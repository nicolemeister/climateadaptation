Wildfires consuming entire communities, floods displacing millions of people, and heat waves claiming hundreds of thousands of lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such extreme weather events are no longer anomalies; they are the new normal, threatening lives and livelihoods in the world's most climate-vulnerable regions - especially in the Global South.</p><p>With traditional responses proving inadequate to this escalating threat, innovative finance must take center stage. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, as many as 3.6 billion people currently live in regions that are highly vulnerable to climate change. Between 2010 and 2020, deaths caused by floods, droughts, and storms in those areas were 15 times more frequent than in low-vulnerability regions, underscoring the severe and unequal toll of the climate crisis.</p><p>Conventional wisdom holds that for resource-dependent economies, climate action is a matter of economic survival, while for developing economies, it offers a pathway to sustainable growth and development. But many economies fall into both categories - developing and resource-dependent - compounding the challenge of designing and implementing effective climate strategies.</p><p>While a comprehensive strategy for building climate resilience is essential to strengthening developing economies' ability to withstand shocks, resilience and adaptation must go hand in hand. For vulnerable countries, this may involve reinforcing infrastructure to protect against flooding, investing in drought-resistant crops, and diversifying income sources to reduce dependence on climate-sensitive sectors.</p><p>But conventional modes of resilience financing remain constrained, both in terms of sources and delivery mechanisms. As a result, vital social safeguards and support systems are often underfunded or insufficient. The problem is made worse by growing uncertainty over the availability of concessional financing from developed countries.</p><p>Given this reality, financial innovation must become a central pillar of climate resilience. To that end, financial institutions, governments, and other stakeholders must work together to develop new financing mechanisms aimed at protecting climate-vulnerable regions.</p><p>Encouragingly, several innovative financing funds and mechanisms have emerged to support resilience and adaptation efforts.</p><p>These include the Green Climate Fund, which provides financial assistance to developing countries; the Climate Bonds Initiative, which promotes the growth of the climate bond market; climate insurance, which helps manage and reduce climate-related risks; community-based adaptation, which enables local communities to design and implement their own adaptation strategies; and nature-based solutions, which focus on restoring and protecting natural ecosystems. Even so, such financing falls far short of demand.</p><p>Multilateral development banks play a pivotal role in delivering the financing necessary for vulnerable countries to reduce emissions and invest in adaptation projects. According to the most recent Joint Report on Multilateral Development Banks' Climate Finance, MDBs provided a record $125 billion in public climate finance in 2023. Notably, 60% of that total - $74.7 billion - was directed to low- and middle-income countries, highlighting MDBs' commitment to supporting those most exposed to climate risks.</p><p>The IsDB is a notable example. In November 2024, the IsDB approved $1.15 billion in financing to bolster food and water security in Kazakhstan by sustainably irrigating 350,000 hectares of land. The project aims to boost average crop yields by 30%, thereby strengthening community resilience to climate-related disasters and improving the economic well-being of 1.3 million vulnerable people.</p><p>Like other MDBs, the IsDB is grappling with the challenge of strengthening climate resilience across its 57 member countries, more than half of which are more vulnerable to climate change than the global average.</p><p>Addressing such vulnerabilities requires an estimated $75-90 billion annually through 2030 for sustainable agriculture, water, and infrastructure projects. Adaptation-related financial flows to these countries average $23.9 billion per year, leaving a 68% funding gap that the IsDB is actively working to close.</p><p>The growing supply of adaptation financing illustrates MDBs' indispensable contribution to global climate efforts. But success should not be measured only by the amount of money disbursed; instead, it must be judged by tangible, real-world outcomes. While climate finance is growing, its effectiveness hinges on rigorous monitoring and impact assessment.</p><p>Establishing robust reporting frameworks is therefore critical to building stakeholders' confidence and channeling more financing toward adaptation projects. To enhance their impact, MDBs should also adopt targeted results-based and policy-based financing models. Beyond bolstering borrowers' institutional capacity and expanding targeted financing, MDBs also have an opportunity to boost resource mobilization by attracting capital from non-conventional sources.</p><p>The IsDB's sustainability framework is a prime example. Under this scheme, the IsDB has mobilized more than $6 billion by issuing Islamic bonds (Sukuk), attracting both Muslim and non-Muslim investors.</p><p>Rooted in asset-backing and risk-sharing, Islamic finance is inherently aligned with sustainability principles. In recent years, instruments like cooperative insurance (takaful), charitable endowments (waqf), and faith-based crowdfunding platforms have emerged as alternative sources of climate financing across the Muslim world.</p><p>Recognizing the need for targeted climate-funding solutions, the IsDB has actively promoted and supported these mechanisms. By tapping into the $4.5 trillion Islamic finance industry and adopting its asset-backed, risk-sharing model, other MDBs could expand and diversify their funding sources, enabling them to support adaptation and mitigation initiatives in the world's most vulnerable regions.</p><p>But the time for pilot projects and piecemeal interventions is over. To build a sustainable, climate-resilient future, MDBs must urgently scale high-impact solutions, embrace financial innovation, and foster global cooperation. Drawing on more than a half-century of experience, the IsDB is ready to do its part.</p><p>(Muhammad Al Jasser is Chairman of the Islamic Development Bank Group.

The beautiful landscape of CHT in Bangladesh is a biodiversity hotspot, providing essential ecosystem services for economic development, environmental protection, and human wellbeing, and is home to diverse tribal communities, said Kathmandu-based international organisation ICIMOD. However, it said, the region was identified as one of the most 'climate stressed' areas of the country, in Bangladesh's recent National Adaptation Plan (NAP). CHT also remains among the most underserved areas of the country and lacks livelihood options. Water sources such as springs are drying up, flash floods and landslides are increasing, and livelihoods are becoming increasingly unstable, especially for women and youth. \"ICIMOD's mission is to provide science-based, locally led solutions to mountain communities, which is exemplified by the GRACE initiative. In collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh, we are dedicated to developing climate resilience that empowers the community and safeguards ecosystems in CHT, Bangladesh,\" said Director General of ICIMOD Dr Pema Gyamtsho. The GRACE project will provide extensive nature-based solutions and community-driven climate adaptation strategies throughout Rangamati, Khagrachari, and Bandarban districts. The project will help to establish climate-resilient infrastructure, improve retention ponds, restore springs and groundwater recharge systems in the water-scarce upazilas (sub-district units). The initiative will promote sustainable land utilisation by applying climate-resilient agriculture methods suited to the region's unique topography. GRACE will also improve the capacity of local governments, women and youth to actively participate in climate-resilient development, disaster risk mitigation, and adaptation planning. To ensure that climate finance is distributed effectively and fairly at the local level, the interventions will be implemented through the 'Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility' (LoCAL) mechanism, providing performance-based climate resilience grants. The GRACE project will directly supported 25 upazilas during its first phase, later expanding to cover the remaining 10 upazilas of the CHT. This project will make use of performance-based climate resilience subsidies managed through government frameworks inspired by the LoCAL concept. This approach will ensure a fair distribution of resources, promote transparency, and support continuous oversight from institutions. The GRACE project is spearheaded by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Bangladesh, as the official Designated Authority (DA) for the Adaptation Fund. The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) is the regional implementing entity.

It has moved rapidly to carve a role for itself by formally recognising long-ignored lin\u00ackages between macroeconomic stability and climate resilience. Pakistan is now seeking over a billion dollars from its Resilience and Sustainability Facility (RSF). This offers Pakistan an opportunity to redefine its climate landscape and engage the IMF on five big strategic barriers to climate action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In accessing the RSF, this is the time to start weaving benchmarks for climate resilience and sustainability in macroeconomic indicators. RSF is the IMF's newest initiative that became operational in 2022 to provide longer-term concessional financing to build climate resilience. It has already committed $8 billion to almost a dozen countries, starting with Barbados. The last and largest is $1.4bn to Bangladesh earlier this year.</p><p>The support to these countries, mostly least developed or island nations drowning in debt, seeks policy and institutional, financial, regulatory, infrastructural, and social and economic reforms. These broad categories have enabled the IMF to support wide-ranging adaptation and mitigation-related interventions aimed at improving climate governance, policy environment, climate resilience frameworks, or strengthening financial systems. It is too early to see how far this playbook has spurred transformational change, but for Pakistan, several development partners have routinely extended support in these areas. What will then be the strategic arenas on which Pakistan and IMF can together build the architecture for the RSF?</p><p>It is important for Pakistan that the conditionalities associated with RSF disbursements are country-driven and anchored in country-specific circumstances. The IMF's role should therefore extend beyond developing frameworks to help surmount the following five stumbling blocks.</p><p>First, the cost of climate change to the economy is too high and Pakistan must find ways and means of reducing both direct and indirect costs. The Country Climate and Development Report, a diagnostic study by the World Bank in 2022, projected that climate disasters, environmental degradation and air pollution would mean a seven to nine per cent fall in GDP, shrinking overall by 20pc by 2050. For several reasons, Pakistan's real per capita income has already begun to slip. How can it be turned around?</p><p>Second, the cost of inaction is high and increasing. Underlining the urgency to develop an enabling environment to reduce action gaps across sectors and geographies, a new study by FCDO has estimated $250bn as the cost of inaction by 2030 and $1.2 trillion by 2050. Given our political economy context, how can the reform agenda for resilient and low-carbon development be incentivised?</p><p>Third, while improving direct access to international climate finance has remained an ambition, Pakistan's challenge is also to optimise domestic resources, particularly domestic private sector investments. Its share in Pakistan is woefully small, compared to its peers. In 2019, for example, private sector investments in climate actions barely totalled $1.4bn \u2014 just 0.5pc of GDP, accor\u00acding to another FCDO study. Can we reimagine the relationship with the private sector without furthering elite capture and marginalisation?</p><p>Fourth, while taxpayers are taxed mercilessly, the regime for domestic climate taxes and levies is weak. There is space available to expand climate-related tax provisions by introducing carbon taxes, climate-proofing subsidies, integrating climate-smart manufacturing, and adopting innovative financing mechanisms such as public-private partnerships and an emissions trading system, as pointed out by the finance minister in Baku at the climate summit last month while launching the National Climate Finance Strategy (NCFS). How can Pakistan start mobilising domestic revenue and investments for domestically driven climate action?</p><p>Fifth, resilience and sustainability are at the heart of the discourse on empowering local government institutions. After the 18th Amendment of 2010, development and climate issues became essentially provincial and beg for improved clarity and coordination on their respective roles and responsibilities.</p><p>For the RSF, the provinces and long-awaited local governments are the primary stakeholders. Can the RSF grasp the centrifugal trends and become more responsive to climate adaptation and mitigation needs of communities?</p><p>From the list of countries supported under the RSF, Pakistan is perhaps the only federal entity where the provinces have their own policies, priorities and pace of climate action. There is evidence that federal level reforms do not always seep down easily. It is also a fallacy to assume that the 18th Amendment has shifted all functions to the provinces, because in several instances the centre continues to hold on to non-federal functions, for example the roles and responsibilities for resilience and sustainability.</p><p>The RSF can help catalyse private sector inves\u00actment encouraging investment flows, build upon institutional partnerships with MDBs and other financial institutions. The proposed Pakistan climate resilience and sustainability fund will req\u00acu\u00acire wider consultation to determine purpose, size, equity partnerships, and governance structures. The IMF's contribution can serve as investment equity. The RSF can help catalyse additional external financing, now that Pakistan has drafted its NCFS that puts a premium on co-financing. For Pakistan, it is important to build upon the signalling effect to enhance investor confidence, address big barriers, and show that we are committed to implementing climate reforms.</p><p>We have learnt in Pakistan that reforms are not just a list of unprioritised tick boxes. They are a strategically prioritised, sequenced, and synchronised set of timebound actions for a just transition.</p><p>Since Pakistan's policies are not always aligned with reform agenda or national climate commitments, it is imperative that the prior actions under the RSF are embedded in the forthcoming Nationally Determined Contri\u00acbutions. This will foster ownership of the reform process within provinces and help gain support and speed for transformational change.</p><p>In the 23 programmes that Pakistan has secured from IMF since 1950, it is perhaps for the first time that the finance minister has publicly owned the reform agenda by repeating that the reforms are owned and driven by Pakistan. The immediate challenge is engaging with stakeholders, particularly the provinces, civil society, and the private sector to build national consensus around this narrative.</p><p>The writer is an Islamabad-based climate change and sustainable development expert.</p><p>___ (c)2024 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.asianewsnet.net/home\">www.asianewsnet.net/home</url>/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p>", "publisher": "The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network", "instances": ["Dec. 20\u2014ISLAMABAD(Dawn/ANN) \u2014 THE IMF is a relatively new player in the climate space.

From cyclones to monsoon floods, the country faces ongoing challenges threatening its people's lives and livelihoods, infrastructure, and future sustainability. Forecast-Based Financing (FbF) has emerged as a transformative approach to responding to these disaster adversities and climate resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FbF was first piloted in Bangladesh by the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society (BDRCS) in collaboration with the German Red Cross and supported by international agencies such as the World Food Programme (WFP). This approach links early warning systems to pre-arranged funding for flood preparedness, as a pilot in Kerrigan district allowing proactive measures to mitigate disaster impacts. Later, Care International Bangladesh also initiated the FbF programme in the Bogura and Jamalpur districts.</p><p>Traditionally, humanitarian aid is delivered after disasters, leaving vulnerable populations struggling to recover from loss of life, livelihoods, and property. This reactive model is financially burdensome and often arrives too late to mitigate damage effectively. Forecast-based Financing (FbF) transforms this approach by integrating early localised warning systems with pre-arranged funding, enabling proactive, lifesaving interventions before a specific climate-induced disaster occurs. This methodology has proven transformative in case of Bangladesh, with people of selected climate change induced distress districts, showing notable progress to withstand climate-induced floods and cyclone impacts significantly better than before and better financial access and capacity, demonstrating its efficacy and potential to address the escalating challenges posed by climate change.</p><p>LIVES SAVED, COSTS REDUCED: During the monsoon season of 2020, FbF initiatives facilitated cash transfers to over 10,000 households in climate-induced flood-prone areas along the Brahmaputra river. Families used these funds for early evacuation, securing essential supplies, and safeguarding their homes and livestock. These actions averted catastrophic losses and significantly reduced recovery costs by addressing risks before flooding.</p><p>UN Research indicates that every dollar invested in anticipatory action can save between $3 and $5 in post-disaster response and recovery. This cost-effectiveness is crucial for Bangladesh, where climate change-induced disaster recovery often depletes resources that could be allocated to long-term development. Furthermore, proactive measures help protect livelihoods, preventing families from falling further into poverty due to climate-related shocks.</p><p>BUILDING RESILIENT COMMUNITIES: In addition to its financial advantages, Forecast-based Financing has made a substantial social impact. Anticipatory measures, such as early evacuation, distribution of hygiene kits, and reinforcement of embankments have saved countless lives during cyclones and floods. For instance, during Cyclone Amphan in 2020, FbF facilitated the evacuation of over two million individuals and prepositioned emergency supplies in high-risk areas, resulting in a significant reduction in casualties compared to similar events in previous decades. FbF initiatives prioritise vulnerable populations, including women, children, and marginalised groups. This emphasis on equity ensures that resources are directed to those in need, fostering trust and cooperation within communities. Furthermore, training programmes integrated with FbF protocols have empowered local populations, enhancing their capacity to prepare for and respond to future disasters.</p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND CLIMATE ADAPTATION: Forecast-based Financing (FbF) supports environmental conservation and climate adaptation efforts. In the coastal regions of Bangladesh, proactive disaster preparedness measures include planting mangroves, which act as natural barriers against storm surges and help reduce soil erosion. Community-driven water conservation systems and soil preservation techniques mitigate the impacts of droughts and salinity intrusion, contributing to disaster readiness and sustainable resource management. By aligning scientific forecasting with practical interventions, FbF bridges the gap between early warning systems and climate action. This integration enhances the reliability of forecasts and ensures that actions taken are data-driven and impactful.</p><p>CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME: Despite its successes, Forecast-based Financing in Bangladesh faces several challenges that must be addressed to maximize its potential. One key issue is the accuracy of forecasts. While advances in technology have improved prediction models, uncertainties remain, leading to occasional false triggers or missed events. Investing in more sophisticated forecasting systems and data-sharing platforms is essential to enhance reliability.</p><p>Funding sustainability is another critical concern. FbF initiatives rely on pre-arranged financial mechanisms, but long-term commitments from development partners and governments are necessary to ensure consistent support. Expanding these mechanisms to cover a broader range of climate risks, such as salinity intrusion and heat waves, would also increase the programme's effectiveness.</p><p>Additionally, geographical coverage remains limited. While FbF has made significant strides in flood-prone areas, regions affected by other climate-related hazards, such as droughts and cyclones, require greater attention. Strengthening community participation in designing and implementing FbF programmes can further improve their relevance and efficacy.</p><p>A MODEL FOR GLOBAL CLIMATE ACTION: The success of FbF in Bangladesh offers valuable lessons for the global community. By demonstrating how anticipatory action can save lives, reduce costs, and enhance resilience, it establishes a precedent for integrating proactive disaster management into both national and global climate policies. This approach aligns seamlessly with the objectives of the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), particularly those related to climate action and poverty eradication. In African nations such as Malawi and Kenya, FbF is already being implemented for drought and flood management, drawing inspiration from Bangladesh's experience. Similarly, the Philippines has adapted the model for typhoon preparedness by pre-positioning supplies and reinforcing shelters based on forecast triggers. These examples underscore FbF's scalability and adaptability across diverse contexts and hazards.</p><p>Forecast-Based Financing can be viewed as a critical lifeline instrument for millions facing the challenges of climate change. In Bangladesh, FbF has proven effective in saving lives, protecting livelihoods, and enhancing resilience. However, its potential is not fully realised. By addressing challenges such as forecast reliability, funding sustainability, and equitable coverage, we can enhance its impact. As the world faces the effects of climate change, FbF offers a proactive strategy for safeguarding the future. Bangladesh's success serves as both inspiration and a call to action. The time to scale up and invest in anticipatory action is now-because the cost of inaction is too high.</p><p>Dr. Anwar Hossain Chowdhury, Assistant Professor, Bangladesh Institute of Governance and Management (BIGM.

Everglades Mangrove Forest (South Florida) is of the significant examples of perfect NbS to fight climate change as it takes the first hit from storm surge, capturing CO2 from the atmosphere and storing it (mangroves store nearly four times more carbonthan other forests).</p><p>The Everglades mangroves, the largest contiguous mangrove forest in North America, home to nearly 550 square miles of mangrove forests, form a strong natural infrastructure against large waves and storm surges; it also stabilises the shores against erosion.</p><p>SIGNIFICANCE: Nature-based solutions i.e., restoration and protection of nature could not only safeguard biodiversity but also help people adapt to the effects of climate change. NbS in urban areas bring varied benefits and ecosystem services such as flood management, cooling effects and recreational values. The mangroves and seagrasses, are among the most efficient carbon sinks available. These ecosystems can absorb more carbon per hectare than terrestrial forests, resulting in mitigation of carbon. When properly managed, NbS acts as a dual solution of mitigation and adaptation (enhancing climate resilience). River restoration and protection is another NbS that highly benefits residents and communities. Planting grass and trees along the riverbank, river cleaning through the removal of solid wastes helps restoration of rivers. It also helps us not to get infected with malaria or any other waterborne disease. The significance of NbS is manifested in the Youth4Nature's mission of mobilising youth to advocate for political leaders to deliver up to 30 per cent of climate solutions needed by 2030 through NbS.</p><p>Bangladesh has been a pioneer in promoting NbS by coastal afforestation. The mangrove plantation at the Mukdara and Chokatoli Mouja areas carried out under the Sustainable Forests and Livelihoods (SUFAL) project, implemented in selected sites in 147 upazilas of 28 districts during 2018 to 2023 resulted in collaborative forest management, a protection for coastal people against storms and floods; it also created alternative livelihoods for forest-dependent communities in targeted sites.</p><p>ENGINEERED SOLUTION VS NBS: In many parts of the world, the dominant approach to dealing with the hazards of climate change has been static engineered interventions such as sea walls, wells, and irrigation infrastructure. These can be very expensive, but very effective, at least in the short term. NbS in many situations, can provide a more affordable long-term solution.</p><p>RELEVANCE OF NBS FOR BANGLADESH: National Adaptation Plan of Bangladesh (2022) outlined the main climate induced challenges of the country, and its urban areas. These challenges are flash floods and waterlogging, drought, riverbank erosion, urban flood, sea level rise and storm surges, salinity intrusion, extreme heat, heatwave, landslides, sea surface temperature increase and ocean acidification.</p><p>The following case of Kudalichora Canal, Moulvibazar presents an example of NbS that addresses urban challenges of climate change.</p><p>The Kudalichora canal is an example of how restoring natural waterways can significantly enhance climate resilience and urban living. Flowing through the centre of Moulvibazar Municipality, the canal, serves as the area's primary drainage system. Due to flooding, waterlogging, and severe pollution, it was once known as the \"curse of Moulvibazar\". The Canal underwent a transformation through a restoration project led by the municipality and funded by LGRD. This initiative not only improved its drainage capacity but also turned it into a functional and eye-catching urban waterway. The project has also addressed the urban challenges such as indiscriminate waste-dumping and odour pollution, waterlogging in the city and illegal encroachment on both sides of the canal. Boosting urban ecology through the canal and canalside plantation, and better navigability in canal are the other major co-benefits reaped with the implementation of the project.</p><p>NBS FOR SALINITY INTRUSION: The southwestern coastal area of Bangladesh is frequently impacted by tropical cyclones and storm surges. Such cyclones and storm surges inundate the area with saline water. When tidal water gets trapped within embankments or polders, it results in long-lasting salinity that severely hampers crop productivity. It also adversely affects infrastructure, water supplies, soil quality, ecology, and biodiversity. Nature-based solutions such as rainwater harvesting offers an effective way to address water scarcity and reduce reliance on saline groundwater, although on a short-term basis.</p><p>URBAN RAINWATER HARVESTING AS AN NBS: The water treatment project in Mongla City serves as a prime example of nature-based solutions addressing salinity in daily water use. The project features two large rainwater harvesting ponds; the objective of these ponds is to reduce the salinity of river water collected from the Mongla river. Moreover, two overhead tanks store the treated water before the same is distributed throughout the city. This sustainable approach ensures a reliable and safe water supply for the community, showcasing an effective adaptation to the region's environment challenges in addition to its role of mitigation of salinity.</p><p>BLUE CARBON AS A NATURAL CARBON SOLUTION: Blue carbon, known as the greenhouse gases (GHZs) captured and sequestered by coastal and marine ecosystems such as seagrasses, mangroves, salt marsh and other tidal wetlands is recognised as a vital NbS. It is therefore necessary to scale up Nature-based Solutions (NbS) aiming to address the impacts and risk of climate change and environmental degradation. In this process, forming local level action plans aiming to cope with adverse impacts of climate change is imperative.</p><p>Regarding NbS, the Environment, Forest and Climate Change questioned the global push for NbSs without sincere commitments to GHG emission reductions. She observed that it has become fashionable to talk about NbS. Substantiating her observation, she rightly mentioned that if commitment for mitigation is not demonstrated and improved, adaptation will always remain a challenge. According to her, NbS is protecting the natural resource bases that will help adaptation better. She accepts NbS \"as a value that you protect your natural resource bases so that the water logging that persists in Noakhali after a given flood can be addressed.\"</p><p>Her observation also concurs with the observation that \"an NBCS approach can draw upon aspects of the Rights of Nature (RoN) paradigm through exploring the competing concerns of the 'use' of nature by humans, as a tool to mitigate climate change, against the intrinsic value of the environment and the needs of non-human species - all of this while retaining control of climate change\" made by Deane and Bell-James (2025).</p><p>The most significant message we can get from the adviser (who is also an environmental and climate change specialist and a front-line activist for environmental justice) is that NbS is learning from our communities. A Nature-based Solution uses the tools that nature already provides. NbS is not something that should be imposed from the top. Rather, it should be the other way round (Frugal Innovation Forum, 2025). NbS can only be sustained if they are designed and implemented by local communities showing respect to the indigenous knowledge, local needs and management, cultural traditions and human rights.</p><p>To conclude, nature-based solutions are a critical tool for any country's climate action, offering both mitigation and adaptation benefits. NbS is not just about conserving nature in its current state, it is also about integrating nature solutions with all of our climate actions.</p><p>Dr Mohammad Abu Yusuf is a climate analyst and Additional Secretary, Finance Division, Ministry of Finance.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:yusuflotus@gmail.com\">yusuflotus@gmail.com</email></p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

The 29th Conference of the Parties (COP) will be a critical opportunity for the international community to address ongoing environmental challenges, including transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner energy alternatives. This transition is essential for Bangladesh, which is on the frontline of climate impacts, facing frequent cyclones, rising sea levels, and extreme weather events that threaten its agricultural economy and densely populated coastal regions. For COP29, Bangladesh has set clear expectations in areas such as climate finance, green technology support, and sustainable development frameworks to reduce its fossil fuel dependency and strengthen its climate resilience.A priority for Bangladesh at COP29 is securing enhanced financial support to shift away from fossil fuels and invest in renewable energy infrastructure. </p><p>As a developing country, Bangladesh's capacity to transition from coal, gas, and other fossil fuels to sustainable alternatives is limited by financial constraints. Bangladesh is likely to advocate for the establishment of a more accessible financial framework at COP29. This framework would provide developing countries with grants and low-interest loans tailored for renewable energy projects, early warning systems, and disaster-resilient infrastructure. Such initiatives are essential for Bangladesh's goals of achieving a cleaner, more sustainable energy mix and reducing the country's carbon footprint.The concept of a \"just transition\" will likely be central to Bangladesh's demands at COP29. A just transition ensures that workers and communities reliant on fossil fuel industries do not suffer economically as the world shifts to cleaner energy sources. Bangladesh, which still relies on coal and natural gas for much of its energy production, will advocate for solutions that consider the social and economic impacts of reducing fossil fuel usage. COP29 is expected to see discussions around policies allowing developing countries like Bangladesh to gradually phase out fossil fuel dependency while investing in education and re-skilling programs. These programs could prepare workers for jobs in renewable energy sectors such as solar, wind, and hydroelectric power, creating new employment opportunities that align with Bangladesh's environmental and economic goals.A major demand from Bangladesh at COP29 will be the scaling up of investment in renewable energy sources. Although Bangladesh has made progress with solar home systems and small-scale renewable projects, it still requires substantial support in infrastructure and technology to implement large-scale projects. Bangladesh will seek commitments from developed nations to fund renewable energy projects and provide necessary technology transfers to scale these solutions. With access to efficient technology and expertise, Bangladesh could diversify its energy sources beyond fossil fuels. The country is expected to push for measures that enhance access to solar panels, wind turbines, and hydroelectric systems. Support for pilot projects that test alternative sources, like offshore wind or tidal energy, will also be on the agenda. COP29 could provide a platform to strengthen the \"Technology Mechanism,\" a system aimed at accelerating the adoption of clean energy technology in developing nations.Bangladesh played a pivotal role in COP27's establishment of the \"Loss and Damage Fund,\" which aims to support countries experiencing severe climate-related losses. At COP29, Bangladesh will seek concrete measures for the operationalization of this fund. Bangladesh's coastal areas and low-lying regions are frequently impacted by sea-level rise and extreme weather events, making it imperative for the country to have access to funds that can help it recover and adapt. Bangladesh expects that COP29 will establish guidelines for rapid fund disbursement and create criteria to ensure that the most vulnerable communities receive necessary aid promptly. Addressing loss and damage will allow Bangladesh to focus more of its domestic resources on transitioning away from fossil fuels and developing climate-resilient infrastructure without the constant burden of disaster recovery. One of the critical global changes that Bangladesh hopes to see at COP29 is a commitment from developed nations to phase out subsidies for fossil fuels. These subsidies keep fossil fuels affordable in many parts of the world, making it difficult for cleaner energy sources to compete. Firstly, countries may agree on a timeline to gradually reduce coal use, with financial support for those needing time to make the transition. Bangladesh stands to benefit from international backing that could help it replace coal power plants with solar or wind alternatives. Secondly, COP29 could see an expansion of carbon pricing strategies like carbon taxes or cap-and-trade systems, which could apply globally. These mechanisms encourage industries to reduce their emissions, promoting greener alternatives and fostering an environment where renewable energy sources become more competitive. Another anticipated solution is the establishment of a dedicated Green Energy Fund, specifically supporting renewable energy adoption in developing countries. This fund could be used to build large-scale solar or wind farms, and in Bangladesh, such projects would help address power shortages and improve rural electrification without expanding fossil fuel usage. Finally, COP29 is likely to push for firmer commitments from major emitters, with a more ambitious roadmap for reducing greenhouse gas emissions. This would send a strong signal to both public and private sectors worldwide that the future lies in renewable energy, potentially unlocking significant investment in Bangladesh's clean energy sector.For Bangladesh, COP29 represents a crucial moment to gain international support for its transition away from fossil fuels. The country's leaders hope that COP29 will not only deliver on climate finance and renewable energy investments but also foster meaningful commitments to a just, equitable energy transition. If global leaders can come together to implement robust solutions, COP29 could set the stage for a more sustainable and resilient future for Bangladesh, with fewer fossil fuels and a stronger focus on building a greener economy.</p><p>(The writer is Dean, Faculty of Science, Professor, Dept. of Environmental Science, Stamford University Bangladesh).</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

In Bangladesh, transformation is underway: from green start-ups to ready-made garments, from food to finance, the conversation around Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) standards is becoming louder in Bangladesh. But to translate this into real impact, we need to move away from soloed pilot projects towards a collective, system-wide change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last month Dhaka hosted its second Sustainability Summit organized by Bangladesh Brand Forum and Sustainable Brand Initiative at the Radisson Blu, an initiative of Bangladesh Innovation Conclave. This time it widened its frame. Along with the multinational corporations, local companies were also brought onto the stage to showcase their action plans on social responsibility, waste reduction, and fair sourcing. This inclusiveness was a key turning point. It showed that ESG is no longer a foreign compliance controlled by regulators or investors. Rather, it is being rebuilt from ground zero-by Bangladeshi youth, farmers, entrepreneurs, and engineers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But beneath the jargon and signboards lies an even more pressing question: How do we transform ESG from an ad hoc epitome into a functioning, equitable reality?</p><p>FROM CSR TO ESG - A NECESSARY MINDSHIFT: Bangladesh has had a long tradition of Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). Many companies have sponsored philanthropic campaigns, funded educational drives, and entered \"green\" initiatives. But ESG demands more extensive change. It demands instilling sustainability into the very fibre of an organisation-at every step from the way it acquires materials and treats employees to the way it disposes of waste and communicates with communities.</p><p>Unlike CSR, which will usually be on the fringe of strategy, ESG is more about accountability and evidence. This requires robust indicators, credible data, and, above all, a mind shift for many small and medium-sized businesses/enterprises (SMEs). This can feel like an overwhelming shift. Technical nomenclatures of ESG reporting, international norms, and data disclosure requirements can be intimidating, rather than inspiring. But here is the paradox: many of these same companies are already performing ESG-aligned activities albeit without the label. Whether it is recycling water in a dyeing house, offering childcare to factory workers, or making investments in metal recycling, these activities correspond to ESG principles. The trick is to recognise, support, and scale up these efforts to make ESG accessible and relevant, not just for the business owners, but for the broader economy.</p><p>THE MISSING ROADMAP: Along with progressive speeches and high intentions, Bangladesh suffers from a persistent policy-practice gap. Take the case of polythene bags. The recent ban on plastic bags in supermarkets has been in effect, yet plastic keeps clogging our drains and over-filling our landfills. The gap exists because enforcement remains weak, without viable alternatives or incentives, and businesses are ensnared in unsustainable supply chains.</p><p>Take the example of Bangladesh's leading electronics conglomerate. Their technologies for metal recycling and e-waste are a form of internal ESG investment and a national priority. But without systems to scale up such technologies -via mutual information sharing, technical transfer, or public-private finance, their impact will be limited. Such technologies must be expanded for the benefit of the system overall, particularly in local markets and municipalities where sustainable technologies are sorely needed but technically and economically out of reach. Besides, there yet remains a question on the willingness of companies to share technological knowledge and information, which may create more jobs in this sustainability sector.</p><p>BRIDGING THE DATA GAP: Among the largest obstacles to integrating ESG in Bangladesh is a lack of transparent, aggregated, and reliable data. How much water are we using across industries? What is the emissions footprint of our garment exports? How many informal workers are being reached through social protection schemes? We often don't know.</p><p>Others print glossy sustainability reports, but since they have not been verified by third parties, their credibility is doubted. Others, including SMEs, do not report at all because they have no knowledge, resources, or incentives. Meanwhile, government agencies publish contradictory or outdated statistics, making monitoring and planning an impossibility in practice.</p><p>This void of information hurts everyone. It hinders good businesses that want to shine a light on their work, enables green washing, and complicates collaboration on shared goals. But perhaps most importantly, it erases many worthwhile stories such as student's clean-up campaigns, informal recyclers, and rural women-led circular businesses-who are critical to the sustainability agenda but do not show up in formal statistics.</p><p>If we are to mainstream ESG, we must democratize the data system. Shared data platforms, open access to environmental and social markers, and common frameworks linking local action to national progress.</p><p>A CALL FOR A NATIONAL ESG PLATFORM: To move beyond individual initiatives, Bangladesh needs a national ESG and sustainability reporting platform. That platform cannot be yet another top-down bureaucratic effort. Instead, it must be a multi-stakeholder, collaborative platform upon which public institutions, private companies, academia, and civil society collaborate to co-develop standards, provide verification of impact, and promote local innovations.</p><p>Such a platform would have three implications. First, it would localize ESG indicators to mirror Bangladesh's development priorities-e.g., climate resilience, gender equality, and SME competitiveness. Second, it would provide capacity-building for business, particularly SMEs, to embrace and report ESG practices meaningfully. Third, it would give voice to underrepresented voices and innovations, pushing the sustainability of conversation from elite boardrooms to grassroots change makers.</p><p>WHY ESG MATTERS TO EVERYONE: For ESG to be embraced across society, people must see why it matters. It is not just a company checklist or an investor request but is reflected on the water we drink, the air we breathe, the food we eat, and the work we do. Until such connections are made, ESG will remain abstract and elitist. Generating awareness and establishing trust is therefore imperative, not necessarily only through campaigns but through education reform, youth empowerment, and community dialogue.</p><p>FROM POTENTIAL TO PRACTICE: Despite all these issues, Bangladesh has a solid foundation to build on. We already have resilient communities, bold entrepreneurs, and growing awareness for sustainability. The Dhaka Sustainability Summit reminded us on time that we already have the seeds of change. But they must be nurtured: with coordination, infrastructure, and trust.</p><p>ESG is a journey, not a destination. It cannot be reduced to checkboxes or PR campaigns. It calls for a culture of integrity, transparency dedication, and learning and collaboration mindset.</p><p>If we are committed to developing a green, just, and prosperous Bangladesh, then ESG is not an option-it is a necessity. It is time to move from silent progress to collective resolve. That means not only investing in technology and reports, but in relationships. Because ultimately, sustainability is a journey we share, and a one that Bangladesh cannot undertake alone.</p><p>Nayma Akther Jahan and Sameera Zaman are Lecturers at the Center for Sustainable Development at the University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh.

Serve cold, preferably with a side of exam-induced anxiety that manifests as vehement vomiting or diarrhoea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what if I told you that, after all this academic seasoning, the finished product barely qualifies as half-baked on the global scale? According to the World Bank, Bangladesh\u2019s Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) is now functionally equivalent to Grade 7 internationally. Yes, after 12 years of schooling, our students are emerging five years behind the global standard. That\u2019s not a learning gap, it\u2019s a canyon and not the grand kind.</p><p>Despite noble intentions and plenty of committees with acronyms longer than novels, our national curriculum still operates on one central principle: education is less about learning and more about surviving a system designed to test memory rather than meaning. The National Curriculum Framework 2021 promised to revolutionise education through \u201ccompetency-based learning,\u201d \u201cintegrated assessments,\u201d and \u201clifelong learning skills.\u201d Lovely. But much like my New Year\u2019s resolution to take up pilates, the intentions are there\u2014just not the follow-through.</p><p>The truth is that the curriculum continues to reward regurgitation over reflection. Want proof? Open any board exam script. You\u2019ll find students rewarded for copying textbook paragraphs verbatim.</p><p>Science, meanwhile, is less about discovering the world and more about memorising definitions like a corporate compliance manual. Religion is taught as moral absolutes with minimal room for interpretation. And civic education\u2014formally lumped into \u201cBangladesh and Global Studies\u201d\u2014remains stuck in the glorious past of the Liberation War, with little engagement on democratic values, constitutional rights or climate justice. The idea that a student might question why freedom of expression is only celebrated in textbooks and not tolerated in classrooms is, frankly, revolutionary\u2014and not in a way the authorities would appreciate.</p><p>And speaking of values: where is the conversation around consent, gender equity or mental health? We have an entire generation going through puberty with the emotional intelligence of a brick because the word \u201csex\u201d still sends policymakers into a shameful panic. There is no comprehensive sex education, no guidance on bodily autonomy, and no meaningful engagement with the reality of gender-based violence. But sure, let\u2019s spend three pages explaining types of sedimentary rocks.</p><p>If we are to believe the curriculum is designed to prepare children for the 21st century, then can someone please explain why financial literacy, digital safety, media misinformation, and climate adaptation are still missing from the syllabus?</p><p>To be fair, the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) has tried to modernise. The new curriculum for classes 1-5, launched in 2023, ditches final exams and introduces continuous assessment. It also encourages thematic learning across disciplines. But implementation has been chaotic. Teachers remain undertrained, class sizes balloon, and textbooks are riddled with errors. According to the 2022 BRAC Education Watch report, only 23 percent of primary school teachers had received in-depth training in competency-based instruction.</p><p>And let\u2019s not forget the elephant in the classroom: inequality. Students in elite urban schools get smart classrooms, extracurriculars, and debate clubs. Meanwhile, rural schools still lack toilets, let alone trained teachers for integrated learning. The English version of the national curriculum is marginally better resourced, but it still suffers from the same outdated pedagogy, just in awkwardly translated English.</p><p>The truth is, we need an education system that doesn\u2019t just manufacture employees or engineers, but nurtures citizens to become curious, compassionate, and capable of questioning the status quo without fearing that a red pen will ruin their future. This means reimagining the entire philosophy of the curriculum. Ditch rote learning entirely. Revamp textbooks to pose questions, not just provide model answers. Reward analysis over memorisation. Infuse classrooms with real-life context.</p><p>Teachers are the backbone of this transformation, and they must be treated as such. This means proper pay, professional development, and pedagogical freedom\u2014not just strict instructions to finish the syllabus like a robot with a whistle. It also means democratising the curriculum design process. Right now, it\u2019s a top-down exercise dominated by bureaucrats, where educators, psychologists, parents, and\u2014dare we suggest\u2014students have minimal input. The 2024 textbook controversy, where glaring errors and politically sanitised omissions made headlines, should be a wake-up call for genuine transparency and public review.</p><p>We also need to audit the relevance of the curriculum. Why are children still learning about out-of-date agricultural production figures instead of sustainable farming practices? Why are their moral lessons framed around obedience, but not empathy or ethics in the digital age? Why is Life Skills Education an occasional workshop rather than a core subject that includes mental health, climate resilience, conflict resolution, and the basics of being a functional adult?</p><p>Until these questions are taken seriously, underneath those perfect GPAs and patriotic essays will remain a grim truth: we are handing out Grade 12 certificates for a Grade 7 education.</p><p>We can either keep producing graduates who top the charts but bottom out on creativity, confidence, and critical consciousness, or we can start treating our children like future leaders.

Serve cold, preferably with a side of exam-induced anxiety that manifests as vehement vomiting or diarrhoea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what if I told you that, after all this academic seasoning, the finished product barely qualifies as half-baked on the global scale? According to the World Bank, Bangladesh's Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) is now functionally equivalent to Grade 7 internationally. Yes, after 12 years of schooling, our students are emerging five years behind the global standard. That's not a learning gap, it's a canyon and not the grand kind.</p><p>Despite noble intentions and plenty of committees with acronyms longer than novels, our national curriculum still operates on one central principle: education is less about learning and more about surviving a system designed to test memory rather than meaning. The National Curriculum Framework 2021 promised to revolutionise education through \"competency-based learning,\" \"integrated assessments,\" and \"lifelong learning skills.\" Lovely. But much like my New Year's resolution to take up pilates, the intentions are there\u2014just not the follow-through.</p><p>The truth is that the curriculum continues to reward regurgitation over reflection. Want proof? Open any board exam script. You'll find students rewarded for copying textbook paragraphs verbatim.</p><p>Science, meanwhile, is less about discovering the world and more about memorising definitions like a corporate compliance manual. Religion is taught as moral absolutes with minimal room for interpretation. And civic education\u2014formally lumped into \"Bangladesh and Global Studies\"\u2014remains stuck in the glorious past of the Liberation War, with little engagement on democratic values, constitutional rights or climate justice. The idea that a student might question why freedom of expression is only celebrated in textbooks and not tolerated in classrooms is, frankly, revolutionary\u2014and not in a way the authorities would appreciate.</p><p>And speaking of values: where is the conversation around consent, gender equity or mental health? We have an entire generation going through puberty with the emotional intelligence of a brick because the word \"sex\" still sends policymakers into a shameful panic. There is no comprehensive sex education, no guidance on bodily autonomy, and no meaningful engagement with the reality of gender-based violence. But sure, let's spend three pages explaining types of sedimentary rocks.</p><p>If we are to believe the curriculum is designed to prepare children for the 21st century, then can someone please explain why financial literacy, digital safety, media misinformation, and climate adaptation are still missing from the syllabus?</p><p>To be fair, the National Curriculum and Textbook Board (NCTB) has tried to modernise. The new curriculum for classes 1-5, launched in 2023, ditches final exams and introduces continuous assessment. It also encourages thematic learning across disciplines. But implementation has been chaotic. Teachers remain undertrained, class sizes balloon, and textbooks are riddled with errors. According to the 2022 BRAC Education Watch report, only 23 percent of primary school teachers had received in-depth training in competency-based instruction.</p><p>And let's not forget the elephant in the classroom: inequality. Students in elite urban schools get smart classrooms, extracurriculars, and debate clubs. Meanwhile, rural schools still lack toilets, let alone trained teachers for integrated learning. The English version of the national curriculum is marginally better resourced, but it still suffers from the same outdated pedagogy, just in awkwardly translated English.</p><p>The truth is, we need an education system that doesn't just manufacture employees or engineers, but nurtures citizens to become curious, compassionate, and capable of questioning the status quo without fearing that a red pen will ruin their future. This means reimagining the entire philosophy of the curriculum. Ditch rote learning entirely. Revamp textbooks to pose questions, not just provide model answers. Reward analysis over memorisation. Infuse classrooms with real-life context.</p><p>Teachers are the backbone of this transformation, and they must be treated as such. This means proper pay, professional development, and pedagogical freedom\u2014not just strict instructions to finish the syllabus like a robot with a whistle. It also means democratising the curriculum design process. Right now, it's a top-down exercise dominated by bureaucrats, where educators, psychologists, parents, and\u2014dare we suggest\u2014students have minimal input. The 2024 textbook controversy, where glaring errors and politically sanitised omissions made headlines, should be a wake-up call for genuine transparency and public review.</p><p>We also need to audit the relevance of the curriculum. Why are children still learning about out-of-date agricultural production figures instead of sustainable farming practices? Why are their moral lessons framed around obedience, but not empathy or ethics in the digital age? Why is Life Skills Education an occasional workshop rather than a core subject that includes mental health, climate resilience, conflict resolution, and the basics of being a functional adult?</p><p>Until these questions are taken seriously, underneath those perfect GPAs and patriotic essays will remain a grim truth: we are handing out Grade 12 certificates for a Grade 7 education.</p><p>We can either keep producing graduates who top the charts but bottom out on creativity, confidence, and critical consciousness, or we can start treating our children like future leaders. But for that, we need a curriculum that doesn't just pass the exam but passes the test of life.</p><p>\u00a9 2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany).

Under the 'Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap for USD 1.3 Trillion,' what kind of discussions might take place at COP30? Financing wasn't discussed in Bonn. So, how are preparations moving forward? At Baku, countries agreed under the NCQG (New Collective Quantified Goal) to mobilize USD 300 billion annually.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">they also agreed to continue discussions on scaling this up to USD 1.3 trillion by 2035.</p><p>this ongoing process is known as the 'Baku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap for USD 1.3 Trillion.' But this money is not expected to come solely from the public sector-it must be mobilized across all sectors.</p><p>therefore, discussions in Bel\u00e9m will be critical for developing a clear strategy on how this financing will be raised, who will contribute, and under what conditions. While SB62 in Bonn didn't include climate finance formally on the agenda, there were some side discussions. However, growing geopolitical and geoeconomic tensions could significantly hinder finance mobilization. We all know the USD 100 billion per year promised by developed countries for 2020-2024 was never fully delivered.</p><p>a new pledge of USD 300 billion per year was made in Baku, but again, there are no guarantees. Still, we hope this roadmap will lead to a formal institutional structure that allows negotiations to move forward more efficiently. Negotiators from developing countries still hope that most climate finance will come from public sources. But developed nations are now shifting focus to innovative finance and the private sector. How do you interpret this? The basic principle of the finance discussion is that polluters must pay. Countries like the US, which have historically polluted the most, must pay now. Countries like China, which are among today's top emitters, also need to step up.</p><p>this is fundamentally about compensating for pollution. We've insisted that, in the interest of climate justice, the majority of climate finance must come from public sources. But now developed nations argue that their public sectors can't shoulder the full burden-the private sector must be engaged as well.</p><p>this raises a critical question: How do we compel corporations, banks, and other private entities -many of which are major emitters -to contribute to climate efforts? There must be pressure and accountability mechanisms to ensure they pay their share.</p><p>there's also increasing discussion about innovative financing tools like carbon taxes and levies. For instance, there are proposals to levy taxes on the maritime and aviation sectors.</p><p>these are promising, but implementation will be difficult.</p><p>there was once a proposal to tax the wealth of the ultra-rich to fund climate action. What's the current status of that idea? That idea hasn't gained much traction. The reality is that the ultra-rich often own or control the industries most responsible for emissions.</p><p>these individuals and their corporations- especially in developed countries-bear historical responsibility for climate damage.</p><p>ideally, fossil fuel-producing countries should be paying compensation. But now governments are trying to shift that responsibility onto corporations instead. Private capital is profit-driven.</p><p>it may invest in mitigation, where returns are possible. But how can we attract private financing for adaptation and loss and damage, which don't generate profits? Despite its limitations, the private sector has become a key player in today's global climate framework.</p><p>underArticle 6 of the Paris Agreement, a carbon market mechanism is being developed, and many private actors are eager to participate. Funds generated through these markets could potentially be directed toward adaptation and loss and damage.</p><p>another idea is to legally require polluting companies to fund climate resilience.</p><p>the International Court of Justice (ICJ) is expected to release an advisory opinion on this, and I believe it will carry weight.</p><p>it could lead to real pressure on fossil fuel companies. We need to move beyond viewing climate finance as a public-sector-only issue.</p><p>the private sector must be involved, and this requires active engagement from civil society, academia, NGOs, youth, and women's groups. You mentioned the need to institutionalize the Baku and Bel\u00e9m roadmaps. What exactly do you mean by that? Our goal is to mobilize USD 1.3 trillion by 2035. But where will this money come from? It must come from the public, private, and all other actors.</p><p>the Paris Agreement already outlines various mechanisms for accessing climate finance. What's missing is a structured system to pull together those funds. By institutionalization, I don't mean creating a new fund-I mean setting up a financing mechanism that can tap into these existing sources more effectively.</p><p>over the years, the UNFCCC has developed several strategies, mechanisms, and funding tools. What kind of preparation do developing countries need to access these funds fairly? It starts at the national level.</p><p>each country- through its government, civil society, NGOs, and media-must first define its priorities for the COP.</p><p>once this national process is complete, the 148 developing countries must come together with a unified negotiating agenda.</p><p>together, we must push for public finance and fair access. Given the changing global landscape, it's clear that climate finance will shrink. Countries must submit strong project proposals to secure their share. How prepared is Bangladesh? You're absolutely right-global climate finance is shrinking. So, we must be prepared to capture what's still available. First, we must build local capacity. Unfortunately, we still lack the technical expertise to develop highquality projects.</p><p>this means we may have to rely on foreign experts. Second, institutional integration is key. Though we have designated national entities (DNEs) for different funds, we now need to identify a central body-or a few key institutions-that can coordinate access to all climate funds. This central body should receive funds and allocate them to pre-selected eligible projects. Strong coordination is crucial. Bangladesh has begun this process, but we must accelerate it. We should also prepare to receive not just financial assistance but also technical support.</p><p>the 6th Board Meeting of the Loss and Damage Fund was recently held in Manila.</p><p>a decision was made to initially disburse USD 250 million. Have distribution guidelines been finalized? What about mobilizing new or pledged funds? The main goal of the 6th Board Meeting was to finalize disbursement modalities.</p><p>a decision was made to provide USD 5-20 million per country as an initial allocation.</p><p>the question now is how that money will be disbursed.</p><p>unlike other funds- where you submit a project, get approval, and then implement-this fund is different.</p><p>the Board agreed that it must be capable of rapid disbursement for natural disasters like floods or cyclones. At the same time, it will also allow for project-based disbursements. So far, there is no agreed-upon access strategy. Discussions are ongoing about innovative access options, including direct budget support.</p><p>the World Bank, which is acting as an interim host, wants disbursements to meet its high standards. But many developing countries struggle to meet those requirements.</p><p>therefore, the Board decided to conduct more research and finalize the access modalities-possibly at its next meeting in October.</p><p>in the meantime, the Fund Secretariat is working on mobilizing pledged funds, while the Board explores how to bring in private sector contributions. Corporations worldwide are spending heavily through Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds. Could any of that money be channeled into the Loss and Damage Fund? Yes, there's potential for that. But both the political leadership at the COP and the Fund's board need to take action. We need public campaigns and political pressure to ensure that polluters pay financial compensation to those suffering the consequences.</p><p>the United States is increasingly impacted by natural disasters.

It is now the greatest justice challenge of our time. Its worst impacts are suffered by those least responsible, especially low-paid workers in the Global South. In Bangladesh, the ready-made garment (RMG) sector is home to over 4 million workers, of whom over half are female. These workers find themselves caught between the double forces of climate change and economic transformation, with rising health risks and job insecurity in the face of a global shift towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In countries like Bangladesh, where the majority of RMG employees work in informal or semi-formal environments, they are especially vulnerable due to the absence of safety nets like healthcare or unemployment insurance. Decarbonisation is necessary to prevent a global disaster. But if it is not planned fairly, it may have negative economic effects. As a recent study by the Ethical Trading Initiative (ETI) showed migration, mental health crises, and child labour have all grown as a result of poorly managed transitions in various contexts. As a high energy consumer, the RMG sector must be part of the solution. However, despite allocating Tk 43,000 crores for environment and climate programs in FY 2025-26, most funds go to infrastructure and adaptation, not worker resilience or green industrial transformation.</p><p>A just transition is not only an economic plan, but also a moral requirement. According to the ILO's Just Transition guidelines, if early and inclusive investments are made, the green transition could provide over 24 million jobs worldwide by 2030. Inaction might have disastrous consequences for the county's RMG sector such as lost money, decreased productivity, and a growing gender poverty gap . The RMG industry is making encouraging strides, as seen by the 229 factories that have obtained worldwide green building certifications. However, social fairness and environmental benefits must coexist. For a just transition Bangladesh needs to implement policies that safeguard workers' rights, earnings, and well-being while guaranteeing a sustainable economic future in order to fulfill its climate obligations.</p><p>Against this backdrop, to ensure a worker-friendly and inclusive transition, Bangladesh must take four feasible actions.</p><p>1. Enhance climate literacy and workers' rights: Government departments, trade unions, and NGOs must collaborate on factory-focused campaign programmes to create advocacy for climate hazards. Information about heat stress, occupational illness, and their rights under the law must be available to workers in understandable language. The programmes must be integrated with the National Adaptation Plan of Bangladesh (NAP, 2023-2050), which already focuses on community-based resilience. As the RMG sector transforms to green production, employees ought to be provided with new skills. Public-private initiatives, such as the Skills for Employment Investment Programme (SEIP), need to be expanded to fields of energy efficiency, circular production, sustainable materials, and waste reduction.</p><p>2. Improve workplace health and safety standards: Extreme heat must be officially classified as an occupational hazard in the labour regulations. Regulation reform must impose a minimum set of protections-ventilation equipment, shaded rest areas, emergency medical care, and cooling shelters. The department of inspection of factories and establishments( DIFE) needs a bigger workforce and more robust digital monitoring equipment, and local clinics must be equipped to treat illnesses and injuries related to climate as also recognised in the ILO Guidelines .</p><p>3.

It articulates well-known culprits: volatile capital flows, creditor-biased legal frameworks in Western jurisdictions, ineffective debt sustainability assessments, and global financial institutions that entrench rather than alleviate structural inequities. Yet, for all its moral gravitas and diagnostic accuracy, the reports most pressing flaw lies not in what it observes, but in what it recommends-a renewed call for international consensus and cooperation in a geopolitical environment utterly hostile to such ideals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crisis is urgent and existential. Since 2013, public debt in African nations has outpaced economic growth. Today, at least 25 African countries spend more on servicing external debt than on essential sectors like health and education. These nations are being suffocated by interest payments that crowd out vital investments in climate resilience, education, healthcare, and job creation for a youth population that, by 2050, will represent 35% of the global total.</p><p>The Jubilee Reports central prescription-another heavily indebted poor countries (HIPC) initiative-demands coordinated action from a fragmented web of creditors: traditional Paris Club members, newer bilateral lenders like China, and private bondholders who now hold over 40% of low-income countries debt. Yet history provides little assurance such coordination will ever materialize. The first HIPC initiative, while providing partial relief, failed to prevent debt reaccumulation because it left intact the global structures that breed fiscal dependence. The Common Framework, another recent initiative designed to streamline debt restructuring, has similarly floundered under the weight of creditor infighting and noncompliance. There is no compelling reason to believe a new round of global reform will fare better.</p><p>Even if the political will existed, the institutional machinery tasked with administering this reform is ill-equipped and inherently biased. The report calls for reallocating Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), ending IMF surcharges, and overhauling multilateral development bank (MDB) lending models. But these aspirations collide with geopolitical realities. The IMF and World Bank, created in the mid-20th century, still reflect the power imbalances of their time. African nations, despite accounting for over a billion people and 54 sovereign states, remain underrepresented in these institutions governance structures. Securing a $650 billion SDR allocation during the COVID-19 pandemic required Herculean diplomatic effort; expecting even larger, more equitable allocations in todays era of resurgent nationalism and great power rivalry is delusional.</p><p>Moreover, the assumption that these institutions-long seen as enforcers of fiscal discipline, not development enablers-can transform into engines of African renewal defies political and institutional logic. Private markets are also unlikely to accommodate bold shifts like lending in local currencies, due to their aversion to perceived currency risk. Without substantial and improbable capital increases, the scale of proposed lending is fanciful at best.</p><p>Theres a darker undercurrent as well: the geopolitical climate is not merely unhelpful-it is actively antagonistic to African-led solutions. Historical prejudice continues to paint African governance as inherently corrupt or inept. Simultaneously, global powers locked in strategic competition resist mechanisms that might shift leverage or resources toward the Global South. New legal and financial architectures-like international bankruptcy courts or global climate funds-face insurmountable political vetoes. In this climate, idealism masquerading as strategy becomes a trap. Africa cannot afford to wait for a global moral awakening that may never come.</p><p>The only pragmatic course forward is a radical pivot toward self-reliance. This is not a call for autarky or disengagement from the world but a demand for African-led, African-owned financial and policy frameworks that prioritize internal resilience over external validation.</p><p>First, Africa must mobilize and retain its own capital. The continent holds trillions in domestic savings, much of which is invested in low-yield assets in advanced economies. A concerted effort to build deep, liquid, and trustworthy domestic capital markets is essential. This includes strengthening legal and regulatory environments to inspire investor confidence, creating incentives for pension and sovereign wealth funds to invest locally, and bolstering credit rating systems that reflect Africas actual-not perceived-risk profile.</p><p>Second, capital controls and regulatory tools must be deployed strategically. The reports tepid endorsement of these measures understates their importance. African economies should not be passive recipients of volatile capital flows that expose them to the monetary policy swings of the Federal Reserve or European Central Bank. By deploying prudential regulations-such as minimum reserve requirements, taxes on short-term inflows, and restrictions on unhedged foreign currency borrowing-countries can create buffers that preserve fiscal space and promote macroeconomic stability.</p><p>Third, regional financial cooperation must be deepened. Institutions like the African Monetary Fund and regional currency swap arrangements must be strengthened to serve as credible alternatives to Western-dominated financial systems. Creating regional payment systems that reduce dollar dependence in intra-African trade is essential. The more African nations can transact in their own currencies, the less exposed they are to currency crises and foreign reserve depletion. This regionalism demands political will, but it offers sustainable autonomy.</p><p>Fourth, infrastructure finance must break its addiction to the dollar. Every loan contracted in foreign currency increases exposure to currency devaluation and economic shocks. African negotiators must prioritize local currency financing-even at marginally higher upfront costs-when dealing with bilateral and multilateral lenders. At the same time, domestic central banks must focus on building credible, transparent, and independent monetary policy regimes to support such a transition.</p><p>Fifth, transparency in public finance must be non-negotiable. Many African debt crises are compounded by opaque borrowing, often tied to public-private partnerships with hidden contingent liabilities. Independent parliamentary oversight, empowered audit institutions, and citizen engagement are key to ensuring that new debt does not replicate the mistakes of the past. Building capacity for sophisticated, climate-aware debt sustainability analyses independent of IMF or World Bank models will strengthen countries negotiating positions and promote fiscal discipline.</p><p>Africa is not without tools; it is without time. Nearly 300 million Africans live in extreme poverty. Prolonged debt traps deepen inequality, destabilize governments, and threaten not only regional but global security. Climate shocks, youth unemployment, and fragile public health systems require immediate investment, not deferment.</p><p>The Jubilee Report deserves recognition for highlighting the injustice of the current system. But it falls short by placing Africas fate in the hands of global institutions and creditor nations that have shown little inclination to change. Africa must not wait for a world order that recognizes its worth. It must act to assert it.</p><p>Financial sovereignty is not a luxury; it is a necessity. And the dignity of African nations lies in crafting solutions from within-anchored in regional cooperation, rooted in self-reliance, and built on the unshakable truth that development cannot be outsourced to those who benefit from its delay.</p><p>Only by rejecting dependency and embracing a new doctrine of fiscal sovereignty can Africa truly escape the vicious cycle of debt and reclaim control over its future.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

'If young people continue to leave farming behind, who will produce our food in the next decade?'</p><p>The economic disparity between farming and other professions is a major driver of this exodus. On average, agricultural workers earn 30 to 40 percent less than those in the service or industrial sectors. Rising input costs-such as seeds, fertilisers, and irrigation-have made farming increasingly unprofitable, especially for smallholders.</p><p>Additionally, farmland is vanishing. Bangladesh has lost nearly 2% of its arable land in the past decade, mainly due to urbanisation, river erosion, and land conversion for infrastructure projects. Many farmer families, especially in flood-prone or coastal areas, are now landless and forced to work as laborers.</p><p>Climate change has added further pressure. Floods, salinity intrusion, and erratic weather have caused billions in crop losses annually. Agricultural experts warn that a 1\u00b0C increase in temperature could reduce rice yield by up to 7%.</p><p>'There's no future in farming unless reforms are made,' said Mofiz Uddin, a 55-year-old farmer from Barisal who recently leased out his land to a brickfield.

Only about half of all farmland is mechanised, compared to 80% in neighboring India.

Beyond this, the mountain range supplies immeasurable water resources essential for human survival and countless other environmental services.</p><p>through the Sagarmatha Sambaad, the Government of Nepal sought global and regional solidarity to safeguard present and future generations from the escalating threats of climate change, emphasizing the urgent need to protect mountain ecosystems and ensure the well-being of humanity.</p><p>the dialogue highlighted the severe consequences of climate-induced externalities, which have disproportionately impacted the lives and livelihoods of mountain communities, leading to significant human and economic losses.

By understanding these dynamics, societies can better evaluate the capacity of individuals and institutions to implement effective mitigation measures while simultaneously addressing broader challenges.</p><p>as the OECD illustrates, political economy concerns the interplay between political and economic processes, the distribution of power and resources among different groups, societies, governance, and the mechanisms that sustain or steer these relationships over time.</p><p>the theory underscores the importance of power relations in determining whether societies can effectively combat climate change or remain trapped in unsustainable practices. Why the Sagarmatha Sambaad? The design and implementation of climate change interventions must recognize the intricate interplay of contextual, institutional, and societal factors that determine their success or failure.</p><p>to maximize effectiveness, a broader analytical lens is required, one that moves beyond technical mitigation and adaptation measures to interrogate both the internal governance structures and external socioeconomic forces shaping climate action.</p><p>this necessitates forging innovative partnerships, re-evaluating policy agendas, and critically examining the root causes of climate vulnerabilities. The Sagarmatha Sambad, as a platform for dialogue, could strengthen its strategic influence by incorporating political economy resources to discern why certain climate outcomes persist while others remain unrealized. Embedding climate resilience at the center of such an analytical dimension would illuminate systemic constraints and opportunities, particularly for mountain regions where ecological fragility intersects with developmental inequities. Such an approach would enable vulnerable communities and policymakers to better navigate structural barriers while capitalizing on transformative pathways, thereby fostering more responsive and equitable climate interventions.</p><p>the ultimate goal must be to align political and economic incentives with the ecological imperatives of mountain ecosystems and the communities dependent upon them. The Sagarmatha as symbolized 'mountain systems' sustains an extraordinary diversity of human societies across South Asia, supporting nations with vastly different demographic and economic profiles from India's 1.4 billion people and $3.5 trillion economy to Bhutan's modest 797,000 inhabitants and $12.9 billion GDP.</p><p>these nations, including Nepal (the primary custodian of Sagarmatha), Bangladesh, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Maldives, Afghanistan including China, rely directly and indirectly on the region's ecological services, from freshwater provision to climate regulation, which have historically served as critical safety nets forgenerations to generations. However, climate change is now disrupting these systems, with retreating glaciers triggering catastrophic downstream floods, shifting snowlines altering upstream hydrology, and rising temperatures expanding vectorborne diseases into high-altitude communities.</p><p>the resulting losses, crop failures, degraded grasslands, collapsing livestock systems, rangelands, and disrupted wildlife habitats are inflicting severe socioeconomic consequences across the mountain systems.</p><p>these impacts stem primarily from anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions, which trap heat in the atmosphere, accelerate glacial melt, and destabilize the delicate ecological balance of the Himalayas.</p><p>the crisis underscores an urgent paradox: the very populations most dependent on these mountain ecosystems are simultaneously witnessing their rapid degradation due to globalized economic activities disproportionately conducted beyond their borders. Addressing this imbalance requires recognizing that the mountains function not merely as a regional geographic feature but as a vital life-support system for nearly two billion people across the continent. Disseminating such realities from ground are aims of the Sagarmaatha Sambaad. Social Cost of Carbon Emission (SCC) The current heatwaves ravaging southern geographies of Nepal and India exemplify the escalating climate crisis, disrupting livelihoods, decimating agricultural outputs and businesses, and straining public health systems while imposing severe adaptation costs on vulnerable populations. India's carbonintensive development trajectory has precipitated atmospheric CO2 concentrations that now threaten to destabilize South Asia's climate systems through compounding feedback loops where rising temperatures beget further ecological degradation.</p><p>this paradox of progress reveals a fundamental tension: the very industrialization that lifted millions from poverty now undermines long-term socioeconomic stability through intensified cyclones, glacial retreat, and climate-driven disease vectors.</p><p>the crucial dilemma remains whether political economies can transition from measuring growth purely through GDP to accounting for the Social Cost of Carbon (SCC) a metric that quantifies how each tonne of emitted CO2 imposes multi-generational economic burdens through climate externalities. India's SCC of $90/tonne, nearly double America's $50 valuation, reflects its acute vulnerability to agricultural shocks and labor productivity losses from extreme heat. China's surprisingly low $26 SCC, despite comparable emissions to the US, suggests its developmental stage affords temporary insulation from climate costs; a dangerous illusion given the non-linear acceleration of climate impacts.</p><p>these disparities reveal how SCC calculations must evolve beyond static modeling to incorporate three critical dimensions: first, the compound interest effect of delayed mitigation on future adaptation costs; second, the geopolitical externalities where one nation's emissions disproportionately harm neighboring economies; and third, the non-market valuation of biodiversity collapse in critical ecosystems like the Himalayas.</p><p>the metric's true power lies in exposing how conventional cost-benefit analyses systematically undervalue the existential risks of carbon lockin, particularly for developing economies where near-term growth imperatives conflict with longterm climate resilience.</p><p>as the IPCC's latest assessments demonstrate, the difference between 1.5\u00b0C and 2\u00b0C warming scenarios could represent trillions in avoided losses across South Asia, making accurate SCC valuation not merely an academic exercise but a survival imperative for climatevulnerable nations.</p><p>as emphasized by H.E. Ms. Sharmeen Soneya Murshid, Advisor to the Bangladeshi Ministry of Social Welfare and Ministry of Women and Children Affairs, during her keynote address at the Sagarmatha Sambad in Kathmandu, this forum offers South Asian nations a unique opportunity to transcend geopolitical tensions and collaborate on climate resilience. For Bangladesh, a country disproportionately affected by catastrophic flooding such solidarity is imperative.</p><p>annual flood-related losses devastate infrastructure, livelihoods, and food security, underscoring the region's shared vulnerability and the necessity for unified climate strategies.</p><p>the Sagarmatha Sambad thus serves not only as a platform for dialogue but as a catalyst for actionable, transboundary solutions to safeguard both mountainous and low-lying regions from an accelerating climate crisis. Devastating Floods of BangladeshBangladesh's annual monsoon floods represent a cascading climate catastrophe that systematically erodesdevelopment gains while exposing the intersection of geographic vulnerability and anthropogenic climate pressures. As a low-lying delta fed by the GangesBrahmaputra-Meghna River systems, the nation experiences compound flooding mechanisms from Himalayan meltwater pulses to cyclonic storm surges that inundate 60% of the country during severe events.</p><p>the 2025 ADPC (Asia Disaster Preparedness Center) report confirms these floods now disrupt critical infrastructure networks (power grids, water treatment plants, transportation corridors) for prolonged periods, creating public health crises through waterborne disease outbreaks and malnutrition when croplands remain submerged. Particularly devastating is the disproportionate impact on marginalized communities, where flimsy slum dwellings offer no protection against floodwaters that carry industrial pollutants and sewage. Jillian's (2025) Boston University study reveals Bangladesh bears among the world's highest Social Cost of Carbon at $185/ton, driven substantially by uncontrolled emissions from its 8,000 brick kilns; the second largest CO2 source after energy generation.</p><p>this climate penalty manifests acutely during floods, when the nation's meager 0.28% global emissions share belies its extreme vulnerability to climate-amplified disasters.</p><p>the Sagarmatha Sambad dialogue highlighted this injustice through Bangladesh's keynote address, emphasizing how transboundary water management and Himalayan glacier retreat now threaten 169 million people downstream. Current adaptation measures remain woefully inadequate against the triple threat of intensifying monsoons (projected to increase 20% by 2050), rising sea levels (8mm/year in the Bay of Bengal), and unsustainable upstream development that alters sediment flows.</p><p>the solution space demands radical shifts in regional climate governance from binding emissions agreements covering the Himalayan watershed to decentralized flood forecasting systems that empower at-risk communities. Without such systemic interventions, Bangladesh's floods will continue functioning as poverty multipliers, erasing $2-3 billion annually from GDP while displacing millions in perpetuity. Livelihood Losses in IndiaIndia's per capita GHG emissions stood at approximately 2.9 tCO2e in 2023, significantly below the global average of 6.7 tCO2e, though its total emissions reached 2,516.967 MtCO2e in 2022 (IEA 2025 estimate).</p><p>the energy sector dominates India's carbon footprint, primarily through fossil fuel combustion for electricity generation, industrial processes, and transportation. While power plants and oil-dependent vehicles remain major contributors, sectoral emission patterns reflect broader economic and energy system structures.</p><p>this accounting excludes process emissions from industries like cement production, which are substantial, as well as land-use change impacts that push India's actual annual emissions closer to 3.06 billion tons CO2 (Figure 1).</p><p>the interconnected hydrological systems of Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and Nepal present a paradigmatic case of transboundary environmental challenges.</p><p>these Indian states, bordering Nepal's Himalayan River systems including the Koshi, Gandaki, and Karnali basins, exhibit acute vulnerability to flooding despite benefiting agriculturally from the fertile Gangetic plains fed by these Nepal's waterways.</p><p>the monsoon-driven hydrology of these rivers combines with geomorphological factors of steep gradients in Nepal giving way to flat, sediment-choked plains in India to create chronic flood risks.</p><p>annual water flows exceeding 178.35 BCM (Table 1) from major river system of Nepal drains to India annually that sustain critical ecosystems and human needs across borders, yet unilateral water infrastructure development like the Koshi Barrage has generated asymmetric costs to Nepal. Nepal endures permanent land submergence, disrupted drainage, and exacerbated flood damage, while India's embankment-centric flood control strategies prove ecologically maladaptive, failing to address root causes like unsustainable sediment loads measuring ~100 million tonnes annually from Himalayan erosion. Moreover, the important aspects of the ground water resources shared between Nepal and India is being dominationduring discourses.</p><p>this vital hydrological link of shared transboundary groundwater aquifers, recharged by both monsoon infiltration and percolation from upper catchment including fragile Chure region should be major issue while dealing with the impact of climate change on shared water resources. So cooperative, science driven policy and management on interconnected upland degradation and lowland groundwater depletion must bring attention while before building water related infrastructures. Climate change amplifies these systemic risks through intensified monsoons, accelerated glacial melt (Himalayan warming rates exceed global averages by 0.2\u00b0C/decade), and increased sediment flux.</p><p>india's structural interventions often worsen outcomes by poorly maintained embankments breach routinely during peak discharges (~80% of Bihar's embankments are over 40 years old), while uncoordinated dam operations trigger catastrophic downstream flooding.</p><p>this reflects a fundamental governance failure: the absence of institutionalized bilateral mechanisms for integrated basin management, despite the existence of frameworks like the 1996 Mahakali Treaty.</p><p>the resulting cycle of ecological degradation and socioeconomic losses costs both nations an estimated $500 million annually in flood damages alone. Climate Change Governance - Opportunities and Challenges The Sagarmatha Sambaad has established itself as a critical multilateral platform for confronting the complex policy challenges posed by climate change, serving as a convening space for institutions, experts, and stakeholders to evaluate climate impacts and coordinate mitigation strategies.</p><p>as climate disruption manifests through increasingly erratic weather patterns, water scarcity, and intensified natural disasters, it threatens to reverse decades of socioeconomic progress particularly in vulnerable mountain regions where agricultural instability, public health crises, and climate migration compound existing fragilities.</p><p>this forum's significance extends beyond its Nepalese origins, addressing systemic challenges that demand international cooperation, especially between Nepal and India given their hydrological interdependence. Nearly half of the Ganges' dry-season flows originate from Nepalese river systems, creating both shared vulnerabilities and opportunities for collaborative water governance. The platform's potential lies in facilitating a paradigm shift from reactive adaptation to proactive transformation of regional environmental management. Current unilateral approaches to transboundary water resources; exemplified by the Koshi River's severe aggradation have proven ecologically and economically unsustainable. By contrast, institutionalized cooperation through mechanisms like the Sambaad could advance three critical objectives: science-based sediment control protocols, climate-resilient infrastructure standards, and equitable benefit-sharing frameworks for hydropower development.</p><p>the World Bank estimates such cooperation could unlock $6.2 billion annually in joint energy potential while mitigating flood risks that currently cost both nations approximately $500 million yearly. Win-Win Cooperation This transition from zero-sum hydropolitics to basin-wide governance requires moving beyond symbolic diplomacy.</p><p>the Sagarmatha Sambaad's value hinges on its ability to operationalize technical working groups on shared water metrics, establish binding protocols for dam operations during monsoons, and create joint financing mechanisms for adaptive infrastructure.</p><p>india's active leadership in this process would serve dual strategic interests of securing its water security while positioning itself as a regional climate steward.</p><p>the alternative of persisting with fragmented management that risks exacerbating climate vulnerabilities as Himalayan glacier retreat accelerates (currently 1.5 times the global average rate) and monsoon variability increases.</p><p>think Globally Act Locally Ultimately, the Sagarmatha Sambaad's test will be whether it can translate multilateral dialogue into actionable frameworks that reconcile climate change issues and sustainability with developmental needs.</p><p>its success would demonstrate how middle-power diplomacy can address asymmetrical transboundary challenges through knowledge co-production and benefitsharing; a model applicable to climate hotspots worldwide.</p><p>the forum's elevation from discussion platform to decision-making body will determine whether it becomes merely another diplomatic venue or the cornerstone of climate-resilient development in the South Asia</p>", "publisher": "Energy and Power", "instances": ["this necessitates forging innovative partnerships, re-evaluating policy agendas, and critically examining the root causes of climate vulnerabilities.

This is more than just an attractive concept or a design feature\u2014it is a green, sustainable, and urgently needed solution to food insecurity, urban heat, and air pollution. Yet, despite growing interest and even official recognition, rooftop farming in Bangladesh remains legally unregulated and unsupported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The issue is not a lack of acknowledgement. The National Agriculture Policy of 2018 explicitly references rooftop farming under \"Specialised Agriculture.\" It encourages urban citizens to utilise their rooftops for cultivation and recommends incentives for research and development in the sector. Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) has even offered a 10 percent tax rebate to residents maintaining rooftop gardens\u2014a direct cash incentive from the local government.</p><p>But recognition does not equate to action. Policies remain fragmented, and the broader institutional and legal frameworks have yet to follow suit.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant obstacle is the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC 2020). This key document\u2014which dictates how all buildings in Bangladesh must be constructed\u2014fails to mention rooftop farming or green infrastructure even once. There are no guidelines for integrating urban agriculture into building design, no zoning permits, and no regulations mandating that new constructions provide rooftop space for greenery.</p><p>Contrast this with cities like Paris, where local building codes require solar panels or green roofs on all new commercial developments. Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) grants Green Plot Ratio bonuses to developers who incorporate rooftop gardens and greenery. Without comparable legal requirements, Bangladesh risks lagging even further behind in sustainable urban development.</p><p>Legal hurdles extend further. Even when rooftop farms are operational, they are not recognised as valid food sources. The Food Safety Act (2013), which governs the quality and safety of food products in Bangladesh, fails to categorise rooftop produce as either distinct or low-risk. This legislation was designed for industrial-scale manufacturers, not for families growing tomatoes, lettuce, and herbs atop a four-storey building in Dhanmondi.</p><p>As a result, rooftop farmers cannot easily sell their produce through formal distribution channels, despite offering pesticide-free, hyper-local alternatives to chemically grown vegetables sold in open markets. Worse still, the Act has not been updated to reflect the urban agricultural developments encouraged by the National Agriculture Policy. There is no convergence between food regulation and agricultural vision.</p><p>Bangladesh has made notable progress in promoting digital agriculture through its National ICT Policy (2018). Initiatives like Krishoker Janala and Balainashok Shohayika deliver real-time information on crop diseases, weather conditions, and best practices directly to rural farmers via digital platforms.</p><p>But urban rooftop farmers are excluded. The ICT Policy makes no mention of them. There is no e-commerce integration for rooftop-grown produce, and no extension services available online. Once again, urban agriculture is left out of the conversation.</p><p>Then there is the Environment Conservation Act (1995) and its latest update, the Environment Conservation Rules (2023). Despite their importance as cornerstones of Bangladesh's environmental governance, these acts say nothing about the benefits of rooftop agriculture, despite the fact that its environmental value is globally acknowledged.</p><p>Green roofs help mitigate urban heat islands, improve air quality, and manage rainwater runoff\u2014all pressing issues for a city like Dhaka. Yet rooftop farming is not officially recognised as an environmentally beneficial practice. It is not exempt from Environmental Clearance Certificates (ECCs), nor is it incentivised. Without being legally identified as a \"green activity,\" there is no justification for promoting or protecting it.</p><p>Meanwhile, other countries are adapting their legal frameworks in response to environmental crises. In New York, the Green Roof Tax Abatement Programme offers financial incentives to property developers for installing green roofs. In Singapore, public-private collaborations under the \"30 by 30\" food security initiative are integrating urban agriculture into everyday life.</p><p>The solution is not just policy\u2014it is legal reform. Bangladesh already has elements of a visionary framework on paper. But vision without implementation is just an idea.</p><p>The BNBC must be amended to include rooftop farming in building plans and land zoning. The Food Safety Act must introduce streamlined, tiered registration and inspection processes for urban farmers. The ICT policies must incorporate digital tools and support platforms tailored to urban farmers, who are typically younger and more technologically adept than their rural counterparts.</p><p>Most crucially, the Environment Conservation Rules must identify rooftop farming as a recognised green initiative\u2014one that enhances climate resilience and deserves institutional support, not neglect.</p><p>Rooftop farming is not merely planting; it is about reimagining the urban landscape. In a city like Dhaka, where open spaces are vanishing and rooftops are among the last available urban frontiers, rooftop farming offers an environmentally friendly, democratised and scalable solution.</p><p>All it needs is for the law to catch up.</p><p>Mir Preom Mosharrof is an LLM candidate at North South University (NSU).</p><p>Views expressed in this article are the author's own.</p><p>\u00a9 2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany).
