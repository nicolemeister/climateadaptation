This refers to warmer sea surface temperatures in the western Indian Ocean. The phenomenon has induced weather extremes such as the 2019 Australian bushfires and African floods.</p><p>Climate change is a common denominator that will worsen warming globally.</p><p>The heatwave sweeping across Europe is largely due to the Azores High \u2014 a slow-moving, semi-permanent high-pressure cell \u2014 usually located off Spain, said Professor Matthias Roth from the Department of Geography at the National University of Singapore.</p><p>Temperatures have surged past 40 deg C in countries such as Britain and Spain due to the high-pressure system, which is extremely strong this year. More of such occurrences can be expected in the future.</p><p>The \"extremely large\" Azores High is becoming more frequent \u2014 from once every 10 years in the pre-industrial period to once every four years in the 21st century, said Prof Wang.</p><p>As greenhouse gases warm the climate, more anti-cyclones such as the Azores High are projected to reach further north across temperate regions in Europe, Asia or North America, said Prof Koh.</p><p>In Singapore, stronger El Ninos caused by climate change can result in higher-than-normal temperatures.</p><p>Said Prof Koh: \"Under climate change scenarios, more models show stronger El Ninos than not.</p><p>\"This spells drier and hotter weather in Singapore during El Nino years in future, sometimes being intense enough to constitute heatwaves.\"</p><p>Click here to read more from The Straits Times: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-does-not-get-high-pressure-system-behind-europes-heatwaves-more-affected-by-el-nino-experts\">https://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/spore-does-not-get-high-pressure-system-behind-europes-heatwaves-more-affected-by-el-nino-experts</url></p><p>___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.asianewsnet.net/home\">www.asianewsnet.net/home</url>/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p>", "publisher": "The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network", "instances": ["Prolonged dry and warm weather can also be triggered by a strong positive Indian Ocean Dipole event, MSS said.
