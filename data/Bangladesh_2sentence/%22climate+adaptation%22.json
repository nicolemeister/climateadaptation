For Bangladesh, a nation where agriculture remains the backbone of the economy, this integration is not just a financial innovation but a transformative force.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The recent approval of a landmark US$2.45 billion financing package by the Islamic Trade Finance Corporation (ITFC) for the fiscal years 2025-26 underscores Bangladesh's commitment to leveraging Islamic finance for agricultural and energy sector development.</p><p>This move marks a significant milestone in the country's journey toward sustainable growth, food security, and climate resilience.Bangladesh's agricultural sector, which employs nearly half of the country's workforce, has long been in need of modernization and investment.</p><p>The ITFC's financing package, which includes US$200 million for fertilizer imports by the Bangladesh Agricultural Development Corporation (BADC), is a game-changer. Fertilizer is a critical input for crop production, and ensuring its availability at affordable prices is essential for boosting agricultural productivity.</p><p>The optional US$300 million extension further highlights the flexibility and scalability of this initiative, allowing Bangladesh to respond dynamically to future agricultural needs.</p><p>This financing package is not just about immediate relief; it's about laying the foundation for long-term agricultural transformation. By addressing one of the most pressing challenges in the sector-fertilizer availability-Bangladesh is taking a proactive step toward enhancing food security and reducing its reliance on imports. This is particularly crucial in a global context where supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions have made food security a top priority for nations worldwide.</p><p>Islamic finance, with its emphasis on ethical and Shariah-compliant principles, is uniquely positioned to drive inclusive growth in Bangladesh. Unlike conventional financing, Islamic finance promotes risk-sharing, asset-backed transactions, and equitable wealth distribution.</p><p>These principles align closely with the needs of smallholder farmers, who form the majority of Bangladesh's agricultural workforce. By providing access to affordable and ethical financing, Islamic finance can empower these farmers, enabling them to invest in better seeds, modern equipment, and sustainable farming practices.</p><p>The ITFC's financing package is a testament to the potential of Islamic finance to address systemic issues in the agricultural sector. By focusing on fertilizer imports, the initiative directly impacts the most vulnerable segment of the agricultural value chain-the farmers. This approach not only enhances productivity but also ensures that the benefits of economic growth are distributed more equitably across society.</p><p>Bangladesh is one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, with rising sea levels, erratic weather patterns, and frequent natural disasters posing significant threats to its agricultural sector. In this context, the integration of Islamic finance into agriculture offers a unique opportunity to build climate resilience. The ITFC's financing package, which also supports energy projects, aligns with Bangladesh's broader goals of sustainable development and climate adaptation.</p><p>Islamic finance's emphasis on ethical and sustainable investments can further strengthen Bangladesh's efforts to combat climate change. By channeling funds into climate-resilient infrastructure, renewable energy, and sustainable farming practices, Islamic finance can help the country transition toward a more sustainable agricultural model. This is particularly important in the face of global challenges such as water scarcity, soil degradation, and biodiversity loss, which threaten the long-term viability of agriculture.</p><p>Bangladesh's successful integration of Islamic finance into agriculture could serve as a model for other developing nations. The country's strategic approach-combining multilateral support, government initiatives, and private sector participation-demonstrates the potential of Islamic finance to drive inclusive and sustainable growth. By aligning its agricultural financing initiatives with international ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) frameworks, Bangladesh is positioning itself as a leader in the global Islamic finance landscape.</p><p>The ITFC's financing package is just the beginning. As Bangladesh continues to explore innovative Islamic financial solutions, it can unlock new opportunities for agricultural development, food security, and climate resilience. The country's experience offers valuable lessons for other nations seeking to harness the power of Islamic finance to address their own development challenges.</p><p>Bangladesh's embrace of Islamic finance in agriculture is a bold and forward-looking move. The ITFC's US$2.45 billion financing package is a testament to the country's commitment to transforming its agricultural sector and ensuring food security for its people. By leveraging the ethical and inclusive principles of Islamic finance, Bangladesh is not only addressing immediate challenges but also laying the groundwork for a more sustainable and resilient future.</p><p>As the global Islamic agricultural financing market continues to grow, Bangladesh's experience offers a compelling case study for other nations.

The cyclone damaged approximately 150,000 households across 19 districts and inflicted significant financial damage, including crop damage worth BDT 10,595 million (USD 90.7 million). ReliefWeb estimated the financial support required for recovery to be around $1.64 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cyclone Remal is one example of the ongoing climate change-induced disasters that threaten Bangladesh. On average, tropical cyclones cost the country about $1 billion annually. Bangladesh loses 1.3 per cent of its GDP annually to climate change, amounting to $4.65 billion in the 2021-22 fiscal year. Without effective action, these losses could exceed two per cent of GDP by 2030 and nine per cent by 2050. To address these challenges, Bangladesh must spend $8.5 billion annually on climate change damages. It requires $230 billion from 2023 to 2050 for its National Adaptation Plans (NAP) to protect vulnerable sectors and ensure sustainable development.</p><p>Bangladesh's efforts to integrate climate resilience into its development framework are commendable. The government has implemented proactive measures, such as the Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP, 2009) and the Climate Change Trust Fund (CCTF, 2010), to mobilise resources for priority areas, including infrastructure, agriculture, water resources, and disaster management. The government spends approximately $1 billion annually on climate change adaptation efforts, representing 6 to 7 per cent of the national budget. However, this figure is significantly lower than the estimated annual fund requirement of $8.5 billion. Additionally, Bangladesh is exploring ways to increase climate financing, with estimates suggesting a need for around $12.5 billion in the medium term to address climate challenges effectively.</p><p>Despite the government's various efforts, the scale of financial requirements far exceeds the available public funds, necessitating alternative sources of finance. Bangladesh can explore three underutilised sources for climate adaptation finance to bridge the financial gap: the private sector voluntary contributions, Zakat funds, and Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds.</p><p>The private sector in Bangladesh, comprising businesses, financial institutions, and investors, holds significant potential to bridge the climate finance gap. According to the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics, private investment contributed approximately 23.1 per cent to the GDP in the fiscal year 2017-18. The private sector, driven by innovative companies, has been a significant force behind the country's rapid economic growth and is expected to continue this trend, aiming for Bangladesh to become a trillion-dollar economy by 2040. The service sector contributed 52.11 per cent to the GDP during the 2016-17 fiscal year. This sector can contribute significantly to the climate adaptation fund as a repayment of the country's contribution to make it successful.</p><p>Zakat, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, gives a fixed proportion of one's wealth to those in need, usually 2.5 per cent of accumulated wealth over a lunar year. In a predominantly Muslim country like Bangladesh, Zakat has significant potential to contribute to poverty alleviation, social welfare, and economic development. Despite this potential, the full capacity of Zakat remains untapped due to a lack of systematic collection and distribution mechanisms. Research by Kabir Hassan (2024) shows that the service sector's Zakat potential in FY 2018-19 was eleven times more than its value in 2000-01, with bank deposits in the current fiscal year being fourteen times higher than in FY 2000-01. Properly managing Zakat could significantly benefit Bangladesh's economy and society. Studies indicate that the potential of Zakat could cover 21 per cent of the country's budget and 35 per cent of the national revenue in the fiscal year 2019-20. Even one percent of Zakat potential fund can significantly contribute to combating climate change-induced hazards.</p><p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) funds also represent an underutilized resource for addressing climate change in Bangladesh. CSR involves the ethical responsibility of companies to contribute positively to society, including environmental stewardship. The banking sector in Bangladesh is actively engaged in CSR activities, with a significant focus on healthcare, education, and environmental issues. Recent guidelines from the Bangladesh Bank require scheduled banks and non-banking financial institutions (NBFIs) to allocate at least 30 per cent of their CSR funds to healthcare and 20 per cent to environmental and climate change-related initiatives. According to the Bangladesh BankCSR Report (July-December 2023), 61 commercial banks spent over BDT 3500 million ($31 million) from their CSR funds, but only 4 per cent was spent on climate change-related incidents, which is far below the target set by the Bangladesh Bank.</p><p>While the potential for private sector, Zakat, and CSR funds involvement in climate finance is substantial, several challenges need to be addressed:</p><p>Regulatory and Policy Barriers: Inconsistent regulatory frameworks and policies can deter private investment. A stable and supportive regulatory environment is crucial for attracting private capital into climate-related projects. The government must ensure that policies are clear, consistent, and conducive to private sector participation.</p><p>Capacity and Awareness: There is often a lack of awareness and technical capacity within the private sector to identify and implement climate-smart investments. Capacity-building programmes facilitated by public and private stakeholders can help bridge this gap and empower businesses to integrate climate resilience into their operations.</p><p>Risk Perception: Climate-related projects are often perceived as high-risk, which can deter investment. Developing risk mitigation instruments, such as blended finance mechanisms and guarantees, can help de-risk these investments and attract private capital. Blended finance, which combines public and private funds, can effectively leverage private-sector investment. Public funds can absorb some of the risks associated with climate projects, making them more appealing to private investors.</p><p>Bangladesh is a frontline country regarding global climate change impacts, with frequent natural disasters threatening its socio-economic stability. Despite challenges, investments in climate action yield high returns, with significant opportunities for the private sector, Zakat, and CSR funds. The Global Commission on Adaptation found that every $1 invested in key adaptation areas could yield $2-10 in net benefits. Additionally, the private sector has significant opportunities, with a potential adaptation market estimated at $2 trillion by 2026, according to the World Economic Forum.</p><p>Md.

The beautiful landscape of CHT in Bangladesh is a biodiversity hotspot, providing essential ecosystem services for economic development, environmental protection, and human wellbeing, and is home to diverse tribal communities, said Kathmandu-based international organisation ICIMOD. However, it said, the region was identified as one of the most 'climate stressed' areas of the country, in Bangladesh's recent National Adaptation Plan (NAP). CHT also remains among the most underserved areas of the country and lacks livelihood options. Water sources such as springs are drying up, flash floods and landslides are increasing, and livelihoods are becoming increasingly unstable, especially for women and youth. \"ICIMOD's mission is to provide science-based, locally led solutions to mountain communities, which is exemplified by the GRACE initiative. In collaboration with the Government of Bangladesh, we are dedicated to developing climate resilience that empowers the community and safeguards ecosystems in CHT, Bangladesh,\" said Director General of ICIMOD Dr Pema Gyamtsho. The GRACE project will provide extensive nature-based solutions and community-driven climate adaptation strategies throughout Rangamati, Khagrachari, and Bandarban districts. The project will help to establish climate-resilient infrastructure, improve retention ponds, restore springs and groundwater recharge systems in the water-scarce upazilas (sub-district units). The initiative will promote sustainable land utilisation by applying climate-resilient agriculture methods suited to the region's unique topography. GRACE will also improve the capacity of local governments, women and youth to actively participate in climate-resilient development, disaster risk mitigation, and adaptation planning. To ensure that climate finance is distributed effectively and fairly at the local level, the interventions will be implemented through the 'Local Climate Adaptive Living Facility' (LoCAL) mechanism, providing performance-based climate resilience grants. The GRACE project will directly supported 25 upazilas during its first phase, later expanding to cover the remaining 10 upazilas of the CHT. This project will make use of performance-based climate resilience subsidies managed through government frameworks inspired by the LoCAL concept. This approach will ensure a fair distribution of resources, promote transparency, and support continuous oversight from institutions. The GRACE project is spearheaded by the Ministry of Environment, Forest and Climate Change (MoEFCC), Bangladesh, as the official Designated Authority (DA) for the Adaptation Fund. The International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD) is the regional implementing entity.

This historic achievement is the result of decades of coordinated efforts, including the expansion of protected areas, strengthened anti-poaching enforcement, habitat restoration, and robust community engagement, particularly across the Tarai Arc Landscape (TAL).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, this success brings new and pressing challenges. Tigers now face habitat saturation and dispersal bottlenecks in addition to emerging threats from climate change, particularly in the Himalayan foothills and mid-hills regions.</p><p>Nepal's climate has been warming at an average rate of about 0.056 degrees Celsius per year since 1971, with faster warming observed in high-altitude regions, reaching up to 0.08 degrees Celsius annually in some mid-hill and trans-Himalayan areas. Over the past five decades, the country's average temperature has risen by approximately 1.6 degrees Celsius to 2.0 degrees Celsius. This warming has caused unpredictable rainfall patterns, increased flooding and droughts, and caused the degradation of wetlands and grasslands critical for supporting tiger prey. As a result, key tiger habitats in areas such as Chitwan, Bardiya and Shuklaphanta are undergoing significant changes, marked by drying wetlands, fragmented forests and the rapid spread of invasive species.</p><p>According to recent camera-trap studies, tigers are now being recorded at elevations previously considered unsuitable, such as around 2500 metres above sea level in the Dadeldhura district and 3165 metres in Ilam district. These records indicate a northward and uphill range expansion. These sightings are consistent with the global trend of wildlife shifting to higher altitudes and latitudes in response to rising temperatures.</p><p>While high-altitude movement may reflect a degree of ecological adaptation, it also indicates climate-induced stress and displacement from primary lowland habitats. A 2024 study from Nepal revealed that tigers inhabiting hilly terrains expend two to three times more energy navigating steep, rugged terrain compared to flatlands. This has significant ecological implications, increased caloric demands and greater dependency on large prey. It also raises the risk of human-wildlife conflict when natural resources are scarce. Additionally, the physical strain and elevated stress associated with such conditions can negatively impact tiger reproduction and survival rates.</p><p>A healthy prey base is fundamental to successful tiger conservation. However, several parks in Tarai are experiencing a decline in large ungulates such as sambar and swamp deer. Although smaller prey like Chital remain abundant, they do not meet the energy needs of adult tigers. Additionally, livestock encroachment in buffer zones intensifies the problem. When natural prey is insufficient, tigers may turn to livestock, increasing the risk of retaliation killings and undermining conservation improvements.</p><p>Between 2019 and 2023, Nepal reported an increase in tiger attacks on humans and livestock in and around Bardiya, Chitwan, and Banke. Key drivers include habitat encroachment and expansion of physical infrastructure, agricultural expansion, unsustainable forest resource extraction and climate-induced habitat fragmentation.</p><p>While the Tarai Arc Landscape aims to connect tiger habitats across Nepal and northern India, several challenges persist. Over 60 percent of identified dispersal corridors experience high levels of human disturbance. Infrastructure such as the East-West Highway and proposed railways obstructs natural tiger movement. Many mid-hill corridors fall within community-managed forests that lack formal protection. Tiger dispersal through these fragmented and climate-sensitive corridors is essential to maintain genetic diversity and avoid inbreeding in isolated populations.</p><p>As tigers move uphill, their habitat may begin to overlap with leopard and snow leopard territories. The consequences, not fully understood, may include increased competition for prey species, displacement of snow leopards from their traditional ranges, along with altered predator-prey dynamics and overall ecosystem balance. This growing overlap urgently requires focused research and monitoring to inform effective trans-Himalayan Conservation strategies.</p><p>Nepal's conservation strategies are robust, supported by laws and policies such as the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act (1973) and the National Trust for Nature Conservation Act (1982), which aim to bolster government-led conservation efforts. However, climate adaptation is not fully integrated into tiger management plans, and mid-hill and highland ecosystems remain underrepresented within the protected area network. Additionally, disconnections between science and policy hinder the swift implementation of urgent ecological recommendations. The current Tiger Conservation Action Plan (2023-2032) offers a range of opportunities to address conflicts, promote coexistence, and enhance multi-landscape connectivity across Nepal and at the transboundary level.</p><p>The role of local communities, especially through buffer zone user committees, eco-clubs, green force clubs, community-based anti-poaching units and community forests, has been instrumental in reducing poaching and restoring habitats. For climate-resilient tiger conservation, we need to strengthen community-led monitoring and climate response and provide sustainable livelihoods tied to conservation. Lastly, ensuring benefit-sharing mechanisms from carbon finance, eco-tourism and payments for environmental services will also cater to tiger conservation. Climate change threatens not just tigers, but the forests and watersheds upon which communities depend. Co-management strategies must address both tiger survival and human well-being.</p><p>Nepal has made significant investments in SMART patrolling, camera trapping, genetic monitoring and other advanced conservation tools. However, to ensure sustainable tiger conservation, it is essential to implement long-term movement ecology studies using cutting-edge technologies. Priorities should include mapping climate vulnerable zones and refugia, using high-resolution data, assessing energetic stress, reproduction rates, and disease vulnerability, and strengthening research collaboration between the National Trust for Nature Conservation, academic institutions and international research partners.</p><p>Nepal must look beyond 2025 to anticipate what tiger survival will require by 2050. Tigers are ecological indicators of forest health, prey abundance and the resilience of entire ecosystems. Their survival under a changing climate tells a broader story of forest ecosystem vulnerability, water security under glacier retreat, and the challenge of human-nature coexistence in the face of rapid development.</p><p>In the future, Nepal's tigers may not be limited to Chitwan, Bardiya or other lowland protected areas. They may increasingly rely on corridors stretching toward the cloud forests of the Mahabharat range and potentially even the Himalayan foothills. If Nepal can plan a path for tiger conservation under the mounting stresses of climate change, it will serve as a global model.</p><p>Chiranjibi Prasad Pokharel is the Director of the National Trust for Nature Conservation (NTNC).</p><p>\u00a9 2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany).

These crises are all exacerbated by deep reductions in official development assistance (ODA), and they all disproportionately affect women and girls, especially in developing countries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Almost half of humanity - 3.4 billion people - now live in countries that direct more revenues toward servicing interest on debt than toward education or health, where a lack of investment directly undermines economic opportunities for women and girls. Moreover, only 5% of ODA goes toward programs with gender equality as the principal objective.</p><p>Women's options for improving their own economic circumstances are limited, not least because of limited access to finance. The total finance gap for women-led micro, small, and medium-size enterprises is an estimated $1.7 trillion. Women running medium-sized enterprises, in particular, struggle to access both venture capital to support growth, and working capital, to support day-to-day operations. Some 740 million women worldwide lack access even to a bank account.</p><p>Compounding the problem is unequal access to the internet, which is essential for financial and digital literacy. It does not help that women continue to dedicate a disproportionate amount of time to unpaid care work, which, if properly compensated, would add at least $10.8 trillion per year to the global economy. Female labor force participation amounts to just under 47% globally, compared to 72% for men.</p><p>These problems are set to worsen. For starters, the algorithms underpinning AI tools - which are being used in a growing range of areas, from assessing creditworthiness to making hiring decisions - may perpetuate existing biases. Furthermore, many developing economies will struggle to create enough jobs for their burgeoning youth populations: while 1.2 billion people are set to reach working age within the next decade, only 420 million jobs are expected to be created. Young women are more likely than young men to be left out. At the current rate of progress, it will take 134 years to close the global gender pay gap.</p><p>There is now a large body of evidence showing that everyone loses when women and girls are not given the tools and opportunities to reach their potential. Economies in Sub-Saharan Africa lose $210 billion annually - more than 10% of the region's total GDP - as a result of girls leaving school early. Low- and middle-income countries stand to lose $500 billion over the next five years if they fail to close the gender gap in internet access and usage. Studies also show that gender-responsive approaches significantly increase the effectiveness of climate-adaptation finance. All told, investing in gender equality could increase global GDP by more than 20%.</p><p>FfD4 represents an important opportunity to build a global financial architecture that expands women's access to finance, increases their labor-force participation, and contributes to shared prosperity. If done right, this process would harness the energy of young people and make the most of emerging technologies.</p><p>There is good reason for hope. The FfD4 outcome document (Compromiso de Sevilla), adopted on Monday on the first day of the conference, includes commitments to gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including through poverty eradication, female entrepreneurship, and equal access to financial services.</p><p>But commitments are just the beginning; to deliver real progress, a robust framework for implementation and accountability will be essential. The \"Sevilla Platform for Action\" - which will mobilize partnerships among government, civil-society organizations, and private-sector actors to advance concrete initiatives - is a promising step in this direction.</p><p>Promising initiatives are already taking shape as part of this platform. One of them - called Investing in Care for Equality and Prosperity: A Global Initiative to Advance Gender-Responsive Financing for Development - aims to expand impact investments in care policies, infrastructure, and services. For example, partnerships with the private sector would focus on delivering supportive workplace policies and decent working conditions for care workers, and partnerships with financial institutions would drive investment in care infrastructure. This initiative is led by a small group of countries and civil-society organizations, and has been endorsed by many more, including our organization, GWL Voices.</p><p>Such initiatives have huge potential to advance gender equality. But closing the gender gap will require leaders to apply a gendered lens to policy debates across the board, not least when it comes to finance. And that can happen only if women have a seat at the table.</p><p>As it stands, women remain woefully underrepresented at the top of international financial institutions and in senior finance-related positions in public institutions. In 2023, only 26 of the International Monetary Fund's 190 members had female finance ministers, and only 23 central banks were led by women (though the total rose to 29 in 2024). Many international financial institutions, finance ministries, and central banks have never had a woman at the helm.</p><p>The development community must address the structural barriers women face head-on, at FfD4 and beyond.

From the pine-clad coastlines of southern Turkiye to the hills of Greece, from the lavender fields of France to the war-scarred valleys of Syria, the region is under siege by unprecedented wildfires. These fires are not isolated accidents of nature, nor are they random events caused by mere misfortune. They are manifestations of a deepening global climate crisis &amp;#8211; a crisis that is hitting the Mediterranean harder and faster than almost anywhere else on Earth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years, the frequency, intensity, and duration of wildfires in the Mediterranean basin have surged alarmingly. Thousands of hectares of land have been scorched. Once-thriving forests &amp;#8211; some centuries old &amp;#8211; have turned to ash within hours. Wildlife has perished in droves. Towns have been engulfed. Tourists have fled, and local residents have lost not only their homes, but often their sense of safety and future.</p><p>Emergency services are struggling to keep up. Firefighters are stretched thin, working day and night in grueling conditions made worse by sweltering heat, high winds, and bone-dry vegetation. In Turkiye alone, the summer wildfire season has grown more destructive each year, with dozens of blazes breaking out simultaneously across multiple provinces. The scenario is similar in Greece, where temperatures have soared above 45&amp;#176;C and fire fronts extend for miles across rural and urban landscapes. France and Italy, too, are not spared, as southern regions grapple with heatwaves and tinderbox conditions that spark fires with terrifying ease.</p><p>This is not simply bad luck &amp;#8211; it is a scientifically recognized trend. According to climate researchers, the Mediterranean is one of the planets most vulnerable regions to the effects of global warming. The region has already surpassed the critical threshold of 1.5&amp;#176;C of warming above pre-industrial levels &amp;#8211; and is heating up around 20% faster than the global average. This escalation in temperature has led to a chain reaction of environmental degradation: longer droughts, reduced rainfall, dried-out soils, and degraded ecosystems. Together, these create a perfect storm for fire ignition, expansion, and devastation.</p><p>The ecological damage is staggering. Ancient forests that have stood for hundreds, sometimes thousands, of years are being incinerated in mere days. These forests are not just trees &amp;#8211; they are rich ecosystems teeming with life, home to endangered species and vital pollinators. Their destruction sends ripples throughout the biosphere, undermining biodiversity, collapsing food chains, and destroying natural carbon sinks that help regulate the planets climate.</p><p>Soil health is also deteriorating rapidly. When vegetation is lost, the soil becomes vulnerable to erosion, and when rains do eventually arrive, the water rushes over the surface, increasing the risk of floods and landslides. What follows is often a secondary disaster &amp;#8211; not of fire, but of water, mud, and destruction.</p><p>The human toll is just as harrowing. Dozens of people have lost their lives. Thousands have been displaced. Entire communities are being uprooted. Mental health issues among survivors are soaring, as are respiratory ailments linked to smoke inhalation and extreme heat exposure. Healthcare systems, already burdened, are forced to respond to escalating climate-related emergencies ranging from heat strokes to asthma attacks.</p><p>Economically, the region is suffering immense losses. The Mediterranean is one of the worlds most visited tourist destinations. Tourism is a cornerstone of GDP for countries like Greece, Italy, Spain, and Turkiye. But travelers are increasingly wary of destinations plagued by uncontrollable fires and smoky skies. Cancellations rise, revenues fall, and small businesses dependent on seasonal tourism struggle to survive.</p><p>Agriculture, another critical sector, is under siege. Farms are burning. Olive trees, vineyards, citrus orchards &amp;#8211; many of them passed down through generations &amp;#8211; are being lost to flames or rendered unproductive due to drought and heat stress. Crop yields are shrinking, food prices are rising, and farmers are watching their livelihoods disappear.</p><p>All this paints a grim picture of a region caught in a loop of destruction. But worse still is the prospect that these events may not remain anomalies. If emissions continue unabated and global temperatures climb, the Mediterranean could face a future where such disasters are the norm. What was once an exceptional crisis could become an annual ordeal. Under such pressure, nations may experience population displacement on a massive scale. Climate refugees could flood urban centers, placing further strain on housing, healthcare, infrastructure, and social cohesion.</p><p>Governments must take decisive action &amp;#8211; not tomorrow, but now. First and foremost, climate adaptation must become central to national strategies. That means building capacity in fire prevention and response. Land management techniques must be modernized to clear flammable underbrush, reforest burned areas using fire-resilient species, and maintain biodiversity. Emergency response services must be strengthened with better funding, modern equipment, and intensive training programs.</p><p>Early warning systems are also crucial. Technology can play a transformative role in mitigating future disasters. Countries should invest in satellite monitoring, remote sensors, and communication systems that provide real-time data and alerts. These tools can help detect fire risk early and ensure communities are prepared before disaster strikes.</p><p>Urban planning must evolve to reflect the new climate reality. Building codes should be revised to reduce fire risk, especially in forest-adjacent settlements. Public awareness campaigns are vital to educating citizens about how to prevent wildfires and how to respond when they occur.</p><p>Yet, the responsibility cannot fall on Mediterranean countries alone. Climate change is global &amp;#8211; and so must be the response. The international community must offer not just words of solidarity but concrete support. Financial aid, technical expertise, and climate technology transfer are all needed urgently.</p><p>Wealthy nations, particularly in the Global North, bear a special responsibility. These countries are the primary historical emitters of greenhouse gases. Their development came at a cost to global environmental stability, and justice demands they now contribute meaningfully to the adaptation and recovery efforts of nations bearing the brunt of their emissions.</p><p>International climate funds must be made accessible &amp;#8211; and fast. Too often, aid is bogged down in bureaucracy, blocked by political considerations, or tied to debt-creating loans. What is needed are grants, not burdens. Simplified processes, direct partnerships, and trust in local capacities can ensure that help arrives when and where it is most needed.</p><p>Universities, scientists, and policymakers across borders must collaborate to create better models for fire prediction and drought response. Green technology, such as solar-powered irrigation systems and resilient crop varieties, can reduce dependence on fossil fuels while helping communities withstand future shocks.</p><p>This is not a question of charity &amp;#8211; it is one of survival, and of shared destiny. Every hectare of forest preserved in the Mediterranean helps mitigate global climate change. Every successful fire prevention effort contributes to global stability. Cooperation, not isolation, is our best defense.</p><p>The wildfires now raging in the Mediterranean are not isolated incidents. They are warnings &amp;#8211; stark and searing. They are natures response to a global imbalance created by human hands. Unless we act urgently, the Mediterraneans current agony could become a template for disasters across the globe &amp;#8211; from California to Australia to the Amazon.</p><p>In the end, this is not merely a Mediterranean crisis. It is a global reckoning. And it demands a global solution.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

The trilateral summit held on 19 June in Kunming, China&amp;#8212;involving representatives from Pakistan, Bangladesh, and China&amp;#8212;has precipitated renewed scrutiny of shifting regional alliances and their ramifications for both regional stability and security, as well as for Indias strategic position. Nevertheless, amid optimistic assessments foregrounding the consolidation of cooperation among these three actors, several pivotal concerns remain under-examined. Notably, these include Chinas ostensibly benign yet strategically motivated economic diplomacy and the persistence of proxy terrorism sustained through the China-Pakistan nexus, both of which warrant critical scholarly attention.</p><p>The Kunming trilateral discussions, convened in conjunction with the 9th China&amp;#8211;South Asia Exposition and the 6th China&amp;#8211;South Asia Cooperation Forum, saw the participation of Chinese Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Sun Weidong, Pakistani Additional Secretary (Asia-Pacific) Imran Ahmed Siddiqui&amp;#8212;with Foreign Secretary Amna Baloch attending virtually&amp;#8212;and Bangladeshi Foreign Secretary Md. Ruhul Alam Siddique. The meeting resulted in a joint commitment to advance cooperation in several critical sectors, including industrial and commercial development, maritime affairs, water resource management and climate adaptation, agricultural innovation, and youth engagement. The Chinese delegations official statement underscored the guiding principles of &amp;#8220;good-neighbourliness, reciprocal trust, equality, openness, inclusivity, and shared progress&amp;#8221; as central to the evolving partnership.</p><p>Both Pakistan and Bangladesh have increasingly embraced Chinas Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), widely interpreted as a strategy by Beijing to establish a strategic perimeter around India. Over the past decade, China has become a leading development partner for Bangladesh, channelling substantial investments into a diverse portfolio of infrastructure projects, encompassing port facilities, power generation, and connectivity enhancements such as highways, bridges, and tunnels. Notable examples include the Padma Bridge Rail Link, the Karnaphuli River Tunnel, the Payra Port Development, and the Dhaka Elevated Expressway. To date, Bangladesh has maintained a cautious stance, avoiding excessive dependence on the Peoples Republic of China and thereby sidestepping the so-called &amp;#8216;debt-trap diplomacy that has ensnared countries like Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, under the new leadership, there are indications of a shift away from the previous prioritisation of India in strategic matters, as historically advocated by Hasina and the Awami League, and towards a more receptive posture regarding Chinese involvement. In March of this year, Muhammad Yunus, Chief Adviser to the Interim Government, signalled openness to Chinese participation in the Teesta River Comprehensive Management and Restoration Project. Additionally, both nations are reportedly negotiating collaboration on the Lalmonirhat Airbase, situated less than 150 kilometres from the Siliguri Corridor. Such developments not only heighten Indias security concerns but also, given the new administrations strategic miscalculations, risk compromising Bangladeshs sovereignty&amp;#8212;a pattern consistent with established Chinese foreign policy tactics.</p><p>Pakistans persistent instrumentalization of proxy militant networks for strategic objectives is well-documented. Prior to Bangladeshi independence in 1971, Pakistan facilitated the sheltering, training, and arming of insurgent factions operating in Indias northeast from East Pakistani (now Bangladeshi) territory. Under Sheikh Hasinas leadership, Bangladesh implemented decisive counter-terrorism measures, dismantling such groups operating within its borders and extraditing numerous militant leaders to India. Presently, China&amp;#8212;as the primary supplier of military equipment to both Pakistan and Bangladesh, while also providing critical economic support to Pakistan&amp;#8212;has emerged as an essential enabler for Pakistans sustained proxy-terror infrastructure. Documented instances exist where Chinese telecommunications equipment, ostensibly designated for Pakistani military use, has been confiscated from terrorists in Jammu and Kashmir. This empirical evidence underscores a concerning China-Pakistan nexus actively contributing to regional destabilisation through asymmetric warfare tactics.</p><p>Indias cautious monitoring of Bangladeshs diplomatic realignment is contextually justified, given their shared 4,000-kilometre border&amp;#8212;the worlds fifth-longest terrestrial boundary&amp;#8212;and critical bilateral economic and security interdependencies. This vigilance intensifies as Bangladesh cultivates warmer relations with Indias strategic adversaries, Pakistan and China, particularly following Indias recent experience of another significant terrorist attack in Kashmir with established Pakistani linkages. Bangladeshs deepening alignment with actors demonstrably associated with economic entrapment strategies or the facilitation of proxy terrorism for geopolitical objectives presents legitimate concerns. Such developments jeopardise not only Indias security calculus but also the broader regional stability and security architecture.</p><p>While the evolving regional dynamics warrant close observation, Bangladesh continues to acknowledge the significance of India for its economic, political, and strategic interests. Notably, when China and Pakistan suggested the formation of a trilateral working group, Bangladesh opted to reject the proposal. Moreover, the countrys foreign affairs adviser clarified, a week after the Kunming meeting, that the gathering did not signify an alliance and was not directed against any third party&amp;#8212;a statement made in response to queries concerning India. This underscores that, despite the cooling of relations with India since Sheikh Hasinas removal, Bangladesh remains acutely aware of its profound reliance on its neighbour. In this context, although the trilateral engagement with China and Pakistan marks a shift in diplomatic posture, Bangladeshs restrained approach indicates that it is not prepared to relinquish its foundational relationship with India. The coming months will prove crucial in determining whether such balancing endures or gives way to a realignment that could potentially alter South Asias strategic landscape.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

Sixty nations are needed to enact the treaty.France's special envoy for the oceans, Olivier Poivre d'Arvor, said the numbers would be ready in time for a formal ratification ceremony in September in New York.The treaty should then take effect in January 2026, he added.The conference sought to rally global action on marine protection as countries prepare to tussle over global rules for deep-sea mining in July and a plastics treaty in August.More than 90 ministers issued a symbolic call in Nice for the hard-fought plastics treaty to contain limits on consumption and production of new plastics, something opposed by oil-producing nations.The summit rallied a defence of science and rules-based oversight of common resources - most notably the unknown depths of the oceans - in a direct rebuke of US President Donald Trump.Trump was not present in Nice and rarely mentioned by name but his spectre loomed large as leaders backed the global multilateralism he has spurned.</p><p/><p>In particular, leaders condemned Trump's push to fast-track seabed mining, vowing to resist his unilateral efforts to exploit the ocean floor.Leaders \"made it unmistakably clear: deep-sea mining is one of the biggest threats facing our ocean, and the world is saying no,\" said Sofia Tsenikli from the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.French President Emmanuel Macron called it \"madness\" while Brazil's Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva warned against a \"predatory\" race for critical minerals.But a global alliance opposed to deep-sea mining, and spearheaded by France, only attracted four new members during the summit, taking the total to 37 nations.Poivre d'Arvor said the alliance would flatly reject any call at a meeting of the International Seabed Authority next month to permit deep-sea exploration.</p><p>The authority, backed by the UN, has 169 member states.Many nations took the opportunity to unveil plans to create vast new marine protected areas and restrict bottom trawling, which was recently captured in grisly detail in a new David Attenborough documentary.Activists had wanted countries to go further, advocating for a total ban on the destructive fishing method that sees heavy nets dragged across the ocean floor.Some 8.7 billion euros ($10 billion) was committed over the next five years by philanthropists and private investors for the sustainable development of ocean economies.But pledges were less forthcoming from wealthy governments, with France announcing two million euros for climate adaptation in Pacific Island nations.The summit will close later Friday with a joint political statement, negotiated over many months between nations, that critics slammed for omitting any reference to fossil fuels - the key driver of ocean warming.Laurence Tubiana, CEO at the European Climate Foundation, said Nice showed global cooperation was still possible \"but let's not confuse signatures with solutions\".\"No communique ever cooled a marine heatwave,\" she said.Former US special climate envoy John Kerry, who was present in Nice, said in a statement that it was impossible to \"protect the ocean without confronting the biggest root cause bringing it to the breaking point: the pollution from unabated fossil fuels pumped into the atmosphere\".</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

In 2024 and 2025, the country's major cities have been lashed by record-breaking downpours, overwhelming fragile drainage systems and displacing thousands. The latest wave of flooding in 2025 has already claimed the lives of at least 242 people, with more fatalities feared as fresh storms loom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These floods, while destructive, highlight a squandered opportunity \u2014 the inability to store excess water. Limited dam storage and poor urban watershed management result in the loss of floodwaters as runoff, rather than their storage for dry spells.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate scientists have repeatedly warned about extreme weather volatility, with floods and droughts alternating as the new normal for South Asia. Without resilient water storage infrastructure and rainwater harvesting, both urban and rural areas in Pakistan will remain trapped in a cycle of water excess followed by water scarcity.</p><p>A strategic and economic threat</p><p>By various measures of water availability, from the Falkenmark index \u2014 an indicator used to measure water scarcity \u2014 to the water poverty index, Pakistan currently stands as the 15th most water-stressed nation in the world.</p><p>Per the International Organisation for Migration (IOM), Pakistan is predicted to slip into absolute water scarcity by 2035 \u2014 a frightening prospect for the world's fifth most populous country. According to the World Wildlife Fund-Pakistan (WWF-P), the country's annual per capita water availability has plummeted from about 5,600 cubic meters in 1947 to just 930 cubic meters in 2023 \u2014 dangerously below the level conventionally defined as water scarcity. According to Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations, Pakistan's water stress is among the highest globally, underscoring that securing the resource is now a matter of national survival.</p><p>Put simply: we are hurtling toward an inevitable crisis of catastrophic proportions.</p><p>Water woes and climate change go hand in hand</p><p>Adding to Pakistan's water crisis is the relentless pressure of climate change. According to the Global Climate Risk Index, although Pakistan contributes only a fraction of global greenhouse gas emissions, it ranks among the top 10 countries most impacted by climate change. The country has faced unprecedented heatwaves in recent years \u2014 extreme temperatures that have caused water reservoirs and dams to lose up to 20 per cent of their capacity through evaporation.</p><p>Meanwhile, global warming has accelerated the melting of glaciers in the Hindu Kush \u2014 Himalayan region, which supplies over 75pc of the Indus River's flow. These trends threaten to destabilise the timing and volume of river waters that Pakistan has relied upon for millennia. Looking ahead, the World Bank Climate Change Knowledge Portal (CCKP) stated that Pakistan's average temperature is projected to rise by 4.9\u00b0C by 2090, foretelling even greater hydrological volatility. Erratic monsoon rains and a vicious cycle of drought followed by flood have already become the new normal.</p><p>The human and economic toll of this volatility is mounting. Rainfall patterns across the country have grown increasingly unpredictable, And when it rains, it often unleashes devastating downpours. The catastrophic floods of 2022 are a case in point: nearly one-third of the country was submerged, causing almost $30 billion in economic losses and 1,765 fatalities.</p><p>Such climate-exacerbated disasters devastate infrastructure, displace millions, and directly undermine water infrastructure by silting up dams and contaminating freshwater supplies. In essence, climate change is amplifying Pakistan's water stress, making dry seasons drier and wet seasons wetter \u2014 a recipe for sustained crisis.</p><p>Indus Waters Treaty under strain</p><p>Water scarcity in Pakistan is not just a domestic issue but a regional geopolitical flashpoint. The Indus Waters Treaty of 1960, a model of water sharing between Pakistan and India, is now facing a severe threat.</p><p>The treaty gave Pakistan exclusive rights to the Indus, Jhelum, and Chenab rivers (the western rivers of the Indus basin), which together provide over 80pc of Pakistan's irrigation water and around one-third of its electricity generation capacity. For decades, this arrangement maintained a fragile peace over water. However, today a combination of factors \u2014 ranging from climbing demand and geopolitical tensions to climate-induced flow variability \u2014 are testing the limits of the treaty.</p><p>A study in 2021 stated that there are signs of declining flows in the western rivers, a trend some attribute to changing weather patterns and upstream diversions. Pakistan has repeatedly raised concerns over India's construction of large upstream hydropower projects like Kishanganga and Ratle, fearing they could eventually diminish downstream flows. These concerns have even been taken to the World Bank indicating how contentious the issue has become.</p><p>Tensions spiked further in early 2025, when India announced to suspend the Indus Waters Treaty following a terrorist attack in Pahalgam in Indian occupied Kashmir. India, without presenting evidence or conducting a thorough investigation, hastily placed blame on Pakistan \u2014 following its repeated pattern of blame and making this a poor pretext to suspend the treaty. This unprecedented declaration sent shockwaves through Pakistan.</p><p>The New York Times reported that if India were to unilaterally withhold or redirect waters, Pakistan's farming heartlands in Punjab and Sindh could face up to a 35pc reduction in water availability in critical growing seasons. Such a scenario is nothing short of a nightmare for a country whose economy and food supply are so deeply tied to these rivers.</p><p>Fortunately, immediate disruption is constrained by geography and infrastructure \u2014 during the summer monsoon, the Indus system carries huge flows that India currently lacks the capacity to fully capture or store. Nevertheless, the risk is very real in drier months: India could manipulate flows, potentially causing drought-like conditions or conversely releasing water without warning to create flash floods downstream.</p><p>Pakistan's vulnerability is compounded by its own limited storage capacity. The country can only store about 30 days' worth of water, far below the 120-day international benchmark for water security. With this limited capacity, Pakistan cannot effectively bank surplus rainwater or glacial melt for lean times. This precarious situation makes Pakistan highly exposed to any upstream disruptions and to any extreme weather event.</p><p>Food security under threat</p><p>With a heavily water-dependent agricultural sector, the implications of dwindling water supplies for food production are both immediate and severe.</p><p>A study reported that approximately three-quarters of the freshwater is consumed by just four crops: wheat, sugarcane, cotton, and rice. The policies favoring these corps over the decades, have made farmers gradually shifting away from traditional, more drought-tolerant crops like millet and barley to these cash crops. This unsustainable cropping pattern is further straining groundwater and river systems. These cash crops are already experiencing the impact. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) stated in a report that in recent years, cotton production plummeted by about 41pc, largely due to flood damage and waterlogging, which in turn dealt a blow to the textile industry and rural employment.</p><p>Wheat yields have increased slightly, but its growth rate (under 2.5pc per year) lags behind the global average, partly because water shortages and erratic weather have hampered productivity. The 2022 floods alone destroyed 2.4 million hectares of cropland, wiping out food stocks and farmers' livelihoods overnight.</p><p>In light of these challenges, the SBP recorded a slowdown in agricultural growth, attributing it to climate stress and water scarcity undermining the output of key crops. With agriculture still employing a large share of Pakistan's workforce and feeding its population, such water-driven shocks propagate a broader economic crisis. The sustained water stress could ignite a vicious cycle: poor harvests, rising food prices, rural unemployment, and ultimately threats to economic and social stability.</p><p>Policy gaps and the way forward</p><p>Given the gravity of the situation, one would expect a swift and robust policy response. Unfortunately, meaningful actions have been hindered by slow policy response and poor execution. The National Water Policy of 2018 and infrastructure projects like the Diamer-Bhasha dam were deemed as long-term solutions to Pakistan's water stress. While these initiatives were steps in the right direction, progress on them has been painfully slow.</p><p>The key challenges in addressing are funding issues, bureaucratic red tape, and inter-provincial mistrust over water sharing. In addition to that, politically tough but crucial measures \u2014 such as installing water meters to curb waste, regulating groundwater extraction, and incentivising crop diversification \u2014 remain largely sidelined.</p><p>Breaking out of this paralysis requires both institutional reform and international diplomacy.

Later, in the mid-20th century, the British meteorologist 'Guy Callendar' was the first to discover the link between carbon dioxide levels and global warming. Now in the 21st century, most climate scientists have found scientific evidence that human behavior is the main cause of climatic changes and global warming, and also a vital role for climate adaptation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the 'US National Center for Environmental Information', the global surface temperature in 2020 was +0.82\u00b0C above the 20th-century average.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The world is facing a critical climate crisis that needs urgent actions for mitigation measures. During the COP21 in Paris 2015, 196 parties adopted a legally binding treaty to limit global warming to ideally 1.5\u00b0C and a maximum of 2\u00b0C, compared to pre-industrial levels.</p><p>A recent report (Dec 2023) issued by the UNFCCC suggests that human inhabitants are unlikely to meet the Paris climate goals.</p><p>Instead, present human actions are likely to cause global warming to increase temperatures up to 2.8\u00b0C at the end of this century, which is a global threat indeed.</p><p>The climate event is one of the most human challenges, which can be managed by 'top-down' structural changes (e.g. regulation and investment), and 'bottom-up' changes (e.g.</p><p>Individuals' and collectives' beliefs and behaviors).</p><p>This 'bottom-up' process requires widespread beliefs in climate change, support for climate policies, and willingness to engage in climate actions.</p><p>The behavioral pattern has been seen as a significant component in promoting 'bottom-up' changes, through the development of large-scale interventions, which can shift public opinion and support for 'top-down' national climate policies and programs. Human behavior is not only the primary driver of climate change but also critical for mitigating the climate impacts, acts as vice versa (vs.). Climate change also impacts human behavior, and humans act in various ways (e.g. hot-tempered, violent/extreme behaviors, emotional and suicidal behaviors, introverts, decreased moral values, negative attitude, and brutal behavior toward nature). Behavior change is a non-replacement component of climate actions, and essential for effective solutions to climate threats.</p><p>The article analysis helps to better understand the role of human behavior in enhancing, or impending these effects.</p><p>The psychology of climate change The complexity of humans is also reflected in their psychology, despite a devastating scientific consensus on extreme climate scenarios, people often underestimate the climate effects. Present-day psychologists are not concerned about climate uncertainty, they only worry about mental health consequences.</p><p>Addressing climate change requires philosophical behavior change, not only in consumer action, but also in action of communities and organizations as a whole, and could influence national policies to adapt to extreme climate events. Human behavioral change Human behavioral change is a central element in addressing the climate crisis. Most of the interventions require global emissions reduction and mitigation measures. Behavioral changes include significant changes in lifestyle and social actions. Mitigation includes: avoiding flying, and driving, and reducing eating red meat, but to save energy, while adaptation includes: behavioral responses to extreme weather events. Behavior is often narrowly conceived as individual-level actions (e.g. buying low-carbon products, recycling, ethical action, and acting as frontline mitigation volunteers. Climate actions are needed to (i) incorporate the adoption of low-carbon and climate-resilient technologies, (ii) support for large-scale low-carbon infrastructures (solar/wind farms), (iii) political action to support, or demand climate measures (voting and protesting), (iv) participation in policy formulation (policy reforms, legal-justice), (v) local-level initiatives (community energy savings, low-carbon transports), and (vi) engaging in interactions with awareness, and low-carbon lifestyles (low foot-print). Human behavior is a factor in climate actions The role of human behavior in climatic change in the light of the empirical evidence that the 'human factor' has a greater impact, and acts as a factor of climate action.</p><p>Also making climate decisions, positive attitudes are the key drivers to making solutions for climate adaptation.</p><p>This highlights human psychology (e.g. social, environmental, community, organizational, political, economic, health, and in-development activities) to develop, test, and apply human behavior change theories for the interventions for climate adaptation. Human behavior in climate adaptation The individual-level behavior change is important to limit global warming, which can facilitate climate adaptation and mitigation of mass compensations. Present-day climate scientists have been proposed for individual behavior change and motivating environmental protection.</p><p>In 2022, the IPCC noted that the behavioral dynamics in climate mitigation, the human factors are focused on adaptation and preventing warming climate to mitigate the negative consequences. Most nations have already started actions against climate change, but the actions are too little and scattered on actual needs, suggesting working together in a coordinated plan and actions.</p><p>The trend of rising temperatures and natural disasters has become more extreme, occurring at closer intervals, driving biodiversity losses, and affecting human physical and mental health. Behavioral intervention and models Different types of behavioral interventions exist: (i) individual decision-making ('downstream') from the national level versus the context in which decisions are made at the local to national level ('upstream'); (ii) measures that provide/improve options ('pull') versus removing them ('push'); (iii) making use of automatic ('nudge') versus more intentionally, or deliberative processes.</p><p>There are numerous behavioral theories and models exist to explain 'mitigation and adaptation' actions- e.g. (i) theory of planned behavior, (ii) value-belief norms, and (iii) trans-theoretical models, are most commonly applied to mitigation behaviors. (a) Climate change and physical health: Climate change has a greater impact on physical health, e.g.</p><p>A rise in vector-borne, water, and food-borne diseases; an increase in acute and chronic respiratory conditions asthma and allergies; malaria, diarrhea, and heat-related like dengue, and extreme weather-related morbidity and mortality diseases. Indirect health implications that are increasingly recognized in global reports on climate change and health include illness related to food and water pollution, under-nutrition related to food insecurity, malignant melanoma from UV exposure, and chronic critical diseases. (b) Climate change and mental health: Climate change has also impacts on mental health which are more frequent, intense, and complex and can trigger post-traumatic stress disorder, major depressive disorder, anxiety, complicated unhappiness, survivor guiltiness, vicarious trauma, recovery weakness, substance abuse, and suicidal ideation.</p><p>The climate impacts natural phenomena, daily life patterns, land use, and habitation patterns, which weaken mentally, increase financial stress and increase violence and aggression. The overarching threats of a changing climate can incite despair and hopelessness to address the `human problem.` Behavior awareness for climate actions Climate change awareness not only affects public perception but also translates into noticeable changes in people's behavior.</p><p>The changes are two routes: (i) positively in the form of behavioral confirmation (e.g.</p><p>Information leads to positive reinforcement), or (ii) adversely in the form of protest behavior.</p><p>Awareness to mobilize a large number of people to strike, and protest for more action on climate change (e.g. misuse of water bodies, made pollution, forest cutting- nowadays people are more concerned and conscious. Behavior also changes sustainable consumption and lifestyle decisions, and indirectly exerting pressure on the political process (voter behavior on political agenda setting).</p><p>The increasing frequency of extreme weather events has caused a significant increase in awareness movement and people become more motivated to climate action to mitigate climate change. Climate Scholars suggest that the development of climate awareness triggered public perceptions concerning more environmental issues. Recent research has stated that 37% of people believe that global warming is the number one environmental concern, while 82% of people asked for the urgency of climate actions to combat the climate crisis (Energy  and  Society 2022). This Germanbased research stated that 18% of people have a positive willingness to pay more money for car or air travel to protect the climate.</p><p>The supportive attitude towards climate protection promotes 'green' actions as behavioral costs, e.g. turning off lights when leaving a room, using piped gas or water in houses, buying organic foods, or throwing waste in the open space, or green parks.</p><p>It is also estimated that about 34% of CO2 emissions are caused directly in households, whereas indirect emissions are fixed in consumer goods for 66%.</p><p>These indirect effects are split almost equally across energy products 19%, goods 24%, and services 23%).</p><p>Thus, household decisions, especially in high-income countries like America, Canada, Europe, and Australia, play a key role in reaching the Paris climate goals by 2050.</p><p>Also, the most significant contribution to the carbon footprint is in high-income countries, e.g. mobility (transport and communication) 30%, food consumption 30%, and housing 20%. Behavior Ethical Concern Several ethical concerns emerge when discussing population and consumption.</p><p>These include reproductive rights, and choices (how many children to have), a fetus's/unborn child's right to life.</p><p>Ethical concerns arise also from inequalities across the globe and regions, associated with different levels of energy consumption. Many low-income countries and regions should have the right to develop economically in ways that rely on emission-intensive industries that have allowed other countries to develop.</p><p>Technological solutions without using fossil fuel may provide a means to maintain affluent lifestyles and raise the well-being of poor people while decreasing GHG emissions.</p><p>Adaptation measures - a way forward: Adaptation measures that address the psychosocial impacts of climate change come in a variety of forms, i.e. policies, practices, behavioral interventions, community-based interventions, awareness, motivation, and training. Some general approaches to address climaterelated mental health or illnesses include primary care interventions, individual or group-based therapy, cognitive-based interventions/therapy, stress inoculation, training, and crisis counseling.</p><p>Also, emotional resiliency can be sustained by engaging in sports, art, literature, get-together programs, educational excursions, cultural events, and spiritual activities.</p><p>Other measures are policy responses (improving access to mental health care); Surveillance (epidemiological measures after extreme weather events), and monitoring measures during heat waves and following extreme weather; preparation and practices (a stepped-care approach to mental health, used in disaster mental health and at the level of distress/traumatized victims); responses (resilience planning in mental health); community-based interventions (resilience plans of psychosocial wellbeing and psychological first-aid for hopelessness, anxiety and eco-paralysis group.</p><p>For example, a common practice in Japan to reduce stress and anxiety is the practice of 'shinrin-yoku', otherwise referred to as forest bathing/forest visiting.</p><p>The forest bathing/visiting resulted in decreased cortisol levels, pulse rates, negative feelings, and significantly increased positive feelings. Sustainable mental health care in developed and developing nations is urgently needed as the realities of climate change become more apparent, especially for those most marginalized. Conclusions: Global commitments like SDGs and the Paris Agreement are needed to help mental health through human coordinated actions. In addition, effective measures for social, environmental, and climate justice are needed. The best way to make human resilience and adaptation to address mental disorders to health equity. Climate change affects mental health in various ways (e.g. direct, indirect, overarching pathways, affecting those most marginalized, and can result in mental problems, illness as well as affirmative psychosocial outcomes.</p><p>It is important to link climate change and mental health to support climate mitigation as psychosocial resilience. Climate mitigation with adaptation is not possible without the change in human behavior, and therefore, strongly recommended to start actions with individual and collective efforts that require large-scale solutions to raise awareness, and drive the changes at the policy level.</p><p>Therefore, climate adaptation could be possible to spread out worldwide, a greater success towards Paris goals by 2050.

The historically unprecedented flood of August, 2024 has reminded us that the effects of climate change are unpredictable and devastating for the lives and livelihoods of millions of Bangladeshis. In addition to the direct effects on the economy, infrastructure, health and food security, the complications caused by climate change include tensions in international relations. Climate change does not recognise international boundaries, as has been made evident from the recent experience of the floods of August. This has revealed the emergence of a new reality- the need for a climate change dimension in regional cooperation. This should be the perspective of Bangladesh in the coming COP 29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Till date, the international focus of climate change mitigation has been on emission reduction, and the Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) commitments of developing countries include a conditional level for emission reduction, which is contingent on investment from developed nations to increase the renewable and clean energy capacities of developing countries, and thus reduce their greenhouse gas emission levels. However, countries like Bangladesh have comparatively very low levels of emissions, while suffering a disproportionate share of the effects of global warming.</p><p>Fossil fuel power plant projects in Bangladesh have long been rife with financial irregularities, and are currently operating below capacity, due to the lack of fossil fuel supply. This lack of fuel keeps these plants idle, and prevents them from serving efficiently as baseload or peaking power plants, even if we consider that some surplus capacity is needed as reserve capacity. This lower level of generation is coupled with high costs arising from capacity payments for idle power plants and overdue payments for fuels, which puts pressure on the reserves of the country, and forces the country to seek international financial support with onerous restrictive covenants. In contrast, renewable energy technologies have achieved grid parity in Bangladesh, and are favoured to play a bigger role in the future energy mix of the country. Renewable energy is not dependent on import of fuels, nor is affected by depleting domestic reserves.</p><p>The adverse effects of climate change include rising sea levels, coastal soil salinity, extreme floods and droughts, unpredictable weather patterns, desertification, increasing wildfires, more intense storms, and changing seasonal patterns. Bangladesh has seen evidence of most of these climate change effects. These affect the ecosystem of the country, and thus increase challenges for the population. There is the loss of lives and property as a result of floods and cyclones. The change in soil quality affects crop yield and livestock health. Food security and potable water availability are affected as a result, especially for people of coastal areas, flood prone areas and drought prone regions of Bangladesh.</p><p>Climate disasters have been known to affect regions straddling neighboring countries, with implications for regional cooperation. Climate change has led to conflict in the Sahel region of Africa over decreasing amounts of arable land and resources, and cross border migration. Climate change is affecting the freshwater resources of the Nile River, and increasing competition among Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan over water resources. Bangladesh is no exception, as it shares cross-border river systems with neighboring countries, where climate change has increased variability in drought and floods. Mitigation and adaptation requires collaboration with the neighbours over water resource sharing and flood management projects.</p><p>It has been estimated that the rural people of Bangladesh have been annually spending US$ 2 billion in repairing damages caused by climate change related events, which is twice the amount provided by the government, and twelve times the amount obtained from international donors. In the wake of the August 2024 floods, the new interim government of Bangladesh has sought international funds of US$ 300 million for flood relief alone. However, the chain of events that lead to climate disasters can be partially controlled or mitigated in some of the steps, especially in case of drought and flood management. This can include improved weather forecasting, early warning systems for storms and floods as well as dry spells, and cross border coordination with respect to the flow of water in transnational rivers and the operations of upstream hydroelectric dams.</p><p>In 2009, wealthy nations committed to contributing US$ 100 billion per year to help poorer countries adapt to climate change impacts, but have fallen short of this goal. However, the cumulative losses to the population and government of Bangladesh warrant the exploration of alternative sources of financing, including financing for infrastructure. It has been estimated that a project to manage the Teesta river basin can cost US$ 1 billion, which is a fraction of the cumulative losses that accrue in the northeast region of Bangladesh over the years due to floods and droughts. This project is similar in expense to urban infrastructure projects like the Dhaka metro rail. However, it can contribute more to saving the livelihoods and properties of tens of millions, and preventing climate disaster induced migration to urban centres, while creating local economic opportunities. Similar projects can be explored for flood prone areas in Sylhet as well as cyclone prone coastal regions of the country.</p><p>Considering the increasing urgency of the effects of climate change, Bangladesh should be well prepared to pursue every opportunity for mitigation and adaptation in the upcoming COP 29 conference in Baku in November 2024. The event can be a forum for the determination of loss and damage funds, as well as an opportunity for the exploration of alternative financing for infrastructure development, technical assistance and diplomatic collaboration.</p><p>Md Shahriar Ahmed Chowdhury is Director, Centre for Energy Research, United International University.

The World Meteorological Organisation reported 2024 as the warmest year ever recorded, with global temperatures reaching 1.55 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. The organisation confirmed that this is the first time we have crossed the 1.5 degrees Celsius threshold in a single calendar year. The last 10 years have showcased an ongoing, alarming trend, and its impact is everywhere.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to a 2017 study by the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology (DHM), Nepal is warming nearly twice as fast as the global average, with average temperatures rising by approximately 0.056 degrees Celsius per year. The heat will escalate if no actions are taken today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Human cost</p><p>But heat is not just an environmental or climate issue; it has a human cost. According to the Global Heat Health Information Network, between the decades of 1990 \u2014 99 and 2014 \u2014 23, heat-related deaths among adults over 65 have more than doubled, underscoring the growing toll of extreme heat on vulnerable populations. Tarai is experiencing longer, deadlier heatwaves, with the 2024 heatwave causing hospital admissions to spike, stressing health systems. This can lead to increasing mortality rates if left unchecked.</p><p>The Epidemiology and Disease Control Division has also reported increased vector-borne diseases, like dengue, and their shift towards hills and mountains.</p><p>Many educational institutions across Tarai have begun shutting down schools due to extreme heat during summer. However, children in public schools are still forced to study under tin sheet classrooms, under the extreme heat. This not only affects learning but also impacts the health and well-being of the children.</p><p>The Ministry of Forest and Environment's vulnerability and risk assessment report reveals that water scarcity is worsening, with spring discharge steadily declining in hills and mountains by 30 percent over the last three decades. Women, often caregivers, bear the brunt of walking long distances to collect water.</p><p>Similarly, according to the International Labour Organisation, 5 percent of working hours are expected to be lost annually due to heat stress in South Asia by 2030. This hampers economic productivity and deepens inequalities, as heat stress disproportionately affects the informal economy, farmers, daily wage workers and street vendors.</p><p>Urbanisation and heat</p><p>Urbanisation, a global megatrend, is crucial in heating our planet. Heavy use of concrete and asphalt, vehicles, lack of heat-reflective surfaces, reduced vegetation, and waste heat from buildings trap heat in our urban spaces. The IPCC's Sixth Assessment Report (2022) highlighted cities' contribution of 70 percent of global CO2 emissions. This megatrend intensifies greenhouse gas emissions, altering land surfaces and exacerbating local climate extremes such as drought and heat waves.</p><p>The Department of Hydrology and Meteorology recorded the highest temperature of 44.2 degrees Celsius in Nepalgunj in May and 35.3 degrees Celsius in Kathmandu in June 2024. A study from 2022 revealed that land surface temperatures in urban areas in Nepal are consistently greater than those in nearby rural areas. Another study from 2017 approximated a 5 degrees Celsius difference between forested and urbanised areas within the valley, indicating the urban heat island effect in Kathmandu.</p><p>A report on the degree of urbanisation in Nepal reveals that 29 percent of the country's population is in urban areas and 40 percent in peri-urban areas. How our cities are designed has resulted in the urban heat island effect, where urban areas have significantly higher temperatures than the surrounding rural areas. This puts significant stress on energy and infrastructure, as higher temperatures mean higher electricity demand for cooling, increasing energy costs and emissions.</p><p>Heat action plan</p><p>While the impacts of extreme heat are profound, they are not insurmountable\u2014especially when individuals, communities, civil society and governments collaborate for solutions. We must address the emerging threat of extreme heat and replicate the best adaptation and mitigation practices at scale. There is a need for a robust early warning system and preparedness, as well as effective response and anticipatory actions guided by a heat action plan.</p><p>The article particularly focuses on more forward-looking solutions through an urban planning and development approach to directly reduce the temperature and mitigate the risks of extreme heat.</p><p>A settlement-based approach\u2014one that considers all components of a habitat as a system\u2014could guide the way. This means looking at buildings, roads, open spaces, infrastructure, basic services and people. By understanding how these elements interact, we can identify where the challenges and vulnerabilities are concentrated and design solutions that work across these components. Integrating our efforts allows us to multiply our mitigation efforts. It puts our development decisions at the centre so that they are responsive to the risks and do not exacerbate the situation.</p><p>Protecting the natural cooling systems in our settlements\u2014like rivers, ponds, canals, lakes, wetlands and fountains\u2014is also essential. These features improve the microclimate, offer passive cooling and create meaningful community spaces. This means regreening and bringing in as many trees and vegetation as natural coolers. It can take several forms, such as rooftop gardens at household levels, roadside trees, shaded pathways, urban forests, pocket parks, gardens and vegetation in open spaces. Tree canopies provide shade, filter pollution and reduce surface and air temperature by natural reduction of surface temperature by up to 12 degrees.</p><p>We must also create and preserve open spaces, parks and green corridors that, combined with water bodies, create a powerful cooling synergy. Open areas can host cooling centres, water features, or shade structures that directly help people cope with extreme heat.</p><p>To reduce vehicle dependency, we must also promote the walkability of cities. Fewer vehicles mean more space for greenery and lower heat generation. We have witnessed the environmental and socio-economic benefits of a vehicle-free zone in the traditional settlement of Handigaun. While promoting walkability, permeable pavements tested in Lalitpur Metropolitan are a smart urban adaptation strategy that allows rainwater to infiltrate through surfaces, reducing runoff, recharging groundwater and significantly reducing surface temperatures.</p><p>Buildings also play a massive role in reducing heat stress and urban heat island effects. We must use passive design technology to maximise airflow. Green and cool roofs reduce the surface temperature and cool the surrounding air. For instance, Ahmedabad has successfully implemented a Heat Action Plan focused on cool roofs and early warning systems, which reduced heat-related deaths annually by approximately 1,000.</p><p>At Durga Basic School in Gadhawa Municipality, Dang\u2014where tin-roofed classrooms used to reach temperatures as high as 45 degrees Celsius during summer\u2014UN-Habitat tested the application of high-reflective coating that reduced indoor temperatures by up to 10 degrees Celsius. Similar affordable solutions for Nepal's rural-urban areas can significantly improve the well-being of inhabitants and reduce energy demand.</p><p>Coordinated action</p><p>We must focus on people and communities while working on climate adaptation. To identify solutions, we must engage the vulnerable population, such as construction workers, street vendors, daily wage labourers, farmers, children, lactating mothers and persons with disabilities, ensuring their voices and needs are rightly addressed.</p><p>The bottom line is that growing heat is no longer a seasonal discomfort but a growing public health and development crisis. It demands a \"whole-of-society\" approach for mitigation and adaptation through coordinated action across all sectors. There is no denying that the heat is rising, and so is our awareness and ability to innovate.</p><p>Pragya Pradhan is the Habitat Programme Manager at UN-Habitat Nepal.</p><p>Prabal Dahal is an Urban Planner at UN-Habitat Nepal.</p><p>\u00a9 2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany).

For generations, her family relied on Badin's salty waters for fishing, but seawater intrusion turned freshwater ponds brackish and fertile lands barren.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This change, steady but not slow, left Fareeha in dire financial straits, forcing her husband and sons to work at brick kilns. But this wasn't a permanent solution, she says. \"The sea took our nets, then our dignity ... we were eventually forced to move out.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fareeha's plight resonates with almost 80 per cent of other fishing families in Badin, where, without compensation or adaptation, climate poverty has pushed hundreds into a chaotic storm of displacement.</p><p>While climate change is a global issue, its impacts, unfortunately, are spread disproportionately across the world. Despite having minimal contributions towards global greenhouse gas emissions, low-income countries tend to be extremely vulnerable to the disastrous effects of the crisis. Moreover, the increased frequency of extreme weather events, lack of resources and infrastructure, and limited access to climate finance make developing nations less resilient and more prone to climate poverty.</p><p>Pakistan is among these nations, having been ranked as the most vulnerable country to climate change in 2022, according to the Global Climate Risk Index 2025. The floods that submerged over a third of the country three years ago affected more than 33 million people, resulting in the loss of 1,700 lives and $30 billion.</p><p>At the same time, droughts in Sindh and Balochistan in recent years have made water increasingly scarce, leading to parched crops and rising food prices, highlighting Pakistan's severe vulnerability to disasters driven by climate change.</p><p>At the same time, climate change also deepens pre-existing inequalities, with marginalised communities facing a greater burden. Their vulnerabilities increase due to a myriad of socio-economic factors such as gender, ethnicity, and low income, which traps communities into a vicious web of climate poverty \u2014 when the conditions stemming from climate change destroy livelihoods, increase food and water scarcity, and displace communities.</p><p>According to the World Bank Group's Country Climate and Development Report (CCDR) for Pakistan, \"the combined risks of extreme climate-related events, environmental degradation, and air pollution are projected to reduce Pakistan's GDP [gross domestic product] by at least 18pc to 20pc by 2050.\" This will significantly slow down economic progress and hinder efforts towards poverty reduction.</p><p>Engineered, not accidental</p><p>In Pakistan, 40 per cent of the population is highly vulnerable and frequently exposed to climate-induced disasters, including floods, cyclones, droughts, heavy rain spells, and extreme heatwaves. Marginalised urban residents, indigenous rural communities, small-scale farmers, and fisherfolk are among those at high risk.</p><p>A research report by Oxfam studying Pakistan's rural disaster-prone communities in Badin (Sindh), Rajanpur (Punjab), and Khuzdar (Balochistan) found that they bore the brunt of climate-induced displacement, food insecurity and economic instability. In Badin, seawater intrusion has degraded freshwater resources, reducing fish and prawn catches and leaving many fisherfolk struggling to sustain their livelihoods. The increased frequency of cyclones and storms has further displaced coastal populations, many of whom lack the resources to adapt or migrate.</p><p>In Rajanpur, erratic rainfall patterns and intense flooding have destroyed agricultural lands, making it increasingly difficult for farmers to predict sowing and harvesting cycles. Meanwhile, prolonged droughts have rapidly depleted groundwater levels in Khuzdar, shrinking grazing lands and threatening livestock-dependent livelihoods. Across these regions, traditional methods are proving insufficient, pushing many families into seasonal migration in search of alternative sources of income.</p><p>In Pakistan's urban centres, the poor are often pushed to the margins, forced to live in overcrowded, unsafe housing that not only endangers their lives but also intensifies the impact of climate-induced disasters. Take the port city Karachi as an example; prolonged power outages lasting between 10 to 16 hours severely impact low-income areas such as Shah Faisal Colony, Lyari, Bhit, and Baba Island.</p><p>These disruptions affect daily wage earners the most, making it increasingly difficult for them to sustain their livelihoods. Beyond economic strain, the lack of electricity poses serious health risks, particularly for the elderly, children, and pregnant women. With growing climate-related health issues, financial burdens worsen, trapping many in a relentless cycle of poverty.</p><p>In 2021, around 15,000 families living along the Gujjar and Orangi nullahs were displaced without rehabilitation in the name of flood mitigation and anti-encroachment campaigns. Government agencies seem to have not just failed in solving the housing crisis in the metropolis but also in implementing resettlement policies.</p><p>The authorities use the Supreme Court's 2021 order of demolition while displacing people, but forget that the apex court had also issued directions for the resettlement and rehabilitation of the victims. To top it, the government displays impeccable punctuality and pace when it comes to demolition, while delaying tactics are used in relocation and resolution, keeping hundreds of families in limbo for years.</p><p>The impacts of climate change are also deeply intertwined with corporate accountability, such as the illegal development of Karachi's waterfront, or Emaar's $3 billion Bundal Island project, which blocks natural drainage and worsens urban flooding in nearby low-income communities.</p><p>This is why slum dwellers say, \"As soon as the builders get permits, we (the poor and the vulnerable) get evicted.\" Meanwhile, dozens of textile factories along Karachi's Lyari River dump untreated sewage, making monsoon rains toxic, but that doesn't even cross the ears of officials at Sindh's Environmental Protection Agency (Sepa). It's right to say that climate vulnerability is not accidental. In cities like Karachi, they are engineered.</p><p>Where resilience becomes resistance</p><p>Meanwhile, statistics issued by the Pakistan Disaster Management Authority show that around $50 million in the World Bank's flood resilience funds are tied up in bureaucratic delays. It is evident; when institutions fail, the poor drown twice \u2014 first in floodwaters and then again in departmental negligence.</p><p>The disproportionate cost of climate change is not limited to class but also seeps into gender, where women and girls face a higher risk and challenge. The United Nations concurs, highlighting in various reports how women make up 80pc of those displaced by climate change. In Pakistan, it is the women in rural areas who are the most vulnerable.</p><p>According to a 2021 study on vulnerable communities in Sindh, declining agricultural productivity and men travelling in search of work have left women with the dual burden of managing domestic and financial responsibilities, worsening their vulnerability to food scarcity, malnutrition, and health complications.</p><p>The situation is no different in Balochistan. \"Our men have migrated; we (the women) have stayed to fight for the land,\" said Rozina, 51. She leads a women's collective for drought-resistant millet cultivation in Khuzdar. Her efforts are at odds with a system that denies women land title and ownership.</p><p>\"And it is this land that we (women) are protecting,\" Rozina stressed.</p><p>For Pakistan's transgender community, the situation is even worse. Facing immense stigma and marginalisation, they are disowned by their families, limiting their access to education, employment, and proper housing. As a result, they are forced to live in informal settlements or slums, which are particularly susceptible to climate-induced disasters such as floods and extreme heat waves.</p><p>Moreover, due to systemic discrimination and exclusion, many are unable to access government relief post-disasters, as highlighted in the devastating floods of 2022, with a majority of those affected unable to access relief programs due to the lack of official identification documents. According to an NGO working for transgenders, 95pc of flood victims were denied assistance, discriminated against or excluded by design.</p><p>Here, resilience is resistance.</p><p>The path to recovery</p><p>But is there a way out of this toxic and repetitive cycle? Yes.</p><p>A working paper titled 'The 24-Hour Risk City: A Framework for Thinking About Building Infrastructures of Climate Repair in Nairobi and Karachi' introduces the concept of climate repair, describing it as a practice of maintenance and repair that focuses on both human and environmental well-being in the face of climate risks. It is framed as an ethic of care, emphasising the importance of continuous and deliberate efforts to sustain and restore urban and ecological systems.</p><p>Climate repair involves three different dimensions: bodily and familial, infrastructural, and connective-communal repair, particularly in low-income settlements where inadequate infrastructures and governance failures leave communities more vulnerable.</p><p>The paper highlights that climate repair is a gendered practice, often carried out by women and marginalised communities who engage in everyday forms of care and adaptation to combat the effects of extreme weather events, urban flooding, and heatwaves, especially in the absence of governmental or institutional support.</p><p>Therefore, it underlines the need for a holistic approach in policymaking, including not only the improvement of physical infrastructure but also strengthening social networks and integrating local solutions to build resilience towards adverse climatic impacts.</p><p>Encompassing infrastructural resilience, socioeconomic empowerment, and participatory governance, the idea of climate repair recognises that the most vulnerable communities must be at the centre of climate action.

With less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the continent bears a disproportionately high burden of climate-related devastation. From collapsed agricultural systems to growing humanitarian emergencies, the impacts are no longer looming threats-they are current, compounding catastrophes. As the World Meteorological Organization recently warned, extreme weather and climate change are now striking &amp;#8220;every single aspect of socioeconomic development in Africa,&amp;#8221; exacerbating hunger, insecurity, and displacement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This reality presents a moral test and a strategic challenge for the global community. While the scientific consensus on climate change is universal, the lived experience of its impacts is anything but equal. Africa is suffering most from a crisis it did not cause, and unless urgent support is mobilized, the consequences will reverberate far beyond its borders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Africas economic structure leaves it acutely vulnerable to climate variability. Agriculture, which employs up to 60% of the population in many countries, depends heavily on predictable weather patterns. Yet in recent years, erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts, rising temperatures, and flooding have become the new normal. Countries such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mali, and Sudan have seen devastating losses in staple crops like sorghum, maize, millet, and cassava. In some areas, entire harvests have been wiped out.</p><p>This is not simply a rural farming crisis-its a macroeconomic emergency. In places like Kenya and Somalia, repeated climate disasters have forced governments to reallocate scarce resources from long-term development toward immediate relief efforts such as food distribution, water trucking, and emergency infrastructure repair. In 2024 alone, flooding across Central Africa destroyed vital road networks, water systems, and bridges, derailing national development plans and sapping public budgets.</p><p>Compounding the problem, Africas energy infrastructure is already under strain. Hydropower, a major source of electricity in countries like Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is underperforming as rivers and reservoirs dry up. Power outages have crippled manufacturing sectors, pushed businesses to the brink of collapse, and plunged communities into deeper poverty.</p><p>Climate-related economic decline risks becoming a downward spiral. Without sufficient investment in resilience and adaptation, many African economies face the threat of long-term stagnation or collapse. This instability, in turn, discourages foreign investment, drains human capital through emigration, and places unsustainable pressure on public institutions already grappling with debt, health crises, and political fragility.</p><p>Beyond the economic and infrastructural fallout lies a profound and growing human cost. Across the Sahel and West Africa, over 36 million people are facing acute food insecurity, many of them on the brink of famine. Malnourishment among children is skyrocketing, threatening irreversible damage to cognitive and physical development. Education systems are faltering, as floods and droughts damage school infrastructure and push families into survival mode, where education becomes a luxury few can afford.</p><p>Meanwhile, the climate crisis is driving a surge in public health emergencies. Floodwaters breed cholera and other waterborne illnesses. Rising temperatures are expanding the reach of malaria, while also triggering spikes in heat-related illnesses. Healthcare systems-underfunded, understaffed, and overwhelmed-are unable to cope.</p><p>This multilayered emergency is fueling mass displacement across the continent. As land becomes uninhabitable and resources scarce, families are forced to move, often into urban slums or across borders into uncertain futures. Conflict over arable land and access to water is intensifying, escalating pre-existing ethnic and political tensions. In several regions, including the Horn of Africa, climate change is acting as a force multiplier of violence and instability.</p><p>The injustice is clear: Africa did not create this crisis. Its people and governments have contributed only marginally to the global carbon footprint. The vast majority of emissions have historically come from the industrialized world-primarily the United States, European countries, and, more recently, China. These nations built their economies on carbon-intensive models and now have a responsibility to assist those suffering the most severe consequences.</p><p>Yet, despite this responsibility, climate finance pledges from wealthy countries have been inconsistent and insufficient. The $100 billion per year promised to developing countries by 2020 has not materialized in full. Worse, much of the funding that is provided is tied up in red tape, comes in the form of loans rather than grants, or is directed toward mitigation projects that do little to help vulnerable populations adapt to changing realities.</p><p>Now, with the world facing accelerating climate breakdown, the stakes are higher than ever. Experts argue that annual global climate finance must increase to between $1 trillion and $1.3 trillion by 2030. This must include targeted support for Africa, focused not only on emission reductions but also on climate adaptation, infrastructure resilience, and social protection.</p><p>Africa does not need handouts-it needs tools, partnerships, and agency. With the right investment, the continent can not only adapt but lead in key areas of the green transition. Africa is home to some of the worlds most abundant solar and wind resources. Properly harnessed, these can meet energy demand sustainably while expanding access to electricity for the 600 million Africans currently living without it.</p><p>Technology, too, can play a transformative role. Climate-smart agriculture can help farmers adapt to erratic weather, while AI-driven early warning systems can prevent disasters from escalating. Investments in water conservation, green infrastructure, and decentralized renewable energy systems can build community-level resilience.</p><p>Debt relief and financial innovation are also essential. Many African countries are constrained by unsustainable debt, limiting their ability to invest in resilience. Mechanisms such as debt-for-climate swaps, concessional finance, and climate risk insurance can ease this burden and create fiscal space for adaptation strategies.</p><p>Most importantly, climate aid must be locally driven. African women, youth, and grassroots organizations are already leading adaptation initiatives that are effective, inclusive, and grounded in community needs. International donors must ensure that support reaches these local actors and does not bypass them through top-heavy, bureaucratic programs.</p><p>Failing to support Africa is not only unjust-it is dangerous. As the impacts of climate change intensify, so too will the pressures of displacement, hunger, and conflict. A continent of over 1.4 billion people cannot be allowed to slide into climate-driven chaos. The global ramifications-rising migration, disrupted trade routes, and geopolitical instability-will be profound.</p><p>Climate change is not confined by borders. Drought in the Horn of Africa can drive up global food prices. Displacement in West Africa can create political tremors in Europe. Collapse in one region can trigger economic ripples worldwide. Helping Africa is, in truth, helping humanity.</p><p>Moreover, failure to act would erode trust in the international climate process. Agreements like the Paris Accord rest on principles of equity and shared responsibility. If the most vulnerable are left to suffer alone, global cooperation will fracture, and the climate fight will lose legitimacy.</p><p>The world cannot afford to turn its back on Africa. The time for promises and platitudes is over. What is needed now is bold, sustained, and justice-centered action. Climate change is testing not just the planets physical limits, but the worlds moral resolve.</p><p>Africa did not cause this crisis-but it is paying the highest price. The world must help it adapt and thrive. Doing so is not only the right thing to do-it is essential for the survival of a shared, stable, and equitable future.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

The Met Office predicted last Friday that this week would be a sweltering one, with a heatwave sweeping over the country till the coming weekend. It said that a high-pressure system was likely to grip the upper atmosphere from Sunday, triggering heatwave conditions in most parts of the country, which would get more severe in the southern half from April 14. It expected daytime temperatures to remain 6\u00b0C to 8\u00b0C above normal in Sindh, southern Punjab and Balochistan from Monday to Friday. Meanwhile, the upper half of the country would stew in temperatures four to six degrees higher than usual. Hot nights, dust storms and windstorms also featured in the forecast. It made for a rather sobering prognosis, with an acute shortage of water in the Tarbela and Mangla dams adding to the worries.</p><p>Large parts of Pakistan's key agricultural regions have already been facing drought-like conditions, with rainfall drastically below average in the first quarter of 2025. Now adding to that is the extreme heat, which will create major problems for farmers.</p><p>These unnatural climate conditions are a sign of how fast the reality is changing for Pakistan, where policymakers still do not appear to be acting very decisively to protect the people and secure their future. While competing claims are being made on its already stressed water resources, the larger picture points to the fact that a much broader and more cohesive plan is needed to meet Pakistan's changing requirements amidst an accelerating climate crisis. Yet, we continue to rely on band-aid measures.</p><p>Consider the Met Office's warning to farmers. Based on its prediction, it advised agriculturalists to manage their activities keeping in view weather conditions and to protect their livestock during the heatwave. But such warnings serve no long-term purpose. Given the recurrence of freak weather patterns, perhaps what is needed is continuing farmer re-education and training programmes aimed at climate adaptation. Pakistan must confront the fact that the farm practices in vogue in large parts of the country may have been rendered outdated by climate change. It must move quickly to find ways to mitigate the climate's effects on national output.</p><p>Likewise, the issue of water scarcity needs urgent attention. Both climate scientists and experts have long warned that Pakistan cannot continue wasting this vital resource and treating it as if it will stay constant. With reservoirs depleted to critical levels, Pakistan remains at the mercy of nature. An extended drought could trigger disaster in the coming months. There is, therefore, an urgent need to educate the public about water conservation and impress upon it the seriousness of the situation. This is an existential crisis and should be treated as such.</p><p>\u00a9 2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany).

However, there is little evidence to back its assertions that it is integrating climate-resilient policies across the sectors.</p><p>On Friday, Finance Minister Mohammed Aurangzeb rightly pointed out a huge financing gap and lack of technical capacity in our fight against climate change. However, there are policy actions that simply need political will and commitment and not money to address the climate change challenges.</p><p>With international climate financing slow to come, it falls upon our policymakers to use whatever money we have in such a way that it helps create climate-resilient infrastructure and climate-adaptation measures. Waiting for outside help to arrive will only aggravate our climate challenges and not mitigate them. As the finance minister has emphasised, sustainable economic and environmental growth go hand in hand.

But while this figure is three times higher than the previous $100 billion target, it falls far short of what's needed to close the climate funding gap.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">the challenge today is more complex than when the Paris Climate Agreement was signed in 2015. Back then, the $100 billion figure was largely arbitrary, not based on a full analysis of actual investment needs. By contrast, COP29 had to estimate real costs and determine how much external financing would be required.</p><p>a report by the Independent HighLevel Expert Group on Climate Finance (IHLEG), of which I am a member, finds that developing countries (excluding China) will need $2.4-3.3 trillion in climate investments by 2035.</p><p>about 60% of this could be financed domestically through higher savings and reduced public deficits.</p><p>even so, after reallocating existing investments toward the green transition, a $1 trillion shortfall by 2030 - rising to $1.3 trillion by 2035 - remains. Closing this gap will require external funding. While COP29 acknowledged the scale of the financing gap, it failed to agree on how to close it. Developing countries pushed for wealthier economies to cover the shortfall with public funds, but developed countries offered only $300 billion annually - and even that came with a caveat: they would only 'take the lead' in mobilizing funds rather than guaranteeing direct provision.</p><p>every Thursday in PS Economics, we offer a concise selection of essential reading on the most important issues related to economics and finance.</p><p>the IHLEG report suggests that $650 billion of the funding gap by 2035 could be met through private investment, including equity and debt. But this exposed a deep divide. Developed countries favored private capital to ease budget pressures, while developing countries, aware of its volatility, insisted on public funding for accountability and predictability. Skepticism around private finance is warranted. Many developing countries struggle to attract private investment, relying instead on grants and concessional long-term loans. Shifting these limited public resources to low-income economies means that middle-income countries will have to rely even more on private capital - despite investor uncertainty.</p><p>access every new PS commentary, our entire On Point suite of subscriber-exclusive content - including Longer Reads, Insider Interviews, Big Picture/Big Question, and Say More - and the full PS archive. Private climate finance will grow from $40 billion in 2022 to an estimated $650 billion by 2035, according to the IHLEG. But most investment remains concentrated in a few markets, making access unequal and uncertain. Falling renewable energy costs could boost green projects over fossil fuels, but the transition's pace remains unclear.</p><p>even when private capital is available, domestic policies oftendiscourage investment. Many governments artificially lower energy prices for political reasons, making electricity providers financially unviable. Foreign investors understandably see this as a fundamental risk and hesitate to invest.</p><p>if private finance is to play a bigger role, governments must reform energy pricing, strengthen regulations, and cut bureaucratic red tape to attract investment. Public-sector support remains crucial. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) and bilateral institutions can lower risks for private investors through risk-sharing mechanisms while helping governments create stable, investment-friendly environments. COP29's failure to secure a stronger funding deal means a renegotiation is unlikely until the next global stocktake in 2028. However, gaps can still be bridged.</p><p>expanding MDB lending - which has lagged behind climate needs - could provide muchneeded capital while countries work on long-term policy solutions. COP29's final statement pointed to an opportunity to make real progress ahead of COP30 in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil. But one key factor will determine success: developed countries' willingness to commit more financial resources.</p><p>this has become even more uncertain with Donald Trump's return to the White House. His administration's hostility to global climate efforts and its push for fossil fuel expansion will likely weaken international climate finance. The US is already scaling back existing commitments, further delaying climate negotiations. Given how slow and bureaucratic these discussions have become, it's worth asking: Are massive annual COP meetings still the right approach? With tens of thousands of government officials, business leaders, and NGOs gathering each year, the urgency of the climate crisis demands more focused, results-driven decision-making.</p><p>one alternative is to delegate key financing negotiations to smaller, specialized groups.</p><p>the G20, for example, lacks universal representation but includes all major economies - developed and developing - accounting for 80% of global GDP and emissions and twothirds of the world's population. More importantly, its members control the world's largest multilateral development banks, making it a natural platform for driving climate finance.</p><p>another option is BRICS, which has positioned itself as a counterweight to Western-led financial institutions.
