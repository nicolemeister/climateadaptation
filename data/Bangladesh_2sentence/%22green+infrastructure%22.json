This is more than just an attractive concept or a design feature\u2014it is a green, sustainable, and urgently needed solution to food insecurity, urban heat, and air pollution. Yet, despite growing interest and even official recognition, rooftop farming in Bangladesh remains legally unregulated and unsupported.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The issue is not a lack of acknowledgement. The National Agriculture Policy of 2018 explicitly references rooftop farming under \"Specialised Agriculture.\" It encourages urban citizens to utilise their rooftops for cultivation and recommends incentives for research and development in the sector. Dhaka North City Corporation (DNCC) has even offered a 10 percent tax rebate to residents maintaining rooftop gardens\u2014a direct cash incentive from the local government.</p><p>But recognition does not equate to action. Policies remain fragmented, and the broader institutional and legal frameworks have yet to follow suit.</p><p>Perhaps the most significant obstacle is the Bangladesh National Building Code (BNBC 2020). This key document\u2014which dictates how all buildings in Bangladesh must be constructed\u2014fails to mention rooftop farming or green infrastructure even once. There are no guidelines for integrating urban agriculture into building design, no zoning permits, and no regulations mandating that new constructions provide rooftop space for greenery.</p><p>Contrast this with cities like Paris, where local building codes require solar panels or green roofs on all new commercial developments. Singapore's Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) grants Green Plot Ratio bonuses to developers who incorporate rooftop gardens and greenery. Without comparable legal requirements, Bangladesh risks lagging even further behind in sustainable urban development.</p><p>Legal hurdles extend further. Even when rooftop farms are operational, they are not recognised as valid food sources. The Food Safety Act (2013), which governs the quality and safety of food products in Bangladesh, fails to categorise rooftop produce as either distinct or low-risk. This legislation was designed for industrial-scale manufacturers, not for families growing tomatoes, lettuce, and herbs atop a four-storey building in Dhanmondi.</p><p>As a result, rooftop farmers cannot easily sell their produce through formal distribution channels, despite offering pesticide-free, hyper-local alternatives to chemically grown vegetables sold in open markets. Worse still, the Act has not been updated to reflect the urban agricultural developments encouraged by the National Agriculture Policy. There is no convergence between food regulation and agricultural vision.</p><p>Bangladesh has made notable progress in promoting digital agriculture through its National ICT Policy (2018). Initiatives like Krishoker Janala and Balainashok Shohayika deliver real-time information on crop diseases, weather conditions, and best practices directly to rural farmers via digital platforms.</p><p>But urban rooftop farmers are excluded. The ICT Policy makes no mention of them. There is no e-commerce integration for rooftop-grown produce, and no extension services available online. Once again, urban agriculture is left out of the conversation.</p><p>Then there is the Environment Conservation Act (1995) and its latest update, the Environment Conservation Rules (2023). Despite their importance as cornerstones of Bangladesh's environmental governance, these acts say nothing about the benefits of rooftop agriculture, despite the fact that its environmental value is globally acknowledged.</p><p>Green roofs help mitigate urban heat islands, improve air quality, and manage rainwater runoff\u2014all pressing issues for a city like Dhaka. Yet rooftop farming is not officially recognised as an environmentally beneficial practice. It is not exempt from Environmental Clearance Certificates (ECCs), nor is it incentivised. Without being legally identified as a \"green activity,\" there is no justification for promoting or protecting it.</p><p>Meanwhile, other countries are adapting their legal frameworks in response to environmental crises. In New York, the Green Roof Tax Abatement Programme offers financial incentives to property developers for installing green roofs. In Singapore, public-private collaborations under the \"30 by 30\" food security initiative are integrating urban agriculture into everyday life.</p><p>The solution is not just policy\u2014it is legal reform. Bangladesh already has elements of a visionary framework on paper. But vision without implementation is just an idea.</p><p>The BNBC must be amended to include rooftop farming in building plans and land zoning. The Food Safety Act must introduce streamlined, tiered registration and inspection processes for urban farmers. The ICT policies must incorporate digital tools and support platforms tailored to urban farmers, who are typically younger and more technologically adept than their rural counterparts.</p><p>Most crucially, the Environment Conservation Rules must identify rooftop farming as a recognised green initiative\u2014one that enhances climate resilience and deserves institutional support, not neglect.</p><p>Rooftop farming is not merely planting; it is about reimagining the urban landscape. In a city like Dhaka, where open spaces are vanishing and rooftops are among the last available urban frontiers, rooftop farming offers an environmentally friendly, democratised and scalable solution.</p><p>All it needs is for the law to catch up.</p><p>Mir Preom Mosharrof is an LLM candidate at North South University (NSU).</p><p>Views expressed in this article are the author's own.</p><p>\u00a9 2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany).

The program, unveiled by the Ministry of the Interior and Safety and reported by the Korea Herald, is part of a larger 31.8 trillion-won ($23.3 billion) supplementary budget passed by the National Assembly on July 4. It is the first major economic initiative spearheaded by the newly elected President Lee Jae-myung following months of political turbulence and economic underperformance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the core of the initiative is a one-time payment of 150,000 won (approximately $110) for every citizen residing in South Korea as of June 18, 2025. These payments, framed as &amp;#8220;consumption coupons,&amp;#8221; aim to directly encourage spending by putting cash into the hands of ordinary consumers. Disbursements will be delivered via digital means-credit and debit card credits, prepaid cards, and municipal gift certificates-allowing citizens to use the funds quickly and conveniently.</p><p>Vice Interior Minister Kim Min-jae, who heads the interagency task force overseeing the rollout, emphasized the urgency and strategic importance of the initiative. &amp;#8220;We will ensure thorough preparations for the rollout of these payments so that they can serve as a catalyst for economic recovery by boosting consumption and supporting those in need,&amp;#8221; Kim said in a televised statement.</p><p>The government has also tailored portions of the package to address inequality and poverty. Near-poverty households and single-parent families will receive a higher amount-300,000 won ($220), while recipients of the countrys basic living allowance will be entitled to 400,000 won ($290). An additional 50,000 won ($37) will be granted to individuals residing in rural areas, in an effort to promote &amp;#8220;balanced regional development&amp;#8221; and prevent further depopulation of the countryside.</p><p>These targeted disbursements reflect growing concerns within the Lee administration about rising socioeconomic disparities, particularly in the aftermath of the political and economic crises that shook the nation in late 2024.</p><p>In a sign that the government sees the need for sustained stimulus, a second round of payments is already scheduled. Beginning September 22 and continuing through the end of October, the government will issue a further 100,000 won ($73) to the bottom 90% of income earners. Eligibility will be determined by national health insurance premiums-a proxy commonly used in Korea to assess household income levels. The Ministry of Strategy and Finance is expected to release more detailed eligibility guidelines in early September.</p><p>The stimulus package marks a sharp departure from the austerity-leaning policies of the previous administration under President Yoon Suk Yeol, who was impeached and removed from office in early 2025 following a controversial declaration of martial law amid mass protests. The constitutional crisis rattled investor confidence and stymied economic activity, culminating in a rare contraction in the second quarter of 2024 and only anemic growth thereafter. South Korea narrowly avoided a technical recession, but many households continued to struggle with stagnant wages, rising living costs, and youth unemployment.</p><p>President Lee Jae-myung, who won the snap election held in May, campaigned on a populist platform focused on economic relief and national healing. Since taking office on June 4, he has prioritized a mix of cash assistance, digital voucher schemes, and long-term investment in artificial intelligence and green infrastructure.</p><p>&amp;#8220;This stimulus is not just about recovery-it is about transformation,&amp;#8221; Lee said during a national address last week. &amp;#8220;We must rebuild our economy from the bottom up, with fairness, resilience, and innovation at the center.&amp;#8221;</p><p>Despite broad public support, the cash handout program has triggered warnings from several economists and opposition lawmakers about potential downsides. Critics argue that such large-scale stimulus spending-especially if repeated-could fuel inflation or exacerbate the countrys already high debt levels.</p><p>According to the Ministry of Economy and Finance, the supplementary budget will be financed primarily through new government debt, pushing the projected fiscal deficit for 2025 to 4.2% of GDP and lifting the national debt ratio to 49.1%.</p><p>&amp;#8220;The scale of the debt-funded stimulus is unprecedented,&amp;#8221; said Park Hye-jin, a senior economist at the Korea Institute for Economic Policy. &amp;#8220;If the government doesnt present a credible long-term plan for fiscal consolidation, this could lead to interest rate pressures and credit downgrades.&amp;#8221;</p><p>However, proponents of the stimulus argue that the risks are manageable and that immediate action is needed to prevent long-term stagnation. &amp;#8220;In times of crisis, government intervention is not just justified-its necessary,&amp;#8221; said Professor Lee Sang-hoon, an economist at Seoul National University. &amp;#8220;If executed properly, this could lead to a virtuous cycle of increased spending, business recovery, and employment growth.&amp;#8221;</p><p>The success of the program will hinge on execution. South Koreas past experiences with digital vouchers and disaster relief payments during the COVID-19 pandemic have shown that timely disbursement and proper targeting can significantly impact consumption trends. However, administrative hiccups, bureaucratic delays, or insufficient outreach could blunt the programs effectiveness.</p><p>More fundamentally, this initiative is a litmus test for President Lees broader economic vision. As South Korea navigates a period of transition-not only politically but also technologically and demographically-the ability of the government to stimulate short-term demand while laying foundations for sustainable growth will define the legacy of the new administration.</p><p>In the coming weeks, all eyes will be on whether Korean consumers will spend or save the payments. And in a country where household debt remains high and economic uncertainty lingers, the question remains: can free money really fix what ails the economy?</p><p>For now, South Korea is placing a bold bet on the power of cash to spur a recovery-and perhaps restore public trust in its institutions.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

However, few may realise that over 44 per cent of the city's total land area remains agricultural \u00e2\u20ac\u201d a significant advantage if harnessed through proper planning and strategic development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to Nguy\u00e1\u00bb\u2026n Xu\u00c3\u00a2n \u00c4\u00e1\u00ba\u00a1i, director of the H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i Department of Agriculture and Environment, the city has for many years pursued a comprehensive restructuring of its agricultural sector along the principles of 'green \u00e2\u20ac\u201d efficient \u00e2\u20ac\u201d sustainable'. In this approach, agriculture is no longer viewed solely as an economic activity, but also as a cornerstone of environmental protection, food security and ecological balance within the city.</p><p>Restructuring production zones is not merely about rearranging farmland. It represents a broader strategy to preserve soil and water resources, safeguard natural habitats, reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve resilience to climate change. In recent years, H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i has achieved positive results in this direction, especially in crop and livestock production.</p><p>Crop cultivation has undergone a transformation toward organic and high-tech methods. The city currently has over 523 hectares of vegetables grown under organic or near-organic practices, achieving average yields of 50 tonnes per hectare per year, 15-20 per cent higher than conventional methods. In addition, 908 hectares of vegetable farms now apply high-tech solutions such as greenhouse systems and drip irrigation, helping to improve product quality while conserving natural resources.</p><p>In the livestock sector, H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i has adopted circular farming practices that emphasise emission reductions and environmental safety. Many farms operate with closed-loop barn systems, automated feeding technologies, and biological waste treatment measures.</p><p>Notably, 95 per cent of large-scale pig farms use biogas systems, while 65 per cent of livestock facilities apply biological agents to treat waste. These innovations help ensure compliance with technical standards while supporting the transition away from small-scale backyard farming in densely populated areas.</p><p>H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i is also developing a model of urban agriculture that integrates high-tech farming with experiential tourism in peri-urban areas. This is part of the city's broader strategy to transform agricultural land in urbanising zones into smart ecological spaces \u00e2\u20ac\u201d enhancing local food production, boosting farmers' incomes, and meeting the consumption demands of a growing urban population.</p><p>According to B\u00c3\u00b9i V\u00c4\u0192n S\u00c3\u00a1ng, Party Secretary of Tam H\u00c6\u00b0ng Commune, his commune, under the two-tier local governance model, is not only expanding in terms of population and land area but also possesses great potential for the development of green, ecological and circular agriculture.</p><p>With its deep-rooted farming traditions, the commune is well-positioned to establish specialised production areas for vegetables, ornamental plants, fruit trees, and aquaculture. The local government is restructuring its agricultural space with a focus on concentrated, eco-friendly, and high-tech models, while enhancing land-use management and aligning planning with socio-economic development.</p><p>In H\u00e1\u00bb\u201cng V\u00c3\u00a2n Commune, local authorities are leveraging the area's natural advantages to promote agriculture as part of the cultural and tourism fabric.</p><p>L\u00c3\u00aa Tu\u00e1\u00ba\u00a5n D\u00c5\u00a9ng, Chairman of the People's Committee of H\u00e1\u00bb\u201cng V\u00c3\u00a2n, emphasised that the commune was already a recognised tourism destination and had developed flower-lined roads and green corridors that support agri-tourism models. These initiatives catered to the tastes of urban residents and aligned with global trends in sustainable tourism.</p><p>Agriculture in H\u00e1\u00bb\u201cng V\u00c3\u00a2n is seen not only as a productive sector but also as a key element in shaping the landscape, preserving cultural identity, and laying the 'ecological foundation' for integrated development in tourism, services, and culture, according to the chairman.</p><p>The commune's strategy focuses on three main pillars: restructuring cultivation zones toward organic and circular models; developing experiential tourism destinations; and building value chains for local agricultural products tied to regional branding.</p><p>Nguy\u00e1\u00bb\u2026n M\u00e1\u00ba\u00a1nh Quy\u00e1\u00bbn, Vice Chairman of the H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i People's Committee, emphasized that the city was aligning its green agricultural zoning efforts with key legal and strategic frameworks.</p><p>These include the Capital Law, passed by the National Assembly on June 28, 2024, and Decision No. 1668/Q\u00c4-TTg dated December 27, 2024, issued by the Prime Minister to approve adjustments to H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i's General Planning toward 2045 with a vision to 2065.</p><p>Based on these frameworks, H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i has reviewed, adjusted, and supplemented designated zones for crop cultivation, livestock farming, and aquaculture to better reflect real-world conditions, according to Quy\u00e1\u00bbn. The capital is re-establishing its ecological spatial system, positioning agriculture as a form of green infrastructure \u00e2\u20ac\u201d serving both as a food belt and an ecological buffer zone.</p><p>It is clear that H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i's agricultural restructuring, integrated with green zoning and the ecological urban strategy, is a necessary pathway to ensure agricultural economic development, maintain ecological landscapes, improve quality of life and strengthen climate resilience.</p><p>The city has set a target for the 2030 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d 2045 period: to become a fully green urban area with ecological agriculture forming the backbone of an interconnected system that sustainably unites land, people, and nature.</p><p>According to Director Nguy\u00e1\u00bb\u2026n Xu\u00c3\u00a2n \u00c4\u00e1\u00ba\u00a1i, H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i is restructuring agricultural production across all sectors. In crop cultivation, the city will optimise land use, adopt advanced technologies and develop high-value products. Irrigation-challenged rice fields will be converted to more economically viable crops, and focus will be placed on crop varieties and technologies suitable for the unique conditions of peri-urban soils.</p><p>In livestock, H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i will continue developing strategic zones for concentrated animal farming. The city is reviewing plans to establish large-scale livestock areas in rapidly urbanising districts, while phasing out small-scale operations in residential zones. In compliance with Resolution No. 02/2020/NQ-H\u00c4ND of the H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i People's Council, H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i is ending livestock farming in certain areas and supporting the relocation of facilities located in restricted zones.</p><p>Aquaculture is also being developed along sustainable lines, with a focus on high productivity and quality. H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i's strategy includes the protection of aquatic ecosystems, environmental safeguards, climate change adaptation, disease prevention, environmental monitoring, and food safety from the outset of production.</p><p>Simultaneously, the city is integrating green, clean, and sustainable agricultural methods into training programs that link theoretical learning with local practice \u00e2\u20ac\u201d helping farmers improve their knowledge, technical skills and capacity to participate in the new agricultural economy.</p><p>Regional zoning tied to green agricultural development is a timely and strategic initiative for H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i in the face of new challenges. Beyond enhancing production efficiency and ensuring food safety, this approach fosters the creation of ecological zones, improves living conditions and contributes directly to the city's broader goal of sustainable urban development.</p><p>With forward-looking vision and methodical implementation, H\u00c3\u00a0 N\u00e1\u00bb\u2122i is steadily shaping a new agricultural identity that is modern, environmentally responsible and rich in potential.</p><p>\u00a9 2025 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany).

With less than 4% of global greenhouse gas emissions, the continent bears a disproportionately high burden of climate-related devastation. From collapsed agricultural systems to growing humanitarian emergencies, the impacts are no longer looming threats-they are current, compounding catastrophes. As the World Meteorological Organization recently warned, extreme weather and climate change are now striking &amp;#8220;every single aspect of socioeconomic development in Africa,&amp;#8221; exacerbating hunger, insecurity, and displacement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This reality presents a moral test and a strategic challenge for the global community. While the scientific consensus on climate change is universal, the lived experience of its impacts is anything but equal. Africa is suffering most from a crisis it did not cause, and unless urgent support is mobilized, the consequences will reverberate far beyond its borders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Africas economic structure leaves it acutely vulnerable to climate variability. Agriculture, which employs up to 60% of the population in many countries, depends heavily on predictable weather patterns. Yet in recent years, erratic rainfall, prolonged droughts, rising temperatures, and flooding have become the new normal. Countries such as Nigeria, Ethiopia, Mali, and Sudan have seen devastating losses in staple crops like sorghum, maize, millet, and cassava. In some areas, entire harvests have been wiped out.</p><p>This is not simply a rural farming crisis-its a macroeconomic emergency. In places like Kenya and Somalia, repeated climate disasters have forced governments to reallocate scarce resources from long-term development toward immediate relief efforts such as food distribution, water trucking, and emergency infrastructure repair. In 2024 alone, flooding across Central Africa destroyed vital road networks, water systems, and bridges, derailing national development plans and sapping public budgets.</p><p>Compounding the problem, Africas energy infrastructure is already under strain. Hydropower, a major source of electricity in countries like Zambia and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, is underperforming as rivers and reservoirs dry up. Power outages have crippled manufacturing sectors, pushed businesses to the brink of collapse, and plunged communities into deeper poverty.</p><p>Climate-related economic decline risks becoming a downward spiral. Without sufficient investment in resilience and adaptation, many African economies face the threat of long-term stagnation or collapse. This instability, in turn, discourages foreign investment, drains human capital through emigration, and places unsustainable pressure on public institutions already grappling with debt, health crises, and political fragility.</p><p>Beyond the economic and infrastructural fallout lies a profound and growing human cost. Across the Sahel and West Africa, over 36 million people are facing acute food insecurity, many of them on the brink of famine. Malnourishment among children is skyrocketing, threatening irreversible damage to cognitive and physical development. Education systems are faltering, as floods and droughts damage school infrastructure and push families into survival mode, where education becomes a luxury few can afford.</p><p>Meanwhile, the climate crisis is driving a surge in public health emergencies. Floodwaters breed cholera and other waterborne illnesses. Rising temperatures are expanding the reach of malaria, while also triggering spikes in heat-related illnesses. Healthcare systems-underfunded, understaffed, and overwhelmed-are unable to cope.</p><p>This multilayered emergency is fueling mass displacement across the continent. As land becomes uninhabitable and resources scarce, families are forced to move, often into urban slums or across borders into uncertain futures. Conflict over arable land and access to water is intensifying, escalating pre-existing ethnic and political tensions. In several regions, including the Horn of Africa, climate change is acting as a force multiplier of violence and instability.</p><p>The injustice is clear: Africa did not create this crisis. Its people and governments have contributed only marginally to the global carbon footprint. The vast majority of emissions have historically come from the industrialized world-primarily the United States, European countries, and, more recently, China. These nations built their economies on carbon-intensive models and now have a responsibility to assist those suffering the most severe consequences.</p><p>Yet, despite this responsibility, climate finance pledges from wealthy countries have been inconsistent and insufficient. The $100 billion per year promised to developing countries by 2020 has not materialized in full. Worse, much of the funding that is provided is tied up in red tape, comes in the form of loans rather than grants, or is directed toward mitigation projects that do little to help vulnerable populations adapt to changing realities.</p><p>Now, with the world facing accelerating climate breakdown, the stakes are higher than ever. Experts argue that annual global climate finance must increase to between $1 trillion and $1.3 trillion by 2030. This must include targeted support for Africa, focused not only on emission reductions but also on climate adaptation, infrastructure resilience, and social protection.</p><p>Africa does not need handouts-it needs tools, partnerships, and agency. With the right investment, the continent can not only adapt but lead in key areas of the green transition. Africa is home to some of the worlds most abundant solar and wind resources. Properly harnessed, these can meet energy demand sustainably while expanding access to electricity for the 600 million Africans currently living without it.</p><p>Technology, too, can play a transformative role. Climate-smart agriculture can help farmers adapt to erratic weather, while AI-driven early warning systems can prevent disasters from escalating. Investments in water conservation, green infrastructure, and decentralized renewable energy systems can build community-level resilience.</p><p>Debt relief and financial innovation are also essential. Many African countries are constrained by unsustainable debt, limiting their ability to invest in resilience. Mechanisms such as debt-for-climate swaps, concessional finance, and climate risk insurance can ease this burden and create fiscal space for adaptation strategies.</p><p>Most importantly, climate aid must be locally driven. African women, youth, and grassroots organizations are already leading adaptation initiatives that are effective, inclusive, and grounded in community needs. International donors must ensure that support reaches these local actors and does not bypass them through top-heavy, bureaucratic programs.</p><p>Failing to support Africa is not only unjust-it is dangerous. As the impacts of climate change intensify, so too will the pressures of displacement, hunger, and conflict. A continent of over 1.4 billion people cannot be allowed to slide into climate-driven chaos. The global ramifications-rising migration, disrupted trade routes, and geopolitical instability-will be profound.</p><p>Climate change is not confined by borders. Drought in the Horn of Africa can drive up global food prices. Displacement in West Africa can create political tremors in Europe. Collapse in one region can trigger economic ripples worldwide. Helping Africa is, in truth, helping humanity.</p><p>Moreover, failure to act would erode trust in the international climate process. Agreements like the Paris Accord rest on principles of equity and shared responsibility. If the most vulnerable are left to suffer alone, global cooperation will fracture, and the climate fight will lose legitimacy.</p><p>The world cannot afford to turn its back on Africa. The time for promises and platitudes is over. What is needed now is bold, sustained, and justice-centered action. Climate change is testing not just the planets physical limits, but the worlds moral resolve.</p><p>Africa did not cause this crisis-but it is paying the highest price. The world must help it adapt and thrive. Doing so is not only the right thing to do-it is essential for the survival of a shared, stable, and equitable future.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

A city, where your daily commute takes minutes instead of hours, where you breathe clean air without masks?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A moving road - an elevated, two-lane transit system that exclusively transports passengers, eliminating the need for a car, as the road carries individuals from one location to another - offers this groundbreaking future. Functioning with constant movement and quick station halts, this cutting-edge solution integrates solar energy, intelligent technology, and eco-friendly design to revolutionize urban transportation. In addition to addressing traffic issues, the moving road confronts urgent problems of air pollution, climate change, and economic setbacks while generating thousands of eco-friendly jobs. This innovative initiative can potentially transform Dhaka's cityscape, providing a model for sustainable urban development globally.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Moving roads, paving the path to building a zero-traffic, jam-free, clean-air urban ecosystem. This revolutionary transportation system operates 10 feet above the ground with dual tracks moving in opposite directions. The transit systems run continuously, pause briefly at stations, and travel at a great speed.</p><p>Could it be true that the relentless gridlock in Dhaka is responsible for an economic loss of $6.5 billion annually? The city's traffic problem, which affects the quality of life and hampers economic growth, is a problem for a metropolis of almost 20 million people. Moving roads can offer a solution by reducing congestion and enabling more efficient traffic flow. Moreover, these roads can provide a pioneering urban mobility alternative that encourages quicker and more sustainable travel for its residents.</p><p>Moving roads may significantly reduce emissions using environmentally friendly and energy-efficient transportation solutions. In 2023, 9% of Bangladesh's transportation sector's greenhouse gas emissions came from road transportation. On 5 January 2025, Dhaka received a concerning Air Quality Index (AQI) score of 493(Hazardous). The moving road system can improve air quality, lower the risk of respiratory illnesses, and enhance public health in general.</p><p>Moving roads could be essential in eliminating traditional car emissions, which might drop Dhaka's particulate matter from 10.4% to nearly zero. This transit system could improve air quality and reduce reliance on fossil fuels by using renewable energy sources like solar power. Solar panels incorporated into the system's infrastructure would produce clean electricity, offering a renewable energy source to power the moving road system and further lowering emissions.</p><p>With the use of moving roads, pollution may be completely eradicated. It will eventually save many more lives. According to studies, even a 20% decrease in pollution levels might save between 1,200 and 3,500 deaths a year and avert millions of respiratory illnesses. This renewable energy-powered transportation system could lower greenhouse gas emissions, and improve the lives of Dhaka's residents.</p><p>Several cities and countries have implemented or explored moving roads and walkways to improve passenger transport and urban mobility. Dhaka proposes an elevated system to address traffic congestion and promote eco-friendly travel. Geneva models a car-free network of walkways capable of transporting 7,000 passengers per hour. Hong Kong's Central-Mid-Levels escalators connect hilly areas, while Charles de Gaulle Airport in France uses walkways for seamless passenger flow. These systems enhance mobility, reduce congestion, and support sustainable urban transport.</p><p>Traffic congestion drains $11.4 billion yearly from our economy. Losing 5.3 million working hours daily is an unacceptable waste of productivity. Moving roads generate numerous employment opportunities in the areas of development, maintenance, and system operations. By reducing reliance on motor vehicles, these roads also promote convenience, physical activity, stress reduction, mental well-being, social interactions, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>For example, as of 2017, Bangladesh's transportation and storage industry employed more than 5.2 million people, suggesting a solid basis for job growth in this sector. The workforce can be equipped for these new positions by implementing training programs on installing solar panels and integrating smart technology.</p><p>How much could possibly be saved while building a sustainable future in Dhaka? Because moving roads lowers the costs of traditional infrastructure, they provide a chance to spearhead the green revolution. The transit system also provides a chance to reduce land acquisition and related costs because of its raised design, in contrast to traditional highways, which cost between $55,000 and $100,000 per kilometer.</p><p>Moving roads offers a chance to incorporate green infrastructure into Dhaka's development, addressing both urban growth and unemployment. Globally, the renewable energy sector is expected to generate 24 million employments by 2030. By promoting sustainable solutions, Dhaka may capitalize on this trend. Moving roads promote Dhaka's transformation to greener urban surroundings and offers a chance to leverage local human resources, creating jobs.</p><p>Additionally, the moving roads would eliminate visual pollution by eliminating visually unappealing vehicles. By implementing the advanced transportation system, Dhaka may improve its economy and guarantee a cleaner, more sustainable future.</p><p>To sum up, Dhaka's moving road idea is a ground-breaking way to alleviate the city's terrible traffic, which costs $6.5 billion a year and consumes 8.2 million working hours per day. As vehicle speeds are now only 4.8 km/h, it is our joint responsibility to accept and put this cutting-edge technology into place. One of the most polluted cities in the world may greatly reduce pollutants and improve air quality by incorporating solar panels into the moving roads. Moreover, it has the potential to transform urban mobility, empower communities, and generate meaningful jobs. We all have to collaborate to take full advantage of this unique opportunity to make Dhaka a global leader in efficiency and sustainability.</p><p>(Authors: Dr. Sultan Ahmed is Associate Director at the Bangladesh Institute of Governance and Management (BIGM), former Secretary of the Power Division, former Chairman of Rajdhani Unnayan Kartripakkha (RAJUK), and former Director-General of the Department of Environment.

The country's geographical features, defined by the vast Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, create an extensive river system as a lifeline for trade, agriculture, and transportation. Riverine trade in Bangladesh is not just a remnant of history but an essential driver of the nation's economic growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bangladesh's rivers have historically been central to its civilisation and economy. The Indus Valley civilisation flourished thousands of years ago and was primarily based around river systems. The same holds for Bengal's later empires, such as the Mauryas and Guptas, who understood the strategic importance of rivers for trade and transportation. The rivers acted as natural highways, allowing goods to be transported efficiently across vast distances. This early reliance on waterways set the foundation for modern riverine trade.</p><p>Today, rivers like the Padma, Meghna, Jamuna, and many others play a pivotal role in Bangladesh's economic activities. Despite the rapid expansion of road and rail networks, river transport remains vital, especially for moving goods to remote rural areas. Most trade within the country and a significant portion of external trade is conducted via waterways. The low-cost nature of river transport, compared to road and rail, has made it particularly attractive for bulk goods like agricultural products, sand, timber, and coal, which are integral to the country's development.</p><p>One of the main advantages of riverine trade is its cost-effectiveness. A dense river network can relatively cheaply transport goods over long distances. This is particularly crucial for Bangladesh, where economic growth is often linked to the agricultural sector. Bangladesh's key agricultural regions, such as Khulna, Barisal, and Sylhet, are along the riverbanks. These regions rely heavily on river transport to get their goods to markets within the country and for export purposes. Furthermore, river transport reduces the strain on road networks, which are often congested and underdeveloped in rural areas.</p><p>For Bangladesh's economy, riverine trade is also crucial for the country's export sector. Bangladesh's major exports-such as ready-made garments, textiles, and food products-often use river transport to reach the country's seaports, such as Chittagong, one of the busiest ports in South Asia. The riverways connect inland production centres and the international market, enabling goods to be shipped to global destinations. Moreover, Bangladesh's strategic location, with its access to the Bay of Bengal and neighbouring countries like India, Myanmar, and China, provides it with opportunities to strengthen regional trade through river routes.</p><p>While riverine trade has been central to the economic life of Bangladesh for centuries, it is not without its challenges. Environmental factors, such as flooding and erosion, often disrupt river routes, making them less reliable. The seasonality of river water levels can cause significant fluctuations in transport capacity, leading to delays and higher costs during the dry season when rivers are shallow. Moreover, the increasing siltation of riverbeds and the encroachment of waterways by human settlements have led to the narrowing and changing of river routes, further complicating trade.</p><p>Another primary concern is river pollution, exacerbated by industrialisation and urbanisation. Polluted rivers hinder navigation and have broader implications for public health and the environment. This urgently requires infrastructure investments in river management and environmental conservation. Developing navigational aids, such as dredging and improving ports and terminals along the rivers, can mitigate some of these issues. However, these challenges must be addressed systematically to unlock the full potential of riverine trade.</p><p>In recent years, the Bangladeshi government has recognised the importance of riverine trade in its economic development strategy. The government has undertaken several initiatives to improve river navigability, including dredging programmes and developing modern river ports. The Inland Water Transport Authority (IWTA) has been working on expanding and upgrading the country's river transport infrastructure, including constructing new terminals and introducing more modern, efficient vessels.</p><p>In addition to government efforts, private sector involvement in river transport has also increased. Companies involved in shipping, logistics, and river transport have been innovating with new technology, improving the efficiency of operations and reducing environmental impacts. The rise of digital platforms and logistics apps has also made it easier to manage riverine trade, enabling businesses to track shipments in real time and optimise supply chains.</p><p>As Bangladesh continues to grow, riverine trade holds the potential to play an even more significant role in its economic future. The regional connectivity rivers offer is substantial for facilitating trade with neighbouring countries. Bangladesh's inland waterways provide a relatively low-cost, efficient option for cross-border trade, particularly with India, where river systems also play a central role. Moreover, Bangladesh's rivers can promote more significant trade with Myanmar and China through improved access to the Bay of Bengal.</p><p>In the future, Bangladesh could further capitalise on its riverine trade by developing a \"Blue Economy,\" which involves the sustainable use of water-based resources for economic growth. Expanding the use of waterways for tourism, fisheries, and renewable energy, alongside trade, could open up new avenues for growth. Developing water-based transport hubs and creating green infrastructure could provide sustainable solutions to urbanisation and climate change challenges.</p><p>Bangladesh's focus on sustainable development also offers an opportunity to integrate riverine trade with environmental goals. By adopting eco-friendly practices, such as using cleaner vessels and reducing the environmental impact of industrial activities along riverbanks, the country can ensure that river trade remains a viable and green option for future generations.</p><p>Moreover, adopting international standards and agreements on waterway management will ensure that riverine trade continues to thrive while minimising adverse environmental effects. Thus by wisely leveraging its river systems, Bangladesh can position itself as a critical player in the regional and global economy while ensuring that its rivers remain a vital part of its socio-economic fabric.</p><p>Dr. Matiur Rahman is a researcher and development worker.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

From deforestation and biodiversity loss to air and water pollution, the natural world is being transformed at an alarming rate. Sustainability is no longer a buzzword but a necessity. </p><p>At its core, environmental sustainability is about maintaining the balance of our natural ecosystems, ensuring that they continue to provide the essential services - clean air, water, fertile soils - that are the foundation of life on Earth. The vital role that vegetation plays in environmental sustainability and climate change adaptation. In an era where urbanisation and industrialisation have intensified challenges like air pollution, noise pollution, rising temperatures, and the urgent need to adapt to climate change, vegetation offers some of the most effective, natural solutions. Air pollution is a pressing global concern. From vehicle emissions to industrial pollutants, the air we breathe is increasingly becoming toxic. However, vegetation acts as a natural filter. Trees and plants absorb pollutants such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxides through their leaves. More significantly, they take in carbon dioxide (CO2), a major greenhouse gas - and through the process of photosynthesis, release oxygen back into the atmosphere. Forests, urban parks, and green spaces are indispensable in this regard, as they help reduce the concentration of particulate matter, lower carbon emissions, and improve overall air quality. Urban areas with higher tree density have been shown to have lower levels of particulate pollution, benefiting public health by reducing the occurrence of respiratory diseases and cardiovascular problems. Additionally, green spaces help mitigate the urban heat island effect, thereby reducing the formation of ground-level ozone, a harmful pollutant. Urbanisation has led to increased noise pollution, which has detrimental effects on human health, causing stress, sleep disturbances, and hearing loss. Vegetation provides an elegant solution. Trees and shrubs act as natural noise barriers, absorbing and deflecting sound waves. A well-planned green belt with dense vegetation can significantly reduce noise levels, particularly in urban areas and along highways. To evaluate the effectiveness of vegetation in reducing noise pollution at different distances, Center for Atmospheric Pollution Studies (CAPS) conducted a research in 2023 on measuring noise pollution in certain parks in Dhaka city to observe whether plants can reduce noise pollution. The research found that the average sound level in the presence of plants in the 4 parks of Dhaka city was measured at 85.9 decibels, while the average sound level in the absence of plants was 90.3 decibels. That means the presence of vegetation in the study area may be contributed to reduce sound pollution of 5 dBA approximately. In addition to acting as a physical barrier, vegetation also creates an atmosphere of tranquility, providing psychological relief from the stresses of city life. The rustling of leaves, the chirping of birds, and the overall ambiance of green spaces create a soothing auditory environment that counterbalances the harsh sounds of urbanisation. One of the critical challenges of climate change is the rise in global temperatures, which leads to heatwaves, droughts, and other extreme weather events. Vegetation plays a significant role in regulating temperatures, both on local and global scales. Trees and plants help lower the temperature of their surrounding environment through a process called transpiration, where water is absorbed by the roots, moves up through the plant, and evaporates from the leaves. This mechanism reduces the temperature of the air around us, much like how sweating cools the human body. According to CAPS study report 2024, Plant-populated areas of Dhaka get cold faster. The study was conducted among 60 locations by using Automatic temperature measuring device where the highest average temperature was found in Uttara-13 (44oC) one of the most commercial place and had less amount of vegetation. On the other hand, the least average temperature was found in Naya Paltan (34oC) had average amount of vegetation than other areas. It can be said that the vegetations are capable of reducing environmental temperature. Urban areas often experience what is known as the \"urban heat island\" effect, where concrete and asphalt absorb and retain heat, making cities significantly warmer than their rural surroundings. By increasing urban green spaces, planting trees, and integrating green roofs and vertical gardens, we can lower ambient temperatures and reduce the energy demand for air conditioning, which in turn reduces greenhouse gas emissions. Thus, climate change accelerates, societies must adapt to new environmental realities. Vegetation can play a central role in this adaptation. Trees and plants help stabilise soil, reducing the risk of landslides and erosion, particularly in areas prone to flooding. Coastal vegetation, such as mangroves, acts as a buffer against storm surges and rising sea levels, protecting both ecosystems and human settlements. Forests act as carbon sinks, absorbing more carbon dioxide than they emit, which helps mitigate the effects of climate change. The restoration and expansion of forests, especially in tropical regions, are vital for reducing atmospheric carbon levels. As we look toward building a more sustainable future, widespread plantation efforts will be critical. Planting trees is not merely about increasing green cover but involves the strategic selection of native species that support biodiversity, enhance ecosystem services, and promote resilience to climate extremes. It is essential that we view plantation initiatives as long-term investments in our planet's health. From community-led afforestation projects to governmental policies that encourage green infrastructure, every tree planted brings us one step closer to a more sustainable and resilient future. Vegetation is not just an aesthetic addition to our landscapes, it is the foundation of environmental health and a key ally in our fight against pollution, climate change, and the challenges of urbanisation. By prioritising the protection and expansion of our green spaces, we are not only addressing immediate environmental issues but also laying the groundwork for a sustainable, climate-resilient future. Let us continue to plant, nurture, and preserve the vegetation that sustains life on Earth. Together, we can ensure that future generations inherit a planet where clean air, cooler temperatures, and vibrant ecosystems are not the exception but the norm.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

The countries in these regions &amp;#8211; spanning across Latin America, Africa, and parts of Asia &amp;#8211; face unique challenges and opportunities based on whether the next US president will be Donald Trump or Kamala Harris. The candidates distinct approaches to international relations, trade, security, and diplomacy will shape the Global Souths future in numerous ways.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Trump administration would likely return to a more protectionist economic stance, with substantial tariffs potentially imposed on imports, particularly from China, and possibly affecting goods from other countries as well. This shift could disrupt trade relations for several countries in Southeast Asia and Latin America that heavily rely on exports to the US Industries such as textiles, electronics, and agriculture, which serve as crucial economic pillars in these regions, could face significant challenges due to supply chain disruptions and reduced US demand. This outcome might lead to a slowdown in economic growth, a reduction in job opportunities, and increased economic volatility.</p><p>Conversely, Kamala Harris is expected to uphold many of the Biden administrations &amp;#8220;Worker-Centric&amp;#8221; trade policies that emphasize collaboration, multilateralism, and targeted sanctions rather than sweeping tariffs. Harris would likely support initiatives such as the Indo-Pacific Economic Framework, promoting economic engagement with nations in the Global South. This approach could offer more stability and help Global South countries maintain trade partnerships with the US, reducing the risks of sudden disruptions that a Trump presidency might bring.</p><p>The ongoing US-China rivalry is a central issue for many nations in the Global South, particularly in Southeast Asia, where countries often try to balance their economic relations with China and security ties with the US. A Trump presidency is expected to intensify pressure on these countries to align more closely with the US in its competition with China. Trumps confrontational approach to China would make it harder for Southeast Asian nations to maintain a balanced stance, potentially leading to greater geopolitical instability in the region.</p><p>Kamala, on the other hand, would likely pursue a competitive stance toward China but through a consultative, less confrontational approach. Her policy would give Global South nations more flexibility to navigate the US-China rivalry without needing to choose one side. This balanced approach could benefit countries like India, the Philippines, and other nations in the Indo-Pacific region, allowing them to engage with both superpowers on their terms while leveraging their strategic importance in the region.</p><p>A Trump presidency is likely to emphasize a transactional approach to security alliances, as seen during his previous term, where he pressed allies like Japan and South Korea for greater financial contributions. A similar stance could reduce US security commitments to countries in the Global South, which might prompt these nations to strengthen their defense capabilities independently. For instance, South Korea has considered enhancing its nuclear capabilities as a countermeasure if US support declines. Trump would stop all US military engagement globally, especially in Ukraine and Israel. In regions like North Atlantic Nations, Southeast Asia and Africa, Trumps approach could mean reduced US security assistance, prompting countries to seek new security partnerships or reassess their defense strategies.</p><p>In contrast, Kamalas administration would likely continue to support security alliances, following the Biden administrations approach of bolstering alliances through cooperation. Her approach would prioritize stability, especially in sensitive regions like the Indo-Pacific and the Middle East, offering countries in the Global South a more predictable security relationship with the US. For Africa and Latin America, Kamalas administration could continue supporting counterterrorism, anti-narcotics operations, and defense collaborations, ensuring that US military engagement in these areas remains robust.</p><p>The influence of US soft power in the Global South would diverge depending on which candidate takes office. Trumps blunt and at times isolationist approach has previously undermined trust among global leaders, reducing the USs diplomatic reach in some areas. Many leaders in the Global South may be wary of aligning too closely with a Trump-led US due to his tendency to withdraw from international institutions and agreements. Although some authoritarian regimes might appreciate Trumps less interventionist stance, others could view his approach as too unpredictable, potentially straining diplomatic ties.</p><p>A Kamala Harris administration would likely prioritize multilateral diplomacy, particularly on issues like climate change, which disproportionately affect countries in the Global South. By engaging with these nations on global challenges, Kamala could strengthen diplomatic ties and reinforce US influence through a more inclusive approach. This multilateral approach could be attractive to Global South countries, which would benefit from participating in international platforms that address shared issues and promote stability.</p><p>Under Trump, India and the Philippines might deepen their ties with the US, though their relations would hinge on different factors. Trumps rapport with Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi could strengthen the bilateral relationship, while Southeast Asian countries might face more economic challenges due to potential tariffs. A Kamala presidency, however, could offer a more structured diplomatic route, potentially benefiting India due to her South Asian heritage. Southeast Asian nations may find Harriss policies more predictable, allowing them to continue diversifying trade partnerships without severe disruptions.</p><p>Trumps policies on immigration could strain diplomatic ties in Latin America, while economic disruptions from potential tariffs might push countries in the region to seek alternative trade partners or bolster regional alliances. Kamalas approach would likely emphasize sustainable development initiatives, infrastructure investment, and climate action, aligning well with Latin American priorities. Her policies could encourage economic cooperation focused on social and environmental goals, strengthening the regions resilience.</p><p>In the Middle East, Trumps strong alliances with countries like Israel could lead to policies that prioritize US allies, potentially increasing punitive measures against Iran. The abandonment of multilateral diplomacy could stop conflicts and Trump would exert political pressure for Two State solution. Kamala, on the other hand, would likely adopt a more balanced approach, fostering conflict while supporting US alliances. For Africa, Kamalas presidency could continue anti-terrorism initiatives, supporting security partnerships that contribute to stability in the region. Her focus on diplomatic engagement and development assistance would likely strengthen ties with African nations, facilitating the US defense industrial complex to profit.</p><p>The global economic landscape could shift significantly depending on the outcome of the US presidential election. Trumps protectionist policies and tariffs could destabilize international trade, particularly affecting export-driven economies in the Global South. Although such disruptions might encourage countries to innovate and diversify their supply chains, they could also dampen economic growth, especially in regions like Southeast Asia and Latin America.</p><p>A Kamala Harris presidency would probably focus on initiatives that promote the digital economy and environmental sustainability, benefiting Global South countries investing in green technology and digital infrastructure. Her administration might pursue trade agreements centered on critical minerals, technology, and sustainable development, supporting the long-term growth of nations focusing on green infrastructure.</p><p>The impact of the 2025 US presidential election on the Global South will depend heavily on whether Donald Trump or Kamala Harris becomes president. A Trump administration might create a more transactional, unpredictable environment, with aggressive economic protectionism and intensified US-China competition likely causing disruptions. This scenario could strain alliances and heighten diplomatic challenges for the Global South.</p><p>On the other hand, Kamalas approach would offer a more predictable and consultative framework, allowing Global South nations to engage with the US without needing to make drastic adjustments. Her focus on multilateral diplomacy and environmental initiatives could foster stability, creating opportunities for economic growth and resilient partnerships. However, the conflict-ridden nations will be pushed towards more volatile situations by Harriss administration.</p><p>In anticipation of these potential shifts, countries in the Global South may seek new partnerships, prioritize stability-oriented policies, and weigh the costs and benefits of engagement with the US, striving for adaptability and resilience in an increasingly polarized world.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

Central to this transformation is the ongoing Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with India, which is now poised to reflect the Labour Partys strong emphasis on environmental sustainability and climate action. Under the leadership of Keir Starmer, the Labour Party is determined to integrate stringent environmental standards into its trade agreements, potentially reshaping the contours of the UK-India FTA.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Labour Partys victory marks a renewed focus on climate change as a cornerstone of UK policy. Keir Starmer has been vocal about the partys ambitious climate goals, which include decarbonizing the UK economy by 2030, significantly ahead of the 2050 target set by previous governments. This ambition is encapsulated in Labours Green New Deal, a comprehensive policy framework aimed at accelerating the UKs transition to a low-carbon economy.</p><p>Central to this agenda is the implementation of the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), a policy designed to impose a carbon tax on imported goods based on their carbon content. The CBAM is intended to prevent carbon leakage by ensuring that foreign producers face the same carbon pricing as domestic industries. This policy is expected to have a profound impact on the UKs trade relationships, including the ongoing negotiations with India.</p><p>Labours commitment to environmental sustainability is further reinforced by the UKs Climate Change Act 2008, which mandates that the country achieve net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. The Labour government is determined to not only meet but exceed these targets, with plans to invest heavily in renewable energy, enforce stricter regulations on carbon emissions, and embed sustainability into all aspects of its economic and trade policies.</p><p>The Labour Partys green agenda is expected to significantly influence the ongoing FTA negotiations with India. Traditionally, FTAs focus on reducing tariffs and trade barriers to facilitate commerce. However, under Labours leadership, the UK-India FTA is likely to incorporate climate-related provisions, reflecting the partys commitment to environmental sustainability.</p><p>This shift presents both challenges and opportunities for India. On one hand, Indias economy remains heavily dependent on fossil fuels, with coal accounting for a significant portion of its energy mix. This dependence poses a challenge in aligning with Labours stringent environmental requirements. The transition to greener energy sources will require substantial investments, and Indias economic growth could be affected by the demands of meeting the UKs environmental standards.</p><p>On the other hand, India has made notable progress in renewable energy and carbon reduction efforts. The country is one of the worlds largest producers of renewable energy, with significant investments in solar and wind power. This progress positions India as a valuable partner for the UK in achieving mutual sustainability goals.</p><p>The CBAM is a pivotal element of Labours climate policy, designed to level the playing field for domestic industries by imposing a carbon tax on imported goods based on their carbon content. This policy ensures that foreign producers, including those in India, are subject to the same carbon pricing as UK industries, thereby preventing carbon leakage and promoting global emission reductions.</p><p>For India, the CBAM poses significant challenges, particularly for carbon-intensive industries such as steel, aluminium, and cement. As the worlds second-largest steel producer, India could face higher production costs under the CBAM, potentially impacting its competitiveness in the UK market. This could lead to a reduction in Indias exports of these goods to the UK, which in turn could affect the broader economic relationship between the two countries.</p><p>However, the CBAM also presents opportunities for India to modernize its industries and adopt cleaner technologies. By investing in low-carbon production methods, Indian industries could not only comply with the CBAM but also gain a competitive edge in the global market. The Indian government may need to offer subsidies or incentives to support industries in this transition, ensuring that they remain competitive while also contributing to global emission reduction efforts.</p><p>Despite the challenges posed by the CBAM, the Labour governments focus on renewable energy and green technologies could open doors for enhanced collaboration between the UK and India. Indias growing renewable energy market, coupled with its commitment to expanding its green infrastructure, positions it as an ideal partner for the UK in advancing mutual sustainability goals.</p><p>Both countries stand to benefit from increased cooperation in sectors such as solar energy, wind power, and electric mobility. The UK, with its advanced technology and expertise in renewable energy, can play a crucial role in supporting Indias transition to a greener economy. In return, Indias large and rapidly growing market offers significant opportunities for UK businesses involved in green technology and sustainable development.</p><p>Moreover, by aligning trade policies with environmental objectives, the UK and India can ensure that their economic progress is achieved in a responsible and sustainable manner. This approach not only supports the global fight against climate change but also strengthens the economic relationship between the two countries, paving the way for a more resilient and sustainable future.</p><p>The Labour Partys leadership marks a new chapter in the UKs approach to international trade, with a clear focus on embedding environmental sustainability into its economic policies. The ongoing negotiations for the UK-India FTA are likely to reflect this shift, with climate-related provisions playing a central role in the agreement.</p><p>While the transition to greener trade practices presents challenges, particularly for Indias carbon-intensive industries, it also offers opportunities for collaboration and innovation. By working together, the UK and India can not only strengthen their economic ties but also contribute to the global effort to combat climate change.</p><p>As the UK pushes for greener economic practices, the UK-India FTA will need to strike a delicate balance between facilitating trade and enforcing stringent environmental standards. Under Labours leadership, this trade deal is set to be a key instrument in advancing the global green agenda, heralding a new era of sustainable economic cooperation between the UK and India.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Weekly Blitz .

The relentless march of global warming, marked by more frequent and severe natural disasters, threatens not just our environment but the very fabric of our economic systems. To ensure a resilient future, we must undertake a holistic approach to embed sustainability and climate resilience at the core of our economic policies and practices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bangladesh stands at a critical juncture where the realities of climate change threaten to derail its economic progress. As one of the most climate-vulnerable countries in the world, Bangladesh faces rising sea levels, more frequent and severe cyclones, and unpredictable rainfall patterns. These challenges pose significant risks to the nation's agriculture, infrastructure, and overall economic stability. To safeguard our future, we must urgently climate-proof our economy through strategic investments and policy reforms.</p><p>Bangladesh's reliance on fossil fuels for energy production exacerbates its vulnerability to climate change. Transitioning to renewable energy sources such as solar, wind, and biomass is not only environmentally sustainable but also economically prudent. By investing in large-scale renewable energy projects, the government can reduce greenhouse gas emissions, create green jobs, and decrease dependence on imported fossil fuels. Initiatives like the Solar Home System program, which has already brought solar energy to millions of rural households, should be expanded and supported with robust policy incentives.</p><p>One of the most effective ways to climate-proof our economy is by investing in green infrastructure. This includes the development of renewable energy sources such as wind, solar, and hydroelectric power, which can reduce our dependence on fossil fuels and mitigate greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, enhancing urban infrastructure to withstand extreme weather events - through flood defenses, green roofs, and permeable pavements - can protect communities and reduce the economic toll of natural disasters.</p><p>A shift from a linear to a circular economy is crucial. In a circular economy, resources are reused, recycled, and repurposed, minimising waste and reducing environmental impact. This not only conserves resources but also fosters innovation and creates new economic opportunities. Companies that embrace circular principles can reduce costs, improve efficiency, and enhance their competitiveness in a rapidly changing market landscape.</p><p>With a vast coastline and densely populated cities, Bangladesh must prioritise the fortification of its coastal and urban infrastructure. Constructing and maintaining embankments, cyclone shelters, and flood defenses are critical to protecting vulnerable communities from the impacts of rising sea levels and extreme weather events. In urban areas, investments in resilient infrastructure such as improved drainage systems, green spaces, and disaster-resistant buildings can mitigate the effects of urban flooding and heatwaves. Collaborative efforts between the government, private sector, and international partners will be essential to mobilize the necessary resources and expertise.</p><p>Agriculture is the backbone of Bangladesh's economy, employing a significant portion of the population and contributing to food security. However, the sector is highly susceptible to climate impacts. To enhance resilience, farmers must be equipped with knowledge and tools for climate-smart agriculture practices. This includes adopting drought-resistant crop varieties, efficient water management techniques, and integrated pest management. Extension services should be strengthened to provide timely weather forecasts, training, and access to modern agricultural technologies. Furthermore, financial support in the form of crop insurance and subsidies for sustainable practices can help farmers withstand climate shocks.</p><p>Effective policy frameworks are crucial for guiding climate resilience efforts. The Bangladesh Climate Change Strategy and Action Plan (BCCSAP) provides a comprehensive roadmap, but its implementation must be accelerated and adequately funded. Enforcing regulations that limit deforestation, promote reforestation, and protect natural habitats can enhance the country's natural defenses against climate impacts. Additionally, integrating climate risk assessments into national development planning will ensure that all economic activities are aligned with sustainability goals.</p><p>Building a climate-resilient economy requires an informed and engaged citizenry. Education systems should incorporate climate change topics to raise awareness from a young age. Public awareness campaigns can highlight the importance of sustainable practices and encourage community participation in resilience-building activities. Empowering local communities with knowledge and resources to take proactive measures can significantly enhance collective resilience.</p><p>Investing in research and development is key to finding innovative solutions to climate challenges. Universities, research institutions, and the private sector should collaborate on projects that explore new technologies and practices for climate adaptation and mitigation. Government support for research in renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and disaster management can lead to breakthroughs that strengthen the economy and protect the environment.</p><p>Financial mechanisms must be in place to support climate resilience initiatives. Establishing a dedicated climate resilience fund, supported by both national and international contributions, can provide the necessary capital for large-scale projects. Microfinance institutions can offer loans to small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) for adopting sustainable practices. Additionally, climate risk insurance schemes can protect businesses and individuals from the financial losses associated with climate-related disasters.</p><p>Effective disaster preparedness and response mechanisms are vital for minimising the economic impact of climate-related events. Establishing early warning systems, conducting regular disaster drills, and creating efficient evacuation plans can save lives and reduce economic losses. Training local communities in disaster response and providing necessary resources can enhance their ability to cope with emergencies. Additionally, developing a comprehensive disaster management strategy that includes rehabilitation and reconstruction plans will ensure a swift recovery and reduce long-term economic disruptions.</p><p>Bangladesh's fisheries and aquaculture sectors are crucial for food security and livelihoods but are threatened by climate change. Promoting sustainable practices in these sectors can enhance their resilience. Implementing community-based fisheries management, protecting mangrove forests, and adopting climate-resilient aquaculture techniques can help sustain fish populations and protect coastal communities. Providing training and resources to fishers and aquaculture farmers can improve their adaptive capacity and ensure the long-term viability of these important sectors.</p><p>The private sector has a significant role to play in climate-proofing the economy. Encouraging businesses to adopt sustainable practices, invest in green technologies, and disclose climate-related risks can drive substantial progress. Public-private partnerships can mobilise resources and expertise for climate resilience projects. Incentivising corporate social responsibility initiatives focused on climate adaptation and mitigation can also contribute to building a resilient economy. Furthermore, fostering a culture of innovation within the private sector can lead to the development of new products and services that support climate resilience.</p><p>Social resilience is a key component of economic resilience. Ensuring that vulnerable populations, including women, children, and marginalised communities have access to resources and opportunities is essential for building a resilient society. Social protection programmes, such as conditional cash transfers and employment guarantee schemes, can provide a safety net during climate shocks. Promoting gender equality and empowering women to participate in decision-making processes can enhance community resilience. Strengthening social cohesion through community-based initiatives and participatory approaches can also foster collective action and support climate adaptation efforts.</p><p>Climate-proofing Bangladesh's economy is not merely an option but a necessity for ensuring long-term prosperity and security. By harnessing renewable energy, strengthening infrastructure, promoting climate-resilient agriculture, implementing robust policies, enhancing education and public awareness, fostering innovation, securing financial resilience, strengthening disaster preparedness, promoting sustainable fisheries, encouraging private sector engagement, and building social resilience, we can build an economy that withstands the challenges of climate change. The time to act is now, and with concerted effort and unwavering commitment, Bangladesh can emerge as a leader in climate resilience, setting an example for other vulnerable nations.</p><p>Tanvir Ahmad, climate change &amp; public health researcher.</p><p>[email protected]</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

No, not to the time of foragers and hunters, but the 1970s and 80s. This period saw the birth of environmental consciousness in the global north, where issues like deforestation, pollution, and resource depletion began to gain traction, with the 1987 Brundtland Report, which coined the term 'sustainable development', introducing the notion that economic growth should not come at the expense of future generations. However, it was the global financial crisis of 2008 that really pushed the Green Economy into the spotlight.</p><p>As economies around the world crumbled, the idea of rebuilding in a way that also addressed environmental concerns started to gain traction. In 2012, the concept was further solidified at the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (Rio+20), where the Green Economy was recognized as a critical strategy for achieving sustainable development. By 2023, the urgency to transition to a Green Economy is no longer just a policy preference - it is it is a survival strategy.</p><p>With the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) warning that global temperatures could exceed the 1.5degC threshold by 2035, and with one million species at risk of extinction, the stakes could not be higher.</p><p>In addition, biodiversity is declining at an unprecedented rate, with one million species at risk of extinction (UN, 2022). These are not just numbers; they are harbingers of the hunger games, a future where food, water, and clean air could become scarce commodities. Sounds voodoo? Mumbo jumbo?</p><p>The Global Footprint Network of 2023 reports that we now consume the equivalent of 1.8 piles of earth annually to maintain our lifestyles, and this is more than just a statistic - it is a clear indicator that we are writing cheques our planet can cash.</p><p>The world is grappling with climate change, biodiversity loss, and resource depletion - issues that make the plot of 'Mad Max: Fury Road' look like a comfy Sunday picnic.</p><p>Fear not, men. You have a messiah. The Green Economy offers a pathway to mitigate these crises by transforming how we produce, consume, and live.</p><p>By prioritizing renewable energy, sustainable agriculture, and circular economy practices, the Green Economy aims to create a system where economic activity enhances, rather than depletes, the planet's natural capital.</p><p>Moreover, the Green Economy is increasingly seen as a critical driver of social equity. The current economic model has exacerbated inequalities, both within and between countries. The Green Economy, by focusing on inclusivity and equitable resource distribution, offers a more just and sustainable alternative.</p><p>For instance, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimates that the Green Economy could create 24 million new jobs by 2030, primarily in sectors like renewable energy, energy efficiency, and sustainable agriculture, while also reducing poverty and improving health outcomes (ILO, 2019)</p><p>However, what exactly does a Green Economy look like? Is it about slapping solar panels on every rooftop and calling it a day? Not quite. It is built on principles that go beyond just environmental sustainability. It is about inclusivity, ensuring that economic benefits are shared across society, particularly among the marginalized. It is about efficiency - using resources in a way that minimizes waste and maximizes value. It is about resilience, creating systems that can withstand environmental and economic shocks. It is about interconnectedness, recognizing that the economy, society, and the environment are interconnected.</p><p>This is not just a theoretical exercise in a seminar. It is about tweaking the rules of the game so that everyone - including the planet - can win. It is less about radical change and more about intelligent evolution.</p><p>The transition to a 'Green Economy' is already underway in many parts of the world, driven by both necessity and innovation. Change is inevitable, and resistance is futile.</p><p>In reality, transitioning to a 'Green Economy' is horrendous! It requires overcoming significant challenges, from entrenched fossil fuel interests to the need for massive infrastructure investments.</p><p>It is like turning a cruise ship - slow, cumbersome, and requiring a lot of coordinated effort. However, if the global community can pull it off, the rewards - both economic and environmental - could be immense.</p><p>The European Union (EU) has been at the forefront of the global push towards a Green Economy. The European Green Deal, launched in 2019, is perhaps the most ambitious plan to date. The EU aims to become the first carbon-neutral continent by 2050, with intermediate targets to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 55% by 2030 compared to 1990 levels (European Commission, 2022).</p><p>This plan includes a mix of regulatory measures, investments, and policy reforms aimed at transforming sectors such as energy, agriculture, and transportation.</p><p>The EU is also implementing the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM), which is set to be fully implemented by 2026. It is one of the most innovative trade policies aimed at promoting green economic growth. It is designed to prevent 'carbon leakage' by imposing tariffs on imports from countries with lower environmental standards. This policy not only incentivizes green production within the EU but also pressures trading partners to adopt more sustainable practices (European Commission, 2023).</p><p>This could create a ripple effect, leading to higher environmental standards globally. However, the CBAM has also sparked concerns about protectionism and the potential for trade disputes, particularly with developing countries that may struggle to meet the EU's stringent environmental standards.</p><p>The United States, under the Biden administration, has rejoined the Paris Agreement and set ambitious climate goals, including achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 (The White House, 2021).</p><p>The administration's Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, allocates $369 billion to clean energy and climate initiatives, making it the most significant investment in green technology in U.S. history (Congressional Budget Office, 2022).</p><p>The U.S. is also promoting green trade through the U.S.-Mexico-Canada Agreement (USMCA), which includes provisions for environmental protection and sustainable trade practices. However, the country faces significant challenges, including political polarization (hello fracking) and the continued influence of fossil fuel industries.</p><p>China, often criticized for its environmental record, is also making significant strides towards a Green Economy. As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, China's actions are critical to global climate goals.</p><p>The country has pledged to peak its carbon emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060 (Xinhua, 2023). To meet these targets, China is investing heavily in renewable energy, electric vehicles, and green infrastructure.</p><p>In 2022 alone, China added more than 100 gigawatts of solar power capacity, accounting for nearly 40% of the global total (BloombergNEF, 2023) and over 45% of global wind turbine production (International Renewable Energy Agency, 2023).</p><p>The country is also leading the world in the production and export of electric vehicles, with EV sales surpassing 6 million units in 2022 (International Energy Agency, 2023).</p><p>China's reliance on coal remains a significant challenge, and its transition to a Green Economy will require substantial efforts to phase out fossil fuels. By investing heavily in renewable energy and exporting these technologies to other countries, China is not only greening its economy but also driving the global transition to renewable energy (IEA, 2020). However, China's dominance in the renewable energy market has also led to trade tensions, particularly with the United States.</p><p>In 2022, the U.S. imposed tariffs on Chinese solar panels, citing concerns about unfair trade practices and the need to protect domestic industries (Office of the United States Trade Representative, 2022).</p><p>These trade tensions highlight the complexities of promoting a Green Economy in a globalized world, where economic interests and environmental goals can sometimes conflict.</p><p>As for developing countries, the transition to a Green Economy presents both opportunities and challenges. On the one hand, these countries have the chance to leapfrog traditional, carbon-intensive development pathways and adopt more sustainable practices. They face significant barriers, including limited financial resources, lack of access to green technologies, and vulnerability to climate change. International cooperation and financial support will be crucial in helping developing countries transition to a Green Economy.</p><p>The Green Climate Fund, established under the UNFCCC, aims to mobilize $100 billion annually by 2025 to support climate action in developing countries (UNFCCC, 2023). However, as of 2023, only $80 billion has been pledged, highlighting the need for more robust financial commitments from developed countries.</p><p>Clearly, the Green Economy is not just a fad - it is its future since now you realize trading is lurking at the corner!</p><p>...........(to be continued)</p><p>(The writer is an engineer turned finance and ESG enthusiast, trying to drink gulps from the immensely stimulating ocean of finance/economics/ESG and move to greener pastures to shift from his tedious job in the capital market.

As temperatures rise and heatwaves become more frequent and severe, the economic repercussions are profound, affecting agriculture, industry, health, infrastructure, and overall productivity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agricultural sector, which employs a substantial portion of the population in Bangladesh, bears the brunt of heatwave-induced damages. Prolonged periods of extreme heat lead to water stress, reduced soil moisture, and heat-related stress on crops.</p><p>Staple crops such as rice, wheat, and jute are particularly vulnerable, with heatwaves disrupting planting schedules, affecting yields, and increasing pest infestations. The economic losses incurred by farmers due to crop failures, reduced productivity, and increased input costs during heat waves contribute to food insecurity and rural livelihood challenges.</p><p>Livestock farming also faces significant economic strains during heatwaves. Heat stress in animals reduces milk production, weight loss, and increased mortality rates. Farmers incur losses in terms of lower marketable yields, decreased quality of animal products, and heightened healthcare expenses for livestock management. The cumulative impact on the livestock sector increases the economic burden on rural communities and agricultural stakeholders.</p><p>The industrial and manufacturing sectors experience disruptions and productivity losses during heatwaves. High temperatures can lead to equipment failures, reduced efficiency in production processes, and increased energy consumption for cooling and ventilation. Industries reliant on outdoor labour, such as construction, face challenges in worker safety, reduced productivity, and project delays. The economic costs associated with downtime, repairs, and operational inefficiencies during heatwaves contribute to financial strain for businesses and hinder economic growth.</p><p>The energy sector grapples with heightened demand for cooling services during heatwaves, leading to power shortages, load shedding, and strain on electricity grids. Increased usage of air conditioning units and cooling appliances exacerbates energy consumption and carbon emissions, further amplifying the environmental footprint of heatwave impacts. The economic implications include higher electricity bills for consumers, increased operational costs for utilities, and challenges in meeting peak demand without compromising grid stability.</p><p>The tourism and hospitality industry, a significant contributor to Bangladesh's economy, faces challenges during heatwaves. High temperatures deter domestic and international tourists, impacting hotel occupancy rates, tourism revenues, and related businesses such as restaurants, transportation, and recreational activities. Heat-related discomfort and health concerns among tourists further dampen the tourism sector's economic prospects during peak heatwave periods.</p><p>Healthcare expenditures escalate during heatwaves due to increased heat-related illnesses, hospital admissions, and emergency healthcare services. The economic burden on the healthcare sector includes costs associated with treatment, medical supplies, capacity expansion to cope with patient influx, and public health campaigns to raise awareness about heat-related risks. The strain on healthcare infrastructure and resources during heatwaves highlights the need for adaptive measures and investment in climate-resilient healthcare systems.</p><p>Infrastructure vulnerabilities are exacerbated by heatwaves, leading to economic losses in terms of damage to roads, bridges, buildings, and utilities. Heat-induced stresses on infrastructure materials, such as asphalt roads and concrete structures, contribute to deterioration, maintenance challenges, and increased repair costs. The economic impact extends to transportation disruptions, supply chain interruptions, and reduced operational efficiency across sectors reliant on robust infrastructure networks.</p><p>Small and medium enterprises (SMEs), a vital engine of economic growth and employment generation, face unique challenges during heat waves. SMEs operating in sectors sensitive to climate conditions, such as agriculture, textiles, and food processing, experience disruptions in production, supply chain constraints, and market uncertainties. The economic strain on SMEs includes revenue losses, liquidity challenges, and difficulties accessing financing and insurance to cope with heatwave-related risks.</p><p>To address the economic challenges posed by excessive heatwaves in Bangladesh, a multi-faceted approach is essential, encompassing climate adaptation, resilience-building measures, policy interventions, and stakeholder collaboration.</p><p>Investments in climate-resilient agriculture are paramount to enhancing agricultural productivity and reducing vulnerability to heatwave impacts. This includes promoting drought-resistant crop varieties, efficient irrigation systems, soil moisture conservation techniques, and early warning systems for weather-related risks. Financial incentives, credit facilities, and insurance schemes tailored to agricultural resilience can support farmers in adopting climate-smart practices and mitigating economic losses during heat waves.</p><p>Promoting renewable energy sources and efficiency measures can alleviate pressure on the energy sector during heatwaves. Investments in solar power, wind energy, and other renewable technologies diversify the energy mix, reduce carbon emissions, and enhance energy security. Energy conservation initiatives, demand-side management programs, and public awareness campaigns on sustainable energy practices contribute to economic savings, resilience, and environmental sustainability.</p><p>Climate-resilient infrastructure development is critical for mitigating heatwave impacts on transportation, utilities, and urban areas. This includes incorporating heat-resistant materials, green infrastructure, urban cooling strategies, and climate-responsive design standards in infrastructure projects. Improved drainage systems, flood protection measures, and resilient building codes enhance infrastructure resilience to extreme weather events, including heatwaves, reducing economic losses and improving community well-being.</p><p>Public health interventions are crucial in reducing healthcare costs and mitigating heat-related health risks. Heat-health action plans, early warning systems, heatwave preparedness training for healthcare professionals, and community outreach programs raise awareness about heat-related illnesses and promote adaptive behaviours. Accessible healthcare services, cooling centers, and emergency response mechanisms ensure timely interventions and reduce the economic burden of heatwave-induced healthcare demands.</p><p>Capacity-building and knowledge-sharing initiatives empower communities, businesses, and policymakers to address heatwave challenges effectively. Training programmes on climate resilience, disaster risk management, heat stress mitigation, and business continuity planning equip stakeholders with skills and resources to adapt to heatwave impacts. Knowledge exchange platforms, research partnerships, and best practice sharing facilitate learning and innovation in heatwave resilience strategies.</p><p>Policy frameworks must integrate heatwave resilience into national development agendas, sectoral plans, and regulatory frameworks. This includes mainstreaming climate adaptation, disaster risk reduction, and heatwave management considerations across policy domains. Incentives for climate-smart investments, regulatory incentives for energy efficiency, and fiscal measures to support vulnerable sectors enhance economic resilience to heatwaves and promote sustainable development.</p><p>International cooperation and partnerships are instrumental in addressing transboundary challenges posed by heat waves and climate change. Collaborative initiatives on technology transfer, capacity building, finance mobilisation, and knowledge exchange strengthen resilience efforts and foster global solidarity. Engagement with international organisations, donor agencies, research institutions, and private sector partners leverages resources and expertise to support Bangladesh's efforts in building a climate-resilient economy.</p><p>The economic toll of excessive heatwaves in Bangladesh underscores the urgent need for comprehensive and proactive strategies to build resilience, mitigate risks, and promote sustainable development. By investing in climate adaptation, renewable energy, resilient infrastructure, public health, and stakeholder engagement, Bangladesh can navigate the challenges posed by heat waves and build a more resilient and prosperous future for its economy and society.</p><p>Dr Matiur Rahman is researcher and development worker.

However, theres an additional, often overlooked, factor making these cities even more susceptible to the encroaching waters: land subsidence. Scientists at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography, including Pei-Chin Wu, Meng (Matt) Wei, and Steven DHondt, in collaboration with the US Geological Survey, have conducted research revealing that land is sinking at a faster rate than sea levels are rising in numerous coastal cities worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global projections are alarming, indicating a mean sea level rise of at least one-foot above year-2000 levels by the end of the century. This, combined with land subsidence, poses a severe threat to the resilience of coastal cities. To understand the extent of the problem, the researchers used radar images of the Earths surface collected from orbiting satellites to measure subsidence rates in 99 coastal cities across the globe.</p><p>The findings highlight the highly variable nature of subsidence rates within cities and from city to city. If these rates persist, many metropolises could face flooding much sooner than predicted by existing sea level rise models. Notably, cities in South, Southeast, and East Asia are experiencing the most rapid rates of subsidence. Jakarta, Indonesia, serves as a stark example, prompting the country to relocate its capital to Nusantara, approximately 800 miles away, due to the alarming sinking of Jakarta, primarily caused by groundwater extraction.</p><p>However, land subsidence is not limited to Asia. Research conducted in collaboration with Tom Parsons of the US Geological Survey reveals that even the iconic New York City is not immune. The city is sinking between 1 to 4 centimeters per year, a result of a combination of glacial rebound and the immense weight of its over 1 million buildings. This subsidence exacerbates the citys vulnerability to coastal storms, especially considering the projected sea level rise of 8 to 30 inches by 2050.</p><p>In the United States, many cities on the Atlantic coast, primarily affected by glacial rebound, are experiencing subsidence. Even if the rate seems relatively low at minus-1 millimeter per year, it is a factor that should not be ignored. Cities in the Gulf of Mexico, such as Houston and New Orleans, also face the threat of subsidence, further complicating the challenge of adapting to rising sea levels.</p><p>Governments worldwide are grappling with the complex challenge of mitigating subsidence in coastal areas, recognizing the shared global challenge of preparing for a growing flooding hazard. As researchers continue to refine their understanding, incorporating technologies like machine learning to enhance monitoring capabilities, they stress the importance of city planners, emergency managers, and decision-makers accounting for subsidence in their current plans. The urgency lies in preparing for the impacts of rising sea levels that, when combined with subsidence, present an imminent and escalating threat to the future resilience of coastal cities.</p><p>As Jakarta, the current capital of Indonesia, faces the alarming issue of sinking due to land subsidence caused by factors like excessive groundwater extraction, the government has already taken a significant step by planning to relocate the capital to Nusantara, approximately 800 miles away. However, beyond this relocation, there are several alternative strategies and measures Indonesia can consider to address the challenges posed by the sinking capital:</p><p>Enforce strict regulations on groundwater extraction to prevent further subsidence. Implement sustainable groundwater management practices, including monitoring and controlling extraction rates, promoting water conservation, and encouraging the use of alternative water sources.</p><p>Develop and implement resilient infrastructure in Jakarta and other vulnerable areas. This includes constructing buildings on stilts, designing flood-resistant structures, and implementing effective drainage systems to manage excess water during heavy rains.</p><p>Introduce green infrastructure initiatives, such as creating green spaces, urban parks, and permeable surfaces, to absorb excess water and mitigate the impact of subsidence. Green roofs and permeable pavements can help in reducing surface runoff and improving overall urban resilience.</p><p>Utilize advanced technologies, including satellite-based monitoring and geospatial data analysis, to continuously monitor land subsidence. Early warning systems can provide real-time data, allowing authorities to respond promptly to subsidence-related challenges and minimize potential damages.</p><p>Integrate climate-resilient urban planning practices to address both land subsidence and sea-level rise. Plan developments with consideration for future climate scenarios, incorporating elevated structures, flood barriers, and other adaptive measures to safeguard against the impacts of sinking land and rising seas.</p><p>Promote sustainable and well-planned urban development to reduce the overall environmental impact.

However, theres an additional, often overlooked, factor making these cities even more susceptible to the encroaching waters: land subsidence. Scientists at the University of Rhode Island Graduate School of Oceanography, including Pei-Chin Wu, Meng (Matt) Wei, and Steven DHondt, in collaboration with the US Geological Survey, have conducted research revealing that land is sinking at a faster rate than sea levels are rising in numerous coastal cities worldwide.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global projections are alarming, indicating a mean sea level rise of at least one-foot above year-2000 levels by the end of the century. This, combined with land subsidence, poses a severe threat to the resilience of coastal cities. To understand the extent of the problem, the researchers used radar images of the Earths surface collected from orbiting satellites to measure subsidence rates in 99 coastal cities across the globe.</p><p>The findings highlight the highly variable nature of subsidence rates within cities and from city to city. If these rates persist, many metropolises could face flooding much sooner than predicted by existing sea level rise models. Notably, cities in South, Southeast, and East Asia are experiencing the most rapid rates of subsidence. Jakarta, Indonesia, serves as a stark example, prompting the country to relocate its capital to Nusantara, approximately 800 miles away, due to the alarming sinking of Jakarta, primarily caused by groundwater extraction.</p><p>However, land subsidence is not limited to Asia. Research conducted in collaboration with Tom Parsons of the US Geological Survey reveals that even the iconic New York City is not immune. The city is sinking between 1 to 4 centimeters per year, a result of a combination of glacial rebound and the immense weight of its over 1 million buildings. This subsidence exacerbates the citys vulnerability to coastal storms, especially considering the projected sea level rise of 8 to 30 inches by 2050.</p><p>In the United States, many cities on the Atlantic coast, primarily affected by glacial rebound, are experiencing subsidence. Even if the rate seems relatively low at minus-1 millimeter per year, it is a factor that should not be ignored. Cities in the Gulf of Mexico, such as Houston and New Orleans, also face the threat of subsidence, further complicating the challenge of adapting to rising sea levels.</p><p>Governments worldwide are grappling with the complex challenge of mitigating subsidence in coastal areas, recognizing the shared global challenge of preparing for a growing flooding hazard. As researchers continue to refine their understanding, incorporating technologies like machine learning to enhance monitoring capabilities, they stress the importance of city planners, emergency managers, and decision-makers accounting for subsidence in their current plans. The urgency lies in preparing for the impacts of rising sea levels that, when combined with subsidence, present an imminent and escalating threat to the future resilience of coastal cities.</p><p>As Jakarta, the current capital of Indonesia, faces the alarming issue of sinking due to land subsidence caused by factors like excessive groundwater extraction, the government has already taken a significant step by planning to relocate the capital to Nusantara, approximately 800 miles away. However, beyond this relocation, there are several alternative strategies and measures Indonesia can consider to address the challenges posed by the sinking capital:</p><p>Enforce strict regulations on groundwater extraction to prevent further subsidence. Implement sustainable groundwater management practices, including monitoring and controlling extraction rates, promoting water conservation, and encouraging the use of alternative water sources.</p><p>Develop and implement resilient infrastructure in Jakarta and other vulnerable areas. This includes constructing buildings on stilts, designing flood-resistant structures, and implementing effective drainage systems to manage excess water during heavy rains.</p><p>Introduce green infrastructure initiatives, such as creating green spaces, urban parks, and permeable surfaces, to absorb excess water and mitigate the impact of subsidence. Green roofs and permeable pavements can help in reducing surface runoff and improving overall urban resilience.</p><p>Utilize advanced technologies, including satellite-based monitoring and geospatial data analysis, to continuously monitor land subsidence. Early warning systems can provide real-time data, allowing authorities to respond promptly to subsidence-related challenges and minimize potential damages.</p><p>Integrate climate-resilient urban planning practices to address both land subsidence and sea-level rise. Plan developments with consideration for future climate scenarios, incorporating elevated structures, flood barriers, and other adaptive measures to safeguard against the impacts of sinking land and rising seas.</p><p>Promote sustainable and well-planned urban development to reduce the overall environmental impact. Encourage mixed-use developments, implement green building standards, and prioritize eco-friendly transportation options to create more resilient and sustainable urban environments.</p><p>Engage communities in understanding the challenges posed by land subsidence and involve them in adopting sustainable water usage practices.

The first challenge is the Russian invasion of Ukraine which has caused tremendous suffering and sent shockwaves across the global economy. ASEAN's direct exposure to Russia and Ukraine through trade and investment appears limited. But with the price of oil surging to its highest levels since 2008, inflation is heating up. ASEAN's net oil importers face substantial challenges with rising import bills. Food security and fragile supply chains are at greater risk too.</p><p>The second challenge is increasing interest rates in the United States which are complicating the inflation battle amid heightened uncertainties. Widening interest rate differentials between ASEAN economies and the US and a shift in investor confidence could trigger a sudden reversal in capital flows, currency depreciation, and financial instability. To sustain momentum for recovery, the region must stay vigilant and prepare for collective action to avert regional financial instability. In particular, authorities must carefully manage the combined effects of higher oil prices, US interest rate hikes, and the phasing out of fiscal stimulus. Against this backdrop, ASEAN policymakers face three important policy priorities: Strengthening regional cooperation to ensure a strong recovery; enhancing domestic resource mobilization; and scaling up investment for green and inclusive growth. Regional cooperation can pave the path to a sustained and resilient recovery.</p><p>Strong regional trade and investment gave ASEAN a buffer during the global slowdown in trade and economic activity. The Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement, which became effective early this year, is expected to expand this buffer. ADB will remain a reliable partner for regional economies in this area by providing trade finance, technical assistance, and knowledge solutions. Deepening our local-currency bond and capital markets is also critical. ADB is supporting this through the ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative (ABMI). The ABMI aims to nurture local currency bond markets as an alternative source of funding to foreign-currency denominated bank loans to alleviate the currency and maturity mismatches in the region's financing for investment and reduce the risk of financial vulnerability. We also support the development and issuance of green, social, and sustainability bonds to help governments invest in environmental sustainability, climate change mitigation and adaptation, and resilience.</p><p>ASEAN's efforts to strengthen food and energy security through regional cooperation, bolster regional health security, and strengthen disease surveillance mechanisms are crucial to mitigate risks and maintain sustainability. A second priority is efficient domestic resource mobilization. This is important to restore fiscal sustainability to maintain post-pandemic recovery and finance efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. ASEAN has room for improvement here due to its comparatively low tax revenue mobilization. Several ASEAN members have strengthened their tax administration systems through digital solutions. We are working with economies to simplify processes for taxpayers that can enhance voluntary compliance and improve tax policy formulation. We know that international tax cooperation is key to combatting tax avoidance and evasion. To promote this through knowledge sharing and coordination on tax policy and administration, we launched the Asia Pacific Tax Hub.</p><p>The third priority is scaling up investment in quality, climate-resilient infrastructure. Asia and the Pacific is vulnerable to some of the most destructive effects of climate change, and these are expected to worsen. At the same time, our region is the source of more than 50 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. We need to recognize that the battle against climate change will be won or lost in Asia and the Pacific. ADB's ambition is to deliver US$100 billion in cumulative climate financing from 2019 to 2030, including $34 billion for adaptation projects, to help the region's response to the climate challenge. The ASEAN Catalytic Green Financing (ACGF) Facility, which is owned by all ASEAN members and managed with ADB, is supporting development and financing of green infrastructure projects. It has mobilized $2 billion in public and private resources with support from nine partners, including cofinancing from the European Union, Italy, United Kingdom, and the Green Climate Fund under the Green Recovery Platform launched at the United Nations climate conference in Glasgow (COP26) last year.</p><p>ACGF helps reduce risks in green investment and attract private capital by providing loans to cover high initial capital costs and grants to support governments as they identify and prepare commercially viable green infrastructure projects. The Energy Transition Mechanism (ETM) is another innovative program launched by Indonesia, the Philippines, and ADB last year. ETM seeks to catalyze private capital and accelerate the transition from coal to clean energy in ASEAN. It aims to retire coal-fired power plants early; to scale up clean, renewable energy solutions; and to ensure that the transition is just and affordable. ETM will provide low-cost financing by combining concessional public finance, private sector investment, and resources from philanthropies. This innovative mechanism has the potential to become the largest carbon reduction model in the world. As ASEAN's recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic moves into high gear, regional cooperation initiatives will remain critical to managing growing challenges and seizing new opportunities to build a stronger future.</p><p>___ (c)2022 the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) Visit the Asia News Network (Hamburg, Germany) at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.asianewsnet.net/home\">www.asianewsnet.net/home</url>/ Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.</p>", "publisher": "The Daily Star, Dhaka, Bangladesh / Asia News Network", "instances": ["We need to recognize that the battle against climate change will be won or lost in Asia and the Pacific.

The central issue is to gain economic influence and further control of the continents politics. As already known, the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) spans all the states over the following years, and it has the potential to unite more than 1.3 billion people in a $2.5 trillion economic bloc.</p><p>It has the potential to generate a range of benefits through supporting trade creation, structural transformation, productive employment and poverty reduction. The AfCFTA opens up more opportunities for both local African and foreign investors from around the world. This is the latest core element or component in post-colonial Africa. It has become the most significant landmark in the history of Africa. We are indeed talking about the official start of this intra-African trading which, of course, signals the commencement of Africas journey to market integration.</p><p>Those of us in the academia monitoring, researching and analyzing Africas development, it beholds again to closely examine the two-day Paris summit, June 22 to 23, and determine the level of its significance and interconnection with this new global financing pact that will benefit Africa. There will be winners and losers; it is both sides of the same coin. African leaders with strategic eyes and brains will become the first and most brilliant beneficiaries; others with the old mindset will only sustain their status as observers and consequently gain nothing for their countries and citizens.</p><p>At this point, the summit primarily seeks to rally political leaders and representatives of global financial institutions. The new financing system will address inequality, debt crisis, climate change, international taxes, and special drawing rights. It will be more inclusive and fairer. Therefore, at least, there are solid grounds to rethink the contract between the countries in the Global North and the Global South.</p><p>Given geopolitical contradictions and complexities, one more critical point of focus is formulating new pacts and financial modalities to address the current global economic crisis and climate change.</p><p>I can only remind you of the global financial institutions. These include the IMF and the World Bank, civil society and the private sector. It will lay the foundation for creating a new global financing system. The new financing system will address inequality, debt crisis, climate change, international taxes, and special drawing rights. It will be more inclusive and fairer.</p><p>Most of their conditions are usually unfavorable to many creditors; however, much again depends on the crediting countries implementable policies, approaches and economic goals. At this point, we must ponder a few questions: How does the summit fit into a global context defined by the sweeping consequences of persistent economic, climate, health and energy crises, mainly in the most vulnerable countries? What do we expect from the summit, and what next after all these?</p><p>Objectives for the Paris Summit: Catherine Colonna, the French Minister of Europe and Foreign Affairs, in a statement on January 6, 2023, noted that the Paris Summit would focus on building a new pact with a Global North and a Global South. According to her, the new arrangement would facilitate vulnerable countries access to the necessary finance to address the effects of the current and future crises.</p><p>On the same day, the Secretary of State for Development, Francophonie and International Partnerships, Chrysoula Zacharopoulou, and the Permanent Representative of France to the OECD, Am&amp;#233;lie de Montchalin, took part in a webinar arranged by the Finance for Development Lab on the issues at stake at the Paris Summit 2023.</p><p>In November 2022, on the sidelines G20 Summit and the conclusion of a COP27 Summit with mixed results, French President Emmanuel Macron called for a global conference in Paris in June 2023. Macron announced that the Paris Summit would take stock &amp;#8220;of all means and ways of increasing financial solidarity with the Global South.&amp;#8221;</p><p>Emmanuel Macrons announcement happened in a particular global context. The climate change crisis particularly threatens the Global South countries, including island states. Thus, the Barbados Prime Minister, Mia Mottley, has led an initiative to finance climate action since COP26. The &amp;#8220;Bridge Initiative&amp;#8221; focuses on facilitating access to global financing for the countries most vulnerable to climate change. The funding allows them to respond better to climate challenges.</p><p>Macrons announcement aligns with the Bridgetown Initiative. However, the Paris Summit will deliberate on financing issues beyond the climate question, including the fight against poverty. The Covid-19 pandemic, the Ukrainian conflict, and the accompanying consequences have massively shrunk the budgetary and fiscal space for many countries, including Africa. This has affected their ability to finance citizens access to basic social needs and services. Consequently, the UNDP observed a human development decline in nine out of ten countries globally in 2022. The fall has mainly come from increased poverty levels and a drop in life expectancy.</p><p>AfDB president Dr Akinwumi Adesina will moderate a roundtable discussion about the Alliance for Green Infrastructure in Africa at the Summit for New Global Financing Pact. Seven heads of state will join Akinwumi Adesina. Islamic Development Bank Chairman Muhammad Al Jasser and the European Investment Bank President, Werner Hoyer, will also attend.</p><p>The Alliance represents a program by the African Union Commission, the AfDB, and Africa50 with other partners. The platform allows African nations to partner with the private sector to raise $500 million in early-stage combined finance capital. This will catalyze up to $10 billion in green and climate-resilient programs and projects. Its eventual goal is to hasten a transition to net-zero emissions by Africa and for Africa.</p><p>The event will promote AGIA as an influential platform. AGIA could accelerate and scale funding Africas transformational climate-resilient and greener infrastructure projects to attract new financiers and partners. It will also provide a progress update on the Alliances activities since its launch at COP27. The June 22-23 Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is one to anticipate. Many of the deliberations and expected outcomes will no doubt benefit the majority of African nations.</p><p>With six round tables, 30 branded events and 50 parallel events and deliberations, there will be a final declaration and communique. Leaders have registered their participation, including the President of Mozambique, Filipe Nyusi, Prime Minister of Barbados, Olaf Scholz, Luis Inacio, the President of Brazil, Lula Da Silva, Germany Chancellor Mia Mottley, Chinese Premier Li Qiang, and US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen.</p><p>Several representatives of international organizations, activists, and philanthropists will also attend. They include AfDB President Akinwumi Adesina, Word Bank President Ajay Banga, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres, the European Commission President Ursula Von der Leyen, UN Goodwill Ambassador and activist Vanessa Nakate, co-founder of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation and philanthropist Melinda French Gates, among others.</p><p>A high-level international steering committee composed of states and international organizations oversees the Paris Summit preparations. It includes France, South Africa, Senegal, the United Arab Emirates, the United Kingdom, the United States, Germany, Barbados, Brazil, Japan, China, India, the United Nations Secretariat, the European Commission, the OECD, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund.</p><p>Civil society campaigns: Ahead of the Summit for a New Global Financing Pact in Paris and the confines of multilateral development bank reforms, the Pandemic Action Network and 19 institutions from around the globe have issued a rallying call for the inclusion of pandemic debt relief clauses in new country lending agreements.</p><p>In summary, we expect the summit formulates proposals for innovative financing sources, particularly those from the multilateral development banks. This will ultimately benefit developing countries, including those in Africa. Further, the international institutions interventions will effectively address and reduce or minimize the vulnerability of economic shocks due to global instability from the pandemic and Russia-Ukraine crisis.

According to media report, the US Green Building Council (USGBC) has been recognized quality certificate as an environmentally friendly factory. Last February 21, the USGBC issued the prestigious certificate and the factory received 104 out of 110 marks in various criteria for environmentally friendly factories. More glorious news is that according to the latest USGBC list, 8 of the world's top 10 eco-friendly factories are in Bangladesh and the remaining two are in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. As of 2018, Indonesia had the world's most environmentally friendly factory. The factory then got 101 out of 110 marks. Moreover, 52 out of the top 100 environmentally friendly factories in the world are in Bangladesh and 10 factories in China are in the second position. Then Pakistan has 9 factories, Sri Lanka and India have 6 each with 12 and Vietnam and Taiwan have 4 and 8 factories each.</p><p>According to BGMEA, our country has 183 certified green factories as of December 2022, the highest compared to other countries, and another 500 factories are in the pipeline to be certified soon. Out of 183 garment and textile factories in Bangladesh, 60 have got Lead Platinum, 109 Gold, 10 Silver and 4 certified. Last year, a total of 27 companies in the ready-made garments and textiles sector received the certificate of eco-friendly factories.</p><p>Generally, green factories are built in compliance with all relevant international standards. Energy and water conservation, construction in compliance with building codes and proper waste management are given utmost importance while setting up such factories. It is important to keep solar power source, light with sensor, bicycle stand for energy saving, rainwater harvesting, water recycling systems, taps with sensors to reduce water wastage and modern sanitary fittings are essential to save water. Not only this, a green factory has to maintain indoor air quality as per ASHRAE standards. Besides, the temperature inside the factory is controlled to a tolerable level, which plays a role in maintaining the good health and productivity of a worker.</p><p>The primary foundation of a green factory is efficient and sustainable production, which balances environmental and business interests. All USGBC guidelines are preferred while setting up green factories. A factory is required to receive certification from the USGBC by achieving minimum standards in six specific areas prescribed by the USGBC to become Lead Certified. These include sustainable sites, efficient water management and electricity use, improved working environment, etc. If an industry or factory passes this standard then the factory gets the lead certificate based on the given marks. For example, when a factory building gets 80 or more points, it is certified as a Lead Platinum building in UG, similarly 70 or more is certified as Gold and 60 or more as Silver. Sustainable design is the key to green factories. In this process, maximum production is ensured in a fair working environment by utilizing natural resources in a cost-effective manner. The establishment is evaluated on a total of 110 points in various categories.</p><p>The reality is that setting up or renovating a green factory is very expensive. Advanced technology materials are used to make it. For example VOC Free Point, RUG Certified, FSC Certified, ASHRAE, Energy Star etc. international standard products are to be used. As a result, setting up a green factory costs at least 20-30 percent more than a normal factory. But since setting up a green factory is part of a long-term plan, the investment in this case is profitable in all respects and is quite important for international reputation and reputation. So we should make the policy of green finance easier. However, the USGBC's Green Factory policy places great importance on the working environment of the workers and thereby makes the working environment more pleasant for the workers. Workers also feel comfortable working in green infrastructure due to adequate light and ventilation, advanced machinery and modern facilities.</p><p>In our country mainly after the Tazreen Garments fire and the Rana Plaza collapse, foreign buyers started canceling purchase orders one after another. They even pressured the closure of the country's garment factories by alleging non-compliance. Accord and Alliance, a coalition of European and American buyers, visited the garment factories of Bangladesh at various times, creating fear among the entrepreneurs and causing great discomfort among the entrepreneurs. Later on, due to the constructive initiatives taken by the industrial owners, the uncertain situation has gradually been removed and a very favorable situation has been created and many readymade garment manufacturers are turning towards green industrialization.</p><p>Bangladesh is one of the low carbon emitting countries in the world, yet it is gaining recognition in the world as a renewable energy consuming country. Bangladesh has the largest number of solar home systems. Renewable energy is becoming increasingly popular in Bangladesh's garment industry. BGMEA has already signed ENFCC's initiative Fashion Industry Charter for Climate Action, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from the apparel sector by 30 percent by 2030.</p><p>Everyone is now interested in buying and using products produced in environmentally friendly factories. In such a situation, the importance of green industrialization in our garment industry is very high. Importance of environment-friendly technology and sustainable green industrialization should be increased not only in the ready-made garment industry, but also in other areas to increase exports.</p><p>(The writer is a banker).</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

Exposure to higher temperatures causes public health emergencies and cascading socioeconomic impacts such as loss of work capacity, labour productivity and mobility and exacerbates poverty. Continuous exposure to excessive heat causes serious health conditions such as heat rash, excessive sweating, heat cramps, exhaustion, heatstroke and even death. The International Labour Organization (ILO) predicts that by 2030, 2.2% of working hours worldwide or 80 million full-time jobs, will be lost as a result of higher temperatures. Multiple studies estimate that from 2000 to 2016, the number of people exposed to heat waves increased to 125 million worldwide. Recent studies found that it may affect more than 1.2 billion people annually by 2100.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">South Asia is considered to be a hotspot for heat wave related incidences. The Indian Meteorological Department states that from 1979-2017 the extreme combination of both heat and humidity has doubled in many parts of India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka. Besides, it is also projected that by 2100 the average temperature will rise to 3-6C. This rising temperature will result in extensive heat wave which can potentially affect 800 million people in the region.</p><p>The Bangladesh Meteorological Department defines temperatures of 36 to 38 degrees Celsius as a mild heat wave, 38 to 40 as a moderate heat wave and temperatures above 40 degrees Celsius as an intense heat wave. In this year, Khulna, Rajshahi and Dhaka divisions and their surrounding areas were experiencing mild to moderate heat waves. Rajshahi has twice recorded temperatures of 41.2 degrees Celsius - the highest in the country so far this year. Eleven different locations across the country recorded temperatures between 36 to 40 degrees Celsius in the 30 days of April. Bangladesh is losing 7 billion working hours annually due to extreme heat exposure caused by global warming, a new study reveals. If the global temperature increases by 1 degree Celsius, the country could lose approximately 21 billion working hours, a US study has explored. It has estimated that if the temperature rises by 2 or 4 degrees Celsius it can result in a loss of 31 or 57 billion work hours annually in the country. Heat waves are associated with livestock and poultry disease and with crop damage also. In Bangladesh, mortality rates increase by about 20% during heat waves.</p><p>Heat related illnesses for human health include heat edema, heat rash, heat cramps, heat syncope and heat exhaustion etc. Heat edema presents as a transient swelling of the hands, feet and ankles. No particular treatment is required, wearing support stockings and elevating the affected legs will help minimize the edema. Heat rash, also known as prickly heat, accompanied by acute inflammation and blocked sweat ducts. In such cases, it is advised to wear loose- fitting clothing in the heat. Application of chlorhexidine lotion is beneficial to remove any desquamated skin. The associated itching may be treated with topical or systemic antihistamines. Heat cramps are painful, involuntary spasms of the large muscle groups used in strenuous exercise. Rehydration with salt-containing fluids provides rapid relief. Patients with mild cramps can be given oral salt solutions, while those with severe cramps require IV isotonic fluids. Heat syncope is related to heat exposure that produces hypotension. Management of heat syncope consists of cooling and rehydration of the patient using oral rehydration therapy or isotonic IV fluids. Heat exhaustion is marked by excessive dehydration and electrolyte depletion. Symptoms may include diarrhea, headache, nausea and vomiting, dizziness, tachycardia, malaise and myalgia. Definitive therapy includes removing patients from the heat and replenishing their fluids. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies diarrheal diseases, respiratory infections and malaria in the top ten causes of environment related deaths. Rising temperature influences the emergence and re-emergence of many infectious diseases e.g. dengue fever, diarrheal disease, enteric fever, respiratory tract infections and meningitis etc. In addition, emerging and reemerging diseases such as chikungunya and Zika, have also been linked to climate change influences.</p><p>Staying healthy during heat waves is easier if we take the time to protect ourselves by drinking enough water and limiting our unnecessary exposure to the heat. We should remain hydrated by drinking plenty of fluids even if we do not feel thirsty. Eating small meals and eat more often; wearing loose-fitting, lightweight, light-colored clothing; slowing down, staying indoors and avoiding strenuous exercise during the hottest part of the day; taking frequent breaks if outdoor work is unavoidable and wearing sunscreen with a high SPF are few individual measures to mitigate adverse impact of heat waves amongst others. We should remain aware of family and friends who may need extra care who are at risk of heat-related Illness like dehydration, prolonged exertion, chronic illnesses, uncontrolled diabetes, uncontrolled hypertension, older age, increased body mass and younger age etc.</p><p>People should be informed of weather conditions via television, radio, newspapers and other print media. Long-term measures should focus on disaster prevention: starting from improving the climate adaptability of urban and architectural design, such as the reduction of urban heat generation and the weakening of urban heat island effect through building the urban green infrastructure and increase the quantity and quality of green space.</p><p>The concerned department should implement the high-temperature monitoring and warning system. Necessary action plans and respective national and municipal policies should be formulated and executed to address the heat stress impacts on human well-being and livelihood in Bangladesh following WHO public health guidance for the general public and medical professionals on coping with extreme heat.</p><p>Additionally, the introduction of the Heat Adaptation Plan (HAP) at the city and administrative level, capacity building of the institutions, mass awareness and knowledge campaigns can enhance the overall understanding as well as facilitate necessary measures to tackle the impacts of heat waves in Bangladesh.</p><p>(Lt Col Nazmul Huda Khan, MBBS, MPH, MPhil is a Public Health Specialist and Assistant Director, Kurmitola General Hospital).</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.

through effective adaptation strategies to foster a robust society and ecosystems and stimulate sustainable economic-growth, underlying aims to reduce risk and vulnerability due to the adverse impacts of climate change, to help fulfil Bangladesh's aspiration to become a climate-resilient nation, to promote sustainable nature-based solutions that balance economic-growth and environmental sustainability, a means of ecosystem-based adaptation.</p><p>The NAP sets 6 goals to achieve its vision: Goal-1 - Ensure Protection against Climate Change Variability and Induced Natural Disasters: NAP aims at enhancing overall climate resilience through effective adaptation measures that minimize losses and damages from natural disasters (e.g.temperature rise, rainfall variability, sea- level rise, frequent cyclones, river floods, flash floods, urban floods, heat stress, cold snaps, lightning, droughts, storm surges and salinity intrusions, etc.) and support natural resources management, strong economicgrowth, resilient ecosystems and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>Goal-2 - Develop Climate-Resilient Agriculture for Food, Nutrition and Livelihood Security: The goal aims to reduce the risks and vulnerabilities in agriculture by incorporating climate-resilient and smart efficient agriculture in efforts to protect food, nutrition and livelihood security, achieved through a sustainable value chain for agro-inputs.</p><p>Goal-3 - Develop Climate-Smart Cities for Improved Urban Environment and Well-Being: The goal aims to develop climate-smart cities reinforced with robust drainage networks, water management infrastructure; expand green infrastructure, effective solid waste and renewable energy mechanisms; improve human-health and WASH (water-sanitation and hygiene health), while conserving the urban environment, managing climateinduced disasters (urban waterlogging, tidal-inundation, storm-surge impacts, etc.).</p><p>Goal-4 - Promote Nature-Based Solutions for Conservation of Forestry, Biodiversity, and Well-Being of Communities: The goal aims to apply nature-based solutions, ecosystems-based adaptation to protect, sustainably manage and restore natural ecosystems, address climate challenges effectively, provide human well-being and biodiversity benefits, reduce the vulnerabilities, develop climate-resilient forestry, wetland and biodiversity and capacity development at community level.</p><p>Goal-5 - Impart Good Governance Through Adaptation-Integration in the Planning Process: The goal aims to integrate inclusive climate adaptation planning through appropriate institutional arrangements, to robust governance, enabling environment for implementing adaptation actions, good governance, and institutional capacity of government machineries, private sectors, NGOs,  to use climate finance with greater accountability, responsiveness, transparency, safeguarding vulnerable communities, ecosystems, to overcome the challenges and conflicts.</p><p>Goal-6 - Ensure Transformative Capacity-Building and Innovation for Climate Adaptation:  The goal aims to instigate transformative capacity development at individual, institutional, system levels with better abilities, skills, understanding a holistic, inclusive, feasible and sustainable way, to include awareness-raising, training, individual skill-development, research, knowledge management and communication adaptation, focusing capacity-gaps and applying innovation.</p><p>NAP Working Sectors The initial NAP concept was on: emphasizing water resources; agriculture, food and livelihood security; coastal and drought zones; and urban areas as the priority-sectors for adaptation, focusing with other critical cross-cutting issues, e.g.</p><p>women and gender equal- ity, youth, persons with disabilities, the private sector, infrastructure, WASH and health, to identify appropriate strategies, alignment with national aspirations.</p><p>These sectors and subsectors have been further streamlined, crossmatched and blended to arrive at eight (8) distinct sectors and thematic issues.</p><p>These 8 sectors are: (1) Water resources; (2) Disaster, social safety and security; (3) Agriculture; (4) Fisheries, aquaculture and livestock; (5) Urban areas; (6) Ecosystems, wetlands and biodiversity; (7) Policies and institutions; and (8) Capacity develop- ment, research and innovation.</p><p>Conclusions The changing climate phenomena are hindering Bangladesh's economy and its sustainable development initiatives.</p><p>The future will be more uncertain and extreme.</p><p>Tackling such uncertain effects would bring hardship for the country, and threats to its development goals.</p><p>The coordinated initiatives can be ensured through effective climate adaptation practices, backed by enhanced climate finance from promised donor's support.</p><p>With an underlying objective of reducing risks and vulnerabilities to climate change impacts, the NAP follows the NAPA and the BCCSAP, aiming to streamline further adaptation efforts, foresees building a climate-resilient nation through effective adaptation strategies that foster a robust society and ecosystems to stimulate sustainable economic-growth.</p><p>The NAP will develop climate-resilient agriculture, infrastructure and other socio-economic sectors through implementing inclusive and ecosystem-based adaptation, improved governance, enhanced climate-finance, transformative capacity-building and innovation.</p><p>The NAP will be considered a living document with a planning-horizon until 2050, with at least a five-year revision cycle aligned with Bangladesh's fiveyear development planning process.</p><p>Prioritization of finance to facilitate extensive research, capacity development, adapting advanced technologies and innovation is recommended.</p><p>Successful implementation of the NAP will complement achieving the SDGs by 2030, and the national development vision, becoming a high-income country by 2041.

Businesses shut down, investment spending is cut, and people out of work can lose skills and motivation as the months stretch on. But the recession brought on by the Covid-19 pandemic is no ordinary recession. Compared to previous global crises, the contraction was sudden and deep-using quarterly data, global output declined about three times as much as in the global financial crisis, in half the time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Systemic financial stress-associated with long-lasting economic damage-has been largely avoided so far, owing to the unprecedented policy actions taken. However, the path to recovery remains challenging, especially for countries with limited fiscal space, and is made harder by the differential impact of the pandemic.</p><p>LESSONS FROM HISTORY: The extent of the recovery will depend on the persistence of the economic damage, or \"scarring,\" in the medium-term. This will vary across countries, depending on the future path of the pandemic; the share of high-contact sectors; the ability of businesses and workers to adapt; and the effectiveness of policy responses.</p><p>These unknowns make it hard to predict the extent of scarring but there are some lessons we can draw from history. Severe recessions in the past, particularly deep ones, have been associated with persistent output losses from reduced productivity. Although the pandemic has spurred increased digitalization and innovation in production and delivery processes-at least in some countries-the resource reallocation needed to adapt to a new normal may be larger than in past recessions, affecting productivity growth going forward. Another risk is the pandemic-driven rise in market power of dominant firms, which are becoming increasingly entrenched as competitors collapse.</p><p>Productivity has also been affected by Covid-19 disruptions to production networks. High-contact sectors, such as arts and entertainment, accommodation and restaurants, and wholesale and retail trade are less central to production networks than, say, the energy sector. But historical analysis shows that even shocks to these peripheral sectors can be greatly amplified through spill overs to other sectors. The closure of restaurants and bars, for example, can affect farms and wineries, resulting in lower demand for tractors and other agricultural equipment. So, although the pandemic's initial impact was concentrated in higher-contact service sectors, given the size of the disruption, it still resulted in a broad downturn.</p><p>MEDIUM-TERM IMPLICATIONS: Despite higher-than-anticipated growth as the global economy recovers from the Covid-19 shock, we expect world output in the medium-term to be about 3 per cent lower in 2024 than pre-pandemic projections. Because financial stability has largely been preserved, this expected scarring is less than what we saw following the global financial crisis.</p><p>However, unlike what happened during the global financial crisis, emerging market and developing economies are expected to have deeper scars than advanced economies, with losses expected to be largest among low-income countries.</p><p>This divergence across countries is the consequence of varying economic structures and the size of countries' fiscal policy responses. Because of how the virus is transmitted, economies that are more reliant on tourism or have a larger share of high-contact sectors, such as the Pacific Islands and the Caribbean, are projected to experience more persistent losses. GDP in the Pacific Islands, for example, is estimated to be 10 per cent lower in 2024 than pre-pandemic projections. Many of these countries also have more limited policy space and capacity to mount major health responses or support livelihoods.</p><p>Widespread school closures have occurred across countries, but the adverse impacts on learning and skills acquisition have been larger in low-income countries. The resulting long-term individual earnings losses and damages to aggregate productivity could be a key legacy of the Covid-19 crisis.</p><p>POLICIES TO LIMIT SCARRING: Experience from past recessions underscores the importance of avoiding financial distress and ensuring effective policy support until the recovery is firmly underway.</p><p>Countries will need to tailor their policies to the different stages of the pandemic with a combination of better-targeted support for affected households and firms, and public investments. As vaccine coverage improves and supply constraints ease, these efforts should focus on three priorities:</p><p>* First, reversing the setback to human capital accumulation. To address the rise in inequality that is likely to result from the pandemic, social safety nets should be expanded, and adequate resources allocated to healthcare and education.</p><p>* Second, supporting productivity through policies to facilitate job mobility and promote competition and innovation.</p><p>* Third, boosting public infrastructure investment, particularly in green infrastructure to help crowd-in private investment.</p><p>Finally, strong international cooperation will be needed to address the growing divergence across countries. It is vital that financially constrained economies have adequate access to international liquidity for development spending. On the health front, this also means ensuring adequate production and universal distribution of vaccines-including through sufficient funding for the COVAX facility-to help developing countries beat back the pandemic and prevent even worse scarring.</p><p>Sonali Das is a senior economist in the World Economic Studies Division in the IMF's Research Department.

The pandemic has left us a terrible mess to clear up. What policies will get us out of the huge debt that we have incurred to pay for the health, wealth and job crises?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2020 was a year of terrible devastation, cushioned only by massive government spending. Aside from the favourite sport of blaming China for everything, each country will have to concentrate on the tough business of getting its economy back to a more even keel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The latest OECD Economic Outlook published this week showed how bad the situation has become. World output was down 3.4 per cent last year, but OECD sees growth of 5.5 per cent in 2021 and 4 per cent in 2022. However, poorly performing countries will continue to suffer low growth rates. China was the only major country that had positive growth in 2020 (2.3 per cent), whereas the Eurozone was down 6.8 per cent, with severe declines for France (-8.2 per cent), Spain (-11), and UK (-9.9). Amongst the emerging markets, India was down 7.4 per cent, Mexico (-8.5 per cent), South Africa (-7.2) and Argentina (-10.5).</p><p>The only bright hope for US growing better in the next two years is due to significant fiscal stimulus, plus faster vaccination. But is this sustainable?</p><p>The latest IMF Fiscal Monitor showed that overall fiscal deficits are projected at -13.3 per cent of GDP for advanced economies, -10.3 per cent for emerging markets and middleincome economies, and -5.7 per cent for low-income developing countries. Essentially $14 trillion fiscal support was given in 2020, with global public debt rising to 98 per cent of GDP, compared with 84 per cent in 2019.</p><p>In short, almost every country threw money at the pandemic, with very little appreciation whether we are getting value for money. In a panic, doing that is understandable. After the panic, the pain and reckoning must begin in all seriousness.</p><p>Note that the US fiscal deficit rose from 6.4 per cent of GDP in 2019 to 17.5 per cent in 2020, an increase of 11.1 per cent of GDP fiscal support to defend a decline of 5.6 per cent percentage points in GDP growth (from +2.1 per cent to -3.5 per cent in 2020). In essence, US fiscal policy pumped 2 per cent of GDP spending to defend 1 per cent of GDP growth.</p><p>The IMF estimated that the cost to the US is a rise in gross debt to 128.7 per cent of GDP, far higher than the world average of 97.8 per cent. The comparable Chinese gross fiscal debt was 65.2 per cent of GDP in 2020, just over half of US gross debt.</p><p>Is Biden's $1.9 trillion stimulus package this year too much for comfort? The Republicans certainly are alarmed at the sharp rise in welfare spending and debt, so they voted against the package. The nonpartisan Committee on Responsible Fiscal Budget estimates that the total cost including interest and extensions would amount to $4.1 trillion by 2031. In other words, all stimulus spending cost more than what is shown. From a political point of view, Biden had no choice. If he does not revive the economy and protect his support base, he will lose the mid-term elections in 2022, which would make his second half term a complete lame-duck.</p><p>So, from a global strategic perspective, the real issue is not further quarrels between US and China. The key is whether Biden can turn around US long-term competitiveness damaged by four years of Trumpian fumbling on top of Congressional focus on short-term issues, rather than long-term infrastructure and structural weaknesses.</p><p>Take fiscal and monetary policies. Former US President Ronald Reagan famously said in 1981 that \"government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem\". Instead, US general government expenditure rose by 78 per cent in constant 2010 dollars from 1981 to 2019, whereas total public debt has increased dramatically from $1 trillion or 31 per cent of GDP when Reagan was President to $27 trillion or 136 per cent of GDP by the end of September 2020.</p><p>The Fed's stated monetary policy goals are to promote maximum employment, stable prices and moderate long-term interest rates. Whilst inflation has been kept low at below 2 per cent per annum and unemployment remains low, long-term interest rates are at record low levels, whilst US inequality numbers have worsened since Reagan from a Gini coefficient of 0.38 in 1981 to 0.48 in 2015. In the meantime, the Fed's balance sheet, which was $865 billion or 6 per cent of GDP in 2007 rose over eight times to $7.6 trillion or 36 per cent of GDP by March 2021.</p><p>That's not long-term strategy, but fiscal and monetary overdose.</p><p>Biden's Build Back Better programme will spend another $2 trillion during the next four years on building green infrastructure and creating jobs. By comparison, the US spent $686 billion in 2019 on defense alone, and the cost of war since 9/11 for America was $6.4 trillion and 801,000 deaths since 2001. All these are funded by more government debt, which the Congressional Budget Office projects will amount to 202 per cent of GDP by 2051.</p><p>Any emerging market with these debt numbers would be called a banana republic.</p><p>The Biden Administration is betting that the largest US stimulus package since World War II would restore American competitiveness and heal the nation. But much of this is not funded by domestic savings, such as taxing the rich, but by borrowing on the US dollar. The rest of the world will not fund the dollar forever, certainly not at near zero interest rates. And if interest rates rise, the fiscal costs would be substantially higher. So bet on the Fed pumping more to keep rates low.</p><p>Winston Churchill said once, \"never waste a good crisis\". But in today's complex affairs, even experienced journalists have difficulty figuring whether Americans are getting value for such massive government spending. So far, the United States has not spent enough good money on her own people, and more on the war machine. If this opportunity is wasted, then America will be lurching from crisis to crisis.</p><p>The truth of US debt is that it is not debt, but the rest of the world's equity. America is the world's too-big to- fail borrower. If Biden fails, we lose. Which is why the dollar note says In God We Trust.</p><p>The writer is a former central banker and financial regulator.

Our latest global growth forecast of 6 percent for 2021 is unchanged from the previous outlook, but the composition has changed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Growth prospects for advanced economies this year have improved by 0.5 percentage point, but this is offset exactly by a downward revision for emerging market and developing economies driven by a significant downgrade for emerging Asia. For 2022, we project global growth of 4.9 per cent, up from our previous forecast of 4.4 per cent. But again, underlying this is a sizeable upgrade for advanced economies, and a more modest one for emerging market and developing economies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We estimate the pandemic has reduced per capita incomes in advanced economies by 2.8 per cent a year, relative to pre-pandemic trends over 2020-2022, compared with an annual per capita loss of 6.3 per cent a year for emerging market and developing economies (excluding China).</p><p>These revisions reflect to an important extent differences in pandemic developments as the delta variant takes over. Close to 40 per cent of the population in advanced economies has been fully vaccinated, compared with 11 per cent in emerging market economies, and a tiny fraction in low-income developing countries. Faster-than-expected vaccination rates and return to normalcy have led to upgrades, while lack of access to vaccines and renewed waves of Covid-19 cases in some countries, notably India, have led to downgrades.</p><p>Divergences in policy support are a second source of the deepening divide. We are seeing continued sizable fiscal support in advanced economies with US$4.6 trillion of announced pandemic related measures available in 2021 and beyond. The upward global growth revision for 2022 largely reflects anticipated additional fiscal support in the United States and from the Next Generation European Union funds.</p><p>On the other hand, in emerging market and developing economies most measures expired in 2020 and they are looking to rebuild fiscal buffers. Some emerging markets like Brazil, Hungary, Mexico, Russia, and Turkey, have also begun raising monetary policy rates to head off upward price pressures. Commodity exporters have benefited from higher-than-anticipated commodity prices.</p><p>INFLATION CONCERNS: Aftershocks from the upheaval of last year pose unique policy challenges. Pent-up demand and supply chain bottlenecks are putting upward pressure on prices. Nonetheless, in most advanced economies inflation is expected to subside to pre-pandemic ranges in 2022 for the following reasons:</p><p>First, a significant fraction of the abnormally high inflation readings is transitory, resulting from pandemic affected sectors such as travel and hospitality, and from comparison with last year's abnormally low readings such as for commodity prices.</p><p>Second, overall employment rates remain well below pre-pandemic levels in most countries and while there has been rapid wage growth in some sectors, overall wage growth remains within normal ranges. As health metrics improve and exceptional income support measures expire, hiring difficulties in certain sectors are expected to abate and ease wage pressures.</p><p>Third, long-term inflation expectations (as measured by surveys and market-based measures) remain well-anchored, and factors such as automation that have lowered the sensitivity of prices to changes in labor market slack likely have intensified through the pandemic.</p><p>This assessment is, however, subject to significant uncertainty given the uncharted nature of this recovery. More persistent supply disruptions and sharply rising housing prices are some of the factors that could lead to persistently high inflation. Further, inflation is expected to remain elevated into 2022 in some emerging market and developing economies, related in part to continued food price pressures and currency depreciations-creating yet another divide.</p><p>While more widespread vaccine access could improve the outlook, risks on balance are tilted to the downside. The emergence of highly infectious virus variants could derail the recovery and wipe out $4.5 trillion cumulatively from global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2025. Financial conditions could also tighten abruptly amid stretched asset valuations, if there is a sudden reassessment of the monetary policy outlook, especially in the United States. It is also possible that stimulus spending in the United States could prove weaker than expected. A worsening pandemic and tightening financial conditions would inflict a double hit on emerging market and developing economies and severely set back their recoveries.</p><p>POLICIES TO ARREST DIVERGENCES AND IMPROVE PROSPECTS: Multilateral action is needed to ensure rapid, worldwide access to vaccines, diagnostics, and therapeutics. This would save countless lives, prevent new variants from emerging, and add trillions of dollars to global economic growth. International Monetary Fund (IMF) staff's recent proposal to end the pandemic, endorsed by the World Health Organization (WHO), World Bank, and World Trade Organization (WTO), sets a goal of vaccinating at least 40 per cent of the population in every country by the end of 2021 and at least 60 per cent by mid-2022, alongside ensuring adequate diagnostics and therapeutics at a price of $50 billion.</p><p>To achieve these targets, at least one billion vaccine doses should be shared in 2021 by countries with surplus vaccines, and vaccine manufacturers should prioritise deliveries to low- and lower-middle income countries. It is important to remove trade restrictions on vaccine inputs and finished vaccines and make additional investment in regional vaccine capacity to ensure sufficient production. It is essential to also make available upfront grant financing of around $25 billion for diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccine preparedness for low-income developing countries.</p><p>A related priority is to ensure that financially constrained economies maintain access to international liquidity. Major central banks should clearly communicate their outlook for monetary policy and ensure that inflation fears do not trigger rapid tightening of financial conditions. A general allocation of Special Drawing Rights (SDR) equivalent to $650 billion ($250 billion to emerging market and developing economies), as proposed by the IMF, should be completed quickly so as to provide liquidity buffers for countries and help them address their essential spending needs. The impact can be further magnified if rich nations voluntarily channel their SDRs to emerging market and developing economies. Finally, greater action is needed to ensure that the G20 Common Framework successfully delivers on debt restructuring for countries where debt is already unsustainable.</p><p>The other major shared challenge is to reduce carbon emissions and slow the rise in global temperatures to avoid catastrophic health and economic outcomes. A multipronged strategy with carbon pricing as its centrepiece will be needed. Revenue from carbon pricing mechanisms should be used to fund compensatory transfers to those hurt by the energy transition. In parallel, a green infrastructure push and subsidies for research into green technologies are needed to hasten the move to lower carbon dependence. So far, only 18 per cent of recovery spending has been on low-carbon activities.</p><p>NATIONAL LEVEL POLICIES NEEDED TO REINFORCE MULTILATERAL EFFORTS FOR SECURING THE RECOVERY: Policy efforts at the national level should continue to be tailored to the stage of the pandemic:</p><p>First, to escape the acute crisis by prioritising health spending, including for vaccinations, and targeted support for affected households and firms;</p><p>Next, to secure the recovery with more emphasis on broader fiscal and monetary support, depending on available space, including remedial measures to reverse the loss in education, and supporting the reallocation of labour and capital to growing sectors through targeted hiring subsidies and efficient bankruptcy resolution mechanisms; and</p><p>Finally, to invest in the future, by advancing long-term goals of boosting productive capacity, accelerating the transition to lower carbon dependence, harnessing the benefits of digitalization, and ensuring the gains are equitably shared.</p><p>Fiscal actions should be nested within a credible medium-term fiscal framework to ensure debt remains sustainable. For many countries this will involve improving tax capacity, increasing tax progressivity, and eliminating wasteful expenditures. Low-income developing countries will also need strong international support.</p><p>Central banks should avoid prematurely tightening policies when faced with transitory inflation pressures but should be prepared to move quickly if inflation expectations show signs of de-anchoring. Emerging markets should also prepare for possibly tighter external financial conditions by lengthening debt maturities where possible and limiting the build-up of un-hedged foreign currency debt.</p><p>The recovery is not assured until the pandemic is beaten back globally. Concerted, well-directed policy actions at the multilateral and national levels can make the difference between a future where all economies experience durable recoveries or one where divergences intensify, the poor get poorer, and social unrest and geopolitical tensions grow.</p><p>Gita Gopinath is the Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).

Yet, even with high uncertainty about the path of the pandemic, a way out of this health and economic crisis is increasingly visible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thanks to the ingenuity of the scientific community hundreds of millions of people are being vaccinated and this is expected to power recoveries in many countries later this year. Economies also continue to adapt to new ways of working despite reduced mobility, leading to a stronger-than-anticipated rebound across regions. Additional fiscal support in large economies, particularly the United States (US), has further improved the outlook. In our (International Monetary Fund) latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), we are now projecting a stronger recovery for the global economy compared with our January forecast, with growth projected to be 6 per cent in 2021 (0.5 percentage point upgrade) and 4.4 per cent in 2022 (0.2 percentage point upgrade), after an estimated historic contraction of -3.3 per cent in 2020.</p><p>Nonetheless, the future presents daunting challenges. The pandemic is yet to be defeated and virus cases are accelerating in many countries. Recoveries are also diverging dangerously across and within countries, as economies with slower vaccine rollout, more limited policy support, and more reliance on tourism do less well.</p><p>The upgrades in global growth for 2021 and 2022 are mainly due to upgrades for advanced economies, particularly to a sizeable upgrade for the United States (1.3 percentage points) that is expected to grow at 6.4 per cent this year. This makes the United States the only large economy projected to surpass the level of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) it was forecast to have in 2022 in the absence of this pandemic. Other advanced economies, including the euro area, will also rebound this year but at a slower pace. Among emerging markets and developing economies, China is projected to grow this year at 8.4 per cent. While China's economy had already returned to pre-pandemic GDP in 2020, many other countries are not expected to do so until 2023.</p><p>DAUNTING CHALLENGES AHEAD: These divergent recovery paths are likely to create wider gaps in living standards across countries compared to pre-pandemic expectations. The average annual loss in per capita GDP over 2020-24, relative to pre-pandemic forecasts, is projected to be 5.7 per cent in low-income countries and 4.7 per cent in emerging markets, while in advanced economies the losses are expected to be smaller at 2.3 per cent. Such losses are reversing gains in poverty reduction, with an additional 95 million people expected to have entered the ranks of the extreme poor in 2020 compared with pre-pandemic projections.</p><p>Uneven recoveries are also occurring within countries as young and lower-skilled workers remain more heavily affected. Women have also suffered more, especially in emerging market and developing economies. Because the crisis has accelerated the transformative forces of digitalisation and automation, many of the jobs lost are unlikely to return, requiring worker reallocation across sectors-which often comes with severe earnings penalties.</p><p>Swift policy action worldwide, including $16 trillion in fiscal support, prevented far worse outcomes. Our estimates suggest last year's severe collapse could have been three times worse had it not been for such support.</p><p>Because a financial crisis was averted, medium-term losses are expected to be smaller than after the 2008 global financial crisis, at around 3 per cent. However, unlike after the 2008 crisis, it is emerging markets and low-income countries that are expected to suffer greater scarring given their more limited policy space.</p><p>A high degree of uncertainty surrounds our projections. Faster progress with vaccinations can uplift the forecast, while a more prolonged pandemic with virus variants that evade vaccines can lead to a sharp downgrade. Multispeed recoveries could pose financial risks if interest rates in the United States rise further in unexpected ways. This could cause inflated asset valuations to unwind in a disorderly manner, financial conditions to tighten sharply, and recovery prospects to deteriorate, especially for some highly leveraged emerging markets and developing economies.</p><p>WORKING TOGETHER TO GIVE PEOPLE A FAIR SHOT: Policymakers will need to continue supporting their economies while dealing with more limited policy space and higher debt levels than prior to the pandemic. This requires better-targeted measures to leave space for prolonged support if needed. With multispeed recoveries, a tailored approach is necessary, with policies well-calibrated to the stage of the pandemic, the strength of the economic recovery, and the structural characteristics of individual countries.</p><p>Right now, the emphasis should be on escaping the health crisis by prioritising healthcare spending-on vaccinations, treatments, and healthcare infrastructure. Fiscal support should be well targeted to affected households and firms. Monetary policy should remain accommodative (where inflation is well behaved), while proactively addressing financial stability risks using macro prudential tools.</p><p>As the pandemic is beaten back and labour market conditions normalise, support such as worker retention measures should be gradually scaled back. At that point, more emphasis should be placed on reallocating workers, including through targeted hiring subsidies, and reskilling of workers. As exceptional measures such as moratoria on loan payments are withdrawn, firm insolvencies could rise sharply and put one in ten jobs at risk in many countries. To limit long-term damage countries should consider converting previous liquidity support (loans) into equity-like support for viable firms, while developing out-of-court restructuring frameworks to expedite eventual bankruptcies. Resources should also be devoted to helping children catch-up on lost instructional time during the pandemic. Once the health crisis is over, policy efforts can focus more on building resilient, inclusive, and greener economies, both to bolster the recovery and to raise potential output. The priorities should include green infrastructure investment to help mitigate climate change, digital infrastructure investment to boost productive capacity, and strengthening social assistance to arrest rising inequality.</p><p>Financing these endeavours will be more difficult for economies with limited fiscal space. In such cases, improving tax capacity, increasing tax progressivity (on incomes, property, and inheritance taxation), deploying carbon pricing, and eliminating wasteful expenditures will be essential. All countries should anchor policies in credible medium-term frameworks and adhere to the highest standards of debt transparency to help contain borrowing costs and eventually reduce debt and rebuild buffers for the future.</p><p>On the international stage, first and foremost, countries need to work together to ensure universal vaccination. While some countries will get to widespread vaccinations by this summer, most, especially low-income countries will likely have to wait until end-2022. Speeding up vaccinations will require ramping up vaccine production and distribution, avoiding export controls, fully funding the COVAX facility on which many low-income countries rely for doses, and ensuring equitable global transfers of excess doses.</p><p>Policymakers should also continue to ensure adequate access to international liquidity. Major central banks should provide clear guidance on future actions with ample time to prepare, to avoid \"taper-tantrum\" kinds of episodes as occurred in 2013. Low-income countries will benefit from further extending the pause on debt repayments under the Debt Service Suspension Initiative and operationalizing the G20 Common Framework for orderly debt restructuring. A new allocation of the IMF's Special Drawing Rights will provide needed liquidity protection in highly uncertain times.</p><p>Even while all eyes are on the pandemic, it is essential that progress is made on resolving trade and technology tensions. Countries should also cooperate on climate change mitigation, on modernising international corporate taxation, and on measures to limit cross-border profit shifting, tax avoidance, and evasion.</p><p>Over the past year, we have seen significant innovations in economic policy and massively scaled-up support at the national level, particularly among advanced economies that have been able to afford these initiatives. A similarly ambitious effort is now needed at the multilateral level to secure the recovery and build forward better. Without additional efforts to give all people a fair shot, cross-country gaps in living standards could widen significantly and decades-long progress in global poverty reduction could reverse.</p><p>Dr Gita Gopinath is the Economic Counsellor and Director of the Research Department at the International Monetary Fund (IMF).</p><p>The piece is excerpted from IMFBlog <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.blogs.imf.org\">www.blogs.imf.org</url></p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

He has also pointed out in the virtual climate summit convened by him with the assistance of United States Special Presidential Envoy for Climate John Kerry that there was a moral and economic imperative to immediately act on climate change. Underlining the need to initiate new carbon-cutting measures, Biden has added that \"the signs are unmistakable, the science is undeniable and the cost of inaction keeps mounting\". He also reiterated that unlike his predecessor Trump, he was not walking away from the potentially horrific scenario but ensuring that the US has strong resolve in taking the required pre-emptive action.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The US has pledged to cut carbon emissions by 50-52 per cent below 2005 levels by the end of this decade. This new pledge, unveiled at the virtual summit of 40 global leaders, essentially doubled the US previous promise. The Americans hope that their ambitious new plan will encourage China, India and others to go further before the crucial COP26 meeting, in Glasgow in November.</p><p>However, there is some scepticism about the ability of the US to deliver on their new target, given the divided nature of American politics. The fact that President Biden is prepared to go slightly beyond this level will be a welcome surprise to many scientists and campaigners. \"By announcing a bold target of cutting emissions 50-52 per cent below 2005 by the end of the decade, President Biden has met the moment and the urgency that the climate crisis demands, said Nathaniel Keohane from the US Environmental Defence Fund. \"This target aligns with what the science says is necessary to put the world on the path to a safer climate, and vaults the U.S. into the top tier of world leaders on climate ambition.\"</p><p>It may be recalled that Biden was criticised by the left wing of the Democratic Party for not signing up to the highly ambitious Green New Deal. He answered his critics by promising to make the environment a key plank of his presidency. He appears to have taken some significant steps in this regard- (a) reinstated US membership of the Paris climate accord, (b) paused oil and gas drilling leases on federal land, (c) appointed John Kerry as a climate envoy, (d) secured a loose joint commitment with China to work together and (e) organised a global, two-day summit for Earth Day.</p><p>Welcoming the US's \"return to the multilateral climate governance process\", China's Xi has renewed his pledge for China to become carbon neutral by 2060. He has also urged other leaders to take \"unprecedented ambition and action\". It has also been indicated that \"China will scale up its intended nationally determined contributions to the Paris agreement by adopting more vigorous policies and measures. In this context Beijing will strictly control coal-fired power generation projects and limit the increase in coal consumption over the next five years. One needs to remember that China leads the world in the deployment of clean-energy technologies. Analysts have however pointed out that to reach net-zero emissions in less than 30 years, the country will have to increase and refine its efforts. In this context China has already launched a number of initiatives, such as green infrastructure and transport and finance as part of its Belt and Road initiative. It needs to be understood here that no global solution to climate change is likely without the US and China, since the world's top two economies together account for nearly half of the world's total greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>Consistent with this effort Japan has also indicated that Japan plans to up its emissions cutting pledge for 2030. Their new target will be a 46 per cent cut in carbon by the end of the decade compared to 2013 levels.</p><p>The other participants in this virtual summit of 40 heads of governments and states also included several other world leaders including- Russian President Vladimir Putin, Canadian Prime Minister Trudeau, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and also UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres.</p><p>We, from Bangladesh, felt happy and proud that our Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina had been particularly invited by Biden, through John Kerry, on April 9, to also participate in this important meeting. This was international recognition for a leader who is also the Chair of the Climate Vulnerable Forum-CVF and V20.</p><p>The return of the United States to the Paris agreement and its strong political commitment has made Bangladesh 'optimistic' that the annual target of $100 billion global climate fund will be ensured this time. It may be recalled that ensuring this fund from 2020 onwards for the vulnerable countries was a pledge that had been made in the Paris climate agreement. Unfortunately, it could not be fulfilled principally due to the US's withdrawal from the agreement during the Donald Trump Administration.</p><p>Prime Minister Hasina deeply appreciated the United States' return to the Paris Climate Agreement and promised to engage in this regard with the international community. She also pointed out that \"despite being a climate vulnerable country with resource constraints, Bangladesh had emerged as a global leader on adaptation and mitigation\". She also indicated that every year Bangladesh was spending about 5 billion dollars-- about 2.5 per cent of our GDP, on climate adaptation and resilience-building measures. It was also reiterated that the world should not only ensure the annual target of 100 billion US dollars but that it should also be balanced 50:50 between adaptation and mitigation with special attention to the vulnerable communities while pursuing resolution of the problems arising within the matrix of 'Loss and Damage'. The country in this regard had already included new sectors in addition to the existing energy, industry and transport sectors in the mitigation process.</p><p>It was also stressed by her that while developed countries were trying to reduce their carbon emissions to keep the global temperature rise at 1.5 degree Celsius, they should also pay attention to another aspect. She correctly reiterated that major economies, international financial institutions and private sectors should come forward for concessional climate financing as well as innovation. It was also put forward that there should be more intensive focus on green economy and carbon neutral technologies with the provision of technology transfer among nations. Such a measure would help all vulnerable countries to play a vital role in international efforts to combat climate change, adapt and build resilience to climate hazards.</p><p>Environmental activists and climatologists have carefully monitored the entire meeting and also the promises made by the world leadership regarding reducing carbon emissions. They have subsequently drawn attention to the fact that before the next COP meeting, they will hopefully be able to receive detailed policies about how such changes will be brought about.</p><p>Some among them have also brought up another important issue. This relates to the oceans all over the world being in serious distress. They have warned that the seas are suffering from overfishing, pollution and aquaculture and it should be the duty of the world leadership to protect the oceans. Otherwise, it will also fuel climate change, because the seas help to regulate global temperatures by taking up CO2 and producing oxygen.</p><p>Some interesting pieces of information have since emerged within this dynamic through a report recently published by the United Nations. It explains how rising carbon dioxide emissions have led to ocean acidification. The significant factors include the following: (a) the number of \"dead zones\", or areas with reduced oxygen in the ocean, has increased from more than 400 globally in 2008 to about 700 in 2019, (b) around 90 per cent of mangrove, sea grass, and marsh plant species as well as 31 per cent of species of sea birds are threatened with extinction, and (c) approximately 15 per cent of all sandy beaches worldwide are seeing retreating shorelines at an average trend of 1 meter per year or more over the last 33 years. This is indeed a matter of serious concern because the seas help to regulate global temperatures by taking up CO2 and producing oxygen.</p><p>The meeting also drew the attention of important civil society institutions who have followed carefully not only the denotations of the impact of the pandemic but also the connotations of climate variability. One such person has been Bill Gates, who heads an umbrella group of sustainable investment organisations. In his pertinent remarks he drew attention to a singular factor-- something which the world leadership must note. He underlined at the summit not only that \"young people are demanding action and rightly so\" but also that \"just using today's technology will not allow us to meet those ambitious goals.\" Such a view has also been supported by the COP26 Coalition, an alliance of civil society groups from Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom who are laying the groundwork to create pressure on negotiators well ahead of the November meeting.</p><p>We also need to note the contents of a study published in March by Climate Action Tracker. It observed that the US would need to slice emissions around 60 per cent in this decade to be consistent with that pathway. Brandon Wu, Washington-based director of ActionAid USA, has also stressed on the associated critical moral considerations--adjusting for wealth and inequality in determining who pays for saving the climate.</p><p>We need to conclude by referring to the statement made by UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres. He has hailed the pledges made at the summit by the world leaders but has also expressed the hope that this will be the turning point that will receive immediate action. This was reflected in his statement, \"Today's summit shows the tide is turning for climate action, but there is still a long way to go\". His anxiety was also mirrored in his declaration that \"extreme weather and climate disruption, fuelled by anthropogenic climate change is affecting lives, destroying livelihoods and forcing many millions from their homes.\"</p><p>It is clear that our efforts can meet with success in controlling greenhouse gas emissions if we all work together, forgetting narrow national interests. We have to save this world despite the numerous existing challenges.

On the face of it, the concept may look like a fantasy but the essence of SDGs is different. In principle, the step towards a water-sustainable city is an amalgamation of various aspects of a city's physical features, social affairs and cultural norms.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The following three dimensions of transformation are essential as part of the interventions of the targeted SDG 6:</p><p>VISIBLE WATER WITH BLUE AND GREEN LANDSCAPE: Visible water means transparent and quality water integrated with the green design concept for all our development phases when water will be valued and demonstrated by a community's ethical conservation practices. In the process, our city strategies would be based on natural processes of water conservation where all water bodies within the city get a natural flow to their destinations, maintaining enough quality through different uses. This means that our water channels must be allowed to run through the city where green buildings are designed or retrofitted to contain natural processes considering the chances of water-logging condition, discharge of pollutants etc. Particularly, rain water or any surface water bodies should be considered treatable and usable resource. We have to minimise runoff of rain water as much as possible, and substitute it for usual water sources in all purposes. Our landscapes will be designed to be ecologically-sensitive so that impermeable land surface can be converted into a permeable one for infiltrating precipitation into the ground.</p><p>In reality, we live in a city with a very poor physical infrastructure where 'green' infrastructure is not much focused, or even bypassed in many development projects. This is due to lack of our awareness and understanding of long-term benefits of a sustainable city. The service components are not properly designed on evaluating the natural processes of ecosystems. In the present context of our city infrastructure, promoting green infrastructure can contribute to making the water bodies visible rather than capturing and controlling nature. The process allows city dwellers to rely on 'local' water resources.</p><p>CULTURE OF CONSERVATION PRACTICES: Water is a basic need for human existence on the Earth. In general, it is used for three major purposes of our everyday life-- domestic, agriculture and industry. Among these sectors, household consumption of water is the smallest, but has a great potential impact. A study shows, over half of all accessible water runs off. Recently, household water consumption is considered the largest growing sector with about 80 per cent more consumption expected in the next 25 years. However, an adoption of some strategies and social behaviours can significantly reduce water consumption at home or outside.</p><p>The conservation ethics are very important in respect of water consumption practices, which ultimately have positive impacts on conservation of all natural resources including energy. For a water sustainable city, it must be embedded in the natural systems where some essential strategies are: 1) urban slum must be discouraged within the natural system, 2) minimisation of the size of water networks (more zoning systems in water distribution and collection, so that water use decisions will be connected closely), 3) all types of energy use related to water networks are minimised, or conducted through renewable energy resources (e.g. per household level water/natural gas utility bill by 'meter' system, minimising burning of natural gas for purifying water for drinking etc), 4) modifying and using modern devices for toilet (flashing and other behavioural changes), bathroom (less consuming shower, tap, others), washing (less consuming washing equipment, behavioural change in dish and cloth washing), food preparation etc. 5) recovery and reuse can be practised through green building design, city corporation planning, campaigning and citizens' actions.</p><p>Water consumption should be linked to local sources of water like rain water or other surface water sources. All sources will have best of use without releasing pollutants into water, which means the quality of water is preserved for different purposes and not wasted. We have to identify the leaking points and system loss of the water distribution channel as it is a part of water conservation practice. A comprehensive household rebate packages on water consumption pattern and award certification for green developments may be promoted at the community level upon meeting the specific criteria.</p><p>SHARED RESPONSIBILITY: Since sustainability is achieved in a sector through integration and engaging all beneficiary voices, integration of all citizens' demand in the city planning is essential. The city administration should seek links for collaboration and encourage a wider participation in policy or decision making processes. Ensuring participation not only means delegation of responsibilities, but also the possibility of an integration of various forms of local expertise at each point of the processes.</p><p>At the foundation of planning a sustainable city lies a comprehensive change in people's daily activities instead of manipulation of nature. People usually understand that a city's water sustainability is mostly about governance involving people, institutions and rules. But their sense of responsibilities finally influences them to get involved in planning processes. Capacity building and skill development of the communities should be organised on the basis of private-public partnerships.</p><p>This process already exists but a scale-up is needed. All stakeholders must be interconnected technologically and rely on digitisation process to access data, share data, support cooperation, integration and contribute to the overall sustainable development.</p><p>The writer is Senior Research Associate and sustainability professional at BRAC Research and Evaluation Division</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:polin.kumar@brac.net\">polin.kumar@brac.net</email></p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

Population growth could cause global demand for water to outpace supply by mid-century if current levels of consumption continue, according to a recent study. Periods of increased demand for water - often coinciding with population growth or other major demographic and social changes - were followed by periods of rapid innovation of new water technologies that helped ease or end any shortages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Recent estimates by the United Nations (UN) reveal that around 1.2 billion people, around 20 per cent of the world's entire population, were living in areas where the limits of sustainable water use had already been reached or breached. It is high time that the issue is placed high on the global agenda. In fact, the world is urgently required to adapt to the reality. There is still enough water for all of us if and only if we keep it clean and share the same. In fact, we are faced with a challenge that says we must make safer stores of water available to all.</p><p>Researchers from Duke University used a delayed-feedback mathematical model that analyses historic data to help project future trends and identified a regularly recurring pattern of global water use in recent centuries. Based on this recurring pattern, they predicted a similar period of innovation could occur in coming decades.</p><p>In India, around 10 per cent of the rural and urban population still do not have access to regular safe drinking water although accessibility to drinking water increased considerably during the last decade in particular. The condition even goes from bad to worse in many parts of the country, especially during the critical summer days. Excessive extraction of groundwater to meet agriculture, industrial and domestic demands is steadily harming the rural and urban settlements.</p><p>Not only in India, it is a global phenomenon that calls for immediate attention so that things do not go from bad to worse. It is essential for survival - more important than anything else - the most crucial factor considered from the viewpoint of protecting environment, alleviating poverty and promoting development. At present, more than two and a half billion people across the globe maintain the most abysmal standards of hygiene and sanitation. Waste of water and absence of regular clean supply of water simultaneously coexist not only in the burgeoning metropolis, but also in rural regions.</p><p>HEAT IS ON: Faced with an ever-increasing demand for water, countries and municipalities are showing a growing interest in green solutions. China, for example, recently initiated a project styled \"Sponge City\" to improve availability of water in urban settlements. By 2020, it will build 16 pilot Sponge Cities across the country. Their goal is to recycle 70 per cent of rainwater through greater soil permeation, retention and storage, water purification and the restoration of adjacent wetlands.</p><p>The system of rice intensification, originally introduced in Madagascar, helps restore hydrological and ecological functioning of soil rather than using new crop varieties or chemical products. It enables savings of 25 to 50 per cent in water requirements and 80 to 90 per cent in seeds while raising paddy output by 25 to 50 per cent, depending on the region where it is implemented.</p><p>It is good to note that companies are coming up steadily on this score. A company named Ecolab, which provides its service to about 40,000 customers in more than 170 countries around the world, has been taking in positive moves - promises to maximise asset life. There is a positive impact on process efficiency too. Ecolab intends to further leverage lot and machine learning to enhance its proactive services to ensure that water is conserved and available to both business and the communities they operate in. Hopefully, the next generation 3D TRASAR technology reduces, reuses and recycles water. The technology cannot only monitor the water use at a customer's site and alert us whenever things go out of control, but can also take remedial actions based on the levels stress on the systems and can induce chemicals or reduce water use to maximise the life of the asset as well as minimise the use of water.</p><p>The ultimate aim of Ecolab is to bring industries to ZLD (zero liquid discharge). \"Just by installing a 3D TRASAR on their cooling towers, boilers, reverse osmosis systems, waste water systems, we can bring down water consumption by almost 30 per cent. The energy reduction would be in the range of 15 - 20 per cent. All these do not include any option for recycling. If we find recycling opportunities, we can bring down water consumption to almost 100 per cent\", claims Ecolab.</p><p>GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE AS OPPOSED TO TRADITIONAL GREY INFRASTRUCTURE: Green infrastructure focuses on preserving the functions of ecosystems, both natural and built, and environmental engineering rather than civil engineering to improve the management of water resources. This has multiple applications in agriculture, the greatest consumer of water by far. Green infrastructure can help reduce pressures on land use while limiting pollution, soil erosion and water requirements by contributing to the development of more effective and economic irrigation systems, for example.</p><p>It is estimated that agricultural production could be increased by about 20 per cent worldwide if greener water management practices were used. One study reviewed agricultural development projects in 57 low-income countries and found that using water more efficiently combined with reductions in the use of pesticides and improvements in soil cover, increased average crop yields by 79 per cent.</p><p>As per the recent study, green solutions have also shown great potential in urban areas. While vegetated walls and roof gardens are perhaps the most recognisable examples, others include measures to recycle and harvest water, water retention hollows to recharge groundwater and the protection of watersheds that supply urban areas. New York City has been protecting its three largest watersheds since the late 1990s. Disposing of the largest unfiltered water supply in the US, the city now saves more than $300 million yearly on water treatment and maintenance costs.</p><p>NATURE-BASED SOLUTION - ONE OF THE WAYS OUT: Nature-based solutions (NBS) can play an important role in improving the supply and quality of water and reducing the impact of natural disasters, according to the 2018 edition of the United Nations World Water Development Report. The study argues that reservoirs, irrigation canals and water treatment plants are not the only water management instruments at our disposal. NBS recognises water not as an isolated element, but as an integral part of a complex natural process that involves evaporation, precipitation and the absorption of water through the soil. The presence and extent of vegetation cover across grasslands, wetlands and forests that influence the water cycle can be the focus for actions to improve the quantity and quality of available water.</p><p>IN LIEU OF CONCLUSION: It is crystal clear that population growth would put further strain on the per capita availability of water. Efforts to enhance drinking water supply must move at a greater speed so as to cover all of the villages with adequate potable water connection/supply. Technology, needless to say, would play the bigger role in such a context to meet people's basic needs in a sustained manner. Naturally, protecting fresh water reserves, watershed development, chemical treatments following the safety norms, tackling the arsenic and fluoride contamination, among others, could give rich dividends.</p><p>The government has to come up with a new water resource strategy, since the sector needs to become more sustainable, efficient and focused on how water is used and how it reaches people. To ensure economic growth and political stability approach to water management must be positive, forward looking and not myopic! Let there be no water conflicts, conflicts between users and across regions. Water limits are close to being breached in several countries while food output has to increase by up to 100 per cent by 2050 to sustain a growing world population, according to the UN. The World Bank rightly said that key problems in India's water sector includes data secrecy, competition for resources, too much focus on increasing supply and not enough on management.</p><p>The UNESCO Director General's opinion is something to take note of: \"We need new solutions in managing water resources so as to meet emerging challenges to water security caused by population growth and climate change. If we do nothing, some five billion people will be living in areas with poor access to water by 2050. World Water Development Report 2018 proposes solutions that are based on nature to manage water better. This is a major task all of us need to accomplish together responsibly so as to avoid water related conflicts\".</p><p>Thus the immediate need is to invest in a reliable, proven and advanced water purification system that guarantees the public - in rural and urban areas - safe and pure drinking water at all times. Latest technology available on this score must be extensively made for use in a time-bound manner to protect the human beings from getting crushed via pollution routes. Whatever it is, we are still at a very early stage of awakening. A realistic approach - obviously not by holding seminars and observance of World Water Day only - can mitigate the incidence.</p><p>The responsibility lies equally with the government sector as well as the private sector starting from checking the unrestricted exploitation of groundwater, encouraging planned urbanisation, optimisation of use, restricting the flow of effluents from industrial units to the rivers with stricter supervision and effectively discharging the duties and responsibilities related to corporate social responsibility.</p><p>A forward-looking realistic plan has to focus on improving data collection for the location and types of water resources, promoting water-saving farming technologies, developing sewage treatment facilities alongside water projects, and establishing a national monitoring body and a new legal framework for the sector. What is obvious enough is that water recycling and finding better ways to remove salt from seawater hold the key.</p><p>Dr BK Mukhopadhyay, a noted Management Economist and an International Commentator on Business and Economic Affairs, is Principal [Faculty of Management Studies] of ICFAI University, Tripura, India. <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:m.bibhas@gmail.com\">m.bibhas@gmail.com</email></p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The Financial Express.

The GTRP is the road map endorsed by TRC leaders in 2010 at the International Tiger Forum in St. Petersburg, Russian Federation, to achieve the goal of the St. Petersburg Declaration on Tiger Conservation: double the number of wild tigers globally by 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Building on the pledges of the St. Petersburg Declaration, the Thimphu Affirmative Nine-Point Action Agenda, which emerged from the 2nd Asian Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation, held in Bhutan in November 2012, outlines areas to be targeted for intensified efforts by the TRCs and partners.</p><p>In taking stock of the GTRP Implementation Plan 2013-14 based on the Thimphu Agenda, conference participants agreed that significant progress has been achieved in meeting the goals of the Thimphu Agenda and in addressing the wild tiger's decline toward extinction. Notable achievements include adopting new legislation and policies, creating new protected areas, growing transboundary collaboration, building capacity of frontline staff, and reaching out for the participation of the private sector; however, some areas of continued concern remain. Participants therefore recommend the following actions to advance implementation within the timelines of the Thimphu Agenda:</p><p>1. To strengthen FRONTLINES: Continue to increase investment in frontline staff remuneration, benefits (inter alia, risk allowances, rations, and improved quality of life), recognition, skills development, and field equipment and tools, including communications and transportation. Continue to professionalize their service through increased use of technology-based patrolling in protected areas and other tiger habitats. Maintain robust patrolling databases and improve intelligence-led enforcement.</p><p>2. To conserve HABITAT: Map and secure tiger habitat (protected areas, buffer zones, corridors, and other units) and land uses in tiger landscapes, employing new tools and technology for mapping and monitoring habitat. Assess and maintain functionality of corridors. Regularly assess management effectiveness in tiger protected areas. Convene national- or provincial-level meetings and working groups with relevant development sectors to develop Smart Green Infrastructure (SGI) applications in tiger landscapes threatened by infrastructure.</p><p>3. To engage COMMUNITIES: Expand capacity to deal with human-tiger conflict, which may increase with tiger or prey recovery, through national and local conflict-relief funds and publicize these efforts among affected communities. Make communities partners in conservation.</p><p>4. To enhance COLLABORATION: Actively engage with neighboring TRCs in transboundary landscape management. Actively improve international intelligence sharing, through existing channels, leading to enforcement operations including those in hot spots of illegal tiger trade. Actively promote multi-agency and multi-country collaborations through organizations such as SAWEN and ASEAN WEN. Make use of the valuable ICCWC Wildlife and Forest Crime Analytic Toolkit, which was successfully piloted in two TRCs.</p><p>5. To launch RESTORATION: TRCs and partners with the expertise commit to support ongoing plans of Kazakhstan, Cambodia, and China and encourage other countries and sites with low tiger densities to advance feasibility planning for restoration.</p><p>6. To increase the FLOW OF FUNDS: Continue to seek increasing governmental budgets for tiger conservation. Request development partners and donors to devote attention to the TRCs and themes that are underfunded. Establish or enhance national systems for tracking utilization of financial resources for tiger conservation. Identify points of entry to access funding sources related to climate change adaptation and to smart green infrastructure for the GTRP.</p><p>7. To develop new partnerships with BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY: Take advantage of the Confederation of Indian Industry's (CII) offer to support and facilitate TRCs interested in industry engagement and seek other opportunities to leverage private-sector support.</p><p>8. To build comprehensive AWARENESS and reduce illicit demand: Conduct targeted and well-researched and designed programs to reduce illicit demand for tiger parts and for prey species. Urgently assist in development of the Global Support Program for demand reduction. To support campaigns to reduce illicit demand, review laws and policies to ensure they contribute to these efforts.</p><p>9.a. To MONITOR tigers, prey, and habitat: By 2016, complete science-based national tiger monitoring and assessment to determine tiger population, prey, and habitat status in all tiger habitat. Undertake reserve-specific tiger monitoring using camera traps, DNA analysis ensuring transparency, or other intelligent technologies) to build up national tiger databases.</p><p>9.b. To MONITOR GTRP implementation: Continue to improve program implementation and coordination through refinement of Key Performance Indicators, increased capacity to gather and report data, and harmonizing KPIs to the Thimphu Agenda. Develop a more systematic and periodic monitoring and reporting strategy.</p><p>These recommendations will form the basis for the GTRP Implementation Plan 2015-2016, which will be presented for endorsement at the 3rd Asian Ministerial Conference on Tiger Conservation.</p><p>The TRCs appreciate the commitment of the Government of Bangladesh under the dynamic leadership of the Honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in tiger conservation.

The forest fires were mostly initiated by Brazilian ranchers. About nine thousand square kilometers of tropical forests have been cleared for beef industry. The incident is having massive ecological impact in terms of erosion, carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide emission and other health hazards. Even still, many in Brazilian government and forest adjacent regions seemed content as the large clearings are now prepared for cattle ranching. Thus thousands of trees are sacrificed for the sake of development, paying little attention to the impact on climate and surroundings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since historical times, development strategy focused on fighting against nature, extracting natural resources without caring about ecology or ecosystems. And today, the effect of these rampant development strategies has posed us with a new threat, climate change. Now governments are struggling to balance between the never ending demand for development and climate change.</p><p>The struggle is one of many in developing world. Looming adverse effects of climate change is already creating worldwide concerns. The capital of Indonesia, Jakarta is sinking; Ice caps are melting, salinity and the rise of sea levels are concerning islands and coastal nations. Scientists around the world are trying to merge a way between climate change adaptions and economic development. Merged under a relatively new concept named Nature based Solutions (NbS); the aim is to find a way of development which will be based on Natural and eco-friendly solutions.</p><p>Nature-based Solutions (NbS)</p><p>Nature based Solutions involve wide range of actions. Protection and management of natural environment and ecosystems, the incorporation of green and blue infrastructure in urban areas and application of ecosystem based principles in the agricultural system are to name a few. The concept is based on the knowledge that natural and carefully managed ecosystems can produce diverse range of goods and services like storing carbon, controlling floods and providing clean water, food, fuel, medicine and genetic resources. Nature-based Solutions is an umbrella concept involving nature-based approaches like Green Infrastructure (GI), Ecosystem-based Adaptation (EbA) and mitigation (EbM) and eco-disaster risk reduction (Eco-DRR).</p><p>NbS are emerging as an integrated approach that can reduce trade-offs and promote synergies among the Sustainable Development Goals. For example, forests can be restored in upper catchments to help protect the downstream communities from flooding at the same time as increasing carbon sequestration and protecting biodiversity. Meanwhile, planting trees and increasing green space in cities can help with cooling and flood abatement, while storing carbon, mitigating against air pollution, and providing recreation and mental health benefits. NbS can deliver multiple benefits. NbS are low cost and works as a safety barrier against climate change. Consequently, NbS were endorsed in both recent IPCC Reports and are one of several keys \"action portfolios\" at UN Climate Summit in New York in September 2019. NbS tries to put a link between conventional conservation and climate change adaptation techniques with economic development. The need for nature positive business solutions are also expressed by World Economic Forum's (WEF) Global Risks Report 2019.</p><p>Nature-based Solutions and Bangladesh</p><p>Jobs and modern enmities seem to come at a huge, often unrepairable cost. Government and general mass wants development and vibrant economy. Nature seems to come second and this notion is degrading ecosystems everywhere. Bangladesh is no different. This tiny piece of land hosts wetlands, rivers, mountain and mangrove forests, sandy beaches and numerous islands. Population growth and a rapidly expanding economy is eating away these vital areas. And every project is raising the age old dichotomy. Nature or economic wellbeing? Governments so far seems to prefer the first one. But with the advent of climatic change and worldwide concern of its adverse effect has propelled practitioners and researchers to find a more suitable environment friendly development strategy.</p><p>Natural systems like the Sundarbans works as a safety net against ever increasing number of natural disasters that hit the coastal areas of Bangladesh at a regular basis. The country has a very dense population, a fast growing economy and increasing rate of pollution and other hazards as a result of this development. Our development goals so far has been focused on economic development, thus we have already wasted much of our natural forest, wetlands, rivers and other important ecosystems. Urban developments too have been done without proper implementation of any sound planning. Thus, Bangladesh is progressing in economic terms, but valuable natural resources are lost every day.</p><p>As a country prone to environmental disaster and climate change, Bangladesh has long been using various Nature-based Solutions. Some of these concepts are mixed plantation, floating cultivation of rice and vegetables, modern wetland management techniques and organic fertilizers. As an agricultural country, Bangladesh possesses many traditional expertise which can minimize the effect on environment. However, several issues are consistently holding back the potential of these NbS practices.</p><p>Challenges for Bangladesh</p><p>Bangladesh lacks proper distribution system of agricultural and forest products. Poor infrastructure creates a huge difference in price and distribution mechanisms. Another crucial problem is the nation's lack of any overall, comprehensive plan. Forest and agricultural extension officials think that small scale projects have been very successful but the absence of any comprehensiveness is decimating the little progress.</p><p>Many environmental projects in Bangladesh are foreign funded. Little attention is given to the economic viability. When funds dry up, the projects are stalled, losing all the good gains. Besides, without a proper plan for public engagement, communities are little interested or available to take part in the conservation. As a result, no longstanding impact is achieved.</p><p>The scale of destruction due to wrong policy is astounding. For example, Chittagong Hill Tracts used to be vast, hilly region covered with lush tropical forest. Traditional Jhum/Slash and Burn cultivation has already decimated most of the forests there. Then the government initiated numerous monoculture projects which replaced the old growth vegetation. Result? Erosion, dying streams, less ecological diversity and land slide. Even today, Chittagong Hill Tracts is continuously being degraded. Despite several successful project to replace jhum cultivation and monoculture, little has been changed there.</p><p>Bangladesh also has an astounding lack of studies on environment. Despite being a riverine country, no comprehensive studies on them are found. New findings and approaches are seldom institutionalized and in the end, public are mostly unware of the projects and their impacts. The heavy top down approach in conservation failed in almost every other states and the same is going to happen if Bangladesh doesn't try other ways.</p><p>The climate change phenomenon has put the world in front of a new challenge. NbS are increasingly being viewed as a way to reconcile economic development with the stewardship of ecosystems, and in doing so effectively enable sustainable development. No doubt NbS has huge potential to battle climate change. However, it's a matter of debate about whether Bangladeshi stakeholders have the capacity to carry out NbS solutions in a countrywide scale.</p><p>In short, a new bottom up approach is needed to implement NbS solutions to get viable results.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Dhaka Courier.

Bangladesh Bank's resolute thrusts upon instilling effective corporate governance practices and its emphasis on ensuring proper internal controls are firmly grounded on transparency and accountability; and towards ingraining inclusive and environmentally sustainable financing ethos in the financial sector.</p><p>Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) initiatives of the banking sector, guided by Bangladesh Bank, are also growing robustly. These ethically oriented social initiatives are compensating to an extent for sub-optimal performance on other ethical criteria.</p><p>Environmentally sustainable approaches for rapid poverty eradication by narrowing down inequalities in the advancement of opportunities are our policy priorities in promoting socially responsible, inclusive and sustainable financing. We have therefore identified four broad areas: agriculture, SMEs, modernization of payment system, and adoption of environmentally benign 'green' output practices.</p><p>Priority of rural agriculture and women entrepreneurs in access to finance also figures importantly in our initiatives. The consultatively set targets for these priority areas are incremental, aimed at raising and stabilizing sustainable financing to adequate levels.</p><p>After decades of globalization driven growth, global trade growth has now slowed, and is actually trailing global output growth. This indicates that the potential for export-led growth will be harder to realize unless it takes advantage of upcoming new opportunities in markets for goods and services produced using environmentally sustainable 'green' output processes and practices.</p><p>The Bangladesh government and the Bangladesh Bank have already gained global attention by being early movers in this direction; with enablement and facilitation steps for 'green' transition. To name a few, relocation of our leather sector manufacturers to an area well serviced with ETP facilities is nearing completion. Bangladesh Bank has also lined up a USD 200 million longer term fund called 'Green Transformation Fund' to support green transition of manufacturing practices in the export oriented textiles and leather sectors. These are only small initial steps, with lots more to do in our intended countrywide transition to environmentally sustainable output practices and lifestyles.</p><p>Our concerted effort towards building an environmentally sustainable green economy will position us well to achieve the SDGs well ahead of time as we did in case of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). We are quite confident that we can do this given the high level of motivation and commitment in our financial community. For some years now, BSREA has been playing a major role in scaling up solar and renewable energy in Bangladesh through encouraging and facilitating green loans for projects like solar home and irrigation system, and assisting policymakers in offering incentives for renewable energy projects.

In near future, it is expected that green bonds will be available in Bangladesh financial market as an investment instrument.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2008, the World Bank launched the 'Strategic Framework for Development and Climate Change' to help stimulate and coordinate public and private sector activity in combating climate change. African Development Bank, Asian Development Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund are vowed to work more closely with private and public sector partners to help mobilise the resources needed to meet the historic challenge of achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).</p><p>Green bonds are often identical to traditional bonds in structure, risks and returns, except that the capital is raised from green bond funds for clean energy, energy efficiency, low carbon vehicle, smart grid, agriculture and forestry, natural resource mitigation or similar projects. These are marketed as 'green' at the time of issuance. Issuers are expected to provide a description of projects to be funded at the time of issuance and to ensure segregation of project funds and provide post-project reporting or verification about how the funds will be used.</p><p>The issuer of the green bonds can be banks, non-banking financial institutions, companies, SMEs and other financial institutions. On the other hand, the investors of green bond are typically institutional investors. Other buyers include investment managers, governments and corporate investors. The financing part of green bond should focus on the large-scale fund, capital-intensive green infrastructure projects, such as energy efficiency projects, transit, or renewable powers among many others, that can be repaid from steady, modest and long-term cash flows.</p><p>The bio-financing projects for green bond funds can be large bio-gas plants, bio-energy driven power generation plants etc. Solar-financing projects for green bond funds can be 1-mw or above solar PV plants, pumping through solar pumps, solar cooker assembly plants, solar water heater assembly plants, solar air heater and cooling assembly plants, solar driven cold storages. The other financing projects for green bond funds can be power switch assembly plants for power saving, hybrid cook stove assembly plants, LED light or tube light assembly plants, power generation from municipal waste, compost fertiliser generation from municipal waste, recyclable non-oven polypropylene yarn and baggage manufacturing, palm-oil production plants, supplying and purifying of surface water project, establishing green industry and ensuring work environment and safety in the textile and garment industries.</p><p>Climate change affects us all. But it is likely to hit the developing countries the hardest. Its potential effects on temperatures, precipitation patterns, sea levels rise and frequency of climate-related disasters pose risks for agriculture, food and water supplies. The recent gains in the fight against poverty, hunger and disease, and the lives and livelihoods of people in developing countries are at stake now. Tackling this immense challenge must involve urgent mitigation .Addressing climate change requires unprecedented global cooperation across borders.</p><p>The World Bank Group is providing support to developing countries and contributing to a global solution, while tailoring our approach to the diversified needs of developing country partners. We are strengthening and building climate change partnerships with our member governments and with a wide array of organisations. The World Bank Green Bond raises funds from fixed income investors to support World Bank lending on eligible projects that seek to mitigate climate change or to help affected people adapt to it. The product was designed in partnership with Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken (SEB) to respond to specific investor demand for a triple-A rated fixed income product that supports projects that address the climate challenge. Since 2008 till now, the World Bank has issued around $8.5 billion in green bonds through 100 transactions in 18 currencies. The World Bank Green Bonds are an opportunity to invest in climate solutions through a high-quality credit fixed income product. The triple-A credit quality of the green bonds is the same as for any other World Bank bonds.</p><p>Besides the World Bank initiatives, there are other fascinating examples of green bonds issued for environmentally focused projects around the world. In the US, federal institutions are pioneering the use of green bonds for re-development of brown field sites, following the adoption of the America Jobs Creation Act 2004 and, specifically, its amendment titled 'Brownfields Demonstration Program for Qualified Green Building and Sustainable Design Projects'. In Europe, in May 2007 the European Investment Bank issued Climate Awareness Bonds raising more than 1 bn with a 5-year maturity plan. The capital is to be invested in renewable energy and energy efficiency projects, aimed at bringing down green house gas emissions and protecting the climate. In Canada, there are serious proposals for issuing government-backed green bonds to stimulate the deployment of renewable energy production.

Starting to think of 'green city' could lead us to overcome the prospective many challenges across the globe. But, a misconception of the greenest city is still a big problem for many, even for me when I seek for the differences between 'eco' and 'green'. Actually, by definition the meaning of these two terms is slightly different; but, in reality, there is no difference in achieving quality lives between eco-city and green city. By the concept of 'eco-ing' or 'greening' in city development, the main objective is to work for enhancing congenial environment in our daily lives. Elaborately, the green city desires to notify and inspire the planning and development of the urban areas within some special interests with government, non-government companies and common citizens. In general observation, people think that ensuring a green city means a city dominated by trees; but the process of greening is not only stimulated by enhancing forest resources, but also many other factors that act as a holistic approach to city planning and designing.</p><p>Most of our cities lack clean environment for our living; more importantly, lack of clean air and water. But, unfortunately, where are we heading for in ensuring our living standards in our cities? Since the recent years, we have achieved a status of being one of the worst cities in the world. I've been very shocked about our pessimistic thinking about something. For example, we, individually and intentionally pollute our water, air, food, land and many things; and we know doing such things are bad for our society, even we also know we are destroying myself, my family and children through our regular activities. To get rid of such activities, the most important things are our ethical values and self awareness at first.</p><p>The Green City functions require the critical green elements. Presently, about a half of the global population live in cities and based on the United Nations estimation, the city population will increase by 70% in 2047. For this reason, our present time is very crucial to understand the true value of urban green space. The Green City indicators can be created on the guidelines of the Green City philosophy applied in many countries. This is a global approach that makes green space in the regenerative ways considering the principles of Grey, Red and Blue in the master plan. It utilises evidence-based disputes to highlight the significance of green elements and places them as primary solutions and responses to several challenges of modern life - from stress, obesity or burn-out to be prepared for the climate-change impacts. It argues that the green economy is an agenda for prioritised investment in green infrastructure.</p><p>In the process of greening, it has found a number of key areas which promote quantifiable benefits. These areas seek top to bottom guidelines in order to demonstrate how each guideline strengthens the integral worthiness of the greening process. However, we can understand the considerable issues through the greening process based on the principles of grey, red and blue plans- as already mentioned before. More specifically, Grey plans are based on infrastructure projects that incorporate green at the early stages of designing new roads, transportation facilities and any other relevant projects by facilitating sufficient spaces for trees and other green system like a fountain, lake, pond, park etc. Higher planned development brings us closer to the city flavor with green transit. The road users' experiences are therefore very significant and can be accomplished to improve Grey plans.</p><p>Red plans - this type of plans will be development of new residential and commercial areas that should integrate urban forests into the city design in order to make a green building block. In the city spaces, a collection of all trees refers to an urban forest which can differ anywhere in the city. Urban forests should be counted or distributed through different types of trees, forest, park, green roofs, ecological corridor, recreational garden, front garden or plaza. For an ideal dense city, a liveable neighbourhood should contain 15-20 per cent greenery.</p><p>Blue plans - the last option of the greening process incorporates water structure development that should be designed in some technical ways, guided by an expert team of environmentalists, urban planners, engineers, landscape architects and others, if the initial team thinks to include them in the designing process.</p><p>These three plans are the guiding principles that lead the way to create a truly green city and integrate all the 10 major components of city development, such as eco building, sustainable land use, renewable energy, clean air, waste management, water management, environmental management, sanitation, green economy and green transportation.</p><p>The greening system regulates climate change impact which is a global agenda. Green building decreases temperature, increases biodiversity, retains water, decreases the energy needs in residential areas or buildings and eliminate air pollutants. A good plan is our urgent need in view of the limited budget and resources. And, in case of the present trend of the country's development, the lack of coordination in implementing different development projects and ethical violence of good governance plague our city development.</p><p>Finally, we believe green cities must have clean air and water, energy from renewable sources and a pollution-free transport system. Our authority should effectively utilise long-term solutions that are sustainable. Our decision makers should keep in mind a long-term cost-benefit analysis that all of our urban projects should essentially consider the green elements. Developing green spaces can now play a central role in policies related to the greening process.</p><p>The writer is a Researcher on Sustainability at BRAC Research and Evaluation Division.

This is the major conclusion of Habitat III, the third United Nations' Conference on Housing and Sustainable Urban Development that took place in Quito, Ecuador, in 2016. Our cities are growing very quickly and spontaneously. Decreased planning and excessive urban expansion, alongside reduced density, is leading us to unprecedented levels of chaos, urban poverty and environmental degradation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These trends cannot be ignored. In fact, urbanization is increasingly a strategic issue at both national and subnational levels because it affects our immediate living environment: Our cities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"A city that has an advanced model of technology but is badly planned, with outdated legal frameworks or lacking a good financial model, will only aggravate the dysfunction in the city. A 'smart city' is a city that uses technology in a 'smart' way to reinforce the pillars of urbanization.\"</p><p>Along with the rapid growth of urbanization, the proliferation of communication technologies in our cities has become another major trend of our times. Digital technologies have significantly impacted urban development and management in recent years and will continue to do so, contributing in some ways to a more functional development in areas such as transport, governance and energy efficiency. However, we must not count solely on digital technologies and smart cities to solve many of the challenges faced by our urban areas.</p><p>The diagnosis for a more sustainable and \"smart\" urban model is found in five fundamental pillars of urbanization, with Habitat III concluding with the adoption of the \"New Urban Agenda\" - an action-oriented plan based on these pillars. It includes very clear tasks and responsibilities for national and subnational governments. Here are five highlights and practical examples:</p><p>1. National urban policies</p><p>The first of the fundamental pillars of urbanization is the call for national governments to assume their responsibility in the process of urbanization, by implementing properly developed and established national urban policies. Sustainable urbanization must be led by national governments working closely with subnational and local governments.</p><p>The government of Cameroon, UN-Habitat and other stakeholders began formulating and implementing the Cameroonian National Urban Policy in Feb. 2016. The policy will be an instrument for applying a coherent set of decisions in relation to the future of urban areas in Cameroon, drawing upon a process of consultation and coordination among different actors. It will also help the government revise planning tools, improve the implementation of the planning rules and regulations, increase the sources of financing and optimization of public infrastructure, and strengthen the capacities of the stakeholders both at the national and subnational levels.</p><p>2. Establishing rules and regulations</p><p>The second is the categorical need for urbanization to be based in the rule of law. Urbanization without rules and regulations tends to be spontaneous and ad-hoc. As the world's population grows more and more urban, we have no choice but to become more efficient in our urbanization, by establishing rules and regulations, and implementing them.</p><p>Like many developing countries, Zambia is undergoing rapid urbanization, but the current planning system is not equipped to deal with the resulting effects of climate change, resource depletion and economic instability. The planning system has also, to a large extent, failed to meaningfully consider the existing land tenure - an estimated 85 percent of the total land is held in customary tenure - or involve communities and other stakeholders in the planning of urban areas, thus contributing to the problems of spatial marginalization and exclusion.</p><p>To combat this, the government of the Republic of Zambia recently enacted the Urban and Regional Planning Act, the principal legislation for urban land use planning. It aims to fundamentally transform the land use planning system, planning frameworks and planning process.</p><p>3. Urban planning and design</p><p>The third pillar refers to the design of buildable plots and public spaces, and the relationship between the two. Urbanization without the proper allocation of basic space and the correct design of street patterns and buildable plots is doomed to failure.</p><p>Johannesburg's Spatial Development Framework is a policy that addresses spatial inequalities, job-housing mismatch, urban sprawl and fragmentation, exclusion and disconnection of urban areas, inefficient residential densities and land uses, and increasing pressure on the natural environment and green infrastructure.</p><p>The framework links the spatial development of the city with the financial resources available in the municipal budget, and has proposed six priority transformation areas, as devised by a variety of local, national and international actors. This policy has established how the city should develop over the next 25 years, and its implementation will have a positive impact on the lives of the city residents.</p><p>With a peri-urban structure and a population that is projected to grow by half a million people annually over the coming years, Kenya's Kiambu County needs to acquire budgetary resources to quickly upgrade and build public infrastructures.</p><p>The county requested UN-Habitat's support in 2014 to advise on private investment for local infrastructure and services, municipal finance, generation of local revenues to facilitate service provision, and to foster economic development within municipals. So far, the project has improved the county's revenue generation, and has strengthened and developed its institutional framework for undertaking detailed planning, financial structuring, overseeing the management of projects and reorganizing tax collection systems.</p><p>Preliminary results indicate a potential increase in revenue by 300 percent, with a shift from tax burdens from small businesses to larger businesses, and a reduction in the cost of collection and administration for revenue mobilization.</p><p>4. Form a financial plan</p><p>The fourth pillar is to invest in a financial plan for urbanization. Urbanization without a financial plan will flop. Urbanization should be approached not as a cost, but as an investment, because the cost of urbanization is minimal compared to the value that it can generate. If local authorities decide to recategorize rural land to urban, the value of that land multiplies tenfold at the moment that decision is taken, as a clear example of value generated. The key issue is to guarantee that the urban value generated is properly shared among various constituencies, not just a few. A municipal financial plan should have three elements:</p><p>The first refers to core urbanization functions that should comprise an urban land registry (cadastre and land registry), urban planning and design, building codes, municipal ordinances, urban inspection and correction, and tax collection. These core functions are exclusively municipal.</p><p>The second relates to the basic urban services required to guarantee street and public space maintenance, sanitation, waste management, water, energy, telecommunication, mobility and public transportation. There are different modalities of concession of these services.</p><p>The third covers the complementary services provided by the welfare state, mainly safety and security, education, health, public housing, local economy promotion, and cultural services. The role and capacity of local governments to guarantee these services largely depends on the delegation of such authority by the national government.</p><p>To ensure effective urban planning and management in order to curb the excessive urban sprawl and unplanned land use in Ghana's Greater Accra Region, a Metropolitan Strategy for Greater Accra was created, and with it the Ningo Pram Pram Planned City Extension. This aims to provide access to housing, services and work for between 1.5 and 2 million inhabitants, representing a large share of the expected population growth of the Greater Accra Region, in an area already experiencing high residential pressure.</p><p>5. Local implementation</p><p>And finally, local implementation. Local governments, in particular, are often not given the means to address the challenges of unplanned urbanization. The New Urban Agenda offers planned city extensions, urban redevelopment and planned city infills as the best three tools to address rapid urban growth within our cities.</p><p>ICT also potentially has a large role to play in the deployment of the five pillars toward good urbanization. A smart city requires the use of technology to support these pillars. At the same time, technology itself is not a panacea of development. A city that has an advanced model of technology but is badly planned, with outdated legal frameworks or lacking a good financial model, will only aggravate the dysfunction in the city. A \"smart city\" is a city that uses technology in a \"smart\" way to reinforce the pillars of urbanization.</p><p>(Born in Barcelona, Dr. Joan Clos joined the United Nations in 2010 as under-secretary-general and executive director of UN-Habitat).</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from The New Nation.
