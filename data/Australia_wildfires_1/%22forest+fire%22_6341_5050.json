Their optimism, however, is contrasted with the dark warnings being voiced by public health experts and environmental health practitioners.When it comes to predicting the future no-one can lay claim to 20/20 vision, but it is possible to look at the health trends of today and track forward over the next five years to see where they lead. While this path offers many crossroads and points of divergence, it also offers vistas of opportunity and undreamt-of wealth for those able to read the signs of the times.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By 2005 the first of the Baby Boomers will be in their late fifties. Their parents will be in their late seventies to early eighties, with many either deceased or in nursing homes. Alzheimer's, diabetes, arthritis and cancer will have secured a permanent position on every healthcare agenda and possibly a place in the bodies of the Boomer generation.</p><p>Having been trendsetters all their lives, the Boomers will create and honour a new status symbol - good health. And fortunately for them, they'll have the funds to pay for it. Because while the genome promises access to a whole new world of designer healthcare, it also promises to be extremely expensive.</p><p>Begun in 1990, the Genome Project set itself the ambitious task of charting every one of the estimated 140,000 genes that form the blueprint of human beings, including our structure, behaviour and physical function. Due for completion in 2005, it's now ahead of schedule, with experts predicting its completion mid-way through 2001.</p><p>According to Dr Charles Mackay, a geneticist from the Garvan Institute, the existence of the human genome means that, in the world of medical breakthroughs, all bets are off.</p><p>\"The genome could be of the same magnitude as sanitation and sterilisation by alcohol,\" he says, \"both of which made enormous inroads into disease. And there's no doubt that it's being market driven. People want better health and drug companies want to be in a position to supply that. I think the genome will be able to deliver for both groups.\"</p><p>The first thing to understand about the predictive medicine made possible by the genome is that it doesn't make the same mistake as traditional Western medicine. That is, it works on the premise that every human being is different and there is nothing standard about any of us - especially our genetic make-up.</p><p>For instance, current asthma treatment works on the presumption that asthma is essentially the same for everyone, is triggered by similar agents and can be treated by a standard dose of steroids. Nothing could be further from the truth, Mackay says.</p><p>\"We pretend we understand how asthma works and it works the same way in everyone. Access to the genome now shows us that there may be three or four different forms of asthma. We're on the verge of understanding the molecular mechanism involved, which will totally change the way we treat it.</p><p>\"Today, most asthmatics are put on steroids to reduce the inflammation in their airways. When the genome [project] is finished, a patient will give a tissue or blood sample to their GP and that will be assessed to see which genes are expressing themselves through the RNA [ribonucleic acid]. The patient will then be put on medication that is specifically targeted to suppress the action of genes causing the disturbance.\"</p><p>In the near future, that medicine is likely to be administered intravenously rather than in pill form. While pills are today the favoured form of delivery from a drug company's point of view, genetic therapy will demand tailor-made dosages and come in the form of proteins. Because proteins are normally destroyed in the stomach, this form of medication can only be delivered via the bloodstream.</p><p>According to a number of geneticists, the days of a standard dose of anything are numbered, which is why costs are expected to rise as economies of scale give way to highly individualistic pharmaceuticals. Regardless of the pathology, patients will go through a similar routine for everything from arthritis to depression to Alzheimer's. While diagnosis will be made immeasurably easier, it will also be totally dependent on gaining access to sophisticated and expensive new technologies, such as the gene chip.</p><p>In early November 1999, the University of NSW was one of a consortium of universities and research units that was awarded the $750,000 Ramaciotti Millennium Award. The award was used to establish the Clive and Vera Ramaciotti Centre for Gene Function Analysis, headquartered at the University of NSW.</p><p>While the Genome Project will provide the blueprint for our genetic make-up, such a blueprint remains almost lifeless unless there is the software to analyse the information. The gene chip technology is just such a software, says Professor Ian Dawes from UNSW. \"This technology means that we can take 10,000 gene sequences at a time and analyse them immediately. The human genome has approximately 140,000 altogether. It means we can diagnose disease better and faster and we can tailor the treatment to suit the patient.\"</p><p>In the case of diseases such as cancer, the gene chip will be able to analyse exactly what form of cancer a patient has, which genes are causing the tumour and which kind of therapy would best suit the patient. For instance, while radiation therapy is an extremely successful form of treatment for many, it can cause terrible pain and side-effects in some people. The gene chip will show physicians what therapy would be most successful and how high</p><p>a dose a patient could tolerate.</p><p>However, a more controversial function is its capacity to scan a drop of blood for more than 100 genetic disorders.</p><p>In the next couple</p><p>of years, a woman will be able to have her six-week-old child screened for a whole array of disorders that may affect her or him from childhood through to old age. And according to Dr Julian Savulescu, director of the Ethics Unit at the Murdoch Institute, this presents two problems. \"In the near future we'll be able to test for a large number of common and uncommon diseases,\" he says. Some of these diseases will have treatments and some will not. Is it good to test for diseases that have no known treatment?</p><p>\"Secondly, this technology enables us to make a pre-implantation genetic diagnosis - that is, to use IVF and check cells for genetic abnormalities before continuing with the IVF. This can be done for couples who have no problem with infertility but want to use the IVF route in order to access the genetic screening that it makes possible. Therefore, the gene chip technology will lower the threshold for selection. We need to ask ourselves if we want this.\"</p><p>As it turns out, gene technology means we need to ask ourselves a number of questions that, until now, have been entirely irrelevant. For instance, geneticists at the Garvan Institute have been able to identify some genetic differences in the gene sequencing of those who suffer from manic depression. While this offers real hope of new treatment possibilities, it also relocates mental disorders in the biological paradigm. This shift may have two very different effects.</p><p>First, the stigmatisation of mental disorders needs to be re-thought entirely if it turns out that madness comes from the same internal source as the colour of our eyes and the length of our fingers. But secondly, a number of health practitioners are concerned that seeing mental illness as a purely biological disorder will eventually deny the social, political and emotional components of those same disorders.</p><p>As the President of the International Brain Research Organisation, and having won the 1981 Nobel Laureate in Physiology and Medicine, psychiatrist and genetic researcher Dr Torsten Wiesel knows his way around the human brain. He knows enough to realise how little is known about the brain and all its complexity. And while he remains excited about the inroads being made by genetic research, he looks for hope in the pedestrian world of childhood education.</p><p>\"There was a study done on some nuns recently and their findings are very curious,\" says Wiesel. \"When the nuns entered the convent at 18 years of age they had to write an essay about their reasons for joining. Fifty years later researchers were able to read these essays and know which of these now 70-year-old nuns would develop Alzheimer's. They were absolutely accurate. It wasn't the content or reasons within the essays that gave the nuns away, it was their use of language.</p><p>\"The way we educate our children has a direct bearing on their health and welfare. This is more than teaching them to read and write; it's also about showing them the worlds of art, of music, of the senses. By the age of five, children are already losing their sense of smell because we have privileged language above all else. Which makes me wonder what else they have lost.\"</p><p>There is no doubt that mental illness will be absorbing larger amounts of the healthcare budget over the next five years. The reasons, according to Professor Beverly Raphael, director of the Centre for Mental Health for NSW, are complex.</p><p>\"The number of acute care beds are increasing across the developed world,\" Raphael says. \"Heavy drug use is closely related to mental illness and drug use has also been increasing. Marijuana, for instance, can precipitate an attack in those who are vulnerable, like young men.</p><p>Depression and anxiety are also increasing and both are associated with a great deal of disability.\"</p><p>However, Raphael is reluctant to ascribe all the blame to problem genes. Along with many of her peers, she queries whether mental illness may be a logical response to living in an extremely unbalanced world, saying: \"Unemployment, stress, social isolation - all of these play a critical role in mental illness, which is why</p><p>just treating the individual without looking at the whole system is unlikely to be effective.\"</p><p>While these disorders become obvious during adolescence, they often have their origins in the first months of life. Recent research has shown a relationship between post-natal depression and subsequent mental illness in children. Which is why both State and Commonwealth programs are now putting more resources into supporting women through post-natal depression, developing parenting programs and doing pre-school assessments on children to avoid a trajectory of risk.</p><p>Unfortunately, while mental health experts battle to put out the scrub fires within the nation's psyche, a forest fire of global proportions threatens to overwhelm all the advances on offer via the human genome.</p><p>Today, 40 per cent of the entire global disease burden is environmentally based. That figure is set to increase by 50 per cent over the next 10 years. Regardless of political will and an open chequebook, it is no longer possible to hand on to the next generation the same level of environmental resources currently being enjoyed by the present generation - and that's irreversible.</p><p>This level of decay is already affecting the health of all Australians. It shows itself in the doubling of deaths from melanoma in Tasmania, in the incidence of lung cancer in non-smokers through exposure to diesel exhaust, in the spiralling rate of asthma, in the movement of malaria into previously unaffected countries,</p><p>and in the build-up of toxicity after life-long exposure to pesticides and other air-born pollutants.</p><p>And then there's the bad news. How the damage to the ozone layer and its attendant global warming will affect Australia directly is yet to be quantified. That it will have a deleterious effect on our health is beyond debate. The jury is still out on the impact genetically modified food will have on our health.</p><p>Despite concerns about genetically modified crops and global warming, Professor Stephen Leeder, Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at Sydney University and an expert in public health policy, remains cautiously optimistic about the ongoing provision of health care in Australia.</p><p>\"In 2030 there will be more than one million women aged over 80,\" he says. \"That sounds alarming until you realise that this ageing of the population has been going on for the last 20 years and we've been able to pay for it because we're getting more efficient and we're a lot richer than we were 20 years ago. The problems will only come if there's an economic downturn. Nonetheless, when it comes to the question of public health, we certainly need to be vigilant that we don't slip back.\"</p><p>This is a proposition Professor George Paxinos would dispute. As the winner of the 1999 Ramaciotti Medal for his work in mapping the human brain, Paxinos believes human survival would be greatly enhanced by our brains either shrinking or growing a lot larger.</p><p>\"If our brains were the size of monkeys' we wouldn't have the intelligence to develop these new technologies that may ultimately destroy the planet. If they were much bigger in the frontal lobes, we would have the foresight, intelligence and compassion to avoid doing such a terrible thing. Unfortunately our brains are big enough to cause the problems, but too small to find the remedy.\"</p><p>Medicine 21st Century Style</p><p>While the genomics revolution will be startling in itself, its discoveries will couple with other medical technology and biotech breakthroughs to dazzle the industry and accelerate change.</p><p>The power of two or more discoveries creates a chemical reaction. After all, how successful were organ transplants before cyclosporin, the anti-rejection drug?</p><p>Other revolutions that will tag-team with genetic mapping's breakthroughs include:</p><p>Nanotechnology</p><p>Many researchers are talking about \"nanodoctors\", who will practise a new speciality called \"nanomedicine\": the monitoring, repair, construction and control of human biological systems at the molecular level, using engineered \"nanodevices\" - almost like mini submarines.</p><p>Genetically altered animals</p><p>Transplant experts are currently getting ready to perform xenotransplants using livers, kidneys and hearts from genetically appropriate pigs. \"This development opens up a situation with a potentially unlimited supply of organs for transplantation,\" says Michael Guerrier, Toronto Hospital's chief operating officer. \"The key constraint in the future will be what healthcare we can afford.\"</p><p>Imaging advances</p><p>By 2010, a range of three-dimensional, digital technologies will help practitioners make better decisions and do more precise work in less time. Simple X-rays, MRI and CT scans, or more advanced computer data, will fuse with real-time video and be shared much faster than the time it used to take a patient to walk down a hospital's radiology department.</p><p>Biomaterials &amp; tissue generation</p><p>Those with heart disease may have the option of cardiac vessel regenerative tissue implants, which will replace clogged arteries without bypass surgery or angioplasty. Regenerative tissue implants will also have tremendous applications for paralysis victims.</p><p>Biodegradable materials, such as polymers and corals used as scaffold, are seeded with specific cultured cells to build tissues, bones, |veins, arteries and even complete organs such as livers, bladders and ultimately the heart. In effect, we will create our own spare parts.</p><p>Source: PriceWaterhouseCoopers</p><p>\"Health Cast 2010\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Four Illus: Photographs by Kerry Wilson.

Kinglake) was once a gold-digging and timber-getting settlement about as remote from the city as the imagination could stretch.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Melbourne is a restless beast. In the past 70years, its population has swelled from a million to about 3.8million. It has pushed out of its river valley and up into the spine of the Great Dividing Range to the north-east, devouring what seemed distant villages in the hills, turning dreaming places such as Healesville into outer suburbs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Little Kinglake and its neighbours strung along the high ridge - Kinglake Central, Kinglake West, Toolangi and Pheasant Creek - are an easy and appealing drive from the city, just 61kilometres away, and those intent on the lifestyle that has become known as a \"tree change\" have found the high country irresistible. It is cooler in the hills, often misty, forested with peppermint and stringybark and ash, the gullies lush with dripping ferns.</p><p>Places like these bear no resemblance to suburbs. You could have a horse or two, grow olives or berries, let the kids roam free, feel part of a tight little community and still commute to work in the city if need be. And there were those views. Most Januarys, visitors flock in for the annual Raspberry Fair, a lot of them hankering to live in just such a perfect place.</p><p>And then came the superheated malevolence of Saturday, February7, 2009, and all the contented certainties of bucolic life were blown away.</p><p>We do not need here to describe the shock and the anguish etched into the faces of those who poured out of the hill towns, nor subject ourselves to their stories of panic and loss and heroism. We have all seen and read these things, been numbed by them in the pages of newspapers, been confronted by the televised images, listened endlessly to the stories broadcast on radio.</p><p>From Kinglake, those who did not die fled down the incandescent road to Whittlesea, survivors from the ashen town that was Marysville struggled in to Alexandra, residents who had escaped the flattened Flowerdale found safety and the kindness of strangers in Yea, and others from places such as Buxton, Glenburn, Narbethong, Strath Creek, Taggerty, Thornton, Toolangi and Yarck went every which way - or stayed and fought on.</p><p>Away to the north-west, Bendigo remains dumbfounded that fire ripped through tree-change communities among the old goldfields scrubland and tore into the regional city, reaching little more than a stroll from the town hall.</p><p>To the east, Churchill and broad reaches of Gippsland are doubly traumatised by the deaths of neighbours and the belief that an arsonist caused the terror. In the north-east, the Kiewa and Ovens valleys and their farmers and townsfolk strive to put behind them their own battle with fires.</p><p>Way to the west, in Horsham and other places, the story is hardly different. And everywhere, the grime-rimmed eyes of exhausted firefighters and emergency workers and volunteers have that haunted look that the writer Michael Herr described in Dispatches, his book on American soldiers in Vietnam, as \"the thousand-yard stare\".</p><p>It was, the headlines screamed inaccurately, the greatest natural disaster the nation had suffered.</p><p>This reporter was reminded this week by an old colleague, Jack Waterford of The Canberra Times, of the 14,000 who died of Spanish flu in the few months after World WarI, the 550 Sydneysiders who died of bubonic plague when Australia was preparing to federate, the hundreds who died from flames and heat stress in the bushfires of 1895, the 410 who perished in the 1889 cyclone at Bathurst Bay, far north Queensland, and single shipwrecks in which hundreds were lost.</p><p>None of this reduces the impact of the undeniably tragic event that occurred last Saturday: 200 or more lives lost, most of them in a single evening. Amid the mourning and the horror, voices can be heard declaring that climate change is to blame.</p><p>Perhaps, though, our arithmetic, our memories and our conclusions are more askew than we imagine.</p><p>Victoria's population is now about 5.22million. In 1939, the state had 1.85million people and on Black Friday of that year, on January13, no less than 71 people perished (not taking into account another 400 or so who died of heatstroke across the land around that time).</p><p>Simple multiplication would suggest that had the state been as populated as it is now, Black Friday's death toll might have been remarkably similar to the dismaying figures that haunt us this week - greater, perhaps, had tree change been a phenomenon in 1939.</p><p>As Victoria prepares to place the February7 fires and their causes on trial before a royal commission, it is worth studying the spare, elegant opening paragraphs of Judge Leonard Stretton's royal commission report on the Black Friday tragedy 70 years ago.</p><p>\"In the State of Victoria, the month of January of the year 1939 came towards the end of a long drought, which had been aggravated by a severe hot, dry summer season,\" Stretton wrote.</p><p>\"For more than 20 years the state of Victoria had not seen its countryside and forests in such travail. Creeks and springs ceased to run.</p><p>\"Water storages were depleted. Provincial towns were facing the probability of cessation of water supply. In Melbourne, more than a million inhabitants were subjected to restrictions upon the use of water. Throughout the countryside, the farmers were carting water, if such was available, for their stock and themselves.</p><p>\"The rich plains, denied their beneficent rains, lay bare and baking; and the forests, from the foothills to the alpine heights, were tinder. The soft carpet of the forest floor was gone; the bone-dry litter crackled underfoot; dry heat and hot dry winds worked upon a land already dry, to suck from it the last, least drop of moisture.</p><p>\"Men who had lived their lives in the bush went their ways in the shadow of dread expectancy. But though they felt the imminence of danger, they could not tell that it was to be far greater than they could imagine. They had not lived long enough. The experience of the past could not guide them to an understanding of what might, and did, happen.</p><p>\"And so it was that, when millions of acres of the forest were invaded by bushfires, which were almost statewide, there happened, because of great loss of life and property, the most disastrous forest calamity the state of Victoria has known.</p><p>\"These fires were lit by the hand of man.</p><p>\"Seventy-one lives were lost. Sixty-nine mills were burned. Millions of acres of fine forest, of almost incalculable value, were destroyed or badly damaged. Townships were obliterated in a few minutes. Mills, houses, bridges, tramways, machinery were burned to the ground; men, cattle, horses, sheep were devoured by the fires or asphyxiated by the scorching debilitated air.</p><p>\"Generally, the numerous fires, which during December, in many parts of Victoria, had been burning separately, as they do in any summer, either 'under control' as it is falsely and dangerously called, or entirely untended, reached the climax of their intensity and joined forces in a devastating confluence of flame on Friday, January13.</p><p>\"On that day it appeared that the whole state was alight. At midday, in many places, it was dark as night. Men carrying hurricane lamps worked to make safe their families and belongings. Travellers on the highways were trapped by fires or blazing fallen trees, and perished.</p><p>\"Throughout the land there was daytime darkness. At one mill, desperate but futile efforts were made to clear of inflammable scrub the borders of the mill and mill settlement. All but one person, at that mill, were burned to death, many of them while trying to burrow to imagined safety in the sawdust heap.</p><p>\"Horses were found, still harnessed, in their stalls, dead, their limbs fantastically contorted. The full story of the killing of this small community is one of unpreparedness, because of apathy and ignorance and perhaps of something worse.</p><p>\"Steel girders and machinery were twisted by heat as if they had been of fine wire. Sleepers of heavy durable timber, set in the soil, their upper surfaces flush with the ground, were burnt through. Other heavy woodwork disappeared, leaving no trace.</p><p>\"Where the fire was most intense the soil was burnt and destroyed to such a depth that it may be many years before it shall have been restored by the slow chemistry of nature. Acres upon acres of the soil itself can be retained only by the effort of man in a fight against natural erosive forces.</p><p>\"The speed of the fires was appalling. They leaped from mountain peak to mountain peak, or far out into the lower country, lighting the forests six or seven miles in advance of the main fires. Blown by a wind of great force, they roared as they travelled. Balls of crackling fire sped at a great pace in advance of the fires, consuming with a roaring, explosive noise all that they touched.</p><p>\"Houses of brick were seen and heard to leap into a roar of flame before the fires had reached them. Some men of science hold the view that the fires generated and were preceded by inflammable gases, which became alight. Great pieces of burning bark were carried by the wind to set in raging flame regions not yet reached by the fires.</p><p>\"Such was the force of the wind that, in many places, hundreds of trees of great size were blown clear of the earth, tons of soil, with embedded masses of rock, still adhering to the roots; for mile upon mile the former forest monarchs were laid in confusion, burnt, torn from the earth, and piled one upon another as matches strewn by a giant hand.\"</p><p>With a minor alteration here or there to take account of 70 years of change, Judge Stretton could have written those precise words this week.</p><p>No word there about climate change. Instead, he wrote, \"Nature ... sends the abnormal season, which encourages the major fire, which consumes the forest\".</p><p>There was much made over the past week of the unbearable heatwave that preceded the latest bushfires, and it remains true that the run of plus-40-degree temperatures is the most severe since accurate records began.</p><p>Yet it is worth knowing that Victoria's single-highest maximum temperature, 50.8 degrees, was recorded in Mildura on January 7, 1906. On January10, 1939, three days before Black Friday, it was 47.2 degrees in Mildura. It remained fiercely hot around the state until the cataclysm, when Melbourne recorded 45.6degrees, a record that remained until February9 this year when the city hit an appalling 46.4degrees.</p><p>None of this disproves the theory that climate change is upon us - a notion almost universally accepted by climatologists and scientists in related fields, and which grants a new urgency to the need to prepare for more frequent extremes in weather and their repercussions.</p><p>However, the spooky similarities in events 70years apart do give undeniable support to Stretton's conviction about nature's \"abnormal\" seasons encouraging major fires that consume Victoria's forests.</p><p>Last Saturday was no unique event. It is part of a savage south-east Australian continuum. To it could be added Ash Wednesday, February16, 1983 - another drought, another period of high temperatures (43degrees on the day of the fires), another day of fierce dry wind.</p><p>Seventy-five lives were extinguished - 47 in Victoria and 28 in South Australia - and more than 2000 homes went up in smoke.</p><p>Add to this numerous more-localised fires, with less spectacular death tolls, recalled whenever old people gather and begin yarning.</p><p>My own family's history of 160 years or so farming, a lot of it in thousands of hectares of bush, has built up quite a lore. One of my great-grandfathers, in his late 70s or early 80s, got caught up in Black Friday's fury in far south-western Victoria, electing to stay and fight for his country home while the police evacuated his family.</p><p>The fire was too fast and powerful for him and as the house burnt, he jumped a fence, caught his foot between the pickets and, trapped, was roasted as the flames roared over him. A tough old coot, he survived, treated for weeks with nothing but a blanket tossed over his scorched back, his nurses pouring water on it to keep him sane.</p><p>It was the closest any of the extensive branches of the family came to perishing in a bushfire - they learned the dangers and took precautions that have fallen out of favour and are now being fiercely debated all over again.</p><p>They cleared firebreaks and used fire against fire. My father as a young fellow learned from his father, who had learned from his and so on back through the generations, to do what the Aborigines had done: dribble fire into the forest in the cool of autumn, reducing fuel build-up.</p><p>All those years ago, Judge Stretton made a number of recommendations about what should be done to limit the state's fire risk, and some of them still form the basis for Victoria's fire control systems.</p><p>However, some of them have also fallen by the wayside or have been twisted to the point where they are unrecognisable.</p><p>Governments, bureaucrats, agencies and ideologically driven groups of all stripes have a habit of tearing apart the findings of inquiries.</p><p>The most extreme example in recent times was a full-blooded assault by the ACT Government on the coroner inquiring into Canberra's disastrous fire attack of 2003, in which four lives were lost, hundreds were injured and almost 500 homes destroyed.</p><p>Chief Minister Jon Stanhope tried unsuccessfully to have the coroner, Maria Doogan, replaced during the inquiry, accusing her of \"apprehended bias\".</p><p>When she finally brought down her report, which was deeply critical of Stanhope for deliberately downplaying the seriousness of the fire threat and in general scathing of the Emergency Services Bureau's handling of the crisis, Stanhope simply said Doogan was wrong.</p><p>It is fair to say that with a royal commission being established in Victoria, everyone with an interest - from the top of the Government to local authorities, from firefighters and emergency services agencies through to home owners - will be on high alert to ensure their reputations and careers and beliefs survive intact.</p><p>Among the more interested parties will be that diverse group called environmentalists (by their admirers) or (by their antagonists) greenies.</p><p>There is this week a palpable mood that could turn into a serious backlash against some of the developments driven by green movements, deserved or not.</p><p>Trees and the comfort they give the human eye and soul have become almost sacred objects in some local government areas. Despite the judge's long-ago insistence that forest litter be cleared, Victorian authorities have made it all but illegal to pick up a fallen branch for firewood, let alone cut down scrub or a tree.</p><p>Some of the crustier characters from the scorched hills outside Melbourne noted this week that the Murrindindi Shire, which covers much of the worst-hit areas, encouraged landholders to plant as many trees as possible around their homes to ensure the bush character of the area was maintained. Many, of course, needed no such encouragement - it was precisely because of the bush character that people had moved to the hills or to the forested outskirts of cities.</p><p>The judge also recommended permanent firebreaks at forest margins where settlements were considered in danger. These should be determined according to local conditions, he said, but could be up to 800metres wide.</p><p>The Age reported this week that a family from Reedy Creek, in Mitchell Shire, had been fined $50,000 and spent a further $50,000 in legal costs because they bulldozed 250 trees to clear their property of fire danger.</p><p>The shire allows clearing only within six metres of homes, but Liam Sheahan and his family cleared 100metres. Their house is one of the few in Reedy Creek to have survived last weekend's bushfire, and the only one still standing in a two-kilometre area. Sheahan believes his illegal action has been vindicated.</p><p>Stark evidence lay on the road between Kinglake and Whittlesea this week that trees, so handsome on a fine day, can kill in numerous ways when things turn bad. Burnt-out cars that had smashed into logs fallen on the road were not removed for days.</p><p>A day after witnessing these dreadful tombs, this reporter found himself driving between Tallarook and Yea. Large trees on both sides of the road formed an archway overhead, and it was beautiful. It was also impossible to ignore the ABC's warnings on the car radio that fire still burnt across the hills, and the thought that this lovely avenue could turn vicious seemed a paradox as bitter as the serene view from that destroyed house on the Kinglake ridge.</p><p>Stretton also insisted that the Forests Commission, now known as the Department of Sustainability and Environment, \"must recognise the necessity for protective burning in its areas and should respect local forest lore. Where practicable, autumn burning is preferable for protective purposes.\"</p><p>The department does oversee fuel-reduction burns - leading its detractors to dub the DSE \"the Department for Sparks and Embers\" - but finds itself criticised both for doing too much and doing too little burning. Some local councils won't allow it at all.</p><p>About 400,000 Victorian hectares have been subjected to prescribed burns over the past three years - almost exactly the same amount of land that has been destroyed since last weekend.</p><p>The fact remains that vast swathes of national parks and other public forests, once given those regular \"cool-burn\" treatments by leaseholders to promote grass growth for stock and to prevent hot fires fuelled by the understorey, have been allowed to revert to near-impenetrable bush.</p><p>Some environmentalists label prescribed burning as a threat to endangered species and environmental diversity, and a report this week said the Federal Government had received a submission from an unnamed group demanding it be outlawed nationally.</p><p>A former meteorologist specialising in fire weather for the Bureau of Meteorology, David Packham, retorted that elements among green groups were behaving like \"eco-terrorists waging jihad against prescribed burning\". As a result, he declared, fuel levels at the time of last week's fire were the highest in Victoria for 30,000 years - a reference, apparently, to the ancient practice of Aboriginal people using firesticks to control their environment.</p><p>Premier John Brumby clearly recognises a mood for change, but managed this week to veer away from talking about controlled burning or whether people should be allowed to live in fire-prone bushland.</p><p>Instead, he reprised Stretton's idea of permanent firebreaks, saying people may have to get accustomed to removing native vegetation whether they liked it or not.</p><p>He also focused on one of the more glaringly obvious problems, house design in dangerous areas. His message was that technology could overcome many of the problems through the use of higher fire standards built into houses.</p><p>The unanswered question is whether those driven out of the bush by last week's fires will be able to rebuild before the royal commission has brought down its findings, which inevitably will deal with the way houses should be constructed. Most of the survivors who spoke to The Age this week expressed their desire to return and start building as soon as possible - and many had previously built wooden structures to blend in with their forested surroundings, believing their individual fire plans would be sufficient to deal with whatever the elements threw at them. It seems likely that the State Government will introduce new building standards before the commission has studied all the alternatives.</p><p>There is, too, much discussion about bunkers after one family survived in their purpose-built shelter. Brumby himself suggested bunkers may be an answer and pointed out that they were used widely in tornado-prone areas of America. A bushfire, others noted, was not like a tornado; you could incinerate running for the shelter, or have all the oxygen sucked out of it by the inferno.</p><p>The oldest of verities that one should decide, well in advance of any threat, whether to leave early or stay and fight - the so-called \"stay or go\" policy - smacked up against the reality that many who elected to stay had succumbed to the inferno. Precisely how this policy could be altered without forcing entire communities to evacuate down their narrow roads at the first scent of smoke remains unsolved.</p><p>Yet amid all the furious debate about what might be done to ameliorate the threat from Victoria's capricious rhythm identified so exquisitely by Stretton, there emerged as if from the air itself that indestructible element that suffers no divide in the Australian heart.</p><p>Even as the first survivors staggered out of the bush, volunteers were tossing together relief centres in safe havens all across the state.</p><p>Members of the Country Women's Association, of the Salvos and the Red Cross, doctors, nurses, emergency services personnel, police, church members and unbelievers and an army of ordinary folk with no thought but to help the suffering and support the firefighters stormed to footy ovals and recreation reserves, rolled up their sleeves and set to doing whatever might be required.</p><p>A blur of hands cut sandwiches and poured tea. Bandages and ointments were applied. Tents came from nowhere and everywhere. Shopkeepers emptied their shelves and sent vans scuttling with free goods of all types. Mattresses and bedding and clothing piled up, and householders opened their homes to strangers.</p><p>Noticeboards produced some order and much succour. Here was a board at Whittlesea, arrows pointing in every direction: \"Need to talk?\"; \"Accommodation\"; \"Meals\"; \"Light refreshments\"; \"Clothing\"; \"Information\"; \"1st Aid\"; \"Red Cross\". All around, burly blokes trundled in with their barbecues and fired them up, and workmen banged together a demountable hut where insurance advice could be obtained.</p><p>Around the corner a serenity of saffron-robed Buddhist monks hoisted a small tent and stuck up a sign offering Buddhist relief. The venerable Tich Quang Ba, from Canberra, explained that he and his colleagues from temples around Melbourne had $10,000 to give away.</p><p>Up the mountain, Kinglake's two Buddhist temples had survived while a Christian church was destroyed, only a brick wall inset with a giant glass cross left standing. The monks took nothing from this, accepting that a forest fire is as random as the unknowable universe.</p><p>Here was a young woman in a yellow T-shirt stencilled with the offer of \"Free Hugs\". She was doing roaring business. This offerer of hugs, Sam Atkinson, is unemployed and had nothing else to offer. \"People need compassion and I'm a compassionate person,\" was her simple explanation. Another young woman, Sam Starr, was busily costuming herself in clown get-up, preparing to entertain, as \"Crazy Daisy\", bored and confused children. She had driven from Coburg.</p><p>\"My sister's from Kinglake,\" she said. \"She wasn't home when the fire came and miraculously her house is still standing, but her father-in-law's house is gone. I thought that's it, my car's full of petrol and I'm ready to go. I've got balloons and face-painting gear and I'll go from spot to spot until sundown and find kids who need cheering up.\"</p><p>Away up the road in Yea, the recreation reserve's noticeboard sported hastily scrawled signs of generosity and desperation. \"Please telephone your brother Oscar as soon as possible,\" pleaded one; \"100 acres of land vacant for stock/horses,\" another offered. \"Thank you for donating. However, due to overwhelming support we cannot accept any more clothing,\" apologised yet another.</p><p>In the clubhouse, that blur of hands kept a steady stream of food coming, and out on the oval little kids played cricket and soccer. Some bounced in a blow-up jumping castle. It had been brought out from Melbourne by yet more clown-suited entertainers. They were from Planetshakers, a large, cheerful church group from Melbourne, and they were painting children's faces, handing out lollipops and doing magic tricks.</p><p>\"We authentically love kids, and when I see them hurting I want to help them,\" said Rob Bradbury, his head bedecked with a giant plastic Elvis quiff. \"My wife, Assunta, and I are grief counsellors and we know that children's grief is different to that of adults. It is both shorter and longer - they can't process it on the spot and they go back to playing their Nintendo, but it comes back in the night and stays with them for a long time.\"</p><p>The church will give all its tithes and donations this Sunday to the bushfire appeal. It is likely to be about $90,000.</p><p>All across the nation, Australians answered Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's call for them to dig deep.</p><p>By yesterday, the bushfire appeal through the Red Cross had raised more than $84 million.</p><p>Sky News beamed live from Canberra on a giant screen the stream of condolence motions that replaced the normal jabber of question time, which was cancelled all week in the knowledge that political rhetoric would seem squalid at a time of such grief.</p><p>So sensitive to the hint of a crass political word were those gathered in the relief stations that an audible murmur of displeasure rippled through the crowds when it seemed Rudd had strayed into linking his $42billion stimulus package with the rebuilding of fire-ravaged communities.</p><p>Indeed, the mood across the increasingly crowded sanctuaries shifted as surely as the wind as more and more news media cameras, microphones and reporters hurried to capture the stories and the images of this near-unimaginable horror.</p><p>Many of us in the media have experienced this very phenomenon in other extreme circumstances, after the landslide in Thredbo and the goldmine collapse in Beaconsfield, for instance. Small communities become so overwhelmed by the attention that they shift rapidly from relief at being able to share their experiences with the world to a sullen shunning of reporters and occasional angry outbursts at them.</p><p>By the end of the week at many relief stations, there was a visible stand-off between those who had rushed from fires and those come to collect their stories.</p><p>Perhaps it will always be thus - cameras in particular are visible instruments of intrusion, however sensitive their operators and colleagues may wish to be to the suffering, and however important their reports may be to galvanising a nation to help.</p><p>Swiss doctor Elizabeth Kubler-Ross described in her book On Death and Dying in 1969 a series of emotions that often are referred to as the \"grief cycle\". There are, in this theory, five identifiable stages that those who are bereaved and traumatised are likely to have to wend their way through.</p><p>Stage one is denial (\"this can't be happening to me\"), stage two is anger (\"why me?\"). Then comes bargaining (\"If I do this, surely destiny might be different\"), followed by depression (\"I can't bear this\") and, finally, acceptance (\"I'm ready to resume life\").</p><p>You might add a couple more ingredients to this emotional stew: guilt and relief.</p><p>Having experienced both, 12years ago, when my own family home was consumed by fire when I was at work and my children were in the house - I found them alive and distressed on the street as windows blew out and firemen came racing to save what was left - I could not bear to approach shattered, often weeping survivors early this week.</p><p>By week's end, few of the fire-struck appeared to have moved beyond Kubler-Ross' stage two.</p><p>Here and there, though, were hardy souls who had sauntered straight to stage five: acceptance.</p><p>Kenn Airens, a snowy-haired and bearded man of 57 whose Glaswegian accent has hardly lost its burr in the 32years he has been in Australia, fled with his wife, Els, from remote Toolangi as flames reared over the ridge and consumed their home.</p><p>After a harrowing journey through the forests, the fire pursuing them, they and a couple of hundred other refugees found their way to Yea. A casual acquaintance from the town spotted them and insisted the couple come and live in his family's home.</p><p>Airens thinks he may head towards Queensland and jokes that he would probably find himself flooded out up there, but in the meantime he is content to offer a hand or a yarn to anyone who might need it around Yea.</p><p>\"Well, it's just the nature of Australia,\" he says of his ordeal, and launches into praise for the generosity of those around him.</p><p>There was a bloke, he says, who lost his only home, a camper on the back of a ute, who could hardly believe his fortune when he was given a tent. The fellow immediately sought out others who needed a place to sleep, declaring the tent was so large he had plenty of room for others.</p><p>\"It's all a bit of a bugger, but you move on,\" Airens says with a shrug.</p><p>Quite.</p><p>Precisely where and how remains the question.</p><p>Homes of timber on the edge of steep, forested ridges with native bush all around no longer seem the most satisfactory answer, however glorious the views may be, and however</p><p>brave and resourceful their residents may be.</p><p>At a time when the state of Victoria is searching for new solutions to an old problem, we might pray that Bernard Teague, a former Supreme Court judge who will chair the royal commission on Victoria's bushfires, proves as adept as old Judge Stretton in sorting the wood from the trees.</p><p>Tony Wright is national affairs editor.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FIVE PHOTOS: \u00e2\u20ac\u0153And so it was that, when millions of acres of the forest were invaded by bushfires, there happened ... the most disastrous forest calamity the state of Victoria has known.\u00e2\u20ac SOUTH GIPPSLAND PHOTOGRAPH BY WAYNE TAYLOR;

There is - was - a house on the ridge that only a week ago had one of Victoria's most sublime views. Like so many of its neighbours, it is a ruin now, little but ash and weirdly twisted metal and out the front, on blackened earth, a kangaroo and a dog, grotesque, stiffened in death.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Look beyond these ghastly things, though, and your eye travels through the space that the house so recently inhabited, across the valley far below and clear to city towers and, at night, the twinkling suburbs of Melbourne.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Kinglake (a strange tag for a lakeless mountain-top hamlet, named for a 19th-century English author, AlexanderW. Kinglake) was once a gold-digging and timber-getting settlement about as remote from the city as the imagination could stretch.</p><p>But Melbourne is a restless beast. In the past 70 years, its population has swelled from a million to about 3.8million. It has pushed out of its river valley and up into the spine of the Great Dividing Range to the north-east, devouring what seemed distant villages in the hills, turning dreaming places such as Healesville into outer suburbs.</p><p>Little Kinglake and its neighbours strung along the high ridge - Kinglake Central, Kinglake West, Toolangi and Pheasant Creek - are an easy and appealing drive from the city, just 61kilometres away, and those intent on the lifestyle that has become known as a \"tree change\" have found the high country irresistible. It is cooler in the hills, often misty, forested with peppermint and stringybark and ash, the gullies lush with dripping ferns.</p><p>Places like these bear no resemblance to suburbs. You could have a horse or two, grow olives or berries, let the kids roam free, feel part of a tight little community and still commute to work in the city if need be. And there were those views. Most Januarys, visitors flock in for the annual Raspberry Fair, a lot of them hankering to live in just such a perfect place.</p><p>And then came the superheated malevolence of Saturday, February 7, 2009, and all the contented certainties of bucolic life were blown away.</p><p>We do not need here to describe the shock and the anguish etched into the faces of those who poured out of the hill towns, nor subject ourselves to their stories of panic and loss and heroism. We have all seen and read these things, been numbed by them in the pages of newspapers, been confronted by the televised images, listened endlessly to the stories broadcast on radio.</p><p>From Kinglake, those who did not perish fled down the incandescent road to Whittlesea, survivors from the ashen town that was Marysville struggled in to Alexandra, residents who had escaped the flattened Flowerdale found safety and the kindness of strangers in Yea, and others from places such as Buxton, Glenburn, Narbethong, Strath Creek, Taggerty, Thornton, Toolangi and Yarck went every which way - or stayed and fought on.</p><p>Away to the north-west, Bendigo remains dumbfounded that fire ripped through tree-change communities among the old goldfields scrubland and tore into the regional city, reaching little more than a stroll from the town hall.</p><p>To the east, Churchill and broad reaches of Gippsland are doubly traumatised by the deaths of neighbours and the belief that an arsonist caused the terror. In the north-east, the Kiewa and Ovens valleys and their farmers and townsfolk strive to put behind them their own battle with fires.</p><p>Way to the west, in Horsham and other places, the story is hardly different. And everywhere, the grime-rimmed eyes of exhausted firefighters and emergency workers and volunteers have that haunted look that the writer Michael Herr described in Dispatches, his book on American soldiers in Vietnam, as \"the thousand-yard stare\".</p><p>It was, the headlines screamed inaccurately, the greatest natural disaster the nation had suffered.</p><p>This reporter was reminded this week by an old colleague, Jack Waterford of The Canberra Times, of the 14,000 who died of Spanish flu in the few months after World WarI, the 550 Sydneysiders who died of bubonic plague when Australia was preparing to federate, the hundreds who died from flames and heat stress in the bushfires of 1895, the 410 who perished in the 1889 cyclone at Bathurst Bay, far north Queensland, and single shipwrecks in which hundreds were lost.</p><p>None of this reduces the impact of the undeniably tragic event that occurred last Saturday: 200 or more lives lost, most of them in a single evening. Amid the mourning and the horror, voices can be heard declaring that climate change is to blame.</p><p>Perhaps, though, our arithmetic, our memories and our conclusions are more askew than we imagine.</p><p>Victoria's population is now about 5.22million. In 1939, the state had 1.85million people and on Black Friday of that year, on January13, no less than 71 people perished (not taking into account another 400 or so who died of heatstroke across the land around that time).</p><p>Simple multiplication would suggest that had the state been as populated as it is now, Black Friday's death toll might have been remarkably similar to the dismaying figures that haunt us this week - greater, perhaps, had tree change been a phenomenon in 1939.</p><p>As Victoria prepares to place the February7 fires and their causes on trial before a royal commission, it is worth studying the spare, elegant opening paragraphs of Judge Leonard Stretton's Royal Commission report on the Black Friday tragedy 70 years ago.</p><p>\"In the State of Victoria, the month of January of the year 1939 came towards the end of a long drought, which had been aggravated by a severe hot, dry summer season,\" Stretton wrote.</p><p>\"For more than 20 years the state of Victoria had not seen its countryside and forests in such travail. Creeks and springs ceased to run.</p><p>\"Water storages were depleted. Provincial towns were facing the probability of cessation of water supply. In Melbourne, more than a million inhabitants were subjected to restrictions upon the use of water. Throughout the countryside, the farmers were carting water, if such was available, for their stock and themselves.</p><p>\"The rich plains, denied their beneficent rains, lay bare and baking; and the forests, from the foothills to the alpine heights, were tinder. The soft carpet of the forest floor was gone; the bone-dry litter crackled underfoot; dry heat and hot dry winds worked upon a land already dry, to suck from it the last, least drop of moisture.</p><p>\"Men who had lived their lives in the bush went their ways in the shadow of dread expectancy. But though they felt the imminence of danger, they could not tell that it was to be far greater than they could imagine. They had not lived long enough. The experience of the past could not guide them to an understanding of what might, and did, happen.</p><p>\"And so it was that, when millions of acres of the forest were invaded by bushfires, which were almost state-wide, there happened, because of great loss of life and property, the most disastrous forest calamity the state of Victoria has known.</p><p>\"These fires were lit by the hand of man.</p><p>\"Seventy-one lives were lost. Sixty-nine mills were burned. Millions of acres of fine forest, of almost incalculable value, were destroyed or badly damaged. Townships were obliterated in a few minutes. Mills, houses, bridges, tramways, machinery were burned to the ground; men, cattle, horses, sheep were devoured by the fires or asphyxiated by the scorching debilitated air.</p><p>\"Generally, the numerous fires, which during December, in many parts of Victoria, had been burning separately, as they do in any summer, either 'under control' as it is falsely and dangerously called, or entirely untended, reached the climax of their intensity and joined forces in a devastating confluence of flame on Friday, January13.</p><p>\"On that day it appeared that the whole state was alight. At midday, in many places, it was dark as night. Men carrying hurricane lamps worked to make safe their families and belongings. Travellers on the highways were trapped by fires or blazing fallen trees, and perished.</p><p>\"Throughout the land there was daytime darkness. At one mill, desperate but futile efforts were made to clear of inflammable scrub the borders of the mill and mill settlement. All but one person, at that mill, were burned to death, many of them while trying to burrow to imagined safety in the sawdust heap.</p><p>\"Horses were found, still harnessed, in their stalls, dead, their limbs fantastically contorted. The full story of the killing of this small community is one of unpreparedness, because of apathy and ignorance and perhaps of something worse.</p><p>\"Steel girders and machinery were twisted by heat as if they had been of fine wire. Sleepers of heavy durable timber, set in the soil, their upper surfaces flush with the ground, were burnt through. Other heavy woodwork disappeared, leaving no trace.</p><p>\"Where the fire was most intense the soil was burnt and destroyed to such a depth that it may be many years before it shall have been restored by the slow chemistry of nature. Acres upon acres of the soil itself can be retained only by the effort of man in a fight against natural erosive forces.</p><p>\"The speed of the fires was appalling. They leaped from mountain peak to mountain peak, or far out into the lower country, lighting the forests six or seven miles in advance of the main fires. Blown by a wind of great force, they roared as they travelled. Balls of crackling fire sped at a great pace in advance of the fires, consuming with a roaring, explosive noise all that they touched.</p><p>\"Houses of brick were seen and heard to leap into a roar of flame before the fires had reached them. Some men of science hold the view that the fires generated and were preceded by inflammable gases, which became alight. Great pieces of burning bark were carried by the wind to set in raging flame regions not yet reached by the fires.</p><p>\"Such was the force of the wind that, in many places, hundreds of trees of great size were blown clear of the earth, tons of soil, with embedded masses of rock, still adhering to the roots; for mile upon mile the former forest monarchs were laid in confusion, burnt, torn from the earth, and piled one upon another as matches strewn by a giant hand.\"</p><p>With a minor alteration here or there to take account of 70 years of change, Judge Stretton could have written those precise words this week.</p><p>No word there about climate change. Instead, he wrote, \"Nature ... sends the abnormal season, which encourages the major fire, which consumes the forest\".</p><p>There was much made over the past week of the unbearable heatwave that preceded the latest bushfires, and it remains true that the run of plus-40-degree temperatures is the most severe since accurate records began.</p><p>Yet it is worth knowing that Victoria's single-highest maximum temperature, 50.8 degrees, was recorded in Mildura on January 7, 1906. On January10, 1939, three days before Black Friday, it was 47.2 degrees in Mildura. It remained fiercely hot around the state until the cataclysm, when Melbourne recorded 45.6degrees, a record that remained until February9 this year when the city hit an appalling 46.4degrees.</p><p>None of this disproves the theory that climate change is upon us - a notion almost universally accepted by climatologists and scientists in related fields, and which grants a new urgency to the need to prepare for more frequent extremes in weather and their repercussions.</p><p>However, the spooky similarities in events 70years apart do give undeniable support to Stretton's conviction about nature's \"abnormal\" seasons encouraging major fires that consume Victoria's forests.</p><p>Last Saturday was no unique event. It is part of a savage south-east Australian continuum. To it could be added Ash Wednesday, February16, 1983 - another drought, another period of high temperatures (43degrees on the day of the fires), another day of fierce dry wind. Seventy-five lives were extinguished - 47 in Victoria and 28 in South Australia - and more than 2000 homes went up in smoke.</p><p>Add to this numerous more-localised fires, with less spectacular death tolls, recalled whenever old people gather and begin yarning. My own family's history of 160 years or so farming, a lot of it in thousands of hectares of bush, has built up quite a lore. One of my great-grandfathers, in his late 70s or early 80s, got caught up in Black Friday's fury in far south-western Victoria, electing to stay and fight for his country home while the police evacuated his family.</p><p>The fire was too fast and powerful for him and as the house burnt, he jumped a fence, caught his foot between the pickets and, trapped, was roasted as the flames roared over him. A tough old coot, he survived, treated for weeks with nothing but a blanket tossed over his scorched back, his nurses pouring water on it to keep him sane.</p><p>It was the closest any of the extensive branches of the family came to perishing in a bushfire - they learned the dangers and took precautions that have fallen out of favour and are now being fiercely debated all over again.</p><p>They cleared firebreaks and used fire against fire. My father as a young fellow learned from his father, who had learned from his and so on back through the generations, to do what the Aboriginal people had done: dribble fire into the forest in the cool of autumn, reducing fuel build-up.</p><p>All those years ago, Judge Stretton made a number of recommendations about what should be done to limit the state's fire risk, and some of them still form the basis for Victoria's fire control systems.</p><p>However, some of them have also fallen by the wayside or have been twisted to the point where they are unrecognisable.</p><p>Governments, bureaucrats, agencies and ideologically driven groups of all stripes have a habit of tearing apart the findings of inquiries. The most extreme example in recent times was a full-blooded assault by the ACT Government on the coroner inquiring into Canberra's disastrous fire attack of 2003, in which four lives were lost, hundreds were injured and almost 500 homes destroyed.</p><p>Chief Minister Jon Stanhope tried unsuccessfully to have the coroner, Maria Doogan, replaced during the inquiry, accusing her of \"apprehended bias\". When she finally brought down her report, which was deeply critical of Stanhope for deliberately downplaying the seriousness of the fire threat and in general scathing of the Emergency Services Bureau's handling of the crisis, Stanhope simply said Doogan was wrong.</p><p>It is fair to say that with a royal commission being established in Victoria, everyone with an interest - from the top of the Government to local authorities, from firefighters and emergency services agencies through to home owners - will be on high alert to ensure their reputations and careers and beliefs survive intact. Among the more interested parties will be that diverse group called environmentalists (by their admirers) or (by their antagonists) greenies.</p><p>There is this week a palpable mood that could turn into a serious backlash against some of the developments driven by green movements, deserved or not.</p><p>Trees and the comfort they give the human eye and soul have become almost sacred objects in some local government areas. Despite the judge's long-ago insistence that forest litter be cleared, Victorian authorities have made it all but illegal to pick up a fallen branch for firewood, let alone cut down scrub or a tree.</p><p>Some of the crustier characters from the scorched hills outside Melbourne noted this week that the Murrindindi Shire, which covers much of the worst-hit areas, encouraged landholders to plant as many trees as possible around their homes to ensure the bush character of the area was maintained. Many, of course, needed no such encouragement - it was precisely because of the bush character that people had moved to the hills or to the forested outskirts of cities.</p><p>The judge also recommended permanent firebreaks at forest margins where settlements were considered in danger. These should be determined according to local conditions, he said, but could be up to 800metres wide.</p><p>The Age reported this week that a family from Reedy Creek, in Mitchell Shire, had been fined $50,000 and spent a further $50,000 in legal costs because they bulldozed 250 trees to clear their property of fire danger.</p><p>The shire allows clearing only within six metres of homes, but Liam Sheahan and his family cleared 100metres. Their house is one of the few in Reedy Creek to have survived last weekend's bushfire, and the only one still standing in a two-kilometre area. Sheahan believes his illegal action has been vindicated.</p><p>Stark evidence lay on the road between Kinglake and Whittlesea this week that trees, so handsome on a fine day, can kill in numerous ways when things turn bad. Burnt-out cars that had smashed into logs fallen on the road were not removed for days.</p><p>A day after witnessing these dreadful tombs, this reporter found himself driving between Tallarook and Yea. Large trees on both sides of the road formed an archway overhead, and it was very beautiful. It was also impossible to ignore the ABC's warnings on the car radio that fire still burnt across the hills, and the thought that this lovely avenue could turn vicious seemed a paradox as bitter as the serene view from that destroyed house on the Kinglake ridge.</p><p>Stretton also insisted that the Forests Commission, now known as the Department of Sustainability and Environment, \"must recognise the necessity for protective burning in its areas and should respect local forest lore. Where practicable, autumn burning is preferable for protective purposes.\"</p><p>The department does oversee fuel-reduction burns - leading its detractors to dub the DSE \"the Department for Sparks and Embers\" - but finds itself criticised both for doing too much and doing too little burning. Some local councils won't allow it at all.</p><p>About 400,000 Victorian hectares have been subjected to prescribed burns over the past three years - almost exactly the same amount of land that has been destroyed since last weekend.</p><p>The fact remains that vast swathes of national parks and other public forests, once given those regular \"cool-burn\" treatments by leaseholders to promote grass growth for stock and to prevent hot fires fuelled by the understorey, have been allowed to revert to near-impenetrable bush.</p><p>Some environmentalists label prescribed burning as a threat to endangered species and environmental diversity, and a report this week said the Federal Government had received a submission from an unnamed group demanding it be outlawed across the nation.</p><p>A former meteorologist specialising in fire weather for the Bureau of Meteorology, David Packham, retorted that elements among green groups were behaving like \"eco-terrorists waging jihad against prescribed burning\". As a result, he declared, fuel levels at the time of last week's fire were the highest in Victoria for 30,000 years - a reference, apparently, to the ancient practice of Aboriginal people using firesticks to control their environment.</p><p>Premier John Brumby clearly recognises a mood for change, but managed this week to veer away from talking about controlled burning or whether people should be allowed to live in fire-prone bushland.</p><p>Instead, he reprised Stretton's idea of permanent firebreaks, saying people may have to get accustomed to removing native vegetation whether they liked it or not.</p><p>He also focused on one of the more glaringly obvious problems, house design in dangerous areas. His message was that technology could overcome many of the problems through the use of higher fire standards built into houses.</p><p>The unanswered question is whether those driven out of the bush by last week's fires will be able to rebuild before the royal commission has brought down its findings, which inevitably will deal with the way houses should be constructed. Most of the survivors who spoke to The Age this week expressed their desire to return and start building as soon as possible - and many had previously built wooden structures to blend in with their forested surroundings, believing their individual fire plans would be sufficient to deal with whatever the elements threw at them. It seems likely that the State Government will introduce new building standards before the commission has studied all the alternatives.</p><p>There is, too, much discussion about bunkers after one family survived in their purpose-built shelter. Brumby himself suggested bunkers may be an answer and pointed out that they were used widely in tornado-prone areas of America. A bushfire, others noted, was not like a tornado; you could incinerate running for the shelter, or have all the oxygen sucked out of it by the inferno.</p><p>The oldest of verities that one should decide, well in advance of any threat, whether to leave early or stay and fight - the so-called \"stay or go\" policy - smacked up against the reality that many who elected to stay had succumbed to the inferno. Precisely how this policy could be altered without forcing entire communities to evacuate down their narrow roads at the first scent of smoke remains unsolved.</p><p>Yet amid all the furious debate about what might be done to ameliorate the threat from Victoria's capricious rhythm identified so exquisitely by Stretton, there emerged as if from the air itself that indestructible element that suffers no divide in the Australian heart.</p><p>Even as the first survivors staggered out of the bush, volunteers were tossing together relief centres in safe havens all across the state.</p><p>Members of the Country Women's Association, of the Salvos and the Red Cross, doctors, nurses, emergency services personnel, police, church members and unbelievers and an army of ordinary folk with no thought but to help the suffering and support the firefighters stormed to footy ovals and recreation reserves, rolled up their sleeves and set to doing whatever might be required.</p><p>A blur of hands cut sandwiches and poured tea. Bandages and ointments were applied. Tents came from nowhere and everywhere. Shopkeepers emptied their shelves and sent vans scuttling with free goods of all types. Mattresses and bedding and clothing piled up, and householders opened their homes to strangers.</p><p>Noticeboards produced some order and much succour. Here was a board at Whittlesea, arrows pointing in every direction: \"Need to talk?\"; \"Accommodation\"; \"Meals\"; \"Light refreshments\"; \"Clothing\"; \"Information\"; \"1st Aid\"; \"Red Cross\". All around, burly blokes trundled in with their barbecues and fired them up, and workmen banged together a demountable hut where insurance advice could be obtained.</p><p>Around the corner a serenity of saffron-robed Buddhist monks hoisted a small tent and stuck up a sign offering Buddhist relief. The venerable Tich Quang Ba, from Canberra, explained that he and his colleagues from temples around Melbourne had $10,000 to give away.</p><p>Up the mountain, Kinglake's two Buddhist temples had survived while a Christian church was destroyed, only a brick wall inset with a giant glass cross left standing. The monks took nothing from this, accepting that a forest fire is as random as the unknowable universe.</p><p>Here was a young woman in a yellow T-shirt stencilled with the offer of \"Free Hugs\". She was doing roaring business. This offerer of hugs, Sam Atkinson, is unemployed and had nothing else to offer. \"People need compassion and I'm a compassionate person,\" was her simple explanation.</p><p>Another young woman, Sam Starr, was busily costuming herself in clown get-up, preparing to entertain, as \"Crazy Daisy\", bored and confused children. She had driven from Coburg.</p><p>\"My sister's from Kinglake,\" she said. \"She wasn't home when the fire came and miraculously her house is still standing, but her father-in-law's house is gone. I thought that's it, my car's full of petrol and I'm ready to go. I've got balloons and face-painting gear and I'll go from spot to spot until sundown and find kids who need cheering up.\"</p><p>Away up the road in Yea, the recreation reserve's noticeboard sported hastily scrawled signs of generosity and desperation. \"Please telephone your brother Oscar as soon as possible,\" pleaded one; \"100 acres of land vacant for stock/horses,\" another offered. \"Thank you for donating. However, due to overwhelming support we cannot accept any more clothing,\" apologised yet another.</p><p>In the clubhouse, that blur of hands kept a steady stream of food coming, and out on the oval little kids played cricket and soccer. Some bounced in a blow-up jumping castle. It had been brought out from Melbourne by yet more clown-suited entertainers. They were from Planetshakers, a large, cheerful church group from Melbourne, and they were painting children's faces, handing out lollipops and doing magic tricks.</p><p>\"We authentically love kids, and when I see them hurting I want to help them,\" said Rob Bradbury, his head bedecked with a giant plastic Elvis quiff. \"My wife, Assunta, and I are grief counsellors and we know that children's grief is different to that of adults. It is both shorter and longer - they can't process it on the spot and they go back to playing their Nintendo, but it comes back in the night and stays with them for a long time.\"</p><p>The church will give all its tithes and donations this Sunday to the bushfire appeal. It is likely to be about $90,000.</p><p>All across the nation, Australians answered Prime Minister Kevin Rudd's call for them to dig deep.</p><p>By yesterday, the bushfire appeal through the Red Cross had raised more than $84 million.</p><p>Sky News beamed live from Canberra on a giant screen the stream of condolence motions that replaced the normal jabber of question time, which was cancelled all week in the knowledge that political rhetoric would seem squalid at a time of such grief.</p><p>So sensitive to the hint of a crass political word were those gathered in the relief stations that an audible murmur of displeasure rippled through the crowds when it seemed Rudd had strayed into linking his $42billion stimulus package with the rebuilding of fire-ravaged communities.</p><p>Indeed, the mood across the increasingly crowded sanctuaries shifted as surely as the wind as more and more news media cameras, microphones and reporters hurried to capture the stories and the images of this near-unimaginable horror.</p><p>Many of us in the media have experienced this very phenomenon in other extreme circumstances, after the landslide in Thredbo and the goldmine collapse in Beaconsfield, for instance. Small communities become so overwhelmed by the attention that they shift rapidly from relief at being able to share their experiences with the world to a sullen shunning of reporters and occasional angry outbursts at them.</p><p>By the end of the week at many relief stations, there was a visible stand-off between those who had rushed from fires and those come to collect their stories.</p><p>Perhaps it will always be thus - cameras in particular are visible instruments of intrusion, however sensitive their operators and colleagues may wish to be to the suffering, and however important their reports may be to galvanising a nation to help.</p><p>Swiss doctor Elizabeth Kubler-Ross described in her book On Death and Dying in 1969 a series of emotions that often are referred to as the \"grief cycle\". There are, in this theory, five identifiable stages that those who are bereaved and traumatised are likely to have to wend their way through.</p><p>Stage one is denial (\"this can't be happening to me\"), stage two is anger (\"why me?\"). Then comes bargaining (\"If I do this, surely destiny might be different\"), followed by depression (\"I can't bear this\") and, finally, acceptance (\"I'm ready to resume life\").</p><p>You might add a couple more ingredients to this emotional stew: guilt and relief.</p><p>Having experienced both, 12years ago, when my own family home was consumed by fire when I was at work and my children were in the house - I found them alive and distressed on the street as windows blew out and firemen came racing to save what was left - I could not bear to approach shattered, often weeping survivors early this week.</p><p>By week's end, few of the fire-struck appeared to have moved beyond Kubler-Ross' stage two.</p><p>Here and there, though, were hardy souls who had sauntered straight to stage five: acceptance.</p><p>Kenn Airens, a snowy-haired and bearded man of 57 whose Glaswegian accent has hardly lost its burr in the 32years he has been in Australia, fled with his wife, Els, from remote Toolangi as flames reared over the ridge and consumed their home.</p><p>After a harrowing journey through the forests, the fire pursuing them, they and a couple of hundred other refugees found their way to Yea. A casual acquaintance from the town spotted them and insisted the couple come and live in his family's home.</p><p>Airens thinks he may head towards Queensland and jokes that he would probably find himself flooded out up there, but in the meantime he is content to offer a hand or a yarn to anyone who might need it around Yea.</p><p>\"Well, it's just the nature of Australia,\" he says of his ordeal, and launches into praise for the generosity of those around him.</p><p>There was a bloke, he says, who lost his only home, a camper on the back of a ute, who could hardly believe his fortune when he was given a tent. The fellow immediately sought out others who needed a place to sleep, declaring the tent was so large he had plenty of room for others.</p><p>\"It's all a bit of a bugger, but you move on,\" Airens says with a shrug.</p><p>Quite.</p><p>Precisely where and how remains the question.</p><p>Homes of timber on the edge of steep, forested ridges with native bush all around no longer seem the most satisfactory answer, however glorious the views may be, and however</p><p>brave and resourceful their residents may be.</p><p>At a time when the state of Victoria is searching for new solutions to an old problem, we might pray that Bernard Teague, a former Supreme Court justice who will chair the royal commission into Victoria's bushfires, proves as adept as old Judge Stretton in sorting the wood from the trees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FIVE PHOTOS: \"And so it was that, when millions of acres of the forest were invaded by bushfires, there happened ... the most disastrous forest calamity the state of Victoria has known.\" SOUTH GIPPSLAND PHOTOGRAPH BY WAYNE TAYLOR ;

If the Government were to treat the black community the same way that it does the white community, then there would be no problem.</p><p> We are all aware that if a black family moved into a house and started damaging the property, the landlord could not evict them because a cowardly Government, constantly running scared of being seen as racist, has a different set of rules for coloured people.</p><p> Agents are in a difficult situation because landlords expect them to look after their interests. Thus, if any tenant, no matter what their colour, does not reach the requirements of the landlord, they should be politely told that there are no suitable premises to rent.</p><p> Joe Wallace, Wollongong</p><p>Delayed deposits</p><p>I had an eye-opening experience with my \"friendly\" bank last week. I deposited cash (my pay) into an ATM on Thursday, November 8, and when I tried to pay some bills via BPay on the Internet on Saturday, November 10, I discovered that the money I had deposited still was not available for use.</p><p> I was told that there is a four-day delay for deposits made at ATMs not physically next to the bank (which was not correct in my case), and that the money would not be available until Tuesday, November 13.</p><p> After I complained, a person at my bank contacted the bank where I had made the deposit and eventually the funds were all made available that day.</p><p> So, not only do the banks take forever to clear cheque deposits, they also hang on to cash deposits for four days (probably longer when there is a weekend involved) and deny you access to your own money. I wonder how much the \"delayed\" deposits all add up to in a week.</p><p> Banks charge you if do use the tellers -- they want you</p><p>to use ATMs so you don't clutter up their banks -- but still find more and more and more ways to penalise you if you use an ATM.</p><p> L. Clarke, Darlinghurst</p><p>Lives worth saving</p><p>Stewart Lang (\"Does anyone care?\" Letters, November 10) is understandably upset at the poor treatment his grandmother received in hospital. And he is not alone -- anyone who has been near a hospital for years knows they are suffering from a serious lack of funds.</p><p> But the implication in his letter is that it would be better to let drug users die or suffer overdoses so as to save money for hospitals.</p><p> Actually, the injection room may well be saving money as it revives an addict who has overdosed on the spot, rather than having to call an ambulance to take him to hospital, as the delay may mean more damage might have been done, thus costing even more.</p><p> There is a win/win solution to the problem. If we stopped this idiotic and futile \"war on drugs\", we could free up hundreds of millions of dollars that could be better spent on hospitals and schools.</p><p> After all, we are not actually stopping anyone who wants drugs from getting them at the moment. All we are doing is wasting money that would be better spent elsewhere and causing untold human misery for both drug users and non-drug users who get swept up in drug-related crime.</p><p> L. Smith, Potts Point</p><p>Changi was never like this</p><p>The ABC series Changi could be a demeaning insult to surviving Australian and British prisoners of the Japanese in World War II.</p><p>I have read that the reason for Changi's caricature of the young military prisoners' frequently inhuman treatment was to make the series palatable.</p><p> I don't suppose any survivors of the real malnutrition, disease-ridden Changi, or their relatives, have congratulated the ABC on an enjoyable series.</p><p> The TV Changi may transpire to be future generations' only imagery of a tragic episode in Australian military history. Many of the young soldier and officer prisoners were destined for the infamous Burma Railway.</p><p> Admirers and supporters of the ABC may hope that the burlesque Changi TV series will not be exported.</p><p> John Joseph, East Hills</p><p>Unsafe outside our schools</p><p>Once again, Transport Minister Carl Scully (\"$10m for school safety,\" Daily Telegraph, November 9) has taken a swipe at parents in an effort to avoid making the hard decisions.</p><p> He had a chance to do something constructive for school pupil travel safety but has chosen to hide behind RTA \"experts\". In rejecting a whole of school day (i.e. during school hours) imposition of 40km/h zones around schools, he has ensured drivers will continue to ignore this speed limit,</p><p>as they do around his inane</p><p>bus rule.</p><p> Where is the promise of improved enforcement and a real effort to re-educate drivers? Parents can still have little faith in safety measures around schools and will continue to clog the streets outside schools with private vehicles.</p><p> Brian Evans, Wahroonga</p><p>In response to Peter Lawson (\"Roads no privilege,\" Letters, November 9), there will be no toll booths on the Lane Cove tunnel, so a \"gridlock\" of cars while money is handed over will not be an issue. It will be</p><p>a cashless tollway, with e-tags for all motorists to ensure the smooth flow of traffic.</p><p> Mr Lawson also seems unaware that the tunnel is a big win for public transport. The proposal includes dedicated bus-only lanes on both sides of Epping Rd for the section with the tunnel running underneath. In addition there will be extra transit lanes on both sides of the Gore Hill Freeway.</p><p> Carl Scully, Roads and</p><p> Transport Minister, Sydney</p><p>Christopher Wood (Letters, November 9) raises an issue about bus/train connections.</p><p> The route 412 he refers to runs every 12 minutes at that time of the morning. To assist Mr Wood in his travel, catching an earlier bus to avoid rushing to make his train connection would work bet-</p><p>ter. Leaving a connection</p><p>time of six minutes can sometimes be difficult to maintain should heavy traffic conditions intervene.</p><p> It is always wise to leave a little extra time. Sydney Buses makes every effort to keep our services on time.</p><p> State Transit is looking at increasing the frequency of the 412 in the near future, given the recent growth in patronage.</p><p> John Stott,</p><p> Chief Executive, State Transit,</p><p> Sydney</p><p>The Queensland Government is going to sink the HMAS Brisbane for fish habitat and tourist scuba divers. This ship is the last of a long line of fighting ships, the last of the destroyers and the last of the steam-powered ships. The North Vietnamese could not sink her, but the Government will.</p><p> The ship should be preserved as a floating memorial to the men who served in her and other ships of the navy. Somewhere in Queensland there must be a group of people who would maintain the ship for non-scuba-diving tourists to visit, to smell, feel and see how the navy worked and lived.</p><p> It will cost a lot of money to maintain the ship, but it would also take a lot to remove all the oil and grease, as well as other materials, to make the ship safe for scuba divers and fish.</p><p> Other museums don't preserve their cars, trains or planes by destroying them, so keep HMAS Brisbane above water in one piece, not below.</p><p> P. McManus, Shalvey</p><p>At last, it's all over</p><p>We have a wonderful week ahead of us. No more baby kissing and mummy cuddling. No more false smiling. No stupid advertisements on radio and TV. Let's enjoy it.</p><p> Brian Welfare, North Curl Curl</p><p>I am a 19-year-old student at La Trobe University in Wodonga and this would have been my first vote in a federal election -- but I was deprived of the opportunity.</p><p> I was visiting my parents in the small town of Tottenham, NSW. I am enrolled for the Indi electorate and as that is interstate, I could not vote at the local polling booth. It seems you have to vote at an AEC office if you are from interstate, and the nearest one of those was about two hours away and I could not get there.</p><p> I was under the impression that you could vote for any electorate at any polling booth anywhere in Australia, but it seems I was mistaken.</p><p> This is not good enough. As things stand, the idea of every voice in Australia being heard is an absolute farce. I am furious and hurt that my opinion doesn't matter, but am determined to make sure my voice is heard.</p><p> Linda Ayton, Wodonga, Vic</p><p>Now that the dust is settling after the federal election, I wonder how Mr Howard could feel satisfied and proud that the Coalition won as a result of a campaign developed around the deliberate engendering of fear and uncertainty in the population at large.</p><p> Using issues so vehemently from outside the country is of dubious merit.</p><p> William Barwood, Canowindra</p><p>E-talk</p><p>I have just returned home to New Zealand from a visit to Tasmania. While there I visited the Styx Valley to see the famed giant eucalypts. What a shattering experience to see hundreds of hectares of clearfell through the forest, fire-bombed stumps and exotic replanting. I gather that under current plans, these awesome forests are doomed. These, the world's tallest forests outside California. As a foreign visitor, I can assure you that visiting the Styx is a truly astounding experience. I have seen many of the world's forests and these are of near-peerless international standing. A handsome sum could be reaped from tourism by promoting this area internationally and yet it is squandered for woodchip. Yes, I saw the vast, sickening woodchip pile, from the ferry to Maria Island National Park. What an irony. Australia, hang your head in shame.</p><p> Keryn Squires, Nelson, New Zealand</p><p>I cannot understand why there is so much confusion about the $10 levy introduced to help Ansett employees gain their entitlements. My understanding is that the levy is being paid by the travelling public for the Ansett employees, so therefore there should be no confusion about where or how the funds are allocated. Just give the money to the employees, Mr Howard, and when the funding is completed, remove the levy. It is that simple. As for the funds being a loan -- will the people who paid the levy be repaid if the Government gets the money back? I don't think so. A loan it is not, and nor should it be. I also cannot understand why Qantas would want to deprive any of its Australian workers and subcontractors the right to their share of employment and funds because the Ansett employees are being assisted. The public is not complaining about helping those poor Ansett employees, so stay out of the argument or your present monopoly on the Australian skies may not last if you bite the hand that feeds it.</p><p> Ian Gregory, Repton</p><p>Schools say thank you</p><p>Schools have asked The Daily Telegraph\u00a0 for a forum to thank the thousands of people who have contributed tokens as part of our Free Books for Schools program.

So says a visiting anthropologist who warns that society's achievements are creating ripe conditions for diseases deadlier than AIDS. Indeed, if you are feeling pretty chipper, be warned, writes DEBRA JOPSON . You are merely experiencing a blip in the archaeological record.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BELIEVE Western health advances have made humankind healthier than ever in history? That people have \"progressed\" from living in dangerous hunter-gatherer societies to the rude health of mass civilisation? Wrong, says the Distinguished Teaching Professor of Anthropology at New York State University, Mark Cohen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now on a six-month sabbatical in Australia, Cohen is riveting Sydney University students with his argument that Western progress in health is a myth and that only an affluent minority in the world is better off than hunter-gatherer societies.</p><p>\"What we are enjoying at the moment is not the culmination of a natural progression at all. It's a blip,\" he contends. \"All this advantage we are enjoying is between 50 and 150 years old. If that were in the archaeological record, we wouldn't even see it.</p><p>\"We are in a lull. We are in a period when epidemic disease is not a terrible problem. We have all kinds of evidence that it can happen again.\"</p><p>Contrary to popular belief, argues Cohen, as Western society becomes complacent about its health achievements, the conditions are ripe for a deadly disease more virulent than AIDS to sweep the world.</p><p>\"The conditions are worse than ever. The faster we move, the bigger the danger. Even in Columbus's day, a disease had to be able to survive months on shipboard. Now somebody can get on an aeroplane and bring a disease in in a couple of hours.</p><p>\"How long have we been trying to find a way to combat AIDS? What you have to imagine is that AIDS, which is very slow because it is a venereal disease, could be influenza-like. It could spread through the air. We still can't stop influenza from spreading. The best we can do is protect people a little bit.\"</p><p>There are \"thousands of known infections which are hovering around\" in animals and \"isolated human populations\". The recent horrific outbreak of Ebola virus in Africa is only one example.</p><p>\"We have now created the conditions under which any one of them can spread,\" Cohen says. \"So it seems to me terribly important that major places like the American Centre for Disease Control and its Australian equivalent be as informed as (they) can possibly be about virus potential; about germ potential.\"</p><p>Intimations of how civilisation could kill us have been emerging all too rapidly of late. \"Mad cow\" disease, for instance, transmitted to British beef stock through feed containing scrapie-infected sheep offal and manifesting in humans as the horrific Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, is a \"flow-on\" from our \"intervention in systems\", says Yvonne Cossart, Sydney University's Professor of Infectious Diseases.</p><p>Dr Michael Catton, medical virologist with Melbourne's Fairfield Infectious Diseases Hospital, says: \"There has been a trend for new infectious agents to appear and other agents that we thought we had under control coming back to haunt us.\"</p><p>The new viruses include equine morbillivirus (which killed Queensland horse trainer Vic Rail) and New Mexico's mouse-borne hantavirus, (which has caused several human deaths).</p><p>The returnees include tuberculosis (TB), which the World Health Organisation recently warned is now infecting one person every second and killing three million people annually - the highest rate in history.</p><p>TB is now multi-drug resistant and scientists have predicted that if its current march is not halted, up to a half a billion people will contract it in the next 50 years.</p><p>Britain's The Independent newspaper has reported outbreaks recently in London, Milan, New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Paris and Estonia, as well as cities in India, Thailand, South Africa and Pakistan.</p><p>The reasons scientists ascribe to the spread to the developed world fit in perfectly with the Cohen theory: more movement between countries, the collapse of public health infrastructure and a rise in homelessness and poverty.</p><p>According to Catton, the alarm began with scientists who finally convinced governments - and the public is now catching up on the news.</p><p>Cohen first spelt out his jaundiced view of our outlook in his scholarly Health and the Rise of Civilization (Yale University Press) seven years ago.</p><p>To peer into our future, he surveyed the past, reading the signs in hunter-gatherers' skeletons, as well as anthropological and historical accounts of living people.</p><p>His conclusion: civilisation has been vastly overrated by its citizens. Rather than spreading health, it has generated sickness.</p><p>\"The major epidemic diseases that we all are so proud of getting rid of in the 20th century were all new in the 15th and 16th centuries because it takes civilised crowds and transport to spread them,\" says Cohen.</p><p>\"If we compare what we know about primitive groups with the reality of civilised history, they in fact did quite well. For example, the best estimates that we have of life expectancy in Stone Age groups is equal to, or as good as, Europe up until about 1850.\"</p><p>We've got civilisation all wrong, Cohen argues. It is not about clever humans producing wonderful technology and inventing huge, fascinating complex places called cities.</p><p>Populations grew and people grudgingly adapted by working out ways to live together in big groups. The only advantage was military, allowing people living in bigger groups to overrun the countries of people living in smaller groups.</p><p>The disadvantage for all but the wealthiest (the developed world) was that living in big groups was bad for their health. Farming may have meant people could live in bigger groups, but their nutrition dropped off, he believes.</p><p>The proof of this is around today, Cohen argues. While privileged Westerners currently enjoy better health than their cave-dwelling ancestors, Indians and Chinese average about 2,000 calories each daily. This is the same as hunter-gatherers, only worse. These modern people have more of that no-no - starch - in their diet. \"All of India and all of China (is) eating less well than hunter-gatherers,\" Cohen asserts.</p><p>Not that he is trying to picture past lives as paradise. Over history, hunter-gatherers have had an average life expectancy of just 25 to 30 years, he surmises. Only five to six of every 10 made it to adulthood.</p><p>But, if we were born just 200 years ago in Europe, chances are that we would be far worse off, he says.</p><p>Life expectancy at birth for people in in London in 1604 was 18 years. In Sheffield, in England's north, in the 1860s men could expect to live to 32 and women to 35.</p><p>Do you have Celtic antecedents? In Irish cities in the 1830s, you were likely to make it to just 24. Poor diet made for short people who probably had to look up to New World natives.</p><p>\"The Englishmen who came here in the 1780s undoubtedly represented a society that was less well-nourished, less healthy and, at least if you lived in London, clearly shorter than the Australian Aboriginal (society),\" Cohen says.</p><p>Farming eventually brought undesirable health consequences: coronary heart disease, diabetes, multiple sclerosis and high blood pressure, to name just a few conditions for which little evidence has been found in the skeletons of hunter-gatherers, he says. He claims his theories - outlandish as they may sound to lay people - are based on sound, thorough research.</p><p>\"I have collected everything I could find about the known health of the Australian Aborigines on contact, but also on hunter-gatherers in India, South-East Asia, North and South America. And I also have the historical descriptions of living people in, say, London in the 17th century.\"</p><p>He has also drawn on scientific understandings of disease: \"Now that we know how diseases work, we can predict rather well where and when they will strike.\"</p><p>He uses measles, probably a mutation of a virus in tame animals and thus not a disease of \"primitive\" societies, as an example of the potential deadliness of civilisation.</p><p>\"In my generation, we all got measles. We all got violently ill with this terrible sickness but after two weeks there (was) one of two results. You're immune, because you've beaten it and you never get it again; or you're dead. Even if it had turned up as a mutation in the hunter-gatherer world, it might have made the immediate 30 people very sick. It might have killed many of them, but it might never have spread, because it kills you too fast. It's like a forest fire. If the fire starts on an island, the island burns, but there is no spread.</p><p>\"But when civilisation spreads - which means dense urban concentration and rapid transit, measles becomes a permanent problem and then it can spread around the world, killing lots of people.\"</p><p>Cohen believes the growth of the American underclass is setting the scenario for a possible outbreak of disease. \"In New York city, there are lots of places where there are young children and rats living together. We have bubonic plague in the US, but at the moment it is only in the boondocks. The danger is, if we allow the rats to become prevalent in cities, we are setting up conditions for the plague to return.\"</p><p>As a solution, Cohen argues for threefold investment - to buy health for the world's poor, for the indigenous people for whom \"civilisation\" has often spelt disaster, and for the rest of us whose well-being may depend on our less fortunate neighbours.</p><p>\"We like to think in terms of primitive people that we do them a favour if we bring them Christianity or civilise them, but what I am saying is we have done them terrible damage, so we have a responsibility to invest in them.</p><p>\"I would also extend it to everybody, including the affluent, and say that the civilised structures that we have built are not ways of eliminating disease.</p><p>\"They generate disease over and over and over again and we have to be very careful about whether a new economic activity has a risk of disease. We have to go on being careful about infectious disease control.\"</p><p>Cohen agrees his health prognosis is \"scary\".</p><p>\"What I mean it to be is humbling because this says to me that Europeans have this wonderful sense of superiority (over) everybody else. What I am trying to point out is that the superiority is military and not much else. It's not about a better life. It's about power.\"</p><p>Thus, he sees a danger to our physical, as well as social, health in the racism he claims is now resurfacing in Western societies. While in Australia, he is completing a book on tolerance.</p><p>\"I perceive a very large swing away from tolerance in the United States. It is increasingly fashionable to be racist. Racist things that used to be said only on the shortwave radios of Nazi groups are now coming out of mainstream radio,\" he says.</p><p>\"Our intolerance of others and our sense of our own superiority is based on a perception of our own history, which results from textbooks which are cheerleading and not looking at the facts.\"</p><p>I CANNOT get anyone to engage me,\" laments Professor Mark Cohen. His thesis, he believes, is too big and too sweeping to provoke head-on critiques in academe, where most prefer to stick to the security of their specialties.</p><p>But yesterday, the president of the Academy of Science, Sir Gustav Nossal, took exception to Cohen's claims about a lack of progress, declaring: \"I think he is attacking scientific medicine.\"</p><p>Quoting the 17th-century philosopher Thomas Hobbes, whose characterisation of primitive life Cohen wants to disprove, Nossal said: \"I am a proponent of the view that life was 'poor, nasty, brutish and short'.\" But he agrees with Cohen on the ever-present danger of another disease outbreak: \"Unfortunately, the microbial world is out there and its selfish DNA and RNA (are) trying just as hard as we are to establish themselves.\"</p><p>His academy this week warned in a report on our customs controls that we must stay vigilant about the threat of incoming diseases. Our other defence, argues Nossal, is global immunisation, with smallpox already eradicated and measles and polio on the way out.</p><p>Sydney University's Professor of Infectious Diseases, Professor Yvonne Cossart, says: \"I think we have every reason to have a bit of a salutary look at ourselves. We have had the benefit of both improved food production and control of infection which allows us to have larger numbers. (But) we have been neglecting some of the things we need to do to control diseases.\"</p><p>The developing world's big cities amount to \"a new industrial age involving far bigger numbers\" than the first industrial age. However, some do not have the infrastructure - such as a good water supply - needed to support the population in good health. \"Whether it is apocalypse now is harder to say because I am not sure to what extent the rising tide of problems will induce action from the rest of the world,\" Cossart says.</p><p>Health assistance to the Third World is more than altruism; it is in the First World's interest.</p><p>\"You could take the example of smallpox vaccine, which was paid for by the First World for the benefit of the First World,\" she says.</p><p>A Melbourne medical virologist, Dr Michael Catton, has no doubt there could be \"a new strain out there\" of some deadly disease.</p><p>And Cohen's peers' views? As a new-style archaeologist who seeks to interpret modern trends by analysing the ancient, he \"is very much on the right wave-length\", according to Sydney University reader in pre-history, Dr Peter White.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Drawing: By Rocco Fazzari</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhra4ql3moexmh0kwn</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1996</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P85-11C0-TXN5-R1RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2255\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1996 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>April 4, 1996 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>International</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Health/Diseases/Infectious</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000051</classCode><className>AIDS &amp;

Murray Waldren meets a spirited woman who has faced her own demons and come out fighting</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">THE headlines and the tumult belong to another era. And by the time you reach the end of the gravel and dirt driveway that winds through the vineyard to Betty Churcher's farm retreat, they might as well belong in another country. Her house -- 30 minutes from Canberra's centre, Philip Cox-designed and corrugated iron-clad, its arc roof a playful echo of the Sydney Opera House -- speaks only of rural serenity.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's seven years since Churcher retired as director of the National Gallery of Australia after a seven-year reign that began in controversy, continued amid stuffed-shirt sniping from the critical sidelines and ended with sadness and trauma. It was also a reign that revolutionised Australian gallery culture by making the world's best art accessible, and gallery-going widely popular, via a series of visionary exhibitions the press dubbed Betty's Blockbusters.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>Many saw her retirement from the NGA as the full stop on what had been a glittering career of arts administration and academic authorship. Before her NGA appointment, she had been art school dean at Victoria's Phillip Institute and director of the Art Gallery of Western Australia, where she had had to negotiate around the \"erratic genius\" of then chairman Robert Holmes a Court. She had headed numerous national advisory boards and committees, in 1996 been made an Officer of the Order of Australia and the following year named The Australian's Australian of the Year.</p><p>As she had done throughout her career, however, Churcher wrongfooted popular opinion, beginning a three-year career writing and presenting immensely popular programs on art for ABC television.</p><p>Now 73, she is still far from retiring from cultural life. She is adjunct professor for the Centre for Cross-Cultural Research at the Australian National University. And she is still determinedly making quality art accessible and relevant -- this time her blockbuster is a book-and-TV double feature that explores the range and diversity of art inspired by war. Next year comes the TV series, this week the book. Lavishly illustrated and succinctly elucidated, The Art of War charts how artists have interpreted Australian involvement in conflicts from World War I to the war against terror in Afghanistan and the Persian Gulf, showing also that while war has influenced movements in art, art has also affected attitudes to war.</p><p>The Churchers are a close-knit clan and there's a protective if subconscious checking-out process to be gone through before I receive the interview all-clear. Her husband, artist Roy Churcher, meets me first, accompanied by the family dog Pinot, whose stick-in-mouth greeting demands a getting-to-know-you throw. Son Paul, who manages the family vineyard \"and keeps Roy and me and our amenities ticking over\", makes a quick refuelling pit stop at the house, then Roy brews us coffee before disappearing to his studio further down the property.</p><p>Only then do Churcher and I retire to the family-sized dining table, a carved work of folk art in a discreetly artistic living room. Paintings in a melange of styles and sizes, many by friends and family, line the long wall behind us while across the room a windowed wall frames a wide veranda and, beyond that, a northerly panorama over a dry creek bed towards an amphitheatre of circling hills complete with abundant trees and the odd kangaroo. In the corner, a country-idyll wood-fuel heater promises cosiness but the room's welcoming warmth actually emanates from a feisty gas fire. And from Churcher.</p><p>She exudes an aura of calm authority, benign dignity and can-do competence, handy assets for dealing with artistic turmoils, for raising four sons and for coping with \"a cataclysm of grandchildren\" at Christmas. Composure is the keynote but it would be imprudent to misread this as passivity; Churcher prefers convivial relations in all things but she has a discerning intellect and a driving spirit -- she has never been afraid to assess, and then act.</p><p>The Art of War, she says, \"was born out of a deep despair that I can't even let you understand the magnitude of -- for two years I'd wanted to do a project on Aboriginal art. I wanted to get together the great art of mostly living Aboriginal artists and show them as you would any great art, their roots, their development and so on. But the fact I was not Aboriginal made it a problem of political correctness for SBS and the ABC, and they wouldn't take it on.\"</p><p>At about this time in late 2001, when she \"was in black despair\", her Melbourne-based son Peter was selected as the Australian War Memorial's official artist to record our military involvement in the coalition against terrorism in Afghanistan.</p><p>\"His appointment got me thinking, about him and how he would cope, and then about other war artists \u2026 and then those beyond the official war artists who were also recording impressions of war. And I realised just how little I knew about the wars of the 20th and 21st centuries.\"</p><p>So she began to explore war via artists' eyes, and soon spotted a distinguishing divergence in perspective -- the human element. \"Historians are interested in how many people landed on the beaches, how quickly they established themselves. The artist in the trenches or at the front line focuses more on the discomfort of life there, on the camaraderie that develops. They are not necessarily great artists but they have left incredibly evocative records.\"</p><p>She was hooked on what became a 30-month project of \"really intense research. I was at the war memorial archives every day, trawling through file after file, reading personal correspondence, looking at diaries \u2026 much of the material I drew on has never been used before.\" She had envisaged the project solely as a TV series, \"but after that was shot I found I had so much relevant material left over that I decided to write a book as well\".</p><p>The whole multimedia project is bookended by two personal relationships: at one end her son's Afghanistan posting, at the other her father's involvement in World War I. She has dedicated her book to her father, William Dewar Cameron, who was so keen to sign up for active service that he had all his teeth extracted rather than have his induction delayed for minor remedial dental work. It was, she writes, \"a rash decision he was to regret for the rest of his life\". He saw service at Ypres and Bullecourt, was gassed, and discharged as medically unfit in 1918.</p><p>\"He was always terribly reluctant to speak about anything to do with his war experiences, even though as a child I used to pester him to tell me. This reluctance seems to have been in due proportion to involvement -- those on the periphery were quite happy to discuss their experiences a great deal, but Dad became almost phobic about it. He also</p><p> became phobic about smells, and related that to his memory of rotting corpses and dysentery and mud in thetrenches.\"</p><p>She used to think her father's silence about the war was because \"he was just a taciturn, withdrawn man, and there's no doubt he was by nature, but when I started reading the diaries from young soldiers at the front I realised why he used to say, 'There's no point talking about it, Betty, you wouldn't understand.' He literally couldn't make me understand what it had been about. How could you possibly get the catastrophic horror of it across?\"</p><p>The project had an unexpected personal reward: it allowed her to better understand her father, who was, she says, a dominant influence on her life, \"even if I did find it difficult to get as close to him as I wished. He was an amateur artist who got me interested in art, but everything about him I wanted to emulate. His mother died a month after he was born and he grew up in the Scottish Highlands with his grandmother, who spoke only Gaelic. I grew up very much my father's daughter, and in many ways, yes, I am like him, a bit dour, a bit laconic. I also like to be on my own, to be solitary.\"</p><p>Besides which, her mother, although strong-willed and a strong influence, \"wasn't gregarious at all\". Churcher always felt \"a bit on the outside as a child because Mum was of that Victorian ethos that believed women had defined roles. I was always being told that certain behaviour was inappropriate because I was a girl.\" That was a war front on a familial level and her \"liberation\" came only after a family legacy allowed her to go to an all-girls school, Brisbane's Somerville House, where \"they expected the absolute best of us, no matter what it was, whether we were going to be judges, brain surgeons or mothers\".</p><p>As for her son Peter's war tour of duty in 2002, Churcher says it \"didn't worry me from the safety point at all because I knew they were far more protected than the early war artists. My main worry was how he would cope because he refuses to paint from photographs -- he operates on emotional and visual stimulus -- and I didn't know how he would be able to get people in a war zone to stay still. But he succeeded brilliantly, focusing on the intimate moments around the people rather than events they were engaged in.\"</p><p>Her research also focused on moments of great intimacy in war, and it had its own collateral damage.</p><p>\"As you deal with the material, what had been a concept becomes a tangible reality, and that became quite confronting at times -- understanding the battles, what happened and why, and realising the</p><p>To Page 6</p><p>From Page 5</p><p>extent of the genocide. I was also aware that the unofficial artists were flouting death from their own side as well as from the enemy because strict orders forbade anything being recorded at the front line.\"</p><p>Such war censorship is not unusual, she says. \"Australians at home had no idea that Gallipoli was a failure until after the war, and we knew nothing of the extent of the bombing of Darwin in '42.\" Besides, in World War I it was almost considered unpatriotic to show defeats and setbacks -- \"even the Anzac book that C.W. Bean initiated, which was by the troops, for the troops and published in 1916, was all to do with humour and self-deprecating fun; it had very little about the true horror of their situation, which was ghastly.\" In the 10 years of the Vietnam War, she says by way of illustration, \"around 500 Australians died -- in the battle of the Nek in August 1915, nearly half that number died in less than an hour. The magnitude then of human casualty was colossal.\"</p><p>We also forget how young the soldiers are, I mention, recalling the previous night's serendipitous TV screening of Full Metal Jacket, in which troops that had been engaged in scenes of the most brutal carnage in Vietnam were marching back to base singing the Mouseketeer theme song. \"It was the same in World War I,\" she says, \"the flower of youth, a generation was gutted \u2026 when I was at school, a whole generation of maiden ladies was around because the local men of marriageable ages had been decimated.\"</p><p>During her research she uncovered \"many, many, many personal revelations, not just about myself and my father but also about art, and Australia. For instance, I found a letter from Hans Heysen to Lionel Lindsay talking about George Lambert's landscape in A Sergeant of the Light Horse in Palestine and how it looked so like the Flinders Ranges. That inspired him to take his palettes and brushes into the Flinders Ranges in the '20s and '30s and that started the whole post-war thing of painting our inland as a subject in its own right. Prior to that, coastal Australia had been considered the only valid pictorial scene; the earlier exploratory inland paintings by the like of T.S. Gill had a topographical impetus.\"</p><p>Yet while World War I changed our focus on the landscape and our concept of what was pictorially accepted as a landscape, \"in Europe it gave rise to expressionism, to surrealism, to dadaism, to a whole different movement in art based on the trauma of the war\". It was a head-and-heart dichotomy, mirrored during World War II in the differing approaches by Sydney and Melbourne artists. In Melbourne, \"you had young Arthur Boyd, young Sydney Nolan, young Albert Tucker looking towards the European artists and expressing a kind of internal angst over the war. But Sydney artists like [William] Dobell, [Russell] Drysdale, [Donald] Friend, [David] Strachan, even the young Margaret Olley, were much more about vision, and looking towards the British war artists. That difference should have been apparent to me before, but it took working on the book to bring it out.\"</p><p>While not all the art of war is great art, she concedes, some is. \"Gordon Bennet, George Lambert, Arthur Streeton are great artists within the Australian context, and I think the challenge of the war somehow brought out the best in them. It moved them out of their comfort zones, and they produced some very important works.\" She hopes the book, and later the TV series, will also alert people to \"what we call minor artists and the value they have within the general structure, so that we are looking at the slopes and the valleys as well as the peaks. That allows the whole-picture perspective.\"</p><p>She also hopes to capture an audience beyond history and art buffs. The Art of War, she says, \"is a multifaceted approach -- words, paintings, sketches, photographs and TV -- and I think the time is right for a project like this because in a curious way the zeitgeist is now focused on combat and warfare, and the human cost, ingenuity and sacrifice these entail. We have had renewed interest in D-Day and World War II, for instance, and then there is the situation in Iraq.\"</p><p>* * *</p><p>IN many ways, Churcher is, along with writer Olga Masters, a never-say-never pin-up gal for late starters. Brisbane-born and raised, she had shown near precocious ability as a child for drawing and in her late teens won a rare scholarship to London's Royal College of Art. She recalls herself then as an obsessed and obsessive painter, her whole life dedicated to pursuing her art. In London in 1953 she also met and married fellow art student Roy Churcher (\"although he was studying at Slade\"). She actually proposed to him, she has said, at Poole Harbour in Dorset when they were going on a boat trip. \"I'd got into the boat and he was just about to step in when from nowhere I said, 'Why don't we get married?' He nearly missed the boat.\" She laughs when I mention the incident. Before she met Roy, she'd had several boyfriends but none she wanted to be with \"for more than six months\". But he was different, she says, \"and I thought I wanted to be with him for some time\". She still feels this way, she smiles, more than 50 years later. She was also relieved he didn't hold with stereotypes of beauty: \"I grew up in an era when Marilyn Monroe was the female ideal. But I'm five foot 10 inches [178cm], was always self-conscious, skinny and as flat as a board.\"</p><p>In 1957, after six years away, she returned to Australia on a quick visit to see her parents and introduce Roy. They had left a flat full of furniture and books in London, \"and I would never, ever have come back if I thought we wouldn't be returning to it\". Roy, however, fell in love with Queensland, and she fell in love with raising her children there when they unexpectedly began a family.</p><p>Life changed in another way, as well. Once her first child was born, she stopped painting, her creative energy subsumed by raising her family. Raising her children also delayed her transition from former painter to cultural commissar by the odd decade or so, and it wasn't until her youngest son Tim went to school in 1971 that she started full-time work at Kelvin Grove Teachers College in Brisbane as an art teacher. She also became art critic for The Australian in 1972 until, \"in 1976, I took a year of study leave and went to the Courtauld Institute in London\". As you do, when you are a 45-year-old art teacher and mother of four. \"And when I came back to Australia with my masters [degree], I'd suddenly became very desirable and was being head-hunted for all sorts of things.\" Simple, really. Except, of course, it wasn't.</p><p>The Courtauld, Britain's leading institution for teaching and research in the history of art and conservation, has notoriously searching admission criteria, and the course was handled \"only with difficulty\". It was, she says, \"the hardest year I've ever put in because it was actually a two-year course. Roy looked after the kids, they were all in Dover in Kent, and I was living in college, working up to 13 hours every day. Each week I had to present a 5000-word paper, often on very arcane subjects. It would take all week to research and I would start writing on Thursday evening for the Friday delivery, often working through the night. I developed the most incredible RSI, I used to have to pack the tendons on my wrist and then bind them as tight as possible with bandages.\" Then came a major thesis and three written exams \"that frightened the life out of me because I hadn't done an exam since I left school 28 years before. Adrenalin carried\u00a0 me through.\"</p><p>Her motivation for undertaking the course had been a midlife crisis of conscience. She believes only painters can teach painting convincingly and when she started at Kelvin Grove, she felt \"a fraud because I wasn't actually making art myself\". So she moved into teaching the history and theory of art, and then realised she didn't have qualifications for that either. \"So I took that plunge, and as I'd done when I was 20, I thought I should go to the best place I could and test myself against the most rigorous standards. And in art history, that's the Courtauld.\"</p><p>The rest is, as they say, history, her rise and rise culminating in her 1990 appointment replacing the legendary and long-serving James Mollison at the then Australian National Gallery. Her appointment was contentious because she was, to the greater public, \"Betty who?\"</p><p>And the controversy level was ratcheted up soon after when she changed the institution's name. She had inherited an organisation that was under financial and political duress, in a building with a perennially leaking roof, with a staff appointed and trained by her predecessor that largely resented her new-broom approach. It took all her skill at facilitating and negotiating to turn the entrenched cultures around. But she did, first by making across-the-board cuts to running and staff costs, then by focusing the\u00a0 gallery's objectives, making it both more visible\u00a0 in the community and more welcoming to locals\u00a0 and tourists.</p><p>One of her leading in-house critics initially had been the then senior curator of international art Michael Lloyd, who by the time she retired had become her strongest supporter. She in turn supported him when, as deputy director, he applied in 1995 to replace her, and was selected unanimously. Then came what she calls \"a terrible mess-up\" and \"the most upsetting period of my life. Another member of staff thought he should be director and could not understand why I was promoting Michael -- it was a power play and the press became involved. The mud-slinging was horrific, all this scuttlebutt stuff which had no basis, and Michael's position became untenable.\"</p><p>She had intended to retire in January 1996 when she turned 65 but after the then minister for the arts, Michael Lee, failed to appoint Lloyd, she was asked to return as director for another year. She agreed, her plan being \"to go back, let the dirty work become a thing of the past, let Michael apply again and get it fair and square, which he would have done, he was such a talented man. But we didn't know he had this incipient cancer that had spread to his brain \u2026 and I believe the trauma caused by the furore over his appointment accelerated his decline. Everything happened so quickly, it was like a forest fire spreading and he died in May 1996, just four months after being diagnosed. I never got the chance to explain to him what I was doing. He was a marvellous man tragically lost.\"</p><p>That battle over her successor was one of the few she lost, and she remains, she says, \"saddened and disappointed by the whole situation\". Now she has her own cancer battle to fight after she was diagnosed with a melanoma on the optic nerve. Laser treatment of it has been ineffective but \"we're optimistic that radiation will work\". She is effectively blind in one eye, \"which is a bitter irony for someone who has lived by looking at art, and it presents some challenges with walking and balance\".</p><p>Overall, though, she is philosophic. \"Once I'd got over the shock of finding I had it, I became much more relaxed about things.

But that didn't hold them back: an unforgettable fire was ignited. On the eve of their Australian tour, <person><nameText>Bono, The Edge,</nameText></person> Adam Clayton and Larry Mullen Jr tell how the music started.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: Sometimes it comes across as if I got into U2 to save the world. I got into U2 to save myself. I meet people out on the street who approach me like I'm Mahatma Gandhi. And when someone says, \"Hail, man of peace\", I can hear Larry laughing under his breath: \"You're lucky he didn't nut you.\" The band are very bemused by my attraction to non-violence, because they know you couldn't get further from the songs than the singer. They understand the reason I have been so attracted to these characters, the subjects of my songs - because in life and temperament I am so far from them. There is a rage in me, and it is not all injustice. I have developed good manners to disguise it.</p><p>Your nature is a very hard thing to change; it takes time. One of the extraordinary transferences that -happens in your spiritual life is not that your character flaws go away, but that they start to work for you. A negative becomes a positive. You've got a big mouth; you end up a singer. You're insecure; you end up a -performer who needs applause. I have heard of people set free from addiction after a single prayer. But it was not like that for me. For all that \"I was lost, I am found\", it is probably more accurate to say, \"I was really lost, I am a little less so at the moment.\" And then a little less and a little less again. That to me is the spiritual life. The slow reworking and rebooting of a computer at regular intervals. It has slowly rebuilt me in a better image. It has taken years, though, and it is not over yet.</p><p/><p>The Edge: It seems impossible now to contemplate an existence outside of music, but I honestly don't know if I would have become a professional musician if U2 hadn't made me believe it was possible. We have been together all our adult lives, which demonstrates an incredible level of commitment and solidarity between four people who decided to form a band in 1975.</p><p>The chemistry of the personalities is a big factor. <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>is chairman and founding member of Over-Achievers Anonymous. He has an irrepressible drive to be great. He wants to achieve it all, which actually makes him very vulnerable. I am driven in different ways. I might have to take the 12 steps at Workaholics Anonymous. I have a curiosity that compels me to find ways to make music that are fresh and new. Adam and Larry are the counterparts to <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>and myself. Adam has incredible soul, the unlikely conscience of the band. Larry is the nuts and bolts, a practical, solid and deeply cautious person who is always going to rein us in when we get too excited. We grew up together, we learnt how to play music together. In many respects the way we think is almost telepathic.</p><p/><p>Adam Clayton: I always wanted to be a rock star. When I got my first bass guitar at the age of 15, that was it for me. I didn't have a whole lot else going on in my life. If U2 hadn't worked out, God knows where I would have ended up.</p><p>I wouldn't describe it as fun recording with U2; it is work. Sessions are not exactly filled with laughter and joviality. Frequently, we're being told how crap we are by <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>- and he includes himself in that assessment. Without a doubt, <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>is the driving force. No matter how you might try to describe him, the words would be inadequate, because there's so much more to him. He has what you might describe as classic Alpha Male -programming. He doesn't see limitations, he only sees possibilities. In some ways, he is the psyche of U2; he represents things that are very much a part of all of us.</p><p>Edge is also very ambitious and driven, but you might not see that unless you know him well because it is slightly obscured by his humanity and kindness. Larry is a very sensitive guy and a loyal friend. He thinks about the world the same way he thinks about drumming: something is either in time or out of time. I can't say what I bring to U2. It is not necessarily my bass playing. But something takes place when the band gets together. It is unquantifiable but it has always been the thing that excites me the most. It's the thing that we built U2 on.</p><p/><p>Larry Mullen Jr: You might say I chose the wrong career, and you may be right. Playing drums and being creative in the studio are my drugs of choice. When I started out doing this, any idea of becoming rock stars was laughable.</p><p>You could say U2 are a democracy. The decision-making process is the same now as when we started. Those with the ability to debate, argue and articulate their views win the day. If you are in a band with someone as talkative, argumentative and persuasive as <person><nameText>Bono, </nameText></person>well, things can be kind of difficult for the rest of us. We are four very, very different people with diverse personalities. If there is something special about U2 it has nothing to do with us as individuals. When we play music together, something happens.</p><p/><p>PATHS COLLIDE</p><p>Adam: I was born in 1960 into a house full of women and full of music: two forces that have pretty much -dictated the shape of my life. My dad was an RAF pilot. When I was four years old, dad found work in Kenya flying for East African Airways. By 1965, it was getting quite dangerous to be a white person there. My dad had job offers in Ireland and Hong Kong, but Ireland seemed closer to the family, so we came here, settling in Malahide, a suburban coastal town about eight miles from Dublin. I went to the local National school and it was there that I met David Evans, The Edge, for the first time, although I have no real memory of it. We didn't really bond until we came to know each other again in the band. At the age of eight, I was sent to a boarding school over on the other side of Dublin Bay. I moved school again when I was 13, [and] early on fell in with a boy called John Leslie, who could play guitar. John persuaded me that we could start our own group. He wanted to play electric guitar, so he said I should play bass. So there I was, 15 years old, with a dark-brown Ibanez-copy bass guitar and no amp. I had no idea what I was supposed to do with it. It just sounded good to me. Deep and fat and satisfying.</p><p>My grades were so bad the following year that my parents said they were not prepared to keep me at this expensive school. I thought that was it, the musical career was over. And so I was dispatched to Mount Temple, a comprehensive school in north Dublin.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: You don't become a rock star unless you've got something missing somewhere - that is obvious to me. If you were of sound mind or a more complete person, you could feel normal without 70,000 people a night screaming their love for you.</p><p>I was a freckle-faced kid who was difficult to tie down from the very beginning - a messer full of life and -mischief, noisy, maybe a little too much testosterone. I should admit to my first family nickname: the Antichrist. It wasn't completely wide of the mark. I haven't met many other kids who were nicknamed the Antichrist!</p><p>My father was a very strict man, but his severity was wasted on me. He was an autodidact and a very bright fellah. He taught himself Shakespeare and listened to opera all the time. I never thought of singing as a career, but I remember singing hymns and it stirring up this really strong feeling of being moved by the music. When it was time for me to go to secondary school, my mother took me down to be interviewed by the headmaster of St Patrick's grammar school. It was linked to St Patrick's cathedral and it was well known for its boys' choir. I spent a year there, not being happy, and basically they asked me to leave. I was caught throwing dog shit at the Spanish teacher. I did not have a high opinion of her, and I suspect the feeling was mutual.</p><p>So I left St Patrick's and went to Mount Temple. The moment I arrived I felt alive. It was very progressive, co-educational and non-denominational. There were only two such free schools in the country. It was an amazing place, and we all felt privileged to go there. I remember waking up [one morning] and my mother wasn't around. I was told, \"Something has happened with your grandfather.\" The next time I saw her was at the graveside, watching her father being buried. And then she collapses. She had suffered a brain haemo-rrhage. She stayed alive for about four days, I think. Some powerful things happened in those few days, very powerful things. I read the Bible and I prayed to God not to let my mother die. Then there were just three men living on their own in a house. It ceased being a home. It was just a house, with three men -killing each other slowly, not knowing what to do with our sense of loss and just taking it out on each other.</p><p>Questions filled my teenage head. My mother's death just threw petrol on the fire. The big questions built to a crescendo. I felt hopeless. I thought about suicide. I was sent to a psychologist who lived round the corner, and she was very cool. She listened to me. And after a few weeks she said, \"I really don't think you need to come back here. You're fine. You just had some kind of trauma.\"</p><p>It was 1976, and two things happened in the same few weeks and they both saved my life. The first thing is that I had a vision of my future. I remember I'd seen this girl when she first came to the school, very early on, and thought she looked Spanish, a rose for sure, dark with blood-red lips. She looked like she was in a pool of water, walking through it. There was something so still about her, and to a person who is not still, it was the most attractive thing in the world. And that was Ali, who within a few weeks would become my girlfriend, and within a few years my wife. And then another amazing thing happened: I joined a band. Nothing much has changed since then. I'm still with Ali, and I'm still with the band.</p><p>Edge: I was in St Andrew's for a very brief period with Adam. Then he was shifted out to a posh prep school. So he disappeared off the radar when I was about seven and we didn't meet again until he appeared in Mount Temple.</p><p>My best friend Shane started at Mount Temple, and he told me about this wild kid in his class called Paul Hewson. There was some story involving a small fire, and some rivet-gun caps. So I heard about <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>a couple of years before I even met him. You could say his reputation preceded him. I'd been playing guitar for a while, and I saw <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>on one of the lunchtime breaks, sitting down with a guitar trying to impress some girls. We didn't hit it off particularly, but I couldn't help but observe that I was a better player and yet he was more popular. I made a mental note that perhaps the way you carried your guitar was as important as how well you could play it.</p><p>Before the new school year, during the summer of 1976, my mother said, \"You remember Adam Clayton? He is going to your school this year.\" So I was actually looking out for Adam, but it was literally about halfway through the term that I realised this weird hippie kid who was sporting a very brave Afro hairdo (which made him look like an albino Bootsy Collins) and an Afghan coat was, in fact, the kid I had known when I was seven. Larry, I had seen around. Then one day my music teacher, Albert Bradshaw, told me that Larry Mullen played drums and wanted to form a band.</p><p>Larry: It was my father who suggested I put a notice up on the school board for fellow musicians. We didn't always see eye-to-eye, but through it all he was still watching my back. He was figuring, \"Okay, the kid wants to play drums, how do I help him survive and navigate this because he's never going to be a brain surgeon.\" So I put the now legendary notice up. I think the wording went something like: \"Drummer seeks musicians to form band.\" I just thought of it as a bit of fun. After the notice went up, people asked if I knew, \"Yer man Paul Hewson, he plays guitar.\" I said I didn't, but it turned out everybody knew who he was, so it didn't take long for me to discover who I was going to have to deal with. I knew of Edge and Adam, so on Saturday, September 25, 1976, this odd group of -people convened in my kitchen in Artane.</p><p/><p>A BAND IS BORN</p><p>Edge: It wasn't a particularly auspicious beginning. There was a lot of talk, a lot of people playing songs they knew very badly trying to impress one another, trying to figure out if we had similar musical tastes. I remember thinking that I liked everybody, which was the most important thing; a sense that actually these are cool people.</p><p>Adam: The strategy was to find a rehearsal room at school. Let everyone know we were in a band.</p><p>Edge: Larry and I could play a bit, but Adam really couldn't play, he kind of pretended. But by virtue of owning a bass there was no doubt he was going to be the bass player. <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>didn't even have a guitar, but he seemed to think he was lead guitarist.</p><p>Larry: It was obvious from the beginning that <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>was going to be the singer, not because of his great voice, but because he didn't have a guitar, an amp or transport. What else was he going to do?</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: I had a few songs I could play. The idea of wanting to sing, I don't remember when that happened.</p><p>Edge: Progress was slow and for a very long time we tried unsuccessfully to play a song, any song, from start to finish. I'm sure it was very comical, but we thought we were very cool.</p><p>Adam: There was going to be a talent show in the school gymnasium at the end of term, and that was where we would make our debut. The gig was really the thing that we worked towards.</p><p>Larry: I think we only had two songs, so that was our set. Peter Frampton's Show Me The Way and, as a joke, Bye, Bye, Baby by the Bay City Rollers.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: We walked on that stage, I was playing guitar, and when I heard that D chord, I just started to -levitate. Forget about what we played, because that's not -important. I was singing; it was emancipation. That was a very special concert.</p><p>Larry: After that, I think we were a band. We had managed to play in public without disgracing ourselves. It was as if my identity changed. I was no longer the blond kid hanging out in the corridor, I was now the kid in the band.</p><p/><p>WHAT'S IN A NAME?</p><p>Larry: We had a name for the band before we really had anything else: \"Feedback.\" Terrible name. Ask Edge about it.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: I liked the name The Hype. But it was the name of a punk group in our heads, and it was clear that wasn't where we were going. U2's appeal was its -ambiguity. It had open-ended interpretations. In my mind's eye, I was thinking more of a U-boat than I was of Gary Powers and the spy plane, and I quite liked that. Strangely, it turns out that the train line in Berlin that took you to Zoo Station was called the U2 line. You see it everywhere you go in Berlin.</p><p>Edge: [The name U2] was the least bad of the bunch. We thought about it for a few days and said, \"Well, it's better than The Hype, why don't we just go for it for the moment?\" So we picked U2.</p><p>Adam: The exact point of becoming U2 was a talent competition sponsored by Harp Lager in Limerick on St Patrick's Day in March 1978. There was prize money of (pound stg.) 500. We had entered as The Hype, and we realised that if we won it, then we would be stuck with The Hype. So we had to change the name before the competition.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: There were bands there that could play in time and with great confidence, all of which we couldn't pull off. But, you know, some bands have everything but it. We had nothing but it.</p><p>Edge: I just remember we hit it.</p><p>Adam: I remember the significance of us becoming U2 that night. It was a feeling of, okay, now we're where we should be, playing our own material, and everything is in place. Next week: Top of the Pops!</p><p/><p>GETTING STARTED</p><p>PAUL McGUINNESS: I went to Trinity College in Dublin to study psychology and philosophy. I lost interest in psychology almost immediately. At the end of my third year, I got a letter saying I wasn't able to sit exams because I hadn't been to any lectures. I had to leave. Bill Graham was a friend of mine at Trinity. We often used to listen to music together, go to nightclubs and dream about the idea of taking an Irish band to the very top. I think Bill -mentioned U2 in March 1978. The way I recall it, they hustled him into going to a rehearsal and played some songs and he said, \"But those are Ramones songs!\" Then I started to get phone calls from Adam. Eventually, after a couple of missed opportunities, he came round to see me with a demo tape. Listening to it -subsequently, it really was pretty rough, but it must have had something, because I agreed to go and see them.</p><p>Larry: Paul made a big impression with his refined accent and well-groomed look. I remember he was very taken with <person><nameText>Bono's</nameText></person> stage presence. And I assume he must have thought the rest of us were okay, because we talked about management.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: Paul had an air of confidence about him. One of his great gifts is he makes something normal by saying it. An idea that seems difficult to envision becomes possible because he's talking about it.</p><p>Adam: We did our first demo at Keystone Studios, which was part of the Limerick competition prize.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: I walked down into the basement of Keystone and I remember the excitement of looking at the equipment. And then Larry Mullen Sr arrives and pulls Larry out of there because he was only 15.</p><p>Larry: I had exams the next day, so we could only record for a few hours, then my dad came through the door and said, \"I've got to take him home. He's at school tomorrow.\" And I was gone.</p><p>Edge: School came to an end. We did a gig in the school car park, our farewell, and then it was time to decide what to do.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: My dad gave me a year. He said, \"Right, you can live at home for one year.\"</p><p>Paul: There was a period at the start of the summer where we circled each other. The band used to come round to my flat and we would have lots of meetings about how to take over the world. It took us a long time to secure a record deal, which I found frustrating and puzzling because I thought U2 were so good, though probably those early tapes weren't very impressive.</p><p/><p>DEAL OR NO DEAL</p><p>Edge: Paul was taking the first demos around with mixed success. I thought he felt we weren't necessarily ready, but <person><nameText>Bono </nameText></person>was adamant that with the second set of demos he wanted to get a deal.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: Paul was not coming up with the van, and I'm just getting a bit tired of this. My old man is pointing out that my year at home is almost up. The heat is on. I can't afford not to get a record deal, so I want to go to London and stir up interest.</p><p>Adam: As we moved from being outside contenders to most-likely-to-succeed, record companies were coming to see us, but it was nerve-racking - there was always a hitch.</p><p>Paul: An A&amp;R [talent] scout called Chas De Whalley at CBS London picked up on it. He came up with some demo money and came over and produced some tracks. I suggested that we release the track as a single in -Ireland only, and in return CBS would have the right to release U2 records in Ireland even if we signed to somebody else. So in September the U23 EP was released as a seven-inch [vinyl single] with a picture bag and a -limited-edition numbered 12-inch [vinyl LP].</p><p>Edge: It was an amazing feeling, to actually have your first record and hear it being played on radio. I was also frustrated - I knew that we could do better.</p><p>Adam: We were at an impasse and conscious that in terms of keeping our momentum in Ireland we had to create another stepping stone in our career. The idea was to do a club tour in England.</p><p>Paul: I borrowed some money, and between us we scrambled together enough to make the trip.</p><p>Adam: We were on two quid each a day. We would pool our money and go to the local bad Italian restaurant - exotic stuff for us.</p><p>Edge: Some of the shows were really good, some a bit of a mess. We did the Moonlight Club, the Hope And Anchor, the Rock Garden, Dingwalls, the Electric Ballroom supporting Talking Heads, and we saw a lot of record companies.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: On that tour they were going to decide whether to sign us or not. This was a make-it or break-it situation.</p><p>Adam: We were coming home for Christmas in a state of shock. London was a huge city, and the venues we had heard of as legendary gigs were really kind of -toilets ... and we weren't able to fill them. It was pretty grim because we really had failed.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: We had one last idea, which was based on the sense that the Irish press has a history of colluding with Irish people who cause a stir in the outside world, and fanning those sparks into a forest fire.</p><p>Adam: We did a tour of wherever we could play in Ireland that was a big gig. The culmination of that tour was the National Stadium. It held 2500 people, and it was where the biggest foreign bands would play. Booking ourselves in there was considered pretty cheeky.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: And at that concert arrives an A&amp;R man from Island Records who answers to the name The Captain, Nick Stewart. This is our homecoming gig and all our families are there.</p><p>Larry: Nick Stewart came backstage after the show and offered us a record deal. It couldn't have happened at a better moment. Later, hanging on in London, -waiting for the deal, we all went to a gig one night at the Lyceum.

That, and a fat arse, can close this operation down. I need this band. The truth is I need them more than they need me. That is the way I am wired. They raise my game.</p><p>Edge: I think we've been able to keep it together because we've all grown up with each other. We know how it works. I think we all know, deep down, this is the forum in which we really excel. The day that U2 ends will be a sad day for all of us.</p><p>Paul: It's very odd for the same five men to have been working together for nearly 30 years. It's been very difficult sometimes, but I'm also proud of what we've achieved in business. We always agreed that it would be pathetic to be good at the music and bad at the business.</p><p>Adam: I don't think I was destined for any kind of greatness in my life before U2. The best decision I ever made was to be part of U2, and I guess I haven't needed to make another serious decision since then. I am eternally grateful that this band came along when it did.</p><p><person><nameText>Bono</nameText></person>: I feel much more of a whole person now than I ever did. I seem to have resolved a lot of feelings for my father. That feels great. The -reason why Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own is not a miserable song is because it breaks open with the line \"You're the reason I sing, you're the reason the opera is in me\". He is the reason I have this life, or at least a very large part of the reason. So I certainly have got to a place of peace with him. I thank God on a daily basis for my life in U2, because not only did this job put my talents to use, it put my insecurities and weaknesses to use. That's the miracle for me. U2's definition of art is breaking open the breastbone, open-heart surgery. I wish there was an easier way but, in the end, people want blood, and I'm one of them.</p><p>Larry: I gave these guys their first job when I put the note on the school noticeboard. After 30 years, it's a cool thing to still be making music with your friends. There is a lot of laughter in U2. Sadly, that rarely comes across. We are like a dysfunctional family, with all the laughter and tears that go with that. Personalities will not break up U2. Musical differences will not break up U2. We'll break up because somebody squeezed the toothpaste from the wrong end. J</p><p>Extract from U2 By U2, to be published by HarperCollins on Friday, October 13; $75. (c) U2 2006.

For decades it was Taiwan's most notorious place of incarceration for political prisoners. Built during the so-called White Terror of the early 1950s, it held thousands of political prisoners at one time. There were 14,000 there in the mid-1950s, according to official figures.1 Thereafter, numbers declined, but the prison was not closed until after the end of martial law, in 1987. In that era, officially, 29,407 people were imprisoned for political reasons. Unofficially, Guomindang figures have put the total at up to 70,000. According to none other than Wang Sheng, a leading figure in the Guomindang repressive apparatus for many years, the number executed was about 15 per cent of the total, or between 4,500 and 10,000 people. The Ministry of Justice says the execution files have long since been burned.2</p><p>In the 1990s, a memorial was built on Green Island, to commemorate those imprisoned and executed in the harsh years before democratisation came to Taiwan. The memorial is simple and austere. Standing at its entrance, one can look out over the vastness of the Pacific Ocean and contrast its immense openness with the deadly confinement to which the memorial bears witness. Just past the entrance, descending into the court of the memorial, there is a long wall. On it are inscribed, in Chinese characters, the names of 750 prisoners whose records have been checked. Against the names of those executed there is a small mark. They are many.</p><p>Far from Green Island, in the heart of Taipei, there is another memorial to the victims of Guomindang repression: the 2/28 Peace Park and Museum. Here is commemorated the fearful bloodletting that occurred between February 28 and late March 1947, when the citizens of Taiwan rose up against misrule by mainlanders and were crushed in a brutal military operation by Chiang Kaishek's armed forces. For decades the history of these events was politically suppressed by the Guomindang, but the Taiwanese did not forget and the museum now records the general outline of what happened at that time.</p><p>For many mainlanders it is deeply upsetting to confront this history and there are some who still insist that it is not history, but Taiwanese nationalist propaganda. They are mistaken. There were many witnesses to the events at the time, not least among them the American diplomat, George Kerr, who set down accounts of what they saw.3 Taiwanese exiles kept the matter alive, claiming that 20,000 people had been massacred. In 1991, two Chinese and one American scholar published a detailed examination of the matter, in which they estimated that the number of deaths, almost all Taiwanese, at between 8,000 and 10,000.4 That was a conservative estimate. In 1995, the Guomindang itself apologised for the terrible excesses of 1947 and admitted that the number of Taiwanese killed in 1947 was between 18,000 and 28,000.5</p><p>These are numbing statistics. An equivalent level of bloodshed in Australia today would mean some 75,000 or more people being executed in a matter of weeks. Small wonder that even the pro-Guomindang Ramon Myers and his colleagues, in 1991, described the 1947 massacres as being followed by a \"glooming peace\" which \"covered Taiwan like a blanket of ashes laid down by a forest fire\".6 The Green Island memorial and the 2/28 Memorial Museum, however, make the dead more than statistics. They also rub away some of the numbness, by physically signifying that the truth has come out, that the cause has been vindicated and that repression as a means for resolving political differences has been repudiated. The \"glooming peace\" has been supplanted by a vigorous green growth without further violent upheaval and the heirs of those executed in 1947 have taken office as the legitimate government of Taiwan.</p><p>This is a human rights story which should be much more widely known and understood than it is. It is a paradigm case of democratisation, which merits emulation in a world still grievously beset by ruthless political violence. It is a shining example, within the Chinese world, of what is possible when traditional authoritarianism and ideological bloody-mindedness are replaced by magnanimity, imagination and principle. And it is, finally, a dramatic proof that human rights are not something confected by Western civilisation to interfere in the cultural and political domains of post-colonial states. They are fundamental and universal principles, without which barbarous violence and arbitrary rule will occur and go unchecked.</p><p>When Taiwan was handed back to the Chinese government in 1945, after the defeat of Japan in World War II, it was in excellent condition. The Japanese had been savage conquerors in China and elsewhere in Asia between 1937 and 1945, but in Taiwan, which they had taken from the Chinese empire in 1895, they had been immensely constructive colonial masters, developing rail and port infrastructure, industry and agriculture, education and public administration. Thousands of Taiwanese received good educations in Japan and played dignified roles in the life of the island under Japanese rule. In consequence, they found the contrast with Guomindang rule after 1945 a shock. This was especially so as they had hoped that the political philosophy of the Guomindang Sun Yat-sen's Three Principles of the People would entail sound and democratic government.</p><p>By 1946, educated Taiwanese had invented a wry pun to characterise Guomindang rule. The San Min Chu-I (Three Principles of the People), they quipped, had turned into Ts'an-min Chu-I (Cruel Personism).7 Nothing the Japanese had ever done in Taiwan prepared the Taiwanese for what happened, however, when they rebelled against their mainland rulers. The civil war between the Guomindang and the communists had just entered its final phase in February 1947 and the Guomindang acted ruthlessly to root out opposition on their southern flank in Taiwan. Thousands of regular troops were put ashore at Keelung and Kaohsiung. They fired indiscriminately, then proceeded to round up and slaughter hundreds of civic leaders and thousands of ordinary citizens.</p><p>Not least among the victims were countless idealistic young students. Kerr wrote, \"We saw students tied together, being driven to the execution grounds, usually along the river banks and ditches about Taipei, or at the waterfront in Keelung. One foreigner counted more than thirty young bodies in student uniforms lying along the roadside east of Taipei; they had had their noses and ears slit or hacked off and many had been castrated. Two students were beheaded near my front gate. Bodies lay unclaimed on the roadside embankment near the Mission compound ... For days the dead continued to be washed up in Keelung Harbor ... The atrocities perpetrated at Kaohsiung were (if possible) even more revolting than the mass executions and torture used at Taipei\". 8</p><p>The White Terror did not involve massacres on this scale. It lasted longer, but was more discriminating in its suppression of opposition to the Guomindang.9 It began in 1949, as Chiang Kaishek's Guomindang fled from defeat on the mainland and sought to both consolidate their hold on the island against the Taiwanese and to root out real or suspected Communist infiltrators in their chaotic ranks. It was in these years that the Green Island prisons were built and filled. It was a process wretchedly similar in character to what was happening on the mainland at the same time, as Mao Zedong's Communists purged the country of counter-revolutionaries, warlords, Guomindang officers and officials and feudal reactionaries. It can have been no consolation to the Taiwanese to have known, if indeed they did, that things were even worse on the mainland. And this remained the case throughout the 1950s and 1960s, while Chiang Kaishek was alive.</p><p>Of the thousands of cases of repression from that era, those of Lei Chen, Su Ting-chi and Peng Ming-min are almost paradigm cases of political persecution. Lei Chen was a leading liberal journalist who was arrested in 1961, along with three colleagues, for advocating clean and fair elections. He was sentenced to 10 years in prison for this heinous offence. When a young student, Su Ting-chi, organised a petition for clemency on his behalf, he was arrested, tortured, tried for sedition and executed, in May 1962. His wife was sentenced to life imprisonment for refusing to denounce him. Peng Ming-min, a brilliant young, Japanese-educated political scientist at National Taiwan University, was arrested in 1964 for appealing to all the people of Taiwan, both Taiwanese and mainlanders, to work together to establish a democratic state.10</p><p>He and two of his students were sentenced to prison terms of from eight to 10 years.</p><p>These case histories provide a sense of perspective. They invite searching comparisons with the persecution of democratic dissidents in China right up to the present. The dissent of Lei Chen and Peng Ming-min in the early 1960s directly anticipated the dissent of Liu Binyan, Fang Lizhi, Wei Jingsheng and many, many others in China one or two decades later.11 Lei, Su and Peng were not firebrands but individuals who</p><p>sought to make the Guomindang fulfil its charter to bring democracy, not dictatorship, to the Chinese world. It was in exactly this spirit that Wei Jingsheng, imprisoned by Deng Xiaoping for declaring that without democracy there is no modernisation, challenged the</p><p>Communist Party throughout the 1980s and 1990s.12</p><p>The core problem faced by all of these individuals, whether under the Guomindang or the communists, was the repressive nature of Chinese political culture, its inveterate lack of recognition of the dignity of the individual and the rights of the citizen. Bo Yang, a mainlander who fled communism in the 1940s and was jailed by the Guomindang on Taiwan in 1967 for \"defaming the leadership\", is now the director of the Human Rights Education Foundation in Taipei. In 1984, after his release from Green Island, he gave a speech at Iowa University which was later published under the title The Ugly Chinaman. His reflections in that speech still cannot be published openly in China, but have been through numerous reprints in democratic Taiwan.</p><p>\"During my incarceration,\" he reflected, \"I spent a lot of time contemplating my fate. What crimes had I committed? What laws had I broken? I continued pondering these questions after I was released and began to wonder whether mine was an abnormal or special case.\" Mainlanders he met in America, who had escaped Communist China, told him: \"Someone like you would never have made it as far as the Red Guards or the Cultural Revolution. You'd have been lucky to survive the Anti-Rightist Movement.\" Given the antiquity and richness of Chinese civilisation, Bo Yang found this a dismal reality at the end of the 20th century. \"Why,\" he asked, \"must a Chinese person with the courage to speak an iota of truth suffer this sort of fate? I've asked a number of people from the mainland why they ended up in prison. The answer was invariably, `I spoke the truth.' ... But why does speaking the truth lead to such unfortunate consequences? My answer is that this is not a problem of any particular individual but rather of Chinese culture as a whole.\"13</p><p>We now know better. We know that the lack of human rights has a long history in China, but that it is neither peculiar to Chinese culture, nor ineradicable within Chinese culture. We also know that the change from abuse of human rights to systematic respect for them can be brought about constitutionally and peacefully from within a Chinese polity. We know that individual Chinese citizens, free of prompting by any external power and proceeding only on the basis of reason and experience and the few good examples on offer around the world, can both aspire to such rights and bring them into being.</p><p>We know this because it has happened on Taiwan. The big breakthrough has yet to come in mainland China, but the time has passed when any sort of cultural fatalism or ideological rationalisation can serve to excuse the abuses still practised by the Chinese Communist Party. The Guomindang, which it defeated in the violence stakes long ago, has shown it a clean pair of heels in the democratisation stakes since the death of Chiang Kaishek.</p><p>The breakthrough on Taiwan is, therefore, of world historical significance. No single aspect of it, however, is quite so remarkable as the fact that it was initiated by none other than Chiang Ching-kuo, the son of the old dictator and for many years one of the chief guardians of his dictatorship. In his pathbreaking biography of the younger Chiang, Jay Taylor has done an immense service to the cause of historical transformation in Chinese political culture. In it, Taylor tells a story that few people can have known through all the years when Chiang Ching-kuo ruled the Republic of China on Taiwan, whether as his father's regent between 1955 and 1975 or in his own right until his death in January 1988. It is a story of deep political learning under the most testing circumstances. It should be required reading in every Chinese home and for anyone trying to think through the modernisation and democratisation of Chinese political culture.</p><p>Chiang Ching-kuo was a contemporary of Deng Xiaoping and if Plutarch himself were to write a modern, global Parallel Lives, as he did of Greek and Roman statesmen long ago, then Taylor has shown that he would have to parallel these two lives. The two were classmates in Moscow in 1926, learning to be good communists. Chiang's girlfriend in Moscow was the daughter of the warlord Feng Yu-hsiang, for whom Deng went to work on his return to China. Deng organised the Anti-Rightist campaign for Mao Zedong in the 1950s, while Chiang Ching-kuo organised the White Terror and the Green Island \"New Life Institute\" for his father at the same time. Both saw the need for reform in the early 1970s, but could do little at that time.14 Deng imprisoned Wei Jingsheng in 1979-80, even as Chiang imprisoned Shih Ming-te and Annette Lu.15 But then the astounding break came: Deng recoiled from democratic liberalisation in the 1980s, while Chiang embraced it. Deng turned against his enlightened liberal heirs apparent, Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang, while Chiang ushered his, Lee Tenghui, into office.16 And so, as the new century opened, peaceful democratisation took place in Taiwan, with the Guomindang conceding ground in successive clean elections, while in China the breakthrough has not come and the Communist Party clings to power.</p><p>It was the confident view of leading Guomindang liberal Shaw Yu-ming, in 1985, that China could and would reform itself. It was the conviction of the recalcitrant Iron Blood Patriots, hardline Guomindang rightists, at the same time, that Chiang Ching-kuo had gone soft on the democratic opposition. He should, they asserted bitterly, have done what his father would have done thrown the democratic oppositionists \"into the sea\". Chiang Ching-kuo, raised as a Leninist, tempered as a Stalinist, seasoned as an anti-Communist secret police chief, chose instead, at the end of a long political life, to throw Leninism into the sea. And when his old classmate, Deng Xiaoping, wrote to him in the last decade of his life, urging that they work together to reunify China, he replied that, while China remained as it was, this would mean \"pouring spoiled wine into old bottles\". The Chinese people, he declared to Deng's messengers,17 were sick of communism. They aspired, in its place, to freedom, democracy and prosperity. He could not give these things to China, but he did give them to Taiwan and, in doing so, he set a wonderful example to his old classmate. But Deng could not find it in himself or his party, in his last years, to follow that example.</p><p>In 1988, a six-part TV miniseries was screened in China, to great popular acclaim. It was called River Elegy. In it, the argument was advanced that Chinese political culture faced a profound choice. It could cling to all the imperial traditions symbolised by the Yellow River, which was drying up, and the Great Wall, which was an old ruin representing unsuccessful defensiveness against the outside world. Or it could look to the deep blue sea, from which the democracy and science and industry of the modern world had come and embrace an open future instead of a xenophobic past. The Communist Party reacted badly to the program and it was suppressed even before the disastrous events of June 1989. Like Bo Yang, however, the makers of that TV series were speaking the truth. It is a truth whose time has come and which might best be expressed in a new TV miniseries called Island Elegy.</p><p>Island Elegy would take up where River Elegy left off. It might begin with the statement by Yao Chia-wen, then chairman of the Democratic Progressive Party, in 1988: Taiwan is not part of China, but an island which stands at the intersection of the world's greatest continent and the world's greatest ocean. At that intersection, Taiwan now embodies the challenge to China and everything regressive in its political culture that Bo Yang identified in his Iowa speech. A precise measure of whether China can rise to that challenge will be the manner in which it chooses to deal with the island in the next decade or two. Will it, like the Guomindang in the 1940s and 1950s, seek to impose its will by force and censorship? Or will it, like Chiang in the 1980s, give up Ts'an-min Chu-I for San Min Chu-I, eschew threats and recognise the rights, dignity and freedom of the opposition? Gazing out from the Green Island memorial at the deep blue of the Pacific Ocean, one can see that the better of these choices is possible for the Communist leadership, as it was for the Guomindang leadership. The greatest task in the Chinese world in the years ahead is to draw them in that direction.</p><p>NOTES</p><p>1 Jay Taylor, The Generalissimo's Son: Chiang Ching-kuo and the Revolutions in China and Taiwan, Harvard University Press, 2000, p212.</p><p>2 Ibid, p479n27.</p><p>3 George H Kerr, Formosa Betrayed, Eyre and Spottiswoode, London, 1966, especially chapter XIV `The March Massacre'.</p><p>4 Lai Tse-han, Ramon H Myers, Wei Wou, A Tragic Beginning: The Taiwan Uprising of 28 February 1947, Stanford University Press, 1991, pp164-66.</p><p>5 Jay Taylor, op cit, p148.</p><p>6 Lai, Myers, Wei, op cit, p193.</p><p>7 Murray Rubinstein (ed), Taiwan: A New History, ME Sharpe, New York, 1999, p291.</p><p>8 Kerr, op cit, pp300-303.</p><p>9 Ho Ching-t'ai, White Archives, Taipei, 1991.

This is woefully bad television at its very, very best.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>It follows the tears, the heartache and the bad hair days that occur when the women are dropped (literally, by parachute) into the West Australian outback to vie for the attention of Outback Jack, who is a cross between Steve Irwin and the Anzac spirit.</p><p>The madness starts very early on, right from the moment when the women fly in from the States and are greeted at the airport by host J.D. Roberto with the words, \"Welcome to Sydney, Australia\" as he stands in front of one of Mascot's famous \"canefields\".</p><p>However, as it turns out that Mr Outback Jack does seem like a nice guy and once the real characters come out from behind the pampered caricatures, the series becomes genuinely engaging.</p><p>Surfing the Menu</p><p>ABC, 8pm</p><p>The first series of this show, which screened here last summer, has been the ABC's most successful export apart from Kath &amp; Kim.</p><p>The international appeal is probably uncomfortably close to the appeal overseas of Outback Jack - gorgeously-shot landscapes and a good dose of knockabout Aussie blokey-ness.</p><p>Here presenters Curtis Stone and Ben O'Donoghue do seem to try just a bit too hard to be \"Aussie\" as opposed to just being themselves. But like last series, you'll find yourself forgiving them all their surfer-dude antics when they start cooking.</p><p>Tonight, in the first episode of a new series, the boys travel around the Cairns highlands and cook up all sorts of delights with the local produce including a freshwater crayfish risotto that looks not just scrumptious but actually doable at home.</p><p>The Medici</p><p>SBS, 8.30pm</p><p>The second episode of an eye-opening, four-part look at the role of the Medici family in the Renaissance in Florence follows the extraordinary life of Lorenzo, dubbed The Magnificent.</p><p>In between breathtakingly courageous acts of diplomacy which saved the independence of his family's beloved city, Lorenzo was a passionate scholar of humanism and encouraged artists like Botticelli to explore pagan subjects such as the Birth of Venus (pictured above).</p><p>In his spare time he discovered a young Michelangelo and managed to survive a conspiracy to wipe out the Medici by attacking them at Mass on Easter Sunday, in which his beloved brother was stabbed to death under the famous dome of Florence's cathedral.</p><p>Family Plots</p><p>Seven, 11pm</p><p>Like the British series The Office, it's hard to say whether this is comedy, drama or pure tragedy.</p><p>It is certainly a gem, and deserves better treatment from Channel 7.</p><p>Centred around a family-run mortuary in California, its tension and drama come from its painfully-real depiction of family relationships.</p><p>It's hard to think of another series that has ever done life's casual cruelties and the things that are left unsaid more acutely.</p><p>THURSDAY DECEMBER 16</p><p>KATE MINOGUE</p><p>Savin' their bacon</p><p>The Legend of the Tamworth Two</p><p>ABC, 8.30pm</p><p>At the outset you should know this is not about a pair of bushrangers from Tamworth in northern NSW. It does sound like that though, doesn't it? No it is actually about a couple of ginger pigs who escape an abattoir in the pretty English countryside.</p><p>Just like in the movie Look Who's Talking, the pigs chatter away to each other in English and you can't help but cheer them on as they continue to avoid capture by the humans.</p><p>The story of Butch and Sundance, as they were known, is actually based on truth.</p><p>The two fugitive pigs grabbed newspaper headlines in the UK while fleeing the police, their owner, the abattoir and a media pack for an entire week in 1998.</p><p>Tonight's tale is fun for the whole family.</p><p>The pigs are running for their lives and they doubt whether anyone cares. Ironically, it's the policeman in charge of the hunt - a vegetarian - who always lets them escape.</p><p>Getting to eavesdrop on the pigs' conversations is a treat. On one occasion when smelling bacon frying in a kitchen nearby, they ask, \"Are we getting sunburnt?\"</p><p>There's also a funny scene when the pair wake up hungover in the tent of some startled campers. By this time a creepy wolf-man has joined the chase and the entire nation is in a frenzy over their freedom.</p><p>Hope and Faith</p><p>Seven, 8pm</p><p>This is one silly show about two ditsy sisters who live together with a husband and some children.</p><p>There's nothing irregular going on though. Faith is just crashing long-term with her sister Hope and her family.</p><p>Tonight Hope's husband Charley (Ted McGinley, pictured with co-star Faith Ford) thinks he is finally getting rid of his annoying sister-in-law.</p><p>The Amazing Race</p><p>Seven, 8.30pm</p><p>This is such an exciting show the hour it's on TV passes in a flash. It is surprising how a series based on racing from one clue to another around the world can be so gripping.</p><p>Of course sometimes the challenges are awesome, like tonight, but really it's the characters who animate the show and compel you to sit glued to the screen.</p><p>There are four couples left in the race. The first task requires one person from each pair to climb more than 21m up a rope ladder to the girders beneath the road on the Auckland Harbour Bridge.</p><p>They have to walk across a beam high above the water to receive their next clue. What a nightmarish exercise.</p><p>Colin completes the job easily so he and Christie believe they're home free.</p><p>The others, understandably, find this task really \"intimidating\". But Colin and Christie have been too cocky.</p><p>By the end Colin is standing in a muddy field yelling \"I hate you\" at Christie.</p><p>You can see their post-show relationship is destined for the dumpster.</p><p>Meanwhile, it has been so satisfying to see \"The Bowling Moms\", Karen and Linda, taking on challenge after challenge and doing themselves proud.</p><p>As they say, \"Moms can do anything\". Bravo.</p><p>Scrubs</p><p>Seven, 11pm</p><p>The doctors and nurses in this hospital show do little that resembles medicine.</p><p>But it is good to see some sorely needed comedy, even if it is so frivolous.</p><p>The highlight is a scene that involves the trickery of modern mobile phones.</p><p>A woman sticks a camera phone under her shirt and takes a picture of her breasts as a way to maintain a longdistance relationship.</p><p>The man receiving the pic is so impressed he bumps smack bang into a telegraph pole.</p><p>It's pretty funny.</p><p>FRIDAY DECEMBER 17</p><p>CAROLINE BELLINGER</p><p>Six and the cities</p><p>Lonely Planet: Six Degrees</p><p>SBS, 7.30pm</p><p>Parisians, it seems, are entirely eccentric.</p><p>How else do you explain characters like Gaspard Delanoe, a shabby, junk bike-riding artiste who leads one of the city's most audacious squats? He \"liberates\" real estate by breaking into disused buildings and using them as makeshift studios until the police evict him.</p><p>Then there's Jacques Remus, a sound sculptor who makes music from washing machines and other industrial curiosities.</p><p>These and several other wonderful personalities feature in tonight's premiere of Lonely Planet's new project, Six Degrees.</p><p>Each week one of two presenters (in tonight's case, Toby Amies) travel to some of the world's most happening cities and immerse themselves in local culture.</p><p>They arrive with just one point of contact who leads them to another and so on. It's a real-life version of the popular game that proves we are more connected than we think.</p><p>Tonight, Amies is guided around Paris by socialite Emmanuel de Brantes who, while wearing an camouflage print cap and a straight face, tells the host he needs to get a sense of chic.</p><p>And apparently, if we are super-friendly and polite and pepper conversation with plenty of \"mercis\", then Parisians will be open to us in return. We can only hope.</p><p>Seinfeld</p><p>Ten, 7pm</p><p>Ah, how much sweeter life is when the'Feld is on TV.</p><p>It's the cream in your coffee, the icing on the cake, the kebab shop still open at 3am on your way home from a big night out on the town.</p><p>Tonight, when a fellow passenger on a flight falls ill, Jerry is left to care for Farfel, the man's dog.</p><p>When the owner finally returns to collect Farfel, he threatens to sue Jerry for \"ruining\" his prized pooch.</p><p>Meanwhile George and Elaine (Julia Louis-Dreyfus) try and spend time together without Jerry and, yada yada yada, they realise they have nothing to talk about.</p><p>French Leave</p><p>ABC, 8pm</p><p>Not quite travel show, almost cooking show, mostly reality show, this little delight takes us into the world of English chef John Burton-Race (pictured), his wife Kim and their six children.</p><p>Fed up with his life as a top chef, John has packed up the tribe and shipped out to rural France where he hopes they will live their dream.</p><p>Unfortunately, John and Kim share differing opinions of what that dream is.</p><p>So while John obsesses over soft cheeses, crusty breads and perfecting various regional French dishes, Kim revels in her love for expensive antique chairs.</p><p>This, as you can imagine, causes endless conflict.</p><p>Tonight, matters are not improved by the arrival of Kim's stubborn mother, Patsy.</p><p>\"I want to kill somebody and I know that's probably illegal,\" John admits in a private moment with the camera.</p><p>Doc Martin</p><p>ABC, 8.30pm</p><p>Why is it that the darndest things always happen in English seaside towns? (Think Julian, Dick, Anne, George, Timmy the dog and their zany Famous Five adventures).</p><p>As such, this telemovie has more than its fair share of oddities.</p><p>Martin Clunes is Dr Martin Bamford, an obstetrician who discovers his wife has been sleeping with three of his friends.</p><p>In a moment of clarity, he escapes to Port Isaac on the coast of Cornwall and winds up working on a lobster boat.</p><p>Here, among the town's tight-knit community, he finds residents who roadtest grave sites, a GP who prescribes dog food and a phantom who delivers jelly to wrongdoers.</p><p>Expect plenty of laughs.</p><p>SATURDAY DECEMBER 18</p><p>SCOTT JENKINS</p><p>Yule be singing too</p><p>CAROLS IN THE DOMAIN</p><p>Seven, 8.30pm</p><p>There are three definite signs on TV that Christmas is upon us: your favourite shows are replaced by repeats; that annoying Chrisco woman keeps urging us to save for next year's Chrissy hamper; and Carols In the Domain.</p><p>The show, now in its 22nd year and sponsored by The Daily Telegraph, has become a last-Saturday-night-before-Christmas tradition and provides a much-cherished evening for all the family.</p><p>A quick perusal of the guest list means we should be in for a good night. The most talented of the Daddo brothers, Andrew, is sure to do another sterling job as host, aided by champion dancer Bec Cartwright.</p><p>Australian Idol contestant Cosima de Vito will sing (All I Want For Christmas Is A Music Career perhaps?) and Dancing With The Stars' favourite judge Todd McKenney will put his money where his mouth is and show us what he's capable of.</p><p>The cast from The Producers are on the bill while Idol No.1 Guy Sebastian, Lee Kernaghan The Wiggles, Rachel Beck and Andrew O'Keefe will also perform.</p><p>Oh, and Santa too.</p><p>You have yourselves a cool Yule, folks.</p><p>THE FUTURE IS WILD</p><p>SBS, 6pm</p><p>Science has shown how animals have evolved over millions of years.</p><p>Now, for the first time, this brilliant show applies the same principles and asks what sort of animals will likely inhabit the earth millions of years from now?</p><p>Using computer technology, we're introduced to fanciful creatures such as shagrats, snowstalkers and gannetwhales. This is the first of 13 parts of what is a totally fascinating series for anyone with a curious mind.</p><p>A wonderful concept and a wonderful show.</p><p>HIMALAYA WITH</p><p>MICHAEL PALIN</p><p>ABC, 7.30pm</p><p>Having already reviewed this wonderful show twice, it's hard for me to come up with more superlatives with which to praise it.</p><p>Suffice to say, this final episode is as entertaining and breathtaking as the rest and it's quite sad the journey has come to an end.</p><p>Tonight's final leg takes Michael Palin (pictured) from the almost mythical Kingdom of Bhutan all the way through to the Bay of Bengal (the home of The Phantom to us).</p><p>Gorgeous photography, witty narration from an amiable presenter and absolutely unique characters.</p><p>What more could you ask from Saturday night viewing?</p><p>Don't miss it.</p><p>HOLIDAY HOMES</p><p>FROM HELL</p><p>Lifestyle Channel (Foxtel/Optus), 10pm</p><p>Have you ever rented or purchased a holiday home?\u00a0 If so you'll already know how much small inconveniences can help to really ruin the experience. The hot water may not work, the roof may leak. Or the police may arrest you for growing opium in your new backyard.</p><p>Despite its sensationalist title, this often-hilarious program offers cautionary tales of what happens when unscrupulous property developers set their sights on innocent Brits who buy an overseas getaway house.</p><p>Some of the cases are actually unbelievable.</p><p>There's Dr Gillis and his wife who fall victim to Italy's drug syndicates.</p><p>Mr and Mrs Eyres settle in for a quiet life on Crete, only to have their home swallowed up by a decades-long land dispute.</p><p>Then there's the James family, who find themselves the victims of a robbery and a forest fire in the same week.</p><p>SUNDAY DECEMBER 19</p><p>CHELSEA HUNTER</p><p>The Carnie folk capers</p><p>Carnivale</p><p>ABC, 8.30pm</p><p>Brothers and sisters, beware, for the end is nigh. At least, that is what Carnivale would have us believe. This US miniseries, which won five Emmys, is a revelation of sorts.</p><p>But with its deliberate pace, it requires your absolute patience and attention.</p><p>It sets up a whole load of questions that will leave you looking quizzically at your couch partner, then take its time answering them. But stick with it, for Carnivale will have people discussing the signs and plot twists at bus stops and dinner tables.</p><p>Carnivale is set in Depression-era America, with a young man, Ben Hawkins (Nick Stahl), burying his mother just moments before the bulldozers knock down his farmhouse and the cops appear on the horizon to take him back to the big house.</p><p>He is saved from his fate by The Carnies\u00a0 led by Samson (Michael J. Anderson) - a ragtag bunch of performers with stout hearts and a link to the hereafter.</p><p>Ben has a talent that makes him every bit as unusual as the bearded lady and blind \"mentalist\" and, much to his discomfort, he fits in with these folk.</p><p>His gift, along with the pseudo-Gothic tones of this show, its references to pestilence, disease and plague and its freaky preacher man will slowly but surely draw you in.</p><p>Sabrina The</p><p>Teenage Witch</p><p>Ten, 6.30pm</p><p>The original Archie comic upon which this show is based had sweet, all-American values and jolly, gentle stories.</p><p>It was perfect to read while sucking on a Wizz Fizz.</p><p>Similarly this show, which has gone back to the first series when Sabrina (Melissa Joan Hart) and Harvey (Nate Richert) are still making goofy eyes at each other, has kept that fun, innocent vibe.</p><p>Tonight we see how the Spellmans celebrate Halloween (it involves clones) and how to fix a dateless Friday night (man dough).</p><p>Amba: The</p><p>Siberian Tiger</p><p>ABC, 7.30pm</p><p>If you have read Yann Martel's The Life Of Pi you will have a special interest in watching this documentary.</p><p>The Siberian tiger, much like Pi's Bengal tiger, is an awe-inspiring creature of true power and beauty.</p><p>They may be pretty kitties (as pictured) but with their massive paws and teeth that could easily skewer a limb, these are certainly not domesticated pets.</p><p>The documentary meanders a little in its attempts to show how endangered the tigers are by interviewing the people who are actively involved in keeping their numbers safe.</p><p>But despite the fascinating subject matter, it feels a little like an educational tool, the kind that would put you to sleep during high-school social studies.</p><p>Give it a few minutes though. You'll be impressed by the animals, if not the show.</p><p>Home On Their Own</p><p>Lifestyle Channel (Foxtel/Optus), 7.30pm</p><p>A father looks dejectedly at the camera. \"My son,\" he sighs, \"won't eat carrots out of a tin. He won't eat chips.\"</p><p>A son who wants a healthy diet - you can feel his pain, can't you?</p><p>While Dr Gillian McKeith would be doing jumping star-jacks for joy, this isn't her program. No, this is the show where kids send their parents away and get to redecorate parts of the house.</p><p>Nathan, 16, and Tobias, 12, have chosen to go a little Japanese in the kitchen, lounge room and their parents' bedroom. But you get the feeling the clean, healthy Zen lifestyle isn't going to go down well with their folks.</p><p>How times have changed.</p><p>MONDAY DECEMBER 20</p><p>MIRANDA HERRON</p><p>The youth is out there</p><p>Nip/Tuck</p><p>Nine, 9.30pm</p><p>Plastic surgeons, in the US at least, are becoming superstars and Nip/Tuck is a drama which luridly imagines what might go on behind the scenes in the lives of these modern gods.</p><p>What the show portrays is certainly not pretty. There's narcissism, self-doubt, greed, emotional paralysis and empty (and frequent) sexual encounters, all jumbled in with the flash cars, gleaming minimal offices and beautiful women.</p><p>Nip/Tuck revolves around the dysfunctional lives of two top Miami surgeons, Sean (Dylan Walsh) and Christian (Julian McMahon), and aims for sensation rather than realism.</p><p>But it goes beyond mere trash by delving into the deeper, darker concepts of ageing, self-esteem, dependency and - if it's not going too far - even the meaning of life.</p><p>In the season return, Sean develops \"the yips\", a tremor in his operating hand caused by turning 40 and contemplating how a plastic surgeon is supposed to age in an ageist society.</p><p>Each episode focuses on a new patient so it doesn't become too bogged down with the main characters' neuroses.</p><p>There is also some stomach-turning surgery, including, in the second of two episodes tonight, Christian attempting to give himself a nose job with a chisel and hammer.</p><p>Summerland</p><p>Ten, 7.30pm</p><p>Ryan Kwanten (pictured) played the ill-fated Vinnie who ended up behind bars on soapie Home &amp; Away In this new Aaron Spelling family drama, he plays likeable Aussie surfer, Jay.</p><p>He is one of three adult friends who move into a rambling beach house to help Ava (Lori Loughlin) when she inherits three children after her sister's death.</p><p>The storylines of the show are not revolutionary but it is saved from being hopelessly soppy and artificial by the adult characters.</p><p>Far from being Brady Bunch cardboard cut-outs, they drink beer in the spa in the evening and have diverse views on parenting which makes it more interesting than the standard nuclear-family drama.</p><p>In this episode Ava finds a joint in teenage Brandin's (Jesse McCartney) bag. She admits she's had a puff in the past and Jay says his parents found his stash and smoked it with him. Collectively they have to grapple with how to approach the issue of drugs without being hypocritical.</p><p>Origins: Where</p><p>Are The Aliens?</p><p>SBS, 7.30pm</p><p>Apparently it took half a billion years for intelligent life to evolve on earth.</p><p>According to some, the conditions on earth which allowed this to occur are so \"wacky weirdo\" they are unlikely to be found anywhere else in the universe.</p><p>Others such as radio astronomer Frank Drake, inventor of the Drake Equation which predicts whether planets are capable of sustaining life, are convinced there is life out there somewhere.</p><p>You don't have to be an astrophysicist to understand this interesting doco which explores the arguments for and against other lifeforms.</p><p>It also explains, quite helpfully, why we and the aliens may be having such difficulty finding each other.</p><p>Family Story: the Company You Keep</p><p>ABC, 8pm</p><p>Mental illness affects many Australians but it's not a high profile or sexy issue.</p><p>The profound effects on a sufferer's family are often overlooked too.</p><p>This simple and short doco chronicles a very small slice of life for the family of Ally, a young woman with a depressive psychosis.</p><p>It's remarkable to see how resilient the family is in the face of such sadness.</p><p>TUESDAY DECEMBER 21</p><p>PENELOPE CROSS</p><p>Rose maketh the man</p><p>Rose And Maloney</p><p>ABC, 8.30pm</p><p>She drinks like a fish, smokes like a chimney and once had a sordid affair with her boss.</p><p>And ironically for Rose (Sarah Lancashire), an investigator for an organisation that looks into possible miscarriages of justice, she has been paired with a colleague whose biggest regret in life was the time he missed an exam.</p><p>But it's the lack of things Rose has in common with nerdy administrative manager Maloney (Phil Davis) that make their on-screen chemistry so humorous.</p><p>Rose has dragged former backroom boy Maloney into an unofficial investigation of the case of David McVay (Tony Maudsley), a man jailed for killing his daughter.</p><p>The fiesty redhead believes the evidence doesn't add up - mainly because there's a distinct lack of it and the shifty-looking cops never found a body.</p><p>Unfortunately however, Rose's tendency to ruffle a few feathers has already gotten Maloney into a car accident, ruined his VW and made his face all splotchy.</p><p>In tonight's episode - the second part of the show's pilot - she even convinces him it's possible to \"look inconspicuous\" while driving her filthy red and blue Range Rover.</p><p>Rose has, of course, lost her licence.</p><p>Yep, she's a bossy boots and he loves the field work, though he's loathe to admit it.</p><p>The O.C.</p><p>Ten, 8.30pm</p><p>It may only be filming its second season but The O.C. has already spawned three soundtracks. Or, as an elite circle of fans refer to them - \"The CDs\".</p><p>But that's not to say all these mixes are worthy of being in Seth Cohen's (Adam Brody) personal emo collection.</p><p>The weakest link is undoubtedly an album of corny cover tracks dubbed Have A Very Merry Chrismukkah.</p><p>Yet the episode from which the complilation stems is actually rather fabulous and screens tonight - The Best Chrismukkah Ever.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Chrismukkah is a family holiday in the Jewish and Christian Cohen household.</p><p>Footballers' Wives</p><p>Ten, 9.30pm</p><p>There are moments in the opening scene of this episode where the cameraman appears to have absent-mindedly filmed the back of someone's head.</p><p>But it is probably a tactic to disguise the fact the actors are fighting back laughter.</p><p>And who could blame Ian (Nathan Constance) and Donna (Katharine Monaghan, pictured above, right) from giggling when Ian walks in on his wife with her lover?</p><p>He is furious but Donna just holds up an old copy of The Sun she happens to have handy where, plastered on the front page, is a picture of Ian having a threesome with two lap dancers.</p><p>Then there was that affair he had with her sister.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tanya (Zoe Lucker, pictured, centre) is livid when Jason (Cristian Solimeno) wants to give his baby godson (who is, of course, secretly his son) money for a good education.</p><p>Why is she mad? Well she could have spent that on a weekend shopping in Milan.</p><p>This show, is just too wonderfully trashy and fun for words.</p><p>The West Wing</p><p>Nine, 10.30pm</p><p>You really have to admire the multi-tasking that takes place on this great show.</p><p>It's so fast paced that the characters are often required to conduct discussions of importance in the corridors of the White House on their way to the toilet.</p><p>OK, well not quite but in tonight's episode, the hallways do seem a rather odd place to debate candidates for the vice presidency.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-DTM0412151T06254033</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEDAILYTELEGRALTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4F19-FGK0-015G-S2T3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3851\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Sydney, Australia) (Sydney, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>December 15, 2004 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS004</classCode><className>WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The landscape is tinder-dry, seared by scorching temperatures and wild northerlies. With conditions like these, in one of the most bushfire-prone places on the planet, an inferno is inevitable. John van Tiggelen reports from the front line.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The morning after Victoria's worst day of fire in three summers, Sandi Murdoch and her menagerie of injured and orphaned bush critters are seeing off a second onslaught. First a bushfire went through her refuge. Now comes the media pack, in search of ground zero. The January 22 fires have wiped out much and are far from done yet, but the so-called Anakie fire, which has already consumed half the Brisbane Ranges National Park, is the most accessible to Melbourne. Also, the commercial news networks are insisting that between 15 and 20 homes around Anakie, an hour west of Melbourne, have been burnt to the ground, with the result that reporters are almost indecently concentrated around the few that actually were.</p><p>Murdoch's brick-veneer box, baking behind charred trees and a flame-blistered Land for Wildlife sign, isn't quite one of them. There are more dramatic scenes both across the road and around the corner, where the carcasses of beautiful homes lie wrapped around their chimneys. But everyone loves a quirky story in a day of drama, and Murdoch's tale, about having rescued her animals by moving them from their pens into her home, dovetails nicely. There's a roo in her bed and a koala draped on the curtain rod. A second bedroom is filled with chickens, a third sleeps orphaned joeys in slings, the bathroom is a-squawk with caged galahs and cockatoos and the lounge room is squirming with bagged koalas and possums.</p><p>Says Murdoch: \"I've got no reason to be upset, have I? I've got my home and the animals are okay.\"</p><p>In the back of her \"animal ambulance\" are three singed fugitives she retrieved from nearby properties that morning. More koalas, one with a \"cooked\" eye. Cameras roll and snap. Then everyone goes off in search of blacker pastures.</p><p>Yet Murdoch's tale is something. Joined only by her brother John, a burly bay fisherman, she faced a fire that had everyone else, neighbours and firefighters included, on the run. Spurred on by 40kmh northerlies, 43-degree heat and humidity in the low teens, the fire, which Murdoch glimpsed as \"a roll of black smoke against a red background\", leapt the road to lay waste to her aviaries and animal enclosures, incinerate her car, melt an aluminum lean-to and whoosh through the tree canopies around the house before snap-frying a koala in an ironbark and destroying two homes further down the ridge.</p><p>Neither Sandi, 59, nor her brother recall feeling fear. \"We were busy,\" she says. \"There wasn't time,\" he says. \"We could only run and put out the flames that were shooting up everywhere, on the bark, the ground. The heat was unbelievable; I had on a flannelette shirt, jeans and a woollen beanie, plus a wet towel on my back that would dry in seconds. Sandi kept hosing me down.</p><p>\"The wind was swirling; it was like there were eddies. The flames were above the shed. Then we saw the fire crowning [igniting the canopy] in the trees and Sandi called me inside. We shut the door, grabbed a wet blanket and pulled it over our heads.</p><p>\"You should have heard the smoke alarms,\" he says. \"She had three! They set off the rooster; it was going off over the top of them. It was driving me crazy but there was no time to do anything about it. After a minute, two tops, I opened the door, saw it was okay and we ran back out to mop up the flames.\"</p><p>No fire crews arrived to help. \"And we didn't expect them,\" Sandi Murdoch says matter-of-factly. \"We've had it drilled into us the past few years that if we're going to live here, we have to plan for fire. That we can't rely on the fire brigade because they can't always come.</p><p>So we had a plan.\"</p><p>\"I told her she had to get rid of the trees around her house,\" says her brother. \"She said, 'No, it's the bush. If I cut the trees I may as well live in town.' So we just stuck to the plan. To be honest, part of me wanted to test it out. To see if it worked.\" He looks at his sister as if conceding a minor point. \"It worked.\"</p><p>\"It did,\" she says.</p><p>\"Just,\" he says.</p><p>A flammable country is going to burn at some point. Come January 22, a Sunday, the Country Fire Authority (CFA) knows what it is in for. The state is tinder-dry. As early as the previous Tuesday, forecasters predicted a forest fire danger index (FFDI) of 86, well over the threshold required for a total fire ban. (Anything over 50 is considered \"extreme\".) Desiccating northerlies would push temperatures into the low 40s ahead of a vicious westerly change. Most worryingly, it's next to inevitable that bush is already burning following overnight electrical storms.</p><p>If the forecast were for a cyclone, it would be a category four - Cyclone Tracy strength. The day dawns ominously hot. Country racing is cancelled at Stony Creek. ABC Radio's cricket coverage is suspended in favour of fire updates. And in Melbourne, all matches at the Australian Open are cancelled save those under cover.</p><p>I spend the day at the CFA's Melbourne headquarters, from where it co-ordinates its army of almost 60,000 volunteers and 2300 red trucks. Expecting an office, I walk into a war room. Desks are arranged, theatre style, around an enormous screen. The screen features a map of Victoria displaying \"enemy\" details - the enemy being the weather - such as wind direction and speed, temperature and humidity levels. On either side of the map are panels listing current \"incidents\", including their size, status and the amount of hardware (trucks and helicopters) deployed.</p><p>\"We know we're having a bad day if those two panels are full by the end of the day,\" the CFA's media co-ordinator, Alex Twomey, tells me. It's 11am and they already are. There are some 90 fires listed, the worst of them running riot in the Grampians, Bessiebelle, Tyrendarra, Edenhope and Mount Misery. (Just as the War on Terror teaches George W. Bush geography, so the War on Fire serves to teach it to Australians.) By noon, media reports are coming in of homes lost near Portland and Moe, at opposite ends of the state.</p><p>By order of the chief that morning, all staff are kitted out in yellow bibs identifying their position. \"This day is shaping as one we'll remember,\" says Russell Rees, whose bib reads \"chief officer\". \"Essentially the fire is not controllable. Our game is about controlling the firefight.\"</p><p>In country Victoria, firefighting falls to two organisations: the CFA, whose brief is to protect private property, and the Department of Sustainability and Environment, which looks after public land - that is, the bush. Although most large fires start in bushland, and are therefore the responsibility of the department, it's the CFA that is left to flex its muscle if the fires run truly wild.</p><p>Rees is a balding, fatherly figure who forever looks as if he's eagerly leaning forwards, even while walking. His posture is possibly born of a lifetime spent peering at maps. Having seen the same slabs of bush burn twice or more since starting as a junior firefighter at 11 in the Latrobe Valley, he has a peerless grasp of Victorian geography.</p><p>\"It's not shitful but it's pretty close,\" he says, looking at the central map. \"People out there will think it is, but what I'm saying is it's not catastrophic. So far\" - he looks at his watch - \"at 1.30, we're doing okay. But it's only 1.30.\"</p><p>One of the key tasks at CFA HQ - one that has been reinforced by the disastrous Canberra fires of 2003 - is to use information to minimise risk. The emphasis is on warning of what might happen, rather than revealing what already has. Often that means it's slower than media reportage - for instance, the day's CFA statements have yet to acknowledge that houses have been lost. Occasionally this also means it's right - no houses have actually been lost as yet; they turned out to be haysheds.</p><p>\"It's the fog of war,\" says Twomey. \"We have these moments when, bang, no one knows what's going on and we just have to sit tight. I equate this business [of getting the information out] with making sausages. You really don't want to see how people do it - I mean, it's mayhem here - but if you look at our website, it's a job well done.\" He calls up the website. Unfortunately, it's attracting so many hits, it's jammed.</p><p>About two o'clock, word comes through that the blaze in the Brisbane Ranges, near Anakie, classed as \"contained\" overnight and patrolled by just 12 trucks according to the screen, is going like the clappers. The regional commander phones to say it's scaring his men and can't be stopped: flying embers are \"spotting\" (creating spot fires) 200 metres ahead of the fire front and tree canopies are crowning 100 metres ahead. Someone produces a map and draws a teardrop, representing the likely fire path. \"That's a dangerous spot,\" says the chief, leaning in. \"If it gets into there\" - he pricks his pen at a spray of little black squares marking homes in the bush - \"that's a lot of people under threat.\"</p><p>More strike-teams (comprising five trucks each) are instantly dispatched. The trick to moving strike-teams around the state is not to compromise the safety of their regions of origin. Says Rees: \"Even now, we've still got 1000 trucks on the ground, dealing with the day-to-day: house fires, car fires, kids with their bloody fingers stuck in plug-holes.\"</p><p>But now the time has come to put in a call for assistance to the South Australian fire chief. \"We're shitful,\" Rees tells him. \"The board's lit up like a Christmas tree. We're not struggling yet, but it will come.\" However, South Australia has few men to spare because it's ablaze as well. So is Tasmania. \"We can't really move stuff around now,\" the chief says. \"Every aircraft is committed. It's a case of everyone dealing with what they've got.\"</p><p>By 3.15pm, despite seven choppers and 46 trucks on hand, there are unconfirmed reports of houses ablaze near Anakie. Elvis, the American air crane which carries up to five times as much water as an average chopper, is called in to help, as is the Metropolitan Fire Brigade.</p><p>The news from elsewhere is similarly grim. It's raining ash on several towns bordering the Grampians. A helicopter has crash-landed in Gippsland. The Tyrendarra fire has jumped Highway One. Around the state, smoke from surrounding fires is hanging over Horsham, Warrnambool, the Latrobe Valley, Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. Says Twomey: \"A journo just rang asking which fire she should go to.</p><p>I said, 'Drive in any direction you want.'\"</p><p>A little after seven, as I'm about to leave, Rees's deputy calls the media team to a snap meeting. His face is grave: \"We've just received news that we've lost 18 houses in De Motts Road, in the Brisbane Ranges. We've sent police out for confirmation and to check no one's in them.\" He pauses. \"It's consistent with what we've been saying. And she's still going. ... We need to slow the information flow. We don't want people to run back in.\"</p><p>Driving to Geelong across the West Gate Bridge, the light is an eerie cellophane yellow. Westerly gusts bounce cans and branches across the freeway. Overhead the sky blackens. The blanket of smoke that had been billowing over Geelong has been flung eastwards, leaving the usually benign You Yangs looking volcanic as smoke spews from the Brisbane Ranges somewhere behind them. On the radio, a CFA spokesman warns that the fire has jumped another control line and that further \"assets may be impacted\" in Staughton Vale, a community strung out along what was the fire's eastern flank, but is now its new front.</p><p>At the northern outskirts of Geelong, some 200 people from the Anakie district have gathered for an emergency meeting. Many are seized with panic by the scale of the pall overhead, and the thought that the ash falling around them might be their possessions.</p><p>On the lee side of a large hall, one of 10 emergency relief centres being set up around the state, people make feverish attempts to contact neighbours who stayed. One woman, her face flushed with heat and suffering, suddenly drops her phone and collapses in the arms of her parents. \"The fire's only 100 metres from the house,\" she says. \"The fruit trees are burning.\"</p><p>Inside, the cavernous brown-brick hall refuses to give up the day's heat. A battery of ceiling fans can only stir the soupy air. Under the harsh fluoro lights, fire-stricken families huddle in both hope and fear of answers, their eyes bloodshot from smoke, fatigue and worry.</p><p>A single mother called Cheryl tells me her kids were over the moon about seeing so many helicopters. A man called Doug rues leaving behind his fishing rods. Another woman, Lynnette, fled her home with her galah, two dogs and her husband's Harley on the trailer. It seems many husbands stayed. \"He wouldn't come,\" says Joyce Giacometti of her elderly husband, Bruce. \"We pleaded with him but he just wouldn't.\"</p><p>Among the tears and cheers, the fire is steadily animated into a mythical beast. It variously \"turned feral\", \"outsmarted firies\" or even \"blew out its own arse\". A CFA veteran, who'd discharged himself from hospital only to return home and be evacuated, declares \"the fire's behaving like nothing I've ever seen\".</p><p>A thin, kind-faced bureaucrat stands up to announce that crews are trying to contain</p><p>the fire at Old Boundary Road, well past Staughton Vale. \"It looks a long way from where the fire was two hours ago and it is,\"</p><p>he says, as several people slump their heads and those holding hands tighten their grip.</p><p>\"At eight o'clock it had burnt out 2600 hectares, now it's 4500. We're not hopeful</p><p>of pulling it up in the next hour.\"</p><p>Next, someone gets up to offer free \"pet and budgie\" board. It's left to the local policeman to face the questions about which homes have been lost. Most people only evacuated when the police told them to. They have seen news footage of houses burning and heard up to 20 homes have been destroyed. But the constable has no answers. With his left hand nervously slapping into his right, he instead urges residents to stay the night with friends and family and await further news in the morning. \"Do not go home,\" he says. \"It's not safe. Remember that to lose your house is preferable to losing your life.\"</p><p>As the meeting winds to a close near midnight, he tells me, \"I know they won't sleep tonight without knowing if they have a home to go back to. But we don't yet know if we'll find any deceased. Some of these homes are tucked right into the bush and we know there are people who stayed. Fact is, if they keep their properties clear, and they have a [bushfire] plan, we and the CFA encourage them to</p><p>stay.\" He fingers his moustache before adding: \"That's the policy. As to whether it's wise ...</p><p>I have to say that from where I stand now, it's a bit of a worry.\"</p><p>Victoria is reputed to be the most fire-prone region in the world, marginally ahead of California, parts of the Mediterranean and the rest of south-eastern Australia. In the 40 years to 2001, the state accounted for more than half of the 224 deaths and $2.5 billion damages caused by bushfires in Australia. Climate change isn't helping. CSIRO modelling released last month shows that the number of days of very high to extreme fire danger will increase by up to 20 per cent across the south-eastern corner in the next two decades. As well as becoming more frequent, the worst days will get worse. By 2050, summers will be peppered with days like January 22. Which of those days will foment catastrophes - such as 1983's Ash Wednesday fires (2000 homes, 75 lives) or the Canberra fires of January 18, 2003 (500 homes, four lives) - is at the whim of lightning, arsonists or simple misfortune.</p><p>But it is inevitable there will be more. A national inquiry into bushfire management</p><p>in the wake of the Canberra fires concluded bushfires would increase in frequency, intensity and size. At best, authorities might hope to minimise the loss of lives and property. The Victorian high-country fires of 2003 are a case in point: born out of 87 lightning-lit fires one freak January day, they raged for two months to ravage 1.2 million hectares, or 5 per cent of the state. The good news was no one died.</p><p>Whether firefighting efforts can be beefed up to keep pace with global warming - read inland drying - is doubtful. Rural decline has put a strain on CFA resources in many of the most fire-prone regions. Also, the recent influx of \"tree-changers\" - city dwellers who have traded their rush hours for a country lifestyle - into rural communities such as Anakie has yet to be reflected in the make-up of local CFA volunteer ranks. It's an open question as to how long ageing farming communities will tolerate being called upon to save - for free - the designer homes and weekenders budding among the forested hills.</p><p>The morning after the battle for Anakie, red trucks bearing the names of other one-horse hamlets are parked 10 in a line from the town's general store, which squats opposite the fire station. Yellow-clad firies mill about jacketless, snacking, yawning, trading tales of battle and pointing with grim humour at a month-old shop window advertisement for a house up on the burnt ridge over town: \"For Sale, Paradise Found. Idyllic Bush Setting.\"</p><p>Relief shines on soot-smudged faces. \"I thought we were gone for a while there,\" remarks volunteer Shaun Davidge. \"You could actually hear the crews cheering when Elvis arrived.\" Daybreak saw losses restricted to three homes, an outdoor education centre and several haysheds, with another three homes destroyed in part.</p><p>But it's not over yet. Some 40 truck crews are \"blacking out\" the fire perimeter (that is, backburning), and the short-wave crackles repeatedly with news of break-outs. Four choppers continue to ferry buckets to and fro. The fear is that the fire could erupt again on Thursday, Australia Day, forecast to be almost a carbon copy of yesterday. Returning residents are being told to decide now whether to stay.</p><p>For Nick Lanham and Bonnie Kohnert, who live on De Motts Road, it's a no-brainer. Their blackened house, two gates down from Sandi Murdoch's wildlife refuge, is now minus a kitchen, bathroom and bedroom. \"We're out of here,\" says Nick. A posse of friends is helping cart what remains of the young couple's possessions into a large ute. When the ute radio mentions that the bodies of a father and son have been found in a car swept up in the Grampians fire, several pause to curse.</p><p>Back at the general store I run into Peter Stray, a local sheep farmer and brigade stalwart who began fighting the fire in the national park on Saturday morning, after it was sparked by lightning. That night he got home at 2am and slept badly, fearing that the park rangers' containment lines might not hold against Sunday's extreme weather conditions.</p><p>In the 36 hours since, he's managed just four hours' kip but he's keen to assess the damage. We set off in his white ute, equipped with a small tank, a pump and a hose.</p><p>He points to the north ridge overlooking Anakie. \"The fire came crowning through the tops of the trees there. The Brisbane Ranges is stringy-bark country, and stringy-bark is the worst for spot fires. The embers fly for miles and miles.\"</p><p>The tankers fell back to hold their line just outside town. Then the change hit, creating a new front. We continue north towards Staughton Vale. \"I'm not sure what's been lost up here,\" says Stray, steering a wide berth around a stretch of \"widow-makers\" - massive roadside river red gums still burning from the inside. We pass a place called Touchwood that had a lucky escape. Further on some sheds have been lost, as well as the Anakie Gorge picnic area, a house and a school. More striking than what's been lost is what's been saved. Intact farmhouses and their sentinel pines stand out like desert islands against seared paddocks. The ridges behind them bristle with eucalypt skeletons - not a leaf has been spared.</p><p>Stray's mobile rings. It's the regional chief wanting Stray to take charge of a third of the fire perimeter tonight, from 7pm to 7am. \"Makes it hard to run a farm,\" he says after putting down his phone. In recent years he has been sent to fight fires on the NSW Central Coast and in East Gippsland. With a shrug he says, \"You do have a choice but you feel you have to do your bit.\"</p><p>Stray also helps the CFA run its Community Fireguard program, which brings groups of residents together for a series of information sessions on fire survival. People are instructed to make their properties less fire-prone so they might stay and defend their homes rather than leaving them susceptible to wind-borne embers, which are by far the biggest cause of structural losses in bushfires. Several of Stray's \"pupils\" live here, in the fire zone.</p><p>\"How did they go?\" he wonders. \"That's something I really want to look into: what people did, who stayed, who went and whose houses were saved as a result.\"</p><p>He knows very few stayed. He's not sure that, with all his awareness, he'd have stayed himself. \"It's all about knowing to duck inside when the head fire is coming through, so you don't suffer the radiant heat. But having said that, imagine that orange, red, black cloud coming towards you. It would be really, really scary. Do you stay, or do you jump in the car at the last minute? We say if you're going to leave, leave early. But I wouldn't know what [staying] might be like.\"</p><p>He's silent for a while, then says: \"I'm quite happy in my open country.\" The notion of a \"bush lifestyle\" perplexes him; it's something \"trendies\" do. \"I wonder how many people will sell up now. A lot of these places already have a big turnover. They're all sold in the spring, when everything looks lovely. Come summer, it's just too hot and dry for them.\"</p><p>At Sandi Murdoch's refuge, Stray slows down. \"These stringies\" - he points at the stringy-barks hanging over her house - \"that's just suicide. And see all the grass trees through there? They are incredible for producing heat. They have all those fronds and they're full of resin.\" He shakes his head. \"You sure she stayed? She must have had a helicopter drop. How she didn't decide to make a run for it, even at the last minute ...</p><p>I think they're really brave. Really brave. Some might say foolhardy.\" (Later, Sandi Murdoch acknowledges she was lucky. \"The heli-tanker guys sprayed the tree canopy out the back. If they hadn't, the fire might have come up at us from the gully as well.\")</p><p>The next house is set in a clearing - it survived. Then comes Nick Lanham and Bonnie Kohnert's half-burnt home, tucked into a copse of ironbarks that leaves Stray aghast. \"That's the worst I've seen,\" he says. The worst, that is, until we turn into the driveway of the lot opposite. A pile of remains is surrounded by scorched stringy-barks and grass-trees. Even the above-ground pool, likewise flanked by grass-tree stumps, has melted to the ground. The house, which must have been beautiful, with spectacular views towards the You Yangs, stood no chance.</p><p>\"Whose house is this?\" I ask Stray.</p><p>\"The park ranger's,\" he says, deadpan.</p><p>The subdivisions strung along the ridge road once belonged to a single property. Paul Evans moved into the original 102-year-old home at the top of the ridge last year, with views over Geelong and the bay. As the fire approached he knew he was in no position to defend a weatherboard home on stumps. Any embers swirling underneath would ignite on contact. About two o'clock, under an intensely hot sky, he bundled his two peacocks into a cage he'd picked up that morning from Sandi Murdoch's place, popped them on a trailer and set off down his escape route, a bush track cutting south across his 60-hectare property to Murdoch's block.</p><p>\"I knew Sandi and her brother were staying, so I stopped to help,\" says Evans. \"It was fairly frantic but there was a procedure. We hosed around the house and did some last-minute chopping down of trees.\"</p><p>He had no way of knowing whether the fire had reached his house. He considered sheltering at Murdoch's but knew he'd likely be sacrificing his car at the very least. \"Sandi's house is plain and solid with a low-pitched roof. It's the type of building that might survive. But even though they'd done a hell of a lot of work to make it safer, how safe is safer? Between my place and Sandi's, down in the gully, there's a dam with a five-metre jetty. The jetty burnt down to the water line - that's how hot it was.\" It also worried him to hear Murdoch's preparations went beyond mere survival: \"She told me she was prepared to die with her animals.\"</p><p>About three o'clock, just as a row of trees crowned into flame on the other side of a paddock across the road, he wished Sandi and John luck and took off.</p><p>In town, he parked near the general store. There he ran into another of Murdoch's brothers, Keith, who'd been helping her prepare but ultimately wasn't game to stay. Every so often Keith would confirm his sister was still alive by ringing her to ask, \"Have you suicided yet?\" All she'd handed him for safekeeping was her will.</p><p>When embers began raining on Anakie, Evans drove to a nearby friend's place to watch the news. He'd seen the television choppers overhead and figured their footage of burning homes would reveal whether he still had one. Alas, the widespread power blackout kept him in the dark.</p><p>Roadblocks prevented him from returning until 11pm, when he was finally waved through. Two-thirds of the way up the ridge his car's high beam exposed the forest's new charred form. On both sides of the road, as far as the eye could see, naked grass trees glowed like candles. Passing Murdoch's place, he saw her car was incinerated. He drove slowly on through the debris. At his gate the intact letterbox gave him a flicker of hope. Then he saw the lone chimney, and, crumpled around it, the roof of his house.</p><p>\"I stood there for about five minutes. I thought about all the renovating I'd done. I thought about the old floorboards. And then I thought, 'Well, that ought to have cleared up the white-ant problem.'\"</p><p>The week of January 22 saw the deployment of 10,000 volunteer firefighters and 62 aircraft in Victoria. About 170,000 hectares and 30 homes were burnt. Two civilians and a volunteer firefighter died, along with some 63,000 sheep and 1000 cows.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>SIX PHOTOS: In the line of fire: menacing clouds of black smoke overshadow two firefighters at Paul Evans's burnt-out house near Anakie; (opposite) Sandi Murdoch and her brother John chose to stay put with her menagerie - and lived to tell the tale.

He found an eerie wasteland of deserted farms and ghost towns. But people still work there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IT IS snowing in the Ukraine and the road to Chernobyl, 130 kilometres north of the capital, Kiev, is pristine white.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fields and tall forests of pine and oak slide past on either side as we slow to pass a horse and haycart, driven by two peasants clad in thick, black coats to keep out the cold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It could be a rural scene from a century ago, or even just 10 years ago, when this region was the bread basket of the former Soviet Union.</p><p>But life has changed dramatically here ever since reactor number four at the Chernobyl nuclear power station exploded in the first hours of 26 April 1986, showering caesium 137 and other radioactive fallout over central Europe, Scandinavia and Britain.</p><p>Now, no one dares eat the fruit on the trees or the fish in the streams around Chernobyl and the countryside has become a wasteland, a land of ghost towns and deserted farms.</p><p>Officially it is called the \"Exclusion Zone\" _ a no-go area extending in a 30-kilometre circle around the Chernobyl nuclear power station, near the border with Byelorussia.</p><p>But to everyone in the Ukraine, it's known simply as \"the zone\". It is a place of warped humor and knowing smiles, where alcohol is banned but vodka appears from under the table the moment guests or visitors arrive.</p><p>With the vodka come the wry jokes about radiation. Take a full bottle of vodka and follow each shot with a red wine chaser. When the vodka bottle is empty you won't need to worry about radiation.</p><p>The Russians call the zone \"the land of alienation\". The Ukrainians call the people who have worked in it \"the liquidators\". In both countries, the word \"sarcophagus\" now refers to only one thing _ the zone's epicentre, the concrete and metal coffin of Chernobyl's reactor number four.</p><p>The scientists say no one will ever live in the zone again, though criminals and outlaws are said to roam its \"forbidden forests\".</p><p>About 800 former residents have also moved back to their villages inside the zone, defying repeated attempts by guards to drive them away.</p><p>They are mostly older people without children who say, \"we are going to die soon anyway, we want to die in our own homes\".</p><p>TO ENTER the zone requires official permission, which usually takes a week of tangling with the Soviet-inspired bureaucracy.</p><p>We have the help of Valentina Pastushyna, who is the chairwoman of the Kiev branch of the Ukraine Republican Society of the Children of Chernobyl, the public organisation which has helped arrange eight visits to Australia by children affected by the Chernobyl disaster.</p><p>She has managed to organise our permit in just three hours. She tells us to bring our passports; we might also need some US dollars.</p><p>We are joined on our journey into the zone by the imposing figure of Giorgy Batula, who heads the Chernobyl Committee, a public organisation set up to unite all who were evacuated and suffered, including the liquidators.</p><p>Giorgy and Valentina are both former residents of Pripyat, a city of high-rise apartments housing 58,000 people, three kilometres from the reactor. It was evacuated in the days after the explosion. This is a rare chance for them to return.</p><p>Giorgy was the deputy chief of construction in Pripyat, an important person in what was a growing city. Valentina is meeting her husband Sergei, who works in Chernobyl village designing automated machinery that will replace jobs now done manually at the reactor plant. Like most of the 6000 people employed in the zone, he works two weeks on, two weeks off. During his shift, he lives 40 kilometres away in a dormitory suburb and commutes daily by bus. No one is allowed to live full-time in the zone.</p><p>We arrive at the 30-kilometre gate, where the zone begins, and are told we must transfer to an approved vehicle. As a precuation against contamination, there are two types. One is allowed to travel inside the 30-kilometre zone but not into the 10-kilometre inner zone around the reactor. The other can travel inside both zones, but can never leave the 30-kilometre perimeter.</p><p>Giorgy has shown the guards our authorisation to enter and we are soon driving off in a battered green van towards Chernobyl village, 18 kilometres from the reactor.</p><p>Chernobyl was once a pretty village of farm cottages and fruit trees.</p><p>Now it is overgrown and abandoned, except for a few hundred people who travel here daily to work in administration. It lies at the end of a narrow road lined with forests, flanked by signs warning against throwing cigarette butts and matches out the window. The trees hold so much radiation, mainly in their bark, that authorities fear any forest fire would send clouds of radiation into the atmosphere In the village's central square stands a large statue of Lenin. I try to ask Valentina why it hasn't been pulled down. This has been a common fate of communist heroes elsewhere in the former Soviet Union.</p><p>But she doesn't understand. I make out as if to kick the statue. This she does understand and immediately nods and bursts into laughter. It is not clear how much of a catalyst the Chernobyl disaster was for the Ukraine's push for independence, but it certainly played a part.</p><p>We visit three different buildings for clearance and then pick up Valentina's husband, Sergei, and Nikolai Anysimov, an interpreter who has worked at Chernobyl for the past two years.</p><p>Nikolai worked at the petroleum institute in Kiev with American and British oil experts until the money ran out in 1990.</p><p>\"With the coming of perestroika, the institute's research functions broke down. So I had to find some work and finally I came here,\" Nikolai says, as we drive off towards the reactor.</p><p>\"These were agricultural lands before the accident. Now it is only wild grass. There are no activities here.\"</p><p>Down the road he points to a collection of mounds a few hundred metres away.</p><p>\"A village called Kopache existed here before the accident. It was so badly contaminated that it was decided to break up all the houses and bury them into the ground. A few buildings survived. Now it's only grass and shrubbery. After they finished, they buried the bulldozers that buried the village.</p><p>\"The same happened with the forests. The main radiation attack was like a narrow tongue. One part of the forest still lives. Right next to it, trees died within days. They turned yellow and red and their pine needles fell off. These trees have been felled and buried in the ground.\"</p><p>We pass nuclear reactors five and six which were under construction at the time of the explosion. Everything has been left as it was _ cranes hang motionless over the unfinished reactor towers. Trucks, buses, helicopters and building materials lie abandoned by the road. No one dares touch them.</p><p>Steam rises over water ducts coming from the two nuclear reactors that still operate. A third is under repair after a fire.</p><p>Nikolai points to a lake, which is the main water supply, and cracks a joke. \"It's very abundant in fish. Very large fish,\" he laughs.</p><p>\"But very much contaminated. By the way, we have found no cases of fish with two heads.\"</p><p>Reactor four was entombed in walls of concrete and metal five metres thick after the accident. Hence its name, the sarcophagus. But there are cracks and fissures in the casing. Nikolai says scientists have told him gaps were left deliberately so that air could get inside.</p><p>We stop in car park 300 metres from the sarcophagus. It has a sinister presence, borne out by Nikolai's firm instructions not to go near the fence where radiation is 10 times higher.</p><p>\"We will not stay here long, maybe three minutes for some photos.</p><p>Because, you know, this is not a good place to be.\"</p><p>I am anxious that we leave even sooner. Nikolai says scientists still do not have a clear understanding of what caused the explosion and some believe there could still be fuel burning inside.</p><p>\"There was a desire to produce more power, so there were overloads to the equipment. Then, they began to carry out some experiments, which were periodically performed at the plant. There were personnel who did not have the proper attitude. There were many other possible causes.\"</p><p>Before we leave, Nikolai points to a sign on a wall opposite the sarcophagus, put there by the Russians who built the plant. It reads: \"We shall come to the victory of communism.\"</p><p>\"Some scientists here are very pessimistic about the sarcophagus,\" Nikolai says. \"They say no one knows what will happen to it in the next half an hour, let alone the next 100 years. Everyone says the whole structure is shabby and not too stable and it will only stand for 10 years.\"</p><p>A plan to encase the sarcophagus in a larger dome of glass and ceramic has been developed by the French. This should last for 100 years.</p><p>\"If men go inside the sarcophagus in protective suits it is only for a very short time,\" Nikolai says. \"Mostly the data comes from the several hundred sensors installed inside.</p><p>Men who removed fuel and other debris from the reactor after the accident were allowed to work inside for only 30 seconds. For that, they earned a week's wages and a holiday in Kiev.</p><p>The main danger now is from background radiation and from contaminated land and groundwater. Nikolai says the radioactive debris fell in patches and some areas outside the zone are more contaminated than areas inside.</p><p>\"We have just gone over a hot patch in the road,\" laughs Nikolai, as we drive away. \"But it's OK. We were going fast.\"</p><p>The gathering darkness accentuates the eeriness of entering Pripyat, just three kilometres from the reactor. It is surely the largest ghost city on earth.</p><p>Before the accident, Pripyat housed 58,000 people in its high-rise apartments. Now it is empty, its residents were evacuated in the days after the explosion.</p><p>Think of the high-rise units in Collingwood; scatter dozens of derelict cars, trucks and buses around; take away all the people; and multiply it all 10 times. Then you have Pripyat.</p><p>Valentina and Giorgy point out their former homes. They are both very emotional at this point and Giorgy wipes tears from his eyes.</p><p>During our previous few days in Kiev, Valentina had taken us to visit several homes of families who were residents of Pripyat and victims of the Chernobyl accident. With Mrs Zina Botte, the Ukraine Consul for Melbourne, acting as interpreter, we were told many tragic stories, such as that of Klava and Leonid Pilypeyko and their children Sergei and Svetlana, who now live in the Kiev suburb of Vyshgorod.</p><p>Klava was bedridden for a year. Her arms, legs and face were swollen.</p><p>So were her thyroid glands, which were eventually removed in an operation in 1990. Now she takes thyroxine tablets daily. \"I thought I was going to die,\" she says.</p><p>Leonid, too, has enlarged thyroid glands and the doctors have told him his heart is weakened. Their son, Sergei, also has enlarged thyroid glands and suffers respiratory problems. He goes to school one week on, one week off. Their daughter, Svetlana, suffers similarly.</p><p>Svetlana was one of the Chernobyl children recently stranded in Australia who were flown home for free by Lauda Air.</p><p>Klava said Pripyat before the accident was a paradise, a place full of colorful roses and children playing on swings. She believes the Chernobyl explosion and aftermath was foretold in the apocalyptic writings in the Revelation of St John, the last book of the New Testament. \"There will be a heaven, but you won't be able to eat any of the fruit,\" she said.</p><p>Luba Sirosh was born 10 kilometres from Chernobyl and lived her entire life there until two days after the accident. She remembers her parents' farmhouse, where she grew up with eight brothers and sisters, as a \"house full of laughter\".</p><p>Luba said the explosion buried her eldest brother. Now her younger brother is also sick. She does not know how to help him.</p><p>Luba's father is also buried near Chernobyl village. She grieves that she cannot return to pluck the grass from his grave and lay flowers there. Like most former residents of Chernobyl and Pripyat, she knows she will never go back.</p><p>Officially, 42 people have died as a result of the Chernobyl disaster.</p><p>But the real figure could be hundreds or even thousands.</p><p>Giorgy peers through the gloom at Pripyat's empty apartments. He says a total of 130,000 people were evacuated from the towns, villages and farms around Chernobyl. \"There are 68,000 people now registered as sick due to Chernobyl. They have different illnesses; the most common is swollen thyroid glands. There are already many cancers.\"</p><p>Nikolai says scientists believe that most radiation-induced cancers will not show up for eight to 10 years after the accident, which is a year or two from now.</p><p>Valentina expects that the victims of Chernobyl will die prematurely.</p><p>\"Every slight illness sends fear through them ... that they are dying. Many children know they are sick, but don't really understand why.\"</p><p>She says all survivors have regular medical check-ups. This is partly so that doctors can monitor the effects of radiation. But while the hospitals treating the sick are clean and warm, much of the medical equipment doesn't work and there is a chronic shortage of medicines.</p><p>Even having simple vitamin supplements would help.</p><p>IT SEEMS incomprehensible that people already affected by radiation would voluntarily chose go back to work inside the zone.</p><p>Leonid Pilypeyko, who works at Chernobyl, just shrugged when I asked this question in Vyshgorod the day before. \"There is very high unemployment in the Ukraine,\" he replied, \"and there is a stigma against employing Chernobyl victims. It's a job and we get extra money and benefits, such as free public transport.\"</p><p>Giorgy Batula, too, returned to work inside the zone for six years as a supply manager and in the militia. A year ago he left to take up his job with the Chernobyl Committee in Kiev. \"Sure, I'm happy,\" he says, when I ask him if he's glad to have left the zone.</p><p>Before we leave Pripyat, we are surprised to see lights on in one tall building. It's the former Pripyat Hotel. Nikolai can't resist another joke. \"It's the hotel with the largest number of vacancies in Europe,\" he laughs.</p><p>There is a decontamination team working there. Nearby, scientists have built a greenhouse to study the effects of radiation on plants. The entire zone has become a giant laboratory for scientists.</p><p>\"There are now many wild animals inside the zone _ wild boar, deer, foxes, wolves, rabbits, dogs _ much more than previously because there is no activity here, no industries,\" says Nikolai. \"Swedish scientists come with rifles and go around the forest shooting deer and wild boar. They take samples from their flesh, meat and intestines to determine radiation levels and compare it to animals in Sweden.\"</p><p>Nikolai is not worried about the radiation in the zone. \"At first I was. But now I've got accustomed to it, like most people here.\"</p><p>He says the authorities are very strict about who enters the zone and what is taken out. It's part of the image promoted by the nuclear industry about Chernobyl _ that the accident was a disaster, but that the danger was contained.</p><p>Security was tightened last October, when officials announced that a small quantity of nuclear fuel was stolen from Chernobyl.</p><p>As we leave Pripyat in total darkness and arrive at the gate denoting the 10-kilometre inner zone around the reactor plant, the guard in his cubbyhouse on the gate is sound alseep.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo Inside the laboratory: David Porter (right) shares a meal with staff who work inside the zone at Chernobyl village; Chernobyl: the concrete and metal coffin of reactor number four</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NV80-TXN5-S1H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yhp8x10yqw1b071jfd9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1994</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2575\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1994 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"01\" year=\"1994\"><dateText>January 29, 1994 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RC2</classCode><className>CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000696</classCode><className>FARM LABOR</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX001221</classCode><className>NUCLEAR ENERGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N221113MM</classCode><className>NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RC2</classCode><className>CHERNOBYL NUCLEAR DISASTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLS1</classCode><className>RADIOACTIVE COMPOUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000696</classCode><className>FARM LABOR</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX335</classCode><className>KIYEV, UKRAINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC581</classCode><className>UKRAINE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC570</classCode><className>BELARUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIAN FEDERATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Dugald Jellie reports on the unpredictable nature of the wildfire.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">ON BLACK Friday, 15 January 1939, the workmen at Fitzpatrick's timber mill near Woods Point were trapped in the path of the worst fires in Victoria's history. Tall eucalypts around them cracked and burst with expanding sap, and the air was sucked into whirlwinds of fire. The flames were hotter than 1000 degrees Celsius.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Then, in about 12 minutes, it was all over. The fire left just one survivor, George Sellers, wrapped in a heavy blanket, to emerge from the ashes. All his workmates died. Eleven of them were found buried in the mill's sawdust heap, another was discovered in a 13-foot water tank, where he had been scalded to death. The water had boiled dry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is a story of the dangers of bushfires in Victoria: the thermal energy they produce, the speed they travel, the ways they burn, how they kill. And it is a lesson that repeats itself in Victoria with clockwork regularity.</p><p>According to firefighting lore, south-eastern Australia is one of the three highest-risk fire zones in the world, alongside California and southern France. In Victoria, on average, there are fires in 40 out of 50 years, and in South Australia in six or seven out of 10 years.</p><p>More than 250 people have been killed by bushfires in Victoria since 1939, a total reached through sporadic increments, each time the state experienced a major blaze that could only be stopped by nature itself.</p><p>On Black Friday, 71 people died, 51 people died in the 1944 blazes, 10 people in 1952, 23 people in 1969, and the Ash Wednesday disaster in 1983 killed 76 people in Victoria and South Australia.</p><p>The director of the CSIRO bushfire research and management group, Mr Phil Cheney, says most of these big bushfires were fuelled by a set of environmental conditions coinciding a long drought, soaring summer temperatures and strong winds. They are the three danger signs for firefighters.</p><p>\"It's usually the winds associated with the fire front that cause the greatest damage,\" Mr Cheney says. \"I've seen trees over one metre in diametre snapped off half-way up. That sort of wind can pick up fire trucks and throw them around. Any person caught in the open just couldn't survive.\"</p><p>Which is where George Sellers was trapped on 15 January 1939. But he was lucky. He survived only because he wrapped himself in a wet blanket and ran on to a burnt-out piece of land as the fires passed through. \"I stood in the open while the flames swept overhead,\" he later told an Age reporter. \"I had to rush to the tub to wet it (the blanket) again. It was the most terrifying experience of my life.\"</p><p>Across the mountain ranges, in the Buckland Valley near Porepunkah, a similar horror story was unfolding. A man and his nephew were trying to save their house when they were caught by the flames. They ran for a creek, 100 metres away, which was surrounded by wild blackberries.</p><p>In trying to get through the blackberry, the man became hopelessly entangled in the thorny vine and his teenage nephew collapsed from exhaustion nine metres from the bank. Both were burnt to death.</p><p>Two days after the Black Friday fires, which burnt out 1.5 million hectares in the state, the skies in New Zealand were blackened with the smoke. Shipping between Melbourne and Sydney used foghorns to navigate through the thick smoke and ash swept off-shore.</p><p>But for much of Victoria's vegetation the fires, ironically, heralded the start of a reproductive cycle. From death sprouted life.</p><p>Fire, like wind, water and the sun, has been one of the most powerful natural forces to shape the Australian landscape. Most native ecosystems have adapted to fires that historically occurred about 20 to 40 years apart, usually in late summer.</p><p>Forest fire has arguably moulded the life of everything that exists in Australia, from the composition and geography of our native vegetation, to the character and lifestyle of both the Aborigines and the European settlers.</p><p>The Aborigines used fire regularly for hunting to flush out game and as a ceremonial instrument. But with white settlement came a change in farming and land-use practices that discouraged large-scale fires, resulting in a gradual build-up of combustible fuels in forests. So although the frequency of fire has been reduced, the intensity has increased.</p><p>LIKE ANY natural disaster, there seems to be no order to the licks and turns of a bushfire. Research tells firefighters that the average grassfire front burns for only five to 15 seconds and travels up to 21kmh, but it does not adequately explain why fires often skirt one house but engulf the next, burning large black plains but leaving circles of untouched greenery.</p><p>With forest fires, the front usually passes over in about five minutes, but the heat that remains can often be lethal for up to one hour afterwards.</p><p>CSIRO research shows that houses generally burn down over a period of hours after the fire front has passed. This means that if people are well prepared, they should be able to survive the main fire front by sheltering in their homes and then save their homes by putting out spot fires started by the sparks and embers.</p><p>Much of Australia's bushfire knowledge has been learnt since the February 1977 grass fires in Victoria's western district, which killed five people, including three in one farmhouse. Since then, the Country Fire Authority and the CSIRO have pieced together, like a jigsaw puzzle, the elements of a fire. The research is about eliminating the guesswork of fire behavior, with much of it, tragically, often only realised from experience.</p><p>From the Ash Wednesday fires, for instance, firefighters learnt that 46 of the 47 deaths in Victoria occurred immediately following the afternoon change in wind direction. A CFA scientific officer, Mr Mark Garvey, says the fires were at first fanned by a hot northerly wind, which changed to the south-west later in the day. What had been the side of the fire became the front fatally trapping residents and firefighters, including 12 CFA fighters who died beside their trucks in Upper Beaconsfield.</p><p>The CFA now has direct access to more than 50 automatic weather stations across the state, which can predict accurately when the wind change will alter the direction of a blaze.</p><p>Understanding fires, says Mr Garvey, is all about understanding how the variables work. Heading the list are fuel, moisture content and wind speed, with associated factors including vegetation type, terrain, temperature and fuel weight and arrangement.</p><p>\"In a few years' time, hopefully we'll have all the variables to be able to predict the path of fires on a computer screen,\" he says.</p><p>\"We will be able to plot their shape, intensity, the direction they move, and how to manage them.\"</p><p>These computer models will be particularly useful in combating destructive forest fires. The chief fire officer of the Department of Conservation and Natural Resources, Mr Rod Incoll, says that if firefighters cannot control a bushfire inside the first 30 minutes, it is almost certain to burn until the available bush runs out.</p><p>This is partly because of the dangers of fighting fires within a forest, often driven by strong winds and fuelled by the oils and waxes in eucalypt leaves. In the Ash Wednesday blazes, for instance, the forest fires moved at an average speed of 10-12kmh, four times quicker than the NSW blazes in January last year.</p><p>CSIRO research suggests the only viable way to control fires is to reduce the amount of fuel available, with all other factors outside human control. Its studies have found that the intensity of a fire is roughly proportional to the square of the fuel quantity, so an increase in fuel by a factor of 10 increases the fire intensity by a factor of 100.</p><p>So far this summer, Victoria has been fortunate not to have any major outbreaks despite facing its most dangerous wildfire season since Ash Wednesday 1983. But the CFA's chief fire officer, Mr Arthur Farn, warns: \"The conditions are right for serious fires to occur in many parts of the state and these will threaten ill-prepared communities.\"</p><p>Tomorrow: How to survive a wildfire, a special advertising supplement.</p><p>Ash Wednesday - How People Died: THE Ash Wednesday bushfires, on 16 February 1983, have been scorched into the psyches of most people living in Victoria and South Australia. Even if they saw the fires only on the television news or in the morning newspapers, most Victorians remember where they were or what they were doing the day columns of smoke across the state rose in the air. In Melbourne, the sky was filled with ash and dust; the sun shone bright red.</p><p>The signs of an impending \"Big One\" were evident well before the first blaze broke out at Deans Marsh, in the Otway Ranges. It was Melbourne's driest February for 18 years. On 8 February the temperature hit 43.2 degrees, a February record.</p><p>Most of Victoria had been in the grip of drought for more than a year. Melbourne's water storage was 55 per cent below capacity, with water restrictions in place. A week before Ash Wednesday, tonnes of red dust from the Mallee and Western District, sucked up and carried by scorching winds, cast an ominous pall over Melbourne's suburbs.</p><p>On 16 February the temperature reached 43 degrees, fanning 180 fires burning across Victoria, eight of which were considered major blazes threatening life and property. Four days later, in their aftermath, they had burned 378,000 hectares, caused $440 million damage and killed 76 people.</p><p>When the ash had settled, it was time for the coroner's inquiries and the Country Fire Authority to draw lessons from the disaster. The most poignant questions included: why had so many people died and what, if any, were the contributing causes to their deaths?</p><p>One study of the Ash Wednesday fires at Mount Macedon found that people who sheltered in their houses had an excellent chance of surviving a major fire, while late evacuation was fraught with danger.</p><p>It found that fleeing a fire by a vehicle was a dangerous strategy.</p><p>The study said this was because the principal threat to survival is the radiant heat produced by a bushfire, rather than the flames.</p><p>Exposure to high levels of radiant heat can cause the body's cooling system to fail, leading to heat exhaustion and heart failure, and ultimately death by heat stroke. A house provides much better protection from radiant heat than a car.</p><p>A CFA study, by Noreen Krusel and Stephen Petris, identified three broad scenarios in which civilian victims (not firefighters) died during the Ash Wednesday blazes. They found that people died because they either used an ineffective survival strategy, had insufficient warning, or could not implement an effective survival strategy without support.</p><p>This third category included people who were physically or mentally handicapped, those under the influence of drugs or alcohol, the infirm and the elderly. The CFA study dubbed the \"death papers\" found that elderly people were over-represented among the dead on Ash Wednesday and earlier studies have concluded that the old have three times the risk of perishing in bushfires than the young.</p><p>Cudgee - Ballengeigh Fire: PETRANELLA ANDERSON, 32, and her son Gareth, 13, lived opposite the local primary school in Nirranda East, in western Victoria. On the afternoon of Ash Wednesday, Petranella had been talking outside the school with the teacher. The school had been evacuated earlier. Gareth was at home. While they were talking, the wind started swirling and it looked like a fire front was approaching. Petranella told the teacher she would fetch her son from home and drive north to Terang.</p><p>Albert Grigg, 45, a salesman from Lower Templestowe, talking business in the Western District, had been involved in fighting fires nearby until the people with him decided it was time to return to their homes. He was at an intersection when Petranella and Gareth drove up.</p><p>Mr Grigg, in a statement made to the Warrnambool Coroner's Court, said: \"One of the vehicles (at the intersection) I think was a Holden with a woman and child in it. She saw me and just pulled up. I asked here if she would drop me off at the Askews' and I just jumped into the back seat. She knew the Askews.</p><p>\"We took off down the road. It was only about 250 metres and all of sudden there was a fire in front of us. It was a big fire, a bad fire running straight over the road in front of us. I looked behind me and noticed in the few seconds we had stopped the road behind us was covered with flames.\"</p><p>The car stalled and they closed the windows and huddled down on the floor. Soon the windows exploded and flames started to come into the car. Petranella screamed \"I've got to get out of here\". Albert told her that it would not help and she replied \"I don't care. I can't stand it.\" She left the car and ran.</p><p>Albert and Gareth got out of the car as the interior started to burn. The boy was badly burnt and Albert's clothing was partly on fire. They were both found staggering up the road by a policeman who extinguished the fires burning on their clothing and bodies.</p><p>Sergeant Donald Wilson, of Port Campbell, told the inquest: \"I ran over to them. The boy was burned from head to foot and was not recognisable. His facial features, as with the rest of him, were very badly burned. He had his arm outstretched to me and was screaming in obvious pain.</p><p>\"What little clothing he had left was still smouldering. I extinguished it and placed him on the rear seat of the police car and told him to lay down, which he did. He said several times, `I am going to die again'. His screaming had by now changed to loud moans . . .\"</p><p>On the way to hospital in a police car, joined by a fire tanker, they were again halted by the fire. Another car collided into the back of the police car, breaking Mr Grigg's nose and gashing his forehead.</p><p>They were transferred to another police car that arrived on the scene. Gareth died in this car in the driveway of the hospital. Mr Grigg's survived, despite suffering serious burns to his back, arms, legs and hands.</p><p>The schoolteacher said that when she had been talking to Petranella Anderson outside the school she had only been wearing shorts, a top and thongs. Her body was found about 50 metres from her car, her thongs stuck to the road about 30 metres from her car.</p><p>Otway Ranges Fire: ILIE JOHN MIERLA, 51, was working as a Telecom linesman. On Ash Wednesday he left Lorne at 3.20pm and was on his way to Colac to finish work at 4.30pm. He was driving a Toyota Hi Lux utility. He was told by a workmate that the quickest way back to Colac was via the Deans Marsh road.</p><p>Numerous witnesses saw the Telecom vehicle driving through an intersection at which they had been asked to stop by the police. It was not clear why Mr Mierla's vehicle was not turned back at the intersection. But a police motorcyclist, Senior Constable Steven Williams, did manage to catch up to him and wave him over to the side of the road.</p><p>The policeman told Mr Mierla about the fire front further down the road and \"ordered\" him to turn his vehicle around and follow him back to Lorne. He complied, doing a U-turn and following the motorcycle back south.</p><p>They were both soon confronted by fire. The policeman thought the fire was a \"spot fire\" and less intense than the main blaze still behind them. He told Ilie Mierla to \"come on\" and follow him through the fire. The policeman then lay down on his motorcycle to get protection from the wind shield and drove through the fire in third gear. As he was going through it he had to swerve around a fallen tree, thinking there was sufficient room for a vehicle to follow.</p><p>The policeman got to the other side of the flames and waited for Mr Mierla. When the Telecom vehicle did not arrive he assumed that he had changed his mind and turned around to continue towards Colac, which he had been eager to do anyway. The policeman thought that there would be no trouble as Mr Mierla should have been fairly well protected from the flames by his vehicle.</p><p>The Telecom vehicle was found on the road, facing towards Lorne, in about the place where the policeman thought he had driven into the flames. The vehicle was assumed to have stalled. The body was found beside the car, lying on the road facing the open driver's door.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photos Scrubfire : the average front burns for only five to 15 seconds.

We're not gonna stop that. It's burning everything. We can't contain it, but we're just doing our best. Make sure you just get down the road, and keep moving that way.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Bigger and bigger wildfires are breaking out and they are becoming harder and harder to control.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JERRY WILLIAMS, MEGAFIRE SPECIALIST: Our fire seasons are starting earlier, they're lasting longer, they're burning hotter.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Fears are growing that climate change will bring with it not only more extreme weather events. It will also herald a new age of megafires.</p><p>DR KEVIN HENNESSY, CLIMATE IMPACT AND RISK GROUP, CSIRO: What we're talking about with climate change is whether such events may occur more frequently in future. Our results suggest that that may be the case.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: But the truth is we're already struggling to control our worst bushfires.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: The loss of our house, we... we can accept that, but once we got into Canberra and found out the devastation, and... and the four lives that had been lost, I mean... that was hard to take.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Tonight on Four Corners - Will Australia burn uncontrollably in years to come? How will we minimise the risk? And how will we put out the flames? 2003 was a terrible year for fires.</p><p>REPORTER AT CALIFORNIA FIRE: This fire, you can't stop it. You can't get in front of it. Trees are just blown apart - it's what's happening.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: In California, Canada, France, Portugal and Australia, huge blazes swept across vast areas, destroyed thousands of properties, and took dozens of lives.</p><p>REPORTER AT CALIFORNIA FIRE: We've lost at least a thousand structures. 16 people are confirmed dead.</p><p>JERRY WILLIAMS, MEGAFIRE SPECIALIST: California, which represents probably the largest firefighting capacity in the United States - maybe in the world - was overwhelmed. The Cedar fire in southern California, outside of San Diego, burned over 3,000 homes, and claimed 22 lives. Some 50,000 people were evacuated, starting at 2:00 in the morning.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: In Australia alone, nearly four million hectares were burned. In Canberra, four lives were lost.</p><p>KEVIN O'LOUGHLIN, CEO, BUSHFIRE COOPERATIVE RESEARCH CENTRE: In one year, on three continents, we had, in effect, record-breaking fires, and that, I think, made some people sit up and think, \"Hey, what's going on here? Is there an international pattern? Is something happening in relation to climate change?\"</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Australia has had its share of catastrophic fires. In 1939, the Black Friday inferno resulted in the loss of 71 lives.</p><p>RADIO BROADCAST: Bush fire brigades attack the planks of the fire below on the foothills, and lower slopes of the mountain ranges.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Fewer lives are lost nowadays, but the fear is that fires are becoming harder to put out.</p><p>BRUCE ESPLIN, EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMISSIONER, VIC: I spend a lot of time out in the bush in Victoria, and in regional Victoria talking to farmers, talking to firefighters, talking to foresters. And there's a huge number of them are telling me about bushfire behaviour that they would describe as unprecedented.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: Are we in for an era of larger than normal bushfires? Probably. Are fires becoming more difficult to contain and suppress? Definitely. That's evidenced by the fact that fires are both unseasonal. Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia - all had fires, of consequence, of significance, months before they would normally experience them.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Many experts dislike the term mega-fire, but whatever you call them, huge and uncontrollable fires are here to stay. These fires devour the vegetation on forest floors, which acts as fuel for the flames. And they have the potential to threaten our towns and cities.</p><p>JERRY WILLIAMS, MEGAFIRE SPECIALIST: We're looking at three factors converging. One is climate change, one is over-accumulated fuels, particularly in fire-dependent forests, and the last is the rapid growth and development of human populations at what we call the 'wildland/urban interface.'</p><p>DR KEVIN TOLHURST, SENIOR LECTURER, FIRE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, MELBOURNE UNI: Megafires, I think, are going to become much more common. I don't think it's necessarily inevitable. I think we can probably do a lot to reduce the frequency and occurrence of those megafires with better land management. But certainly that's where the pressure is heading.</p><p>PROFESSOR ROSS BRADSTOCK, DIRECTOR, CENTRE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT OF BUSHFIRES, WOLLONGONG UNIVERSITY: I don't think there's any doubt that we're probably headed for an increase in fire activity in, say, the next half century. And that would be based on what we understand about the projections of change in weather, and in particular, the variables that affect fire.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Fires are more likely to break out on high, very high or extreme fire danger days. The chances of a fire starting, its rate of spread, intensity, and difficulty of suppression are rated on a Forest Fire Danger Index according to temperature, humidity, wind speed, and drought.</p><p>DR KEVIN HENNESSY, CLIMATE IMPACT AND RISK GROUP, CSIRO: We looked at potential danger for the year 2020 and 2050, at 17 sites in south-eastern Australia. We concluded that there would be a 4 per cent to 25 per cent increase in the risk of very high and extreme fire danger days by the year 2020, and a 15 per cent to 70 per cent increase by the year 2050.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: What does that mean, in practical terms?</p><p>DR KEVIN HENNESSY, CLIMATE IMPACT AND RISK GROUP, CSIRO: In practical terms, that means an increase in the frequency and intensity of bushfires in future, due to greenhouse warming, along with an extension of the bushfire season.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Climate modeller Professor Andy Pitman says that in the next 40 years, the risk of bushfires will increase by 25 per cent, whether greenhouse gas emissions are reduced or not. But the forecast for 2100 is much more bleak.</p><p>PROFESSOR ANDY PITMAN, ENVIRONMENTAL LIFE SCIENCES, MACQUARIE UNI: But if we allow the emissions to go to a high end, the population growths continue, there isn't some superb technological solution, we continue to burn fossil fuels in much the way that we have been doing, we're looking at at least 100 per cent increase in bushfire risk, and regionally - substantially more than that.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: These are forecasts of increased risk, but can we cope with the levels of risk we already have? Some now allege that even without global warming, fire management in Australia has been unable to prevent megafires. In 2003, one of the worst bushfire disasters of modern times occurred in and around our nation's capital. On January 18th, extreme weather conditions fanned the flames, as a firestorm engulfed the suburbs of Canberra.</p><p>MAN AT CANBERRA BUSHFIRE: I couldn't get any water bloody pressure, because it was mainly just in the carport. And now, it's just spreading to his... That's his lounge and dining room, so she's gone.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Four people lost their lives, and nearly 500 homes were destroyed. Mount Stromlo Observatory was gutted, and Canberra's water supply seriously polluted. Firefighting is not an exact science, and the Canberra story shows how bad judgment calls can have drastic consequences. In future, with climate change, these kinds of judgments will be even more critical. On the afternoon of January 8th, a lightning strike started a fire in New South Wales, in a remote part of the Brindabella National Park known as McIntyre's Hut. It was one of four fires which would end up hitting Canberra ten days later. Wayne West, who owns Wyora Station - an 860-acre property next to the National Park, remembers vividly how the fire developed. On that first night, he called New South Wales Fire Control to find out what was happening.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: They showed very little concern with the fire, and, um... I was under the impression that the fire was just a lightning strike of very little concern at the time.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Then he visited the site.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: I went to the fire that evening.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: And what did you see?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: Well, the flame height of the fire was not at all high. It was a low flame height, and the fire was burning with very low intensity.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Would it have been dangerous for firefighters to go there and fight it?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: Well, at no time did I feel as though I was endangered, or, um... intimidated by the fire, at all, and that was right through 'til the 17th of, um... January.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The McIntyre's Hut fire was one of a number set off by lightning storms.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: There were multiple fires throughout the area. Every effort was made by a local incident management team to do what was necessary to contain those fires, bearing in mind that, around about the time those fires started, at in the succeeding days, the forecast was for predominantly easterly winds. So obviously their focus was to look at containment on the western side rather than the eastern side because of the forecast conditions.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The New South Wales Rural Fire Service didn't tackle the McIntyre's Hut fire head on, that afternoon or evening. The decision not to hit the fire fast at its source would prove to be fatal. Later, fire chiefs would claim that firefighters were being protected from potential grave danger. Phil Koperberg, a Labor candidate in the New South Wales elections, is also the state's Rural Fire Service Commissioner.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: The incident controller told me on more than one occasion, and my conversations with him and his deputy were not infrequent, that to have commenced a direct attack on the fire would have endangered firefighters and that has to be his call.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: But this film - never before seen on television - shows a team of CSIRO observers monitoring the fire on that first afternoon and evening. The film was shot by the son of one of Australia's foremost bushfire experts, the CSIRO's Phil Cheney.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Now, your son was filming this part of the landscape. Was he in any danger?</p><p>DR PHIL CHENEY, HONORARY RESEARCH SCIENTIST, CSIRO: No, not at all. They came in looking for spot fires and trying to map the position of the fire, and how many spot fires there were, but he certainly wasn't in any danger. The biggest danger up here is falling trees, that some of these trees will catch alight and fall without warning.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: So in your view, the fire could and should have been fought at that time?</p><p>DR PHIL CHENEY, HONORARY RESEARCH SCIENTIST, CSIRO: Absolutely, I mean, that was the safest time of this fire ever. And if you don't take advantage of this first safe period, then you're immediately way, way, way behind the eight ball.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: Phil Cheney is an eminent scientist, but Phil Cheney is not a firefighting entity and therefore has not had to deal with the possibility of committing human resources to a particular incident, and he forms and opinion and other people form different opinions, the decision was arrived at and has to be supported that firefighters may well have been endangered.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Over the next ten days, the McIntyre's Hut fire slowly spread.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: What I seen from the night of the 8th 'til the 17th, ah, the fire burnt very, very slowly. Very, very, very slowly.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: So there was time to tackle it properly?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: I believe so, yes, from what I witnessed.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Peter Cathles was a senior officer in the Rural Fire Service working on the fire ground, and in the Yass fire control centre, while the Canberra fires progressed. On or around January 9th he went to a meeting of fire chiefs in Queanbeyan, at which the McIntyre's Hut fire was discussed. He was surprised by a comment made by a member of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service - and is telling this story publicly for the first time.</p><p>PETER CATHLES, FORMER SENIOR GROUP CAPTAIN, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: One of the paid staff of the RFS said, \"Oh, it's only shit country, it's burning pretty slow... why not let it burn?\" And they all seized on that as a brilliant idea and that was the end of the meeting. They actually decided by consensus to do nothing and I sort of lived with this a year or two and I ultimately wrote to the coroner, Maria Doogan, and told her this.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: There may have been a range of individuals with separate opinions and there may well have been a nodding of heads, and we all know where the odd indiscreet comment will ultimately lead us, but the team itself, the people who were ultimately responsible for making the decisions never, never could be accused of any level of complacency in this and haven't been.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Many firefighters - including Peter Cathles' son Tim - were left on the sidelines, despite being eager to go in and tackle the blaze.</p><p>PETER CATHLES, SENIOR GROUP CAPTAIN, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: I think we could have controlled the McIntyre's Hut fire those first few days if we'd have had the OK to go ahead. I'm certain we could have.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Now Tim wanted to go and fight the fire on January the 8th didn't he?</p><p>PETER CATHLES, FORMER SENIOR GROUP CAPTAIN, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: Yeah, that's right. Yeah, he, he wanted to go and they were stopped from going by their local paid staff, one was in Yarralumla Shire and the other one is Yass Shire.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: How did he react to that?</p><p>PETER CATHLES, FORMER SENIOR GROUP CAPTAIN, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: Ah, he wasn't happy at all.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The judgement had been made not to go in fast and attack the fire directly - but instead to try and contain it by lighting back-burns - where sometimes vast tracts of land are lit in front of a fire, to burn off fuel and stop the fire spreading. Three days after the McIntyre's Hut lightning strike, one of these back-burns was lit.</p><p>HUGH PATERSON, VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER: The idea was to have a back-burn along the Brindabella Range, then along this power line track out to the Goodradigbee River, and so that would, sort of, draw a line around the fire and keep it behind those lines.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: I made a phone call to the fire controller saying to him at that particular time that the weather conditions up here were hot, the wind was blowing from the northerly direction, blowing to the south, and the back-burn was to be burnt to the north and I said the conditions would not suit back-burning. He told me, \"Wayne, you don't see the big picture.\"</p><p>HUGH PATERSON, VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER: It was not heavy fuel loads in my opinion, but lots of fine, flashy fuels which made the fire difficult to contain. Ah, it was very dry and any little sparks crossing the trail could easy lead the fire to escape.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: So did they listen to you?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: No.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: They went ahead and did it?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: They went ahead with the back-burn and in doing that back-burn the fire jumped the containment line immediately to the south and they brought helicopters in then to try and contain that outbreak.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: For several days after this, helicopters travelled to and from Wayne West's property, collecting water from his dam to drop on the fire. One in particular - the 'Incredible Hulk' - was draining 9,000 litres every three minutes, so Wayne West and his family set up pumps to refill the dam from the nearby Goodradigbee river. Later, Wayne West asked an officer from the Rural Fire Service for a four-inch pump and 130 metres of hose. It would have allowed him and his family to protect his house - but it was never supplied. On January 16th, Wayne West and two of his neighbours crossed the river and put out a fire which they'd seen in the national park. They cut down burning trees, and monitored the fire throughout the night. Wayne West was feeling more and more anxious. The next day, he again called Fire Control in New South Wales.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: With this phone call, I was getting a little bit of aggressive on the phone and I had a response come back, \"Should the fire cross the river, we'll put it out.\"</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: How do you feel about that now?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: A very flippant statement made with no intent.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: By January the 17th, weather conditions were deteriorating. Four major fires were spreading and in a last ditch effort to stop the progress of the McIntyre's Hut fire, the New South Wales firefighters lit another back-burn at 11am, this time from the air. The gamble failed and the back-burn itself escaped, adding to the final run of fires into Canberra.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Was it right of the New South Wales Rural Fire Service to drop aerial incendiary devices to start a back-burn?</p><p>DR PHIL CHENEY, HONORARY RESEARCH SCIENTIST, CSIRO: Yes, but not at the time that they did it. To light up on a very high fire danger, and especially when it's forecast 'Possible extreme' in the afternoon, we know we're going to lose that. That's our experience, we're going to lose that fire. So, no, it was the wrong time to do it. If they had done it skilfully the evening before, they could well have achieved a safe burnout of that area and not had any escapes over the fire line. But they really should've done it about three or four days before on a smaller area.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: In a perfect world you would only do a back-burn if you're able to do it with the wind, not against the wind. In a perfect world we would know that you can only do a back-burn at dusk and in a perfect world you would be able to put an aircraft up in the air at 7 o'clock at night when conditions may well have moderated and do a major aerial incendiary run, but in real life that doesn't happen.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: That night, the fire crossed the Goodradigbee River, bringing it that much closer to Wayne West's property. Again, he called New South Wales Fire Control and on this occasion, he was told to call 000. It was his 24th phone call.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: You were ringing them to ask for help?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: Yes.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: You'd been in touch with them more than 20 times before, you'd helped them with water from your dam, you'd crossed the river, you'd fought the fire yourself and now they were telling you to ring 000.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: That's 100 per cent correct. Hard to believe but that's exactly what happened.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Around midday the next day, on January 18, the fire suddenly changed direction and overran Wayne West's home. He and his family were ordered to leave.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The danger was too great?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: I think it was better to save lives than save a house, yes.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: That afternoon, the fires raced into Canberra on two major heads, covering the last 20 kilometres into Canberra's suburbs in an hour - with tragic results.</p><p>MAN AT CANBERRA FIRES: It was a hopeless cause because there was no warning, there was just total devastation within seconds, as you can see. Everything just went off like a bomb. You could hear the crackling and the rumbling and the flames coming toward us, and I just couldn't believe the speed at which they reached my place. That's how quickly it spread. It just came through here like it was being pushed by a cyclone.</p><p>WOMAN AT CANBERRA FIRES: Scary. Yep. Couldn't believe it. And it was already into the house. And the funny thing is, it sort of got into this house but it hasn't touched the trees. It's just that's how frightening it is, It must have come in from their back fence, yeah.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: Where we had a barbecue area... We had an outdoor sink outside that we used to do our dishes on. We had an outdoor table. We had river rocks underneath here for the pavement...</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The decision not to fight the McIntyre's Hut fire at the outset had proved catastrophic not just for Wayne West and his property, but for the city of Canberra as a whole. Wayne West's home was left a charred wreck.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: The loss of our house, we can accept that, but once we got into Canberra and found out the devastation and that four lives had been lost, I mean, that was hard to take.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Are you angry about what happened?</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: Probably very, very disappointed. To be at the fire on 8 January... and witness what happened and see what happened in Canberra, yes. Very, very. It's a hard pill to swallow that you do see something and see what happened at the end that was preventative as far as I could see.</p><p>HUGH PATERSON, VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER: I felt like, well, I lit the fire that burnt down Canberra. I was there with hundreds of other firefighters lighting back-burns and, you know, somewhere or other those fires grew to become the fires that swept into Canberra. And that's a gut feeling, I suppose. It's not a rational analysis of the history of the fire, but it is dramatic for me and it still weighs on my mind, as, I guess, a personal failure.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Wayne West is now suing the State of New South Wales, and the head of the Rural Fire Service, Phil Koperberg, for the loss of his property.</p><p>WAYNE WEST, WYORA STATION: And the only way we believe that the truth will be told is through legal action.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: We regret deeply that Wayne West lost property, as we regret profoundly that 500 families lost their property as a consequence of what happened once the fire got into the ACT under appalling conditions. In exactly the same way we regret profoundly when a rescue team is unsuccessful in extricating a patient before he or she dies, but that does not go to issues of competency or commitment or dedication.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: In the aftermath of the Canberra fires, a number of inquiries criticised the way the fires in the ACT were managed there. ACT Coroner Maria Doogan, who had no jurisdiction over New South Wales, said, \"The failure to aggressively attack the fires in the first few days after they ignited was one factor that led to the firestorm\".</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Do you accept now that it was a mistake not to tackle the McIntyre's Hut fire at the outset more aggressively?</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: If we had known on that day that notwithstanding the forecast of easterly winds thus presenting us with a problem to the west of the fire, it was all going to, in subsequent days, reverse, then would we have done things differently, most certainly.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: There are no winners in this debate about firefighting tactics the families whose relatives lost their lives, the homeowners who lost their homes, the firefighters who wish they'd been able to contain the fires - all are victims of what occurred in Canberra.</p><p>HUGH PATERSON, VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER: We need to put aside blame and anger and just look at the facts, look at the timeline, what happened, where and when, what were the weather conditions, what were the options, what options were considered, what options weren't, what could have been done different. Try and learn from it. I don't think anger and blame's going to get us anywhere.</p><p>MAN AT REVIEW: This fire was one of the biggest we've had in a number of years. The Rural Fire Service did a marvellous job, an excellent job. So why have we been standing here asking for an independent inquiry...</p><p>WOMAN AT REVIEW: It's not an inquiry, it's a review.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: But blame is still the chief currency in much of the debate surrounding fire management and land management.</p><p>WOMAN AT REVIEW: I have to say, that people are profoundly distressed at what has happened to the Blue Gum Forest.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The Blue Mountains outside Sydney, home to the Three Sisters and a magnificent Blue Gum Forest, is a World Heritage site of outstanding natural beauty. Fire can help a forest regenerate, but fires which are too frequent and intense can cause lasting damage. This year, tensions erupted between conservationists and firefighters over how fires in the iconic Grose Valley were managed. The fires in November were started by lightning strikes. It was the fourth time in 25 years that parts of the valley had been swept by fire. Wayne Brennan was part of a remote area firefighting team, or RAFT, which was sent in quickly to fight one of the two major fires. But he wasn't able to finish the job.</p><p>WAYNE BRENNAN, REMOTE AREA FIREFIGHTER, BLUE MOUNTAINS: We believed that we could've contained that fire. The RAFT team was actually taken off, or stood down, as the term is, simply because resources were needed for the new fire which really presented more danger to property and life. And that's the fact of the matter, property and life is important, I fully support that. But basically it meant that we lost our aircraft, the RAFT team, and we had to pull out and we weren't deployed the next day, which we thought was a little strange, and our fire was basically left to burn.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Back-burns were lit as part of a strategy to contain the fires.</p><p>HUGH PATERSON, BLUE MOUNTAINS CONSERVATION SOCIETY: Back-burning was carried out along the Darling Causeway from the area where the fire was burning, well to the north and well to the south, so that within 24 hours the back-burning extended nearly to Mount Victoria and nearly to Bell. The fire had already spotted into the Grose Valley quite early on.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Now, was there spotting from the back-burn itself?</p><p>HUGH PATERSON, BLUE MOUNTAINS CONSERVATION SOCIETY: There was later, yes.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: Invariably there will be spot fires on the wrong side of you, and that may well have occurred, but what we do know with relative certainty is that no back-burn failed to the point where it was the result of fire being in the Grose.</p><p>MAN AT REVIEW: The community would like an opportunity to comment, to be involved in that.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The allegation that the back-burn caused the fire to spread and the suggestion that the Blue Gum Forest was extensively damaged have been hotly debated locally, with councillors calling for a review of how the fire was managed.</p><p>WOMAN AT REVIEW: Well, it would be easy to remain silent and let others manage fire without a real scientific base. But our children and our conscience will never forgive us if they have to look out on the remains of the bush we couldn't stop burning.</p><p>FIREFIGHTER AT REVIEW: Shame! Shame on you!</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The damage in the Blue Gum Forest may not now be as bad as at first feared, but deep concern remains. Last month, this forum, convened by the Blue Mountains World Heritage Institute, brought conservationists, fire chiefs and members of the community together to talk about fire management and land management. But the arguments about whether the environment is being sufficiently protected, will continue.</p><p>WAYNE BRENNAN, REMOTE AREA FIREFIGHTER, BLUE MOUNTAINS: The natural and ecological systems of the Grose have been hammered over the past few decades. And I think that this comes down to fire intensity and frequency. Now, broad-scale burning might make you feel safe, but what effects does it have on biodiversity? What effects does it have on cultural heritage?</p><p>NIC GELLIE, FIRE MANAGEMENT OFFICER 1983-95, BLUE MOUNTAINS NATIONAL PARKS and WILDLIFE SERVICE: If you have a look at what happened, this fire here in the Blue Mountains, We didn't hear very much about World Heritage values, wilderness values, biodiversity and conservation values - it was all about life and property. And if you really cared about this landscape, we would've put out that fire much smaller and we would've also done our back-burning with far more care.</p><p>PHIL KOPERBERG, COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: I would suggest to you that the vast majority of firefighters, volunteers and salaried, care equally about the environment as they do anything else. And they take no pleasure in setting back-burns. And those heritage values would have been uppermost in their minds, but they would have been overridden by their concern for life and property. and as one correspondent from Blackheath said to us, \"This morning I looked out of my window and saw devastation, but then again I had a window to look out of.\"</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: A worrying glimpse of the future has been revealed this year in Victoria. Over one million hectares has gone up in flames. More than 50 properties have been lost, and the fires this season have taken 69 days to contain.</p><p>BRUCE ESPLIN, EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMISSIONER, VIC: There was one particular day with 273 fires in September, three days in October, over 600 fires, so the fire seasons now are starting earlier, they're lasting longer and they include a large number more extreme fire weather days.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Attacking and containing the fires is a huge operation which is run from the state's Emergency Coordination Centre in Melbourne.</p><p>EWAN WALLER, CHIEF FIRE OFFICER, VIC: This is the aircraft desk, which manages all the aircraft fighting fires through Victoria. The control of the centre is through the State Duty Officer. All functions come through there and he actually manages the floor. Talking to the CFA, talking to the police, whatever it may be, so the whole coordination comes through here, all through this one desk.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: This year, almost 20,000 career and volunteer firefighters and support staff have taken part in the effort to contain the fires. But despite the numbers, information updates in early December were reporting that resources were limited. A strategic overview warned: \"planning being developed for a month long campaign to do so may stretch resources to the limit\". The next day, an information update warned of \"limited resources\" for fighting fires in North-East Victoria's Ovens region.</p><p>BRUCE ESPLIN, EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMISSIONER, VIC: I think the resources were in place. That has to be seen in context that the fire chiefs were protecting the whole of Victoria. All of Victoria was judged to be an extreme bushfire risk and the planning that was undertaken was to make sure that the whole of the state had fire cover and that that fire cover could be maintained, not just for December, January, February but for September through to possibly even April.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: One of your own information updates from Monday December 4 said that 79 firefighters were on the fire ground that day to fight 14 fires under the control of the Ovens Control Centre, Was that enough? 79 firefighters to fight 14 fires. Was that enough, do you think?</p><p>EWAN WALLER, CHIEF FIRE OFFICER, VIC: Probably not. Don't know that, er... In first attack that may well be sufficient. If it's, say, during an extended fire then obviously we'd need more support. If those fires were 10 or 20 or 30 hectares, then obviously that would not be enough resources.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The task ahead was huge, and resources were stretched. Reinforcements were requested, and Canadians, Americans and New Zealanders were flown in to provide specialised help. The Canadians sent a remote area firefighting team from British Columbia, who are trained to get into remote country fast, and extinguish fires early, before they get out of control - doing the kind of work that didn't happen at McIntyre's hut. Is that the way of the future, do you think? Do you think there'll be more and more rapid response crews who'll be going out to stop fires quickly, as soon as they start?</p><p>BRUCE YOUNG, BRITISH COLUMBIA FIRE SERVICE, CANADA: Yeah, it's certainly one of the philosophies that we have in the BC Forest Services - hit hard, hit fast - and so when we dispatch or get a fire report, our philosophy is to throw a quick response at it.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: The Canadians also sent fire behaviour specialists - experts in predicting the behaviour of fire under different weather conditions. These are men who are used to being listened to.</p><p>BRUCE YOUNG, BRITISH COLUMBIA FIRE SERVICE, CANADA: In our way of doing business, there's no 'boss hog' in the system, it's just another level of information, but the Incident Management Team has to take time to hear that information before they develop the plan - otherwise they kind of look goofy, because once they do hear that they may have to change the whole plan.</p><p>MAN AT MEETING: We've had some issues I suppose in getting that level of expertise up, and having you guys here I think has helped demonstrate the value of having that level of expertise in-house, if you like.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Are you under-resourced in that area, do you think?</p><p>EWAN WALLER, CHIEF FIRE OFFICER, VIC: I think that when we analyse this season it will be one area where we will have to put more effort. Fire Behaviour Experts have proven their worth this year, particularly in predicting where fires will move to under weather conditions.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Kevin Tolhurst is a fire behaviour specialist and ecologist. This season he helped develop strategies to fight the fires and minimise their impact. Better than most, he knows why the battle to control bushfires has become so hard.</p><p>DR KEVIN TOLHURST, SENIOR LECTURER, FIRE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, MELBOURNE UNI: We're in our 11th year of drought, so it's really starting to be reflected now in the in the forest. And the amount of fuel that's available when a fire comes through is significantly greater than it would be in a normal year, because there's no moisture in the soil effectively to help moderate the moisture content in the litter. So we're in quite dire straits.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Kevin Tolhurst and many other fire managers and land managers believe that areas of forest have to be burned off, in a controlled, prescribed way, in order to reduce the fuel load. It brings into focus the dilemma faced by those who fight fires and those whose job it is to prevent them. To burn, or not to burn?</p><p>DR KEVIN TOLHURST, SENIOR LECTURER, FIRE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, MELBOURNE UNI: We need to be more serious about how we manage fire within those landscapes, and it's not by fire exclusion. We've been very successful in suppressing fires for the last 20 years or so, and that's been seen as a good thing, because fire is seen generally as a bad thing. But one of the consequences of that fire suppression is that we're building up the energy, the amount of fuels in the environments here, and the our forests and parks are becoming out of balance in a fire sense.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Victoria's firefighters have had some big victories this year, protecting lives and small communities. One significant success was protecting Melbourne's water catchment. On a high ridge overlooking the catchment, a long, wide fire break is in place to stop the flames encroaching on it. But fire breaks on their own won't stop big fires spreading.</p><p>DR KEVIN TOLHURST, SENIOR LECTURER, FIRE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, MELBOURNE UNI: I think the Thomson Catchment has been very lucky to date that so little of it got burnt. The amount of sediment and pollution in the Thomson I think will be relatively slight compared with what potentially could happen. But I think the catchments of Melbourne are still very much potentially vulnerable to the impact of fire that perhaps haven't occurred yet. I mean, there'll be lightning strikes in there yet that will cause fires to burn those.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: One problem for land managers and fire managers is that the practice of burning off forest and grassland fuel is unpopular with some green groups, and with residents of suburbs and towns affected by the smoke. In some States, levels of this prescribed burning have fallen. Last year in Victoria, it was hot and dry well into March, so there were fewer autumn days when the weather was suitable for prescribed burning. Victoria fell well short of its target - managing to burn just 50,000 out of a targeted 130,000 hectares. And it's not a simple exercise - where to burn, when, and how much is a difficult, specialised area.</p><p>PROFESSOR ROSS BRADSTOCK, DIRECTOR, CENTRE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL RISK MANAGEMENT OF BUSHFIRES, WOLLONGONG UNIVERSITY: It's about choosing the optimal mix of how often you treat landscapes, how much you treat landscapes, where you treat landscapes. It's about using or defining a prescribed burning scalpel, rather than sort of a...just some sort of generalised sledgehammer, or not doing anything at all.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: Is enough prescribed burning carried out nowadays?</p><p>DR PHIL CHENEY, HONORARY RESEARCH SCIENTIST, CSIRO: No, not in my opinion. Burning is simply the easiest and most effective way, and also the most ecologically desirable way to reduce that fuel load.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: When so little fuel reduction takes place before the fire season starts, the management of fires becomes reactive, and big back-burns are needed.</p><p>EWAN WALLER, CHIEF FIRE OFFICER, VIC: The main back-burn we did to protect Gippsland was well over 100,000 hectares so we burnt out that amount of country to protect... stop the fire from going south. That's abnormally large, they are not normally that large. But that means the size of the fire and the dramatic action we had to do to make sure we did get containment.</p><p>DR KEVIN TOLHURST, SENIOR LECTURER, FIRE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, MELBOURNE UNI: Normally that would be a massive fire in its own right. And the ecological consequences of that are huge and it's quite undesirable. And the need for it needs to be seriously looked at.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: In Victoria this season, two back-burns got out of control, causing considerable damage and anxiety. The first was at the Cresta Ski Lodge on Mount Buffalo. Firefighters believed the back-burn was under control, but it escaped after they left the scene unattended in order to change shifts.</p><p>BRUCE ESPLIN, EMERGENCY SERVICES COMMISSIONER, VIC: I would hope they will be looking at their procedures there. When I have the opportunity to look at the review of the ski lodge loss, I'd like to see that there'll be further changes that mean that shift changes occur at the fire line and that situations like that might be managed slightly differently in future.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: In January a second back-burn escaped. It spread tens of thousands of hectares further than it should have done - and at one point was threatening the town of Bruthen.</p><p>DR KEVIN TOLHURST, SENIOR LECTURER, FIRE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, MELBOURNE UNI: The area that escaped from the back burn, burnt down towards Bruthen and Tambo Crossing as well. It was a considerable area that was burnt or threatened beyond that, where that back burn was, yes.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: When land is burned intensively by nature or by humans, a price is paid. Badly burnt and damaged topsoil, and the removal of nutrients, means both plant and wildlife populations suffer.</p><p>DR KEVIN TOLHURST, SENIOR LECTURER, FIRE ECOLOGY AND MANAGEMENT, MELBOURNE UNI: What we've been seeing in some of the large fires that we've had in recent years, is that that sediment movement is massive. And we're talking about decades or even centuries for some of that to recover.</p><p>PROFESSOR DAVID LINDENMAYER, CENTRE FOR RESOURCE and ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, ANU: Most natural fires are very patchy, they leave a very patchy environment and that's critical to the recovery of biodiversity and the environment after fire. The big difference with the way back-burning and human fires is that they tend to be very uniform and that creates a very homogeneous environment which is not so good for many species to recover, or recover very quickly from.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: New ways will be needed in future to prevent and fight megafires. Australia is already the most flammable continent on earth. In future, it may burn even hotter. Some experts now are saying that, even without climate change, we are mismanaging fire, increasing our fuel loads, and increasing the danger of fire. So are we entering an age of uncontrollable megafires?</p><p>DR PHIL CHENEY, HONORARY RESEARCH SCIENTIST, CSIRO: If we keep going on the same paths as that we have been in the last five years, yes.</p><p>QUENTIN MCDERMOTT: And bushfire is not just an Australian problem. With changing weather patterns, it's a global threat.</p><p>JERRY WILLIAMS, MEGAFIRE SPECIALIST: The message I guess that we're seeing in the United States is that our past strategies, our past prioritisation, protocols, our past ways that we deal with fire aren't working as well today as they used to work and again it kind of comes back to that - what are the limits of suppression capability? Here's a country, the US, spending close to $2 billion a year and I'm just talking about the Federal fire services, 99 per cent successful, but the 1 per cent that's getting away in our parlance, is eating our lunch.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-8953390</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PHM-0YT1-JCM0-63VH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"03\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>March 27, 2007 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment:Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment/Forests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weather</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>National Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTc0NDhFM0ZBMTBFNEQ4QzlERUMxNEJFRENDMDU0OEM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

It was a loaded .22 pistol, the same kind of $20 gun Hinckley used to shoot her husband.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The potential disaster brought everything crashing in on her. \"I stormed about it for days and weeks,\" she says. \"And then back in Washington I picked up the paper and saw the Senate was getting ready to vote on the McClure-Volkmer bill.\"</p><p>McClure-Volkmer - introduced by Republican James A. McClure of Idaho and Democrat Harold L. Volkmer of Missouri - was strongly backed by the National Rifle Association, which had long pushed to neutralise the Gun Control Act of 1968. The 1968 act wasn't an especially tough piece of legislation to begin with. It built on the National Firearms Act of 1934 and the Federal Firearms Act of 1938, and, among the restrictions, prohibited gun dealers from selling to minors and the importing of non-sporting weapons.</p><p>Even so, it in effect allowed any adult who wanted a hunting rifle to go down to the local gun store and buy one. You could buy a pistol with nothing more than proof of residence and your oath that you were not crazy or a convicted felon. Few people checked to see if you were telling the truth. You could buy a machine gun if you paid $200 for a Federal tax stamp, underwent a background check by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and your local police chief didn't object.</p><p>But the Gun Control Act did require gun dealers to keep records of who bought firearms, in case the weapon they sold ended up being used to kill somebody. And it banned interstate and mail-order sales, like the one in which Lee Harvey Oswald bought, for $21.45, the 6.5-millimetre Mannlicher-Carcano he used to kill <person><nameText>John F. Kennedy </nameText></person>in 1963. But the 1968 act had long grated on the NRA and other proponents of easy access to firearms.</p><p>\"McClure-Volkmer would have annihilated the 68 Act,\" says Sarah Brady. She was not then, nor is she now, hysterical about guns. Her father, an agent for the FBI, wore a .38 to work. He and her brother and uncles all hunted for sport, and Sarah Brady sees no evil in it. Her husband's boss, Ronald Reagan, was a member of the NRA; so is George Bush.</p><p>But her son had pointed a loaded pistol at her and the emotionally disturbed man who had shot her husband had had no difficulty buying guns or the kind of exploding bullets called Devastators. The bullets that hit the President, a policeman and a Secret Service agent did not explode; the one that entered Jim Brady's brain did.</p><p>They got Brady to George Washington University Hospital within 10 minutes and managed to save his life, sawing open his skull all the way across the forehead and getting out the fragments and doing other things like lancing his left eyelid to keep</p><p>the pressure from blinding him in case he did survive, which few thought likely. But he did, and although he walked out, literally, on November 23, 1981, both he and his wife knew he was badly, permanently, hurt.</p><p>He could only walk a few steps at a time and the pain was horrible. He cried and screamed and sometimes he would blank out and howl like an animal. After a year or so, he tried to write his name and it would come out JIMMMMMMMM, or he would count and it would go 1,2,3,3,3333333.</p><p>\"But it was the summer that Scott got hold of the gun that really finished me,\" says Sarah Brady. \"And then the McClure-Volkmer bill. I thought, 'This is ridiculous.' And I called Handgun Control Inc. and I said, 'Can I do anything to help?'</p><p>Charles Orasin, president of Handgun Control - a citizens group based in Washington that lobbies, in its words, \"to keep handguns out of the wrong hands\" - signed up Sarah Brady to write letters to members of the Senate, in which she urged them to</p><p>turn back the worst excesses of McClure-Volkmer. She also spoke to a number of the Senators in person. And she wrote about the issue for national newspapers.</p><p>But in May 1986 the McClure-Volkmer bill became law. For the NRA, though, it was a Pyrrhic victory. The organisation had spent millions in its efforts to roll back the 1968 act, and the concessions it won were less than they had worked to get. Gun dealers could sell, over the counter, certain guns to out-of-staters, as long as the sale was legal in the state of the buyer and seller. Dealers could now sell ammunition by mail, but not firearms. And a last-minute addition to the bill banned the further manufacture of machine guns for private sale and made conversions of semi-automatic weapons to machine guns more difficult.</p><p>The day after the bill was approved by Congress, the entire 17-member public relations staff of the NRA was summarily dismissed. The gun lobby denies that the dismissals and passage of the watered-down bill were connected.</p><p>ALTHOUGH the image of James Brady, face down on the sidewalk outside the Washington Hilton, haunted the debate that his wife carried to Congress in the mid-1980s, he himself stayed out of it.</p><p>For one thing, he was still technically the White House press secretary and would be until Reagan left office in early 1989. It was Brady's duty to keep his mouth shut. \"Me and my boss really didn't see eye to eye on it,\" he says today. For another, it was Sarah Brady's cause, not his. On behalf of Handgun Control, she lobbied vigorously for legislation circumscribing the buying of firearms; he was concerned with the rights of the disabled.</p><p>Brady is unsure as to when he decided to break his silence on the issue of gun control.Certainly, having his name taken off the White House masthead in January 1989 had much to do with it. But once the decision was made he pursued the task with characteristic zeal. Despite his severe physical handicaps he travelled with his wife on about a dozen trips around the country pressing for gun control.</p><p>ON November 21, 1989, Jim Brady testified before a Senate judiciary subcommittee on behalf of Senate Bill 1236. The bill, which has been around since 1987 in various forms and was named after Jim and Sarah Brady, basically asks for a gun-purchase waiting period of seven days, during which time a background check of the purchaser can be made.</p><p>\"Are you going to continue to pander to the special-interest groups that whine about a little inconvenience and other such lamebrain foolishness?\" Jim Brady asked the subcommittee.</p><p>The first Handgun Control print advertisement featuring Jim Brady appeared early in 1990. \"Ever since I was shot,\" it said, \"I have watched from my wheelchair as the gun lobby blocked one sane handgun control bill after another. But I'm not just watching anymore. I'm calling on Congress to pass a commonsense law - the Brady Bill requiring a seven-day 'cooling off' period before the purchase of a handgun. So police have time to check if the buyer has a criminal record.\"</p><p>In the ad, Brady cited polls showing that 91 per cent of Americans - and 87 per cent of American handgun owners - support the bill, as does every major law-enforcement organisation in the country. In fact, he continued, \"it seems the only people against the Brady bill are psychopaths, criminals, drug dealers and the gun lobby\".</p><p>\"Can we beat the gun lobby?\" Brady then asked. His answer: \"Yes.\"</p><p>He was wrong. Last October the Brady bill was bottled up in the House and never reached the floor.</p><p>Undeterred, the Bradys said they would try again when the new Congress convened on January 3. Their overriding goal is passage of the Federal bill which is now due to be considered by Congress this month. Even with its passage - and Ronald Reagan's statement of support last week makes this look increasingly likely - the Bradys and other gun control advocates say there is much else to be done: educating people about handgun violence and safety, implementing efficient and through background checks, finding ways to curb traffic in handguns among private owners and making sure that gun laws, once in place, stay in place.</p><p>\"The gun lobby never gives up,\" Sarah Brady says. \"You get a good law and they do everything they can to undo it.\"</p><p>The Bradys lobby, speak, write letters, take part in radio and television commercials, monitor politicians' positions on gun issues, keep a close eye on the National Rifle Association and its allies in Congress. Late last year Sarah Brady stole a march on the NRA with her effective involvement in political campaigns. All of this, of course, is standard operating procedure for active members of public-interest pressure groups, but with a difference: the Bradys are living symbols of what can happen to lives if lawmakers refuse to listen.</p><p>DESPITE the paralysis that affects much of his body, and the fatigue and the terrible pain (and the phenobarbital that he takes to control seizures), Jim Brady is still the irrepressible fellow who was nearly dismissed from his job as Reagan's campaign press secretary. That was in 1980, when he was in a plane full of reporters shortly after <person><nameText>President Reagan </nameText></person>made his curious observation in Ohio that trees cause more pollution than cars and factories. Brady peered out the window, pointed out a forest fire and shouted: \"Killer trees | Killer trees |\"</p><p>He looks better in person than still photos, probably because of his good humour and vitality. But his right eye droops, there is that angry scar across his forehead and most days he cannot walk more than a few steps at a time. To watch him, hear him, get in or out of a car or in and out of his wheelchair is to comprehend only slightly what this man goes through. He moans and curses and stifles outright screams. \"Oh, oh, God, oh, god-damn, oh, ohhh, ohhHHHHHH.....\" He calls his physical therapists \"physical terrorists\".</p><p>Sarah Brady is relentlessly cheerful. When she is with her husband, she seems neither to lead nor to follow, although she is something of the senior partner by virtue of health and mobility. Rather, she is there. \"Gradually things shifted to where Sarah was basically in control,\" says Mollie Dickenson, who wrote a book about the Bradys, Thumbs Up, which is being turned into a Home Box Office movie starring Beau Bridges as Jim and Joan Allen as Sarah. \"Jim has adjusted to his limits.\"</p><p>The Bradys, in fact, have one of those rare partnerships in which each is finely tuned to the other. They are independent but they function like two people sawing wood. They do not always travel or appear together. He travels as vice-chairman of the National Organisation on Disability; as chairman of Handgun Control, she is often somewhere else supporting gun control legislation.</p><p>HANDGUN Control's advertisements point out that people in the United States seem to murder each other with stunning regularity (see table). Given the staggering number of guns out there the organisation concedes the certainty of some of them falling into the hands of criminals. \"But we do know that most guns used in crimes are new guns,\" Sarah Brady says, \"and we can do something about that.\"</p><p>Ask Jim Brady.</p><p>\"I'm not here to sell wheelchairs,\" he told a television reporter in Orlando who wanted to know what his motives were. \"If anything, I'm here to stop the growth of wheelchairs. I know how easy it is to blow somebody away with a piece. John Hinckley knows how easy it was for him to get his handguns. Could we have stopped him? I don't know. But I know we can stop many others. I don't want to go through this again.\"</p><p>THE battle waged by the Bradys and Handgun Control against the NRA for the hearts and minds of America's gun-owning public, and the public in general, is a classic David and Goliath struggle.</p><p>The National Rifle Association was founded in 1871 and has about three million members and an operating budget of $86 million. Pete Shields, a native of Delaware, helped found Handgun Control Inc in 1974 after his 23-year-old son was murdered with a handgun in California. His organisation has 250,000 active members (although it has the names of a million supporters - signers of petitions, contributors and others - in its computers) and an operating budget of $6.5 million.</p><p>Given its war chest and membership, the NRA has long vied with the American Medical Association as Washington's most powerful lobby. Its tactics are blunt and direct: reward friends and punish enemies. For years it perpetuated the misconception that the Founding Fathers decreed in the Constitution that the ordinary American has a \"right to keep and bear arms\". Thus, emblazoned across the face of the NRA's headquarters in Washington are the words \"The right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed\".</p><p>Those are, of course, the words of the Second Amendment to the Constitution. But they are artfully truncated. The Amendment says: \"A well-regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms shall not be infringed.\" The key words are \"a well-regulated Militia\".</p><p>If the words of the Amendment are not clear enough, the United States Supreme Court has, over the past 114 years, ruled at least three times that the Second Amendment has not the slightest thing to do with an individual's right to bear arms (\"or to arm bears, either,\" Jim Brady likes to say) but rather to the right of the States to raise an armed militia.</p><p>PRO-GUNS forces argue that gun controls don't really do any good. \"It is the very places that have the strictest gun laws that have the most crime,\"says James Jay Baker, chief lobbyist for the NRA's Institute for Legislative Action.</p><p>Baker cites places like New York and Washington, which have very strict gun laws and very high rates of violence. To bolster that claim, he points to the nation's capital as having the highest number of murders. This argument, however, ignores the fact that cities like Washington and New York are awash in illegal guns because it is a simple matter to go elsewhere to get them.</p><p>In one analysis, the Federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms found that 96 per cent of the guns used in crimes in New York City were purchased outside the city and almost exclusively outside the state. The same is true in Washington, where one can buy a gun just over the line in Virginia. Virginia, Florida and Georgia form the biggest source of illegal handguns in the East.</p><p>Increasingly, the public and legislators are confronted with the problem of easy access to guns in some states. In Georgia, in 1987, an Atlanta woman named Mozella Dansby, distraught at being passed over for a promotion at work, bought a gun and used it the next day to shoot two of her supervisors and then to kill herself. Atlanta has a gun-purchase waiting period, so the woman went to nearby Smyrna, which has no such law, to buy the gun.</p><p>There are other examples, and they occur frequently enough to cause more and more state legislatures to defy the once indomitable gun lobby to adopt waiting periods. In fact there is clear evidence that the power of the NRA may be waning.</p><p>Not only is there increased public awareness of the handgun problem, there has also been the defection of most major police groups, once staunch allies of the NRA. The role played by Sarah Brady and Handgun Control, and more recently by Jim Brady, has also clearly been a factor.</p><p>\"She has been very effective,\" concedes James Baker, the NRA lobbyist, \"but in large part because of her personal situation.\" John M. Snyder, chief lobbyist for the Citizens Committee for the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, conceding Sarah Brady's effectiveness, also maintains it is \"based on emotion\".</p><p>With her husband often at her side, Sarah Brady is increasingly successful at selling gun control at the state level. At the Federal level, however, after a promising beginning, there was considerable frustration last autumn as House Speaker Thomas S. Foley bottled up the Brady bill despite strong support for it. A bill to ban assault weapons did not come to a House vote after its surprise passage in the Senate.</p><p>Foley's publicly stated reason for not allowing the Brady bill to be considered as part of a pending crime bill was that time was critical and he did not want to bog the crime bill down with attachments and amendments, particularly when he felt the Brady bill was not likely to be acted on in the Senate. Nonetheless, he allowed an amendment, strongly supported by the NRA, from Jolene Unsoeld, his colleague from Washington State, also a Democrat.</p><p>While the crime bill banned the assembly of assault weapons of foreign design from imported or domestic parts, Unsoeld's amendment allowed assembly from domestic parts. The bill sailed through. The day after she introduced the amendment, Unsoeld got a campaign donation of $4,950 from the NRA's political action committee.</p><p>Unsoeld denied any deal with the NRA, as did Foley. But the public-interest group Common Cause found that of 49 representatives who received more than$10,000 each from the NRA over the past five years, 48 voted for the Unsoeld amendment, with Foley, who got $14,850, not voting.</p><p>Common Cause also found that the 257 House members who voted for the Unsoeld amendment received an average of $5,432 from the NRA's political action committee. That adds up to $1.4 million.</p><p>UNITED STATES POPULATION: 238 million</p><p>FIREARMS POPULATION: 200 million</p><p>FIREARMS MURDERS DURING 1988:</p><p>In the US: 8,915</p><p>In Britain: 7</p><p>In Sweden: 19</p><p>In Canada: 8</p><p>In Switzerland: 53</p><p>US CRIMES INVOLVING FIREARMS:</p><p>People killed: 25 per day</p><p>Children killed: (under 14 yrs) 1 per day</p><p>Rapes at gunpoint: 33 per day</p><p>Robberies at gunpoint: 575 per day</p><p>Assaults with a gun: 1,116 per day</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Drawing: by PAUL NEWMAN</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-4yhmxbcasf818p6w98yx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW1991</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5564-G1J1-JD34-V523-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2989\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1991 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Already hard pressed, the disciplined Roman ranks faltered and then broke. The famed eagle standards fell to igno-minious capture and its commander, the richest man in Rome and from whose name we derive the word \"crass\", was held down while his Parthian captors poured molten gold down his throat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Parthians, from what is now modern Iran, had acquired their secret weapon from the Chinese in exchange for an ostrich. It was silk, sewn into long banners, its smooth surface reflecting the sun. The battle of Carrhae in 53 BC was the West's introduction to the diaphanous textile that had been invented in China, probably 4,000 to 5,000 years ago. Within decades noble families of Rome were wearing it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We flew to Xian with Edmund Capon, director of the Art Gallery of NSW, and his wife Joanna. Both are well regarded scholars of Chinese Buddhism and its peregrination along the Silk Road from India.</p><p>Xian endured eleven Chinese dynasties as the nation's capital and was the eastern starting point of the network of ancient caravan tracks which the 19th century German geographer Baron von Richthoven named the Silk Road. It is perhaps best known in the West as the site of the terracotta warriors grandiosely entombed with Qin Shihuang, the first emperor of a united China.</p><p>But it deserves greater fame. Its archaeological treasures, which could rival Egypt's when fully explored, corroborate the story of a city under the Han dynasty as powerful in the East as Rome was in the West and as glorious under the Tang as Byzantium. This was where Chinese script and Sino Communism began.</p><p>A Chinese scholar there introduced us to the popular saying: \"If you wish to understand China in the last decade, go to the Shenzhen special economic zone; if you wish to understand China in the last century, go to Shanghai; but if you wish to understand China over the last 3,000 years, go to Xian.\"</p><p>Extraneous forces have isolated China. For centuries the ferocious Turkic tribes, known to them as the Shiong-nu and to us as the Huns, sealed its western frontiers. Further west lies the vast tectonic crunch that curbs passage into the plains of Central Asia and India. Alexander the Great reached Afghanistan but it appears that his geographical knowledge was stunted by the Pamir mountains, perceived historically as the \"Roof of the World\". East and West were fated to live in ignorance of each other. That was the case until a formal trade route arose to connect the two segments of the world.</p><p>In 138 BC, hearing that the Yueh chi, a Scythian tribe and traditional enemies of the Huns, had been driven west in a series of sanguinary battles and might be fostering revenge, the Han emperor Wu-ti dispatched a mission of a hundred men led by Zhang Qian to solicit an alliance.</p><p>After 13 years of perilous adventures the indomitable emissary returned - without the support of the Yueh chi, whose vengeance had drained away in their new land, but with tales of 36 fabulously rich kingdoms in the shadowy west. Best of all was intelligence of a heavenly breed of horse, more powerful than the Chinese species, which would run so hard that it sweated blood. Smelling military advantage, the emperor forwarded trade delegations to acquire the superior mounts, inaugurating a mercantile link that would internationalise the world.</p><p>For commerce to flourish peace must rule. Gradually the jingoistic Han armies subdued the fractious tribes and, despite periods of tumultuous dynastic decline, the Chinese secured the Silk Road region until Genghis Khan imposed his Pax Mongolica in the Middle Ages. Then the xenophobic Ming dynasty closed China off from the outside world, ringing down the curtain on the epic commercial drama.</p><p>The human drive to obtain what somebody else has can be expressed by theft, force or trade. While examples of the first two appear in its record, the Silk Road is arguably history's paramount case study of the latter method in pre-modern times. The earliest trade was in pigments, jade and religious articles. Later, from the East, appeared silk, furs, bronze weapons, rhubarb, porcelain from highly fired kaolin not produced in the West, and rag paper. The West exported textiles, rhinoceros horn, tortoise shells, ivory, metal, glassware and gold to finance its current account deficit.</p><p>It was a business of middlemen. Merchants would not complete the arduous journey of 14,000 km but would sell their goods at trading centres along the way. By the time the products reached their destination they had been marked up many times. In Rome, silk became so expensive that the Emperor Tiberius sought to ban its use as a plague on the economy, synchronously condemning it as an invitation to lasciviousness.</p><p>From the ancient portal of the Silk Road, now a bustling modernising city of close to four million upwardly mobile souls, we flew back in time to Kashgar, as far west as it is possible to travel before leaving China.</p><p>The old caravan town is the gathering point of the two main Silk Roads that passed north and south of the fearsome Taklamakan Desert, said to have devoured more lives than any other in the world (the name in Turkic means \"enter and never return\"). Marco Polo, who travelled there in the 13th century, reported on the spirit voices that lured countless travellers into the maw of the endless wastelands.</p><p>The Chinese section of the Silk Road stands chiefly in the autonomous province of Xinjiang, meaning \"new frontier\". Its population is predominantly Uighur, a Turkic people related to the ancient Huns who were indigenous to the region. The area, formerly called Chinese Turkistan, is the size of Alaska and is highly fertile when watered; but most of it receives only 10 mm of rainfall a year.</p><p>At the frontier airport we were met by our guide, a cheerful, plump Uighur woman. Guides are virtually the only English speakers in this remote land where Caucasians are still a curiosity. Our hotel was concrete-block basic but the local food was palatable - mutton spiced with cumin and chilli, laghman noodles and clean, fresh greens. And even though we were in a Muslim region, beer was commonly available.</p><p>Xinjiang is the cradle of the Turkic race. From it successive tribes fanned out to the north, to the Mongolian grasslands, and west, across Central Asia to eastern Europe. Attila the Hun could trace his ancestry to this part of the world, as can the inhabitants of Turkey today. The Mongols are closely related.</p><p>Kashgar is full of archetypal Turkic buildings: intricately carved wooden balconies overhang the street, leaning on finely chiselled posts.</p><p>The Sunday bazaar is reputedly the largest open-air market in the world. More than a hundred thousand people saunter through on the day, as they have done since the heyday of the Silk Road when Kashgar was called its pearl. We were time-warped back into the Middle Ages; only the outdoor television sets blaring out the din of action movies disclosed our generation. The donkey is the engine of choice - at rush hour donkey carts, not cars, jam the roads.</p><p>Products were grouped as in a sprawling department store. Sound and smell marked the boundaries, tinkers beating their pots and pans like Caribbean steel drums, slumped sacks of colourful spices perfuming the air. High-cheekboned men being shaved bald sat under red, yellow and navy umbrellas. Few women ventured into the main part of the market. A cluster of about 500, most of them dressed in the brown shawls of Islamic fundamentalism, loitered down by the muddy river chatting; none was engaged in commerce.</p><p>Cooked food - barbecued satay sticks and oven-baked bread - dominated the bazaar. Sheep heads bubbled in murky water. Suddenly a swarthy cook would pull one of them out and hack it in half with an axe. Eager customers in traditional garb would demolish steaming eyes, brains and cheeks. Large curved lumps of yellow meat - smoked sheep lungs - quivered as bite-sized chunks were sliced off.</p><p>A circle of men squatted around a contingent of fighting cocks for sale; the shoulders and thighs of the birds were pecked bare from participation in a sport which is banned in most parts of the world.</p><p>Xinjiang still lives with the charms of the past. In the small oasis of Toyuk on the Silk Road we were the first Europeans to have been seen since 1989. But life is changing for the indigenous Turkic people, who look to Central Asia for their roots, not to the Middle Kingdom that has incorporated them.</p><p>In local affairs Xinjiang retains autonomy, but in matters of national importance China has the say. Racial tension stalks the land that the Uighurs traditionally own. In 1990 local anger at birth control restrictions quickly turned into anti-Han demonstrations. Three years later in Kashgar, a fatal explosion in a building signalled frustration with Chinese dominance. The authorities clamped down fiercely and a reduction in civil liberties followed. Now, Peoples' Liberation Army stations bestride every large town.</p><p>Nevertheless, the races get along on a functional level and, in the absence of a specific grievance exploding in the presence of laxness by the authorities, there seems little danger of widespread rebellion. Economic growth, escorted by an abundance of food, is calming the savage breast.</p><p>Religion remains a problem for China in this region to which merchants travelling along the Silk Road brought Islam in the Middle Ages. Banned during the Cultural Revolution, attendance at mosques is now permitted. Ayatollah Khomeini visited Kashgar and prayed ostentatiously in the 15th century Aidka mosque, the largest in China.</p><p>Still, official policy disapproves. Children under 18 are denied religious education and only two madressas (religious schools) struggle to serve the needs of several million faithful. The people are not especially pious, being more aligned to Central Asian moderation than Iranian theocracy, but they are deeply attached to the social dictates of Islam.</p><p>Just outside Kashgar we stopped at the old British Consulate, Chini Bagh. The grand piece of Victoriana has faded with the glories of Empire, declining into an unkempt restaurant hugged by a few neglected rose bushes struggling with weeds.</p><p>Nearby, bales and crates were being packed in a courtyard and loaded onto trucks. In rudimentary English, the Pakistani boss told us he buys cheap Chinese sewing machine parts, dinner sets, calculators and clothing and hauls them from Kashgar in a four-day trek over the Karakorum mountains to Peshawar, where he keeps a shop. The products are different and the camels have gone, but the Silk Road still operates comme il faut.</p><p>From Kashgar we started our journey east along the Silk Road, north of the Taklamakan Desert, and within a few hundred metres of the Heavenly Mountains (called Tianshan in Chinese) stretching to Urumqi 1,500 km away. Glacial melt flows down from these celestial bodies to the desert, creating sporadic oases along the way. But since the last Ice Age, the capriciousness of the water courses, which mysteriously appear and disappear, has depopulated dozens of once-thriving cities and left them lost under a mask of sand. Archaeologists salivate over the thought of the ancient treasures that may be hidden out there.</p><p>On our left stood the endless wall of the Heavenly Mountains, with its red haematite layering, white salt patches and green chlorite intrusions splashed on the beige landscape like a giant abstract mural. Textural patterns alter as run-off intensifies, from wrinkles at the top to deeply etched drainage channels lower down the slopes.</p><p>It was hard to imagine water as one looked at the dry, brown camel thorn that littered the grey stony soil as far as the eye could see. Trucks half a kilometre apart thundered past our minibus in the 30 degree heat, their drivers struggling against lassitude on the straight, featureless road. Some of them succumbed: we saw the aftermath of horrific collisions - burnt out behemoths clutching each other in the ditch, twisted into macabre sculptures of death.</p><p>Willy-willies like puffs of smoke warned us that the baleful Taklamakan dust storms appear as suddenly as did the devastating hordes of Genghis Khan 800 years ago. We were caught in one, fortunately mild, in which visibility nevertheless plunged to snow blizzard level.</p><p>A few metres off the road lies the oasis valley of Kizil, where some of the most important Buddhist caves in Xinjiang slumber through the modern era. There the mountains begin to take on a surreal quality in the dust haze, flat-grey against a two-dimensional horizon, and jagged like ripped paper. Sometimes at their base, erosion patterns form the shape of Scythian caps.</p><p>The great religions of the ancient world were the main intellectual cargo of the Silk Road. Persian Manichaeism, Nestorian Christianity and Buddhism all travelled east to China. But Buddhism, founded in the 6th century BC and adopted by Emperor Ashoka of India as the State religion three centuries later, was the most influential.</p><p>Trade flowed over the Karakorum mountains both west and east from North India, but the Buddhist monks who travelled with the caravans found a market for their ideas only in the East. Perhaps it was because the prevailing thought structure there was Confucianism, which dealt with the appropriate moral structure of society rather than with a system of spiritual evolution. Even though Taoism explored a mystical connection with nature and ventured onto the metaphysical plane, essentially the spiritual field was left open. In the West it was occupied by Christianity and Islam.</p><p>In the 1st century the Han emperor Ming-ti converted to Buddhism following a vision of a flying apsara (Buddhist angel) in a dream, and established the Indian import as the official religion of China. Interest in the teachings of Prince Siddhartha, the original Buddha, erupted. Monks, missionaries and pilgrims flocked along the Silk Road, banding with the merchants in caravans for safety.</p><p>At oases along the way they carved small caves out of the friable loess rock, which they decorated with religious frescoes painted from local earth pigments. The monks used these caves as living quarters and devotional centres and the frescoes served as a teaching medium.</p><p>The caves at Kizil display some of the finest Buddhist art of the Mahayana style in Central Asia. They are 30 metres up a cliff face in a remote cul de sac. When the Muslim image defacers later rampaged along the Silk Road they missed the beautiful murals. However, many were not to survive the attentions of Albert von le Coq, the 19th century German archaeological adventurer who took camel loads of mural treasures back to Berlin on the pretext that they would be safer in a Western museum. Most were destroyed in World War II.</p><p>Others, too, tramped through the oasis towns and made off with the cultural treasures of the desert. The most famous was Sir Aurel Stein, who filched thousands of price-less Buddhist manuscripts from Dunhuang, bribing the simple monk who guarded the cache with a few pounds. He is considered the prime \"Foreign Devil\" by the Chinese for the work he did, ironically so revered in the West until recently. Contemporary sensitivities about the appropriation of national heritage have inhibited the museum community. At the British Museum, which houses the priceless relics, almost none of Stein's acquisitions are on display in the Central Asian collection.</p><p>The construction of the murals facilitated their removal. The artist would prepare the surface of the wall with a paste of camel dung, clay and chopped straw, over which he spread a stucco. Art plunderers merely had to cut the frescoes off in sizes that fitted camel packing cases.</p><p>The murals at Kizil, like the many others along the Silk Road, depict the mythological Buddhist tales known as the Jatarka stories. They tell of the various lives of Buddha who was reincarnated as a bear, a deer, a rabbit and other animals. The great disciple Sakyamuni, who stars on the cave walls, preached the principles of self sacrifice</p><p>through the myths. One that frequently appears is of the stag who lay across a river during a forest fire, acting as a bridge for escaping animals. Though injured by the trampling, the stag held on until the last animal, a crippled rabbit, crossed over. It then died of exhaustion. Each story takes five minutes to tell but is encapsulated in a 40 centimetre lozenge.</p><p>Every cave makes a particular artistic statement. A garuda eats a snake as he guards the Buddha sitting on the purifying lotus; Prince Siddhartha rides to heaven on his white horse; flying apsaras playing the lute depict the ethereal nature of the faith; mountains painted like closely held fingers reach to paradise; and Bodhisattvas - followers of Buddha who help others to attain salvation - pray for enlightenment.</p><p>The earliest paintings, dating from the 3rd century, were done in the Gandhara style, from what is now Afghanistan and the Peshawar valley. Influenced by Greek culture brought to that region by Alexander the Great, the style incorporates Hellenistic features. The vogue changed as Chinese ascendancy grew; the faces became more oriental. By the 7th century, blue and turquoise pigments announced the arrival of the efflorescent Tang dynasty.</p><p>Small figures at the bottom of many of the cave paintings, placed discreetly underneath the celestial beings, are reminders of the symbiosis of art and commerce. In exchange for donations, wealthy merchants were immortalised on the walls.</p><p>The scenery along the Silk Road is majestic, particularly the section leading to Kucha, one of the primary Buddhist centres in Xinjiang. The bumpy asphalt road cuts through the foothills of the Tienshan, which spread like waves on an angry sea, then debouch onto an immense grass plateau where a herd of near-to-extinction Bactrian camels was grazing. In the panoramic landscape a 1st century Han beacon tower still stands, its warning fire now extinguished.</p><p>Outside Kucha stands the 3rd century BC Jaoguli temple. The Chinese monk Xuan Zhang stayed there on his pilgrimage to India through 36 kingdoms, which he undertook in order to bring back an unadulterated version of the Buddhist sutras. His feat delivered an intellectual base that enriched the theologically skimpy folk tales that had marked the launch of the religion into China.</p><p>The Chinese language with its concrete structure does not easily accommodate the subtleties and abstractions of the Indian mind. Xuan Zhang's translations apparently came closest to the essence of the Buddhist revelations. They lit a conflagration of interest in Buddhism throughout China and are now preserved in the specially constructed Wild Goose pagoda in Xian.</p><p>Each oasis town along the Silk Road is famous for a fruit. The apricot denotes Kucha. Our guide led us to one of the lush orchards that girdle the built-up area. An elderly farmer assailed the branches of his apricot-laden trees, showering us with ripe fruit, then invited us to take tea. The inside of his cool mud-brick house was heaped with oasis produce - peaches, walnuts, miniature dates that tasted like citrus and more apricots.</p><p>The principal reason China took such pains to incorporate Xinjiang, fretting over the possibility that the Uighurs might go the independent way of their ex-Soviet brethren on the other side of the Pamirs, are the prodigious resources of iron ore, coal, gold, silver, antimony, copper and petroleum in the region. The oil discovered in the Taklamakan in 1987, estimated by Chinese geologists to consist of 74 billion barrels (three times the reserves of the US), augurs petroleum autarchy for China.</p><p>Xinjiang sits in the midst of titanic plate collisions between Eurasia and Indo-Africa. These have created some of the richest and most extensive mineral deposits in the world. It is an exploration geologist's dream.</p><p>We passed through Korla, the dormitory of the 50,000 oil exploration workers who have invaded the Tarim Depression, 800 km north-west of Lop Nor, the Chinese nuclear weapons testing site. Exxon, Total, Agip and other foreign companies have entered into joint ventures called \"risk investments\" that entitle them to explore and develop for five years.</p><p>Oil wealth at the crass level is beginning to seep into the Silk Road at Korla and no doubt will spread its cultural monotony throughout the region. We felt fortunate to have travelled there while it was still unspoiled.</p><p>From the high country we descended through the Empty Valley pass into a vast depression at the bottom of which lies Turpan, famous for its grapes. One hundred and fifty-four metres below sea level, it is the lowest town on earth. The heat in full summer - temperatures reach more than 50C - would surprise even Australians enured to the Pilbara at Marble Bar. It was 43C while we were there, the heat relieved somewhat by the grape vine arbours that covered the main road.</p><p>Since the Han times 2,000 years ago, the local people have obtained their water from a 5,000 square kilometre system of wells, called Karez, dug in rows and connected by underground channels. The water rolls down from the Tianshan Mountains and is reticulated out of the reach of the desiccating sun. No-one remembers who installed the system, but the most reliable opinion is that the Persians brought their technology east along the Silk Road.</p><p>The Turpan Basin is considered particularly salubrious and is famous for the longevity of its people, attributed by the locals to the near-zero humidity and a diet consisting primarily of raisins and dried apricots. Arthritis sufferers traditionally have trekked there for treatment. The affected parts of the body are buried in the burning sand and, if the patients can withstand the temperature, the pain disappears.</p><p>Just outside Turpan the ancient oasis city of Gaochang dozes in front of the Flaming Mountains, whose jagged structure leaps out of the desert like a monstrous fire. Deep vertical crevasses engraved into the reddish rock catch the sunlight, inspiring the local myth that it was formed out of the mortal struggle between the archetypal hero, Karahoja, and a fire-breathing dragon.</p><p>Gaochang, built of mud-brick and rammed earth and now slouching into the desert, was a centre of Buddhism, Nestorian Christianity and Manichaeism, a Persian offshoot of Zoroastrianism founded in 300 AD whose adherents fled east to escape persecution as heretics.</p><p>The ruins of a temple destroyed in the Cultural Revolution display the ancient arch structure known as the barrel vault. The locals still employ the style. Better preserved is the old fortress city of Jiaohe, whose weathered mud-brick buildings look like primeval sculptures placed at random on the burning plateau. Shapes and shadows rise up in solitude to an Australia-blue sky, silent messengers of the past.</p><p>The story of the ancient Silk Road is rich in evidence of the way ideas inevitably follow commerce. Besides religion, other ideas migrated along the venerable axis. The know-how to make silk, porcelain, gunpowder, the clock, the compass, printing and rag paper seeped into the West from China along the Silk Road, and much ventured the other way also. Glass, invented by the Romans, was prized more than gold in China.</p><p>Today we have new ways to convey ideas, and indeed all forms of information. But like the old Silk Road, they often involve a network of business dealings and are motivated by the desire to facilitate economic activity. We sensed part of that process, in its most romantic form, out there in the wilds of Xinjiang.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>NINETEEN ILLUS: Clockwise from below: Bootmaker in Kashgar - it takes about three days for a made-to-measure pair of boots to be handcrafted; dried chilli seeds add to the vibrant colours and aromas in the bazaar; coal, the main fuel used, is sold in large lumps.

Clockwise from below: Stocking vendor, Kashgar; the oasis plain at Kizil, below the Heavenly Mountains; the old British Consulate at Chini Bagh was the headquarters of imperial intrigue against the Russians in the Great Game, the 19th century contest for dominance in Central Asia; selling apricots in the bazaar, Kashgar. From left to right: Detail from a carved minaret in Abakh Khoja's mausoleum, Kashgar. Built in the 1600s, the complex is the best example of Muslim architecture in the region; Abakh Khoja's tomb, currently under restoration, is usually covered with multi-coloured tiles, and is reminiscent of the Central Asian style seen at the Taj Mahal; the Han beacon tower, made from mud bricks.

These, and unemployment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet, less than 18 months ago, Mr Edwards believed he had made it in the exciting and elite world of parachuting.</p><p>After experiencing the thrills of jumping, he had chosen a job as a maker of parachutes at the Sydney firm, Parachutes Australia.</p><p>He had been recommended by his previous employer, the National Safety Council of Australia (Vic Division), one of the biggest users of parachutes in Australia.</p><p>At weekends, he worked casually at the Wilton parachuting school in Sydney's west, one of the biggest in the southern hemisphere.</p><p>But last year, he fell foul of those who run Australian parachuting. He was sacked by Parachutes Australia (PA) and stripped of his qualifications until 1992 by the Australian Parachute Federation, the body authorised by aviation authorities to run the parachuting industry.</p><p>This effectively means Mr Edwards has no immediate prospects of parachute work.</p><p>His downfall can be traced to two parachute tragedies at Wilton.</p><p>On May 10 last year, Lorna Rowse, a student on her first jump, leapt from the plane. She froze, her parachute failed to open, and she fell to her death</p><p>MR Edwards began packing parachutes at Wilton the following weekend. To his surprise, his workmate in this skilled job was an unqualified 16-year-old.</p><p>Next, Mr Edwards spread a parachute and there, in his own handwriting, was the word \"UNSERVICEABLE\".</p><p>He had tested the parachute and discarded it as unsafe at his previous job at the Sale headquarters of the National Safety Council.</p><p>It was one of a batch of secondhand parachutes acquired by Mr Graeme Hill, the head of the Wilton Parachute School.</p><p>A powerful figure in the parachute world, Mr Hill is also a Parachute Federation official, has trained army parachutists around the world, and has worked as a consultant to the Safety Council.</p><p>Mr Edwards later told a NSW coroner that when he approached Mr Hill about the unserviceable parachutes, he was told: \"It's OK, all is fine,\" a conversation which Mr Hill could not recall at the inquest into the death of Lorna Rowse and another parachutist.</p><p>Not satisfied, Mr Edwards complained to Parachute Federation director of rigging Mr Dave Smith.</p><p>This was not difficult because Mr Smith was also his boss at Parachutes Australia. Mr Smith also works as a consultant to the Safety Council and aviation authorities.</p><p>According to Mr Edwards, Mr Smith said: \"Don't worry about it, we'll sort it out.\"</p><p>Mr Smith later told the coroner's court he did not regard this as a complaint to him as director of rigging and, in any case, regarded the parachutes as safe.</p><p>By chance, Mr Edwards did not work at Wilton the following weekend when more novices jumped. Among the parachutists were the Allison brothers and their friend Mick Hickey.</p><p>As that Sunday passed, Mr Maxwell Allison waited anxiously for his three sons and Hickey to jump. As he later told the coroner: \"I was concerned it was becoming too dark and unsafe.\"</p><p>He believed \"the training had been too rushed and the students were tired and anxious after a long day\".</p><p>His three sons were safely on the ground when a confident Mick Hickey jumped. The lines on his parachute twisted and it failed to open properly. Before his reserve parachute could open, he was dead on the ground.</p><p>Mr Edwards was appalled when he learned of Hickey's death. He was worried more students would die if nothing was done about safety at Wilton. When a Channel Seven news team approached him, he decided to talk.</p><p>Parachute instructor Mr Graham Carney, who had worked at Wilton, was also interviewed by Channel 7. Mr Carney later told the coroner: \"I was asked to get students out of the aircraft as quickly as possible and told not to debrief at all...\"</p><p>Mr Edwards was at work at PA when his comments were previewed on 2GB. Immediately afterwards, he was sacked. \"When I asked why I was being sacked they told me I may become an embarrassment to them,\" he said.</p><p>THAT night, his telephone rang every 15 minutes until 2am. Some times threats were made.</p><p>(This year, Dave Smith's son, Paul, signed an agreement promising not to harass John Edwards and his family.)</p><p>Mr Edwards' problems were just beginning. Soon afterwards, he and Mr Carney were charged with \"failing to act in the best interests of the Australian Parachutes Federation by making public statements harmful to the sport\".</p><p>Officials of the Parachute Federation, Mr Smith of Parachutes Australia, and Mr Hill, of Wilton Parachute School, were present throughout the Parachute hearing which voted to suspend the two men for three years after which the decision would be reviewed.</p><p>In practice, they could no longer work in the industry.</p><p>Police investigator Detective Phil Baldwin later subpoenaed a tape-recording of this \"trial\" for the coroner's court investigating the two deaths.</p><p>In his report, he described the proceedings as being conducted in a \"most immature and unprofessional fashion\".</p><p>To make matters even worse for Mr Carney and Mr Edwards, the Department of Aviation investigated their complaints about safety and found them baseless.</p><p>But coroner Maurice Hodgson reached a different conclusion. His main task was to investigate the cause of the deaths but he also examined other evidence about safety. The coroner was most impressed by Army Parachute School instructor Mr David Christie, who found \"the material reviewed left me with the impression that decisions on operating practices (at Wilton) were based as much on financial rewards as they are on safety considerations\".</p><p>Two former students gave evidence they had seen a hesitant novice pushed from the aircraft. Despite a denial from the instructor, Mr Christie said the allegations should be investigated.</p><p>Mr Hill told the coroner that the second-hand parachutes which had been acquired from the National Safety Council had been tested and fixed but did not know in what way.</p><p>The coroner found as Edwards had alleged: that students did jump close to last light; an unqualified parachutist packed for live jumps; and Safety Council parachutes marked \"unserviceable\" were purchased by Wilton.</p><p>In suggesting a public inquiry into parachute training, he recommended that no body with a vested interest in parachuting be involved. Detective Baldwin explicitly recommended the Parachute Federation not be involved.</p><p>Parachute Federation executive director Mr Harvey Ritchie, who worked for the Department of Aviation for 14 years, described an inquiry as a waste of public money.</p><p>\"We're a little bit upset about the final results of the coronial inquiry,\"he said. \"It implies the Federal Government department responsible for aviation safety doesn't know what it is doing.\"</p><p>The Federal Government has not yet decided whether to hold an inquiry.</p><p>NATIONAL Safety Council public relations manager Mr Bruce Savage agrees that the coroner's finding that the council supplied \"unserviceable\"parachutes is bad for the image of a body which boasts the most sophisticated safety services in the country.</p><p>The Victorian division of the Safety Council is part of an Australia-wide, loose federation of State Safety Councils.</p><p>While many people think it is a government body, it is in fact a private company. Set up in 1927 with a charter to promote safety standards, in the 1980s, it suddenly blossomed into a hi-tech sophisticated safety service with bases sprinkled around the continent. The Victorian division dwarfs all other state bodies.</p><p>Mr Savage says the council did not attend the inquest because it did not wish to get involved in a bunfight \"which it could not win\".</p><p>Instead, it relied on Parachute Federation and aviation authority findings that Edwards' allegations were unwarranted.</p><p>For the moment, the council is not selling the \"unserviceable\" parachutes.</p><p>This is not the first dispute between Mr Edwards and the council. Mr Edwards resigned from the council after management failed to resolve his complaints about other safety matters.</p><p>But despite the falling out, the council arranged for Mr Edwards to obtain a job at its parachute supplier, Parachutes Australia.</p><p>Some months after he moved to PA, an incident demonstrated to him the close relationship between PA and the council.</p><p>One morning PA boss Mr Dave Smith told him he would receive a cheque from the council. Mr Edwards was surprised because the council had paid everything they owed him, including about $1,500 moving expenses.</p><p>Later, Mr Smith gave him a cheque drawn on a Smith and Basworth account (a partnership account with his wife) for $6,594. When Mr Edwards asked what the cheque was for, he alleges Mr Smith said: \"To keep everything nice and quiet.</p><p>Mr Smith denies making this comment. According to him, the money was for removal expenses. He cannot remember why the council paid the money through his account.</p><p>BACK in 1987, Mr Smith had more on his mind than parachute safety.</p><p>The company already had military contacts. It had developed and sold parachutes to the Australian special forces, the Special Air Services (SAS), for invading hostile territory.</p><p>Now, PA was expanding beyond parachute manufacturing into the role of international middleman.</p><p>The plans were ambitious: a letter to the Fiji military forces offered 6,000 Assault rifles and 5,000 Beretta handguns; a letter from the Texas Air Corporation about Continental 727s which PA wanted for a client in Venezuela; requests from the company's South American agent who wanted aircraft parts and explosives for the Peruvian air force - all were processed through the PA's small factory.</p><p>An important partner in these daring proposals was Pedro Coluzzi, a private arms and aircraft dealer from Lima, Peru. He arrived at PA's invitation last September with a huge list of parts required for the Peruvian air force.</p><p>PA introduced him to the Federal Government's Department of Administrative Services.</p><p>Negotiations began for the sale of Canberra bomber spares to PA, who through Pedro Coluzzi's firm PCB would sell them to the Peruvian Air Force.</p><p>It was an expensive way of supplying the impoverished Peruvian Government with aircraft parts.</p><p>A spokesman for the Peruvian Ambassador in Australia said he would expect his Government to deal directly with the Australian Government. The embassy was not notified of Coluzzi's presence in Australia and, despite inquiries, has received no information about the deal from Peru.</p><p>Back in the United States, Mr Coluzzi faxed PA's then manager Mr Eddie Crowther: \"You already know on which bank the Air Attache has the P.A.F. (Peruvian Air Force) account.\"</p><p>He referred to a General Pizarro. \"This guy is on our side so we cannot miss this opportunity ... we're going to make a good profit on this but more in the future if we make it.\"</p><p>Before the deal was completed, a report appeared in the Times on Sunday about the PA's weapons offer to Fiji.</p><p>When approached by the Times on Sunday, Mr Smith admitted the company investigated the availability of weapons, but the deal had gone no further.</p><p>Neither Mr Smith nor Mr Crowther would name the company willing to supply the weapons.</p><p>After the Times on Sunday report, Mr Smith was concerned about its effect on his Peruvian deal. According to Administrative Services officer Mr Peter Thoet: \"Smith talked to us and said it was done by an employee of the firm without his knowledge. He went to great pains to deny involvement.\"</p><p>The Government accepted Mr Smith's word and, without investigation, completed the bomber spares deal with PA. Mr Thoet said he was satisfied the parts did reach Peru.</p><p>MR EDWARDS was sorry to leave the National Safety Council. For anyone with a sense of adventure, there could be no better place to work.</p><p>Among other things, the council fights fires, trains dogs to jump in parachutes, performs underwater rescues and provides safety services to Australian/US joint defence exercises.</p><p>There was plenty of opportunities to practise the expensive sport of parachuting.</p><p>Not long before Mr Edwards resigned, he spent a month in luxury at the Alice Springs Sheraton Hotel with Mr Friedrich and a team of council parachutists.</p><p>A plane, a bus, and an expert imported from the United States were transported to Central Australia. The reason for this exercise - not safety, but training of a parachute sports team.</p><p>All of this was his to enjoy, he believed, on one condition: \"Do what you're told and don't ask too many questions.\"</p><p>One thing he didn't ask questions about was the military-style parachute rigs he packed but never saw used at the council.</p><p>Most council parachutes were for safety work. They have suitably bright yellow canopies and rigs with reflectors.</p><p>But PA also manufactured HALO parachutes for the council. HALO parachutes are designed for high altitude, low-opening, secret landings. They have black rigs and oxygen masks.</p><p>Council executive officer Mr John Friedrich has no knowledge of these rigs, but past employees of PA remember packing the rigs for the council.</p><p>The purpose of these rigs is only one of the enigmas of the council. Another puzzle is - from where does its money come?</p><p>Its growth has been extraordinary. According to its own figures, in 1984, expenditure and income was $11 million.</p><p>In two years, it grew to $30 million. In another two years to 1988, it more than doubled both its expenditure and income to reach $69 million. All income is from fees for service.</p><p>In the past two years, its employees doubled from 200 to 400. A number of these are defence recruits who, according to Mr Savage, see the council as a\"convenient halfway house.\"</p><p>It has achieved all this while providing services which others cannot offer because they would make a loss.</p><p>In seven years, it has financed a fleet of 32 aircraft worth $40 million. This is less than half of the total equipment purchased or leased during this period.</p><p>While its services are used by fire, police and defence departments and some large private organisations like Esso and the Victorian State Electricity Commission, amounts paid by these bodies cannot explain its growth.</p><p>Some of its services, such as medicine for divers and its new overseas fire-fighting business actually make a loss.</p><p>The main growth, Mr Friedrich claims, comes from providing emergency services to confidential industrial clients.</p><p>According to a council chart, these industrial services raised 17 per cent of $30 million in 1986. When Mr Friedrich was asked to provide a figure for industrial services in 1988, he was not able to do so, but said it was a \"bit more\" than in 1986. The mystery continues.</p><p>Several years ago the council set up Safeair, a private company to handle its overseas operations, which include fire fighting in Canada, advising the Oman regime at the mouth of the Persian Gulf on underwater medicine and the Brunei armed forces on search and rescue.</p><p>IN theory, Safeair's annual accounts should be registered with the Victorian Corporate Affairs Commission but, according to a recent check, no accounts have been registered since 1985.</p><p>Not even the Tax Department has any detailed knowledge of the council's finances.</p><p>Under its charter, the council is a service for promoting safety. As a\"charitable or public educational\" organisation it has sales and income tax exemption.</p><p>It is its tax-free status which angers aviation rivals who compete for firefighting and search and rescue work.</p><p>One critic is SkyWest director Mr Bill Meake. \"I don't think their tax-free status was designed around the activities they now perform,\" he said. \"They were set up to promote community safety.</p><p>\"Take their air ambulance service. It's purely a commercial contract to perform a service for the government which any aviation tax-paying company could perform.</p><p>\"They provide services which the rest of the industry is not interested in because they are not viable. You can't have substantial sums caught up in aircraft standing idle unless you have guaranteed funding.\"</p><p>But the council denies it has any hidden backer. In response to such criticism, Mr Friedrich promised in 1986 to restrict the council to \"aviation services for emergency and public safety requirements\".</p><p>However, in 1987, Safeair agreed to takeover Mayne Bristow helicopters which provided a ferry service to the North West Shelf gas project.</p><p>When SkyWest's Mr Meake objected, council chairman Mr Max Eise explained the deal was \"for investment purposes\". Bristow pulled out of the deal.</p><p>As far as Mr Friedrich is now concerned the council's tax-free status places no limits on its activities. The possibilities are endless. He would like, for example, to turn the council's travel requirements to advantage by setting up a travel business.</p><p>Why not show the figures and end the speculation? \"That would only add to the speculation,\" answers Mr Friedrich.</p><p>Instead, council officers prefer humour. They introduce the subject of the CIA. \"We're not funded by the CIA, but by ASIO,\" quips Mr Savage.</p><p>Mr Friedrich, on the other hand, jokingly says he would love to be a CIA outfit because then \"no-one would expect to see his accounts\".</p><p>The CIA speculation is fuelled by the story of Intermountain, a fully-owned CIA airline which operated a forest fire-fighting service as a cover for training parachutists to drop into rough country in \"dirty wars\".</p><p>Gossip began when the Australian Federal Police invited the council to provide a helicopter service for demonstrations at the US base at Pine Gap.</p><p>Later there were complaints alleging helicopters had flown low over the camp and shone lights on tents.</p><p>With hindsight, council general manager Colin Gomm wishes they had not provided the Pine Gap service because of the CIA \"stigma\".</p><p>Another possible explanation for the council's good fortune is its links to the Australian defence forces.</p><p>The council is a beneficiary of defence privatisation moves. In recent years, it has been providing our forces with underwater rescue training and search and rescue services.</p><p>As Mr Savage puts it: \"The taxpayer can no longer afford these services. We are in the position to be able to provide them.\"</p><p>It will receive more than $900,000 for providing search and rescue facilities for the Australian and US Air Force exercise \"Operation Pitchblack\"and other exercises in the Darwin area this year. To earn this, it only had to compete in a restricted tender.</p><p>According to the Minister for Defence, Mr Kim Beazley, this was due \"to the short time frame to set them (the exercises) up.\"</p><p>Both Mr Savage and Mr Friedrich deny the council provides services to the SAS, but according to Mr Beazley it does provide the SAS with underwater training.</p><p>Mr Beazley, on the other hand, says the council has only provided the Navy with $7,350 worth of dunker (underwater rescue) training. The Sun-Herald has, however, seen documents which show the council also provides the Navy with medical services during diving exercises.</p><p>Officially, no arrangements guarantee these defence contracts. But behind the scenes the council is being encouraged to equip itself to fulfill the defence-related tasks.</p><p>The same documents show the Navy this year promised to buy $200,000 worth of services a year, if the council buys a \"submersible\" (underwater craft)which will be available during submarine exercises.</p><p>GOVERNMENT officials are well aware of the sensitivity of these defence relationships. In December 1986 council students on a survival course set fire to Deal Island, a Commonwealth reserve.</p><p>When most of the island's grassland was burnt, the media became interested</p><p>Reports to the then Minister for Transport, Peter Morris, noted concern by his department that journalists would \"try and embrace their (the council's)involvement with the Department of Defence, in particular the SAS\".</p><p>But however cosy the relationship, it does not explain the $69 million income. Official figures show the council will only receive $4,378,703 for its defence contracts from 1987 to 1989. Even allowing for omissions, the real figure cannot be much more.</p><p>The cash flow enigma remains. The only acknowledgement of possible difficulty comes from manager Mr Colin Gomm.</p><p>He agrees income only just exceeds annual expenditure. \"There is no financial safety net,\" he said. \"If users stop using our services, we go down the gurgler.\"</p><p>Should a body which is publicly unaccountable be encouraged to develop a monopoly in safety services for submarine, Air Force exercises and search and rescue?</p><p>What if there were no bushfires next season, or some of those private clients decided to go elsewhere for their industrial emergency services? How would the council fund those loss-making defence and other public safety activities?</p><p>As Mr Gomm says: \"If there is no money, it doesn't get done.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illus: JOHN EDWARDS: stumbled into an extraordinary series of events.
