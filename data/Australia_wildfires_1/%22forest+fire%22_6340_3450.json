What happens to the light rail? What happens to the airport?\" he said.</p><p>\"If places like that are inundated, then we've got problems.\"</p><p>He said while the council was \"doing a pretty good job\" of factoring inundation and flooding risks into its City Plan, the Gold Coast's projected population growth of 350,000 people by 2041 presented challenges.</p><p>\"We've got a South East Queensland Regional Plan that requires the councils in south-east Queensland to accommodate 80 per cent of that growth within the existing urban footprint,\" Professor Burton said.</p><p>\"Quite a bit of our existing footprint is in areas that are vulnerable.\"</p><p>Councils 'at the coalface' but bound by State and Federal Governments</p><p>Planning Institute of Australia urban planner Julie Brooks said while local governments were \"at the coalface of climate change\" they were bound by State and Federal policy directions.</p><p>\"The state planning policy certainly has direction and mapping for local governments to use, which talk about a range of natural hazards,\" she said.</p><p>\"Local government would then go through a process where they would refine that data and undertake a range of background studies.\"</p><p>But Ms Brooks said older developments presented a problem for councils planning to mitigate the risks of climate change.</p><p>\"Development that we thought was appropriate 50 years ago, we now have different knowledge that may indicate that it's not appropriate at this time,\" she said.</p><p>\"For new developments they certainly have a degree of control.\"</p><p>Ultimately, she said councils could only do so much to address climate change.</p><p>\"[It] affects our economy, our social structure, our settlement pattern, our environment,\" Ms Brooks said.</p><p>\"What's really important is that everybody is talking about it.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-TOPNWS11635132</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XBV-RMB1-DXX7-H28T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><timeReceived>7:30 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>October 26, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia:QLD:Mermaid Beach 4218</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment:Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government and Politics/Foreign Aid/Pollution, Disasters and Safety/Climate Change - Disasters</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Urban Development and Planning</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

And the core to that is that you break or bend rules.</p><p>\"Low-Earth orbit at this point is the Wild West. There are little to no regulations.\"</p><p>A number of private companies have made significant inroads to space exploration in recent years, most notably Elon Musk's SpaceX, which successfully launched a US military satellite into orbit last month.</p><p>However, Associate Professor Duffy said there were notable differences to their process than other start-ups.</p><p>\"For all of this idea of the company being unleashed, they were actually hand-in-hand with NASA,\" he said.</p><p>\"They were deploying NASA engineers and constantly working with NASA safety regulations.\"</p><p>Both the FCC and Associate Professor Duffy said it was vital to regulate private firms because of the real-life risks that unauthorised, or untrackable, satellites posed.</p><p>\"If you don't stop this this runaway cowboy-like behaviour now then someone's going to get hurt sooner or later,\" he said.</p><p>\"There is a reason that we have to manage communications ... if a satellite's taken out and the imagery that they were relying on for forest fire management, for example, is lost there are real consequences.</p><p>\"Just because there's not many people up there doesn't mean you can't hurt people

nitf:lede=\"true\">UPDATE 5.30pm: A total fire ban will be in place across central and western Victoria on Saturday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The ban will apply to the Northern Country, North Central and Central forecast districts, as well as the Mallee, Wimmera and South West.</p><p>UPDATE 1.20pm: Firefighters will be on standby and incident management teams will be based in Bendigo and Gisborne this weekend, with hot temperatures and windy conditions raising fire danger ratings.</p><p>Maximum temperatures will jump to the mid-30s across the region on Saturday as northerly winds arrive.</p><p>Temperatures will fall on Sunday, but the winds will remain.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria district manager Paul Bates advises anyone going camping this weekend to stay informed of weather and fire conditions, and remain observant.</p><p>\"We strongly urge the community to consider the value of visiting local forests or parks during periods of high and extreme heat as they can be extremely dangerous under these conditions,\" Mr Bates said.</p><p>\"Before heading out, make sure you plan ahead and have access to all the information you need.</p><p>\"People must be careful, especially when it comes to campfires as gusty winds will easily carry embers out of a campfire and into the bush.\"</p><p>EARLIER: The risk of fire is set to soar this weekend, with hot temperatures and wind forecast for an increasingly dry central Victoria.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology expects daytime temperatures in Bendigo will climb from 27 degrees on Friday to 34 degrees on Saturday, with similarly hot maximums expected in other parts of the region.</p><p>The fire danger rating for Saturday is severe for the Northern Country, which includes Bendigo and Echuca.</p><p>The Central district in the south of the region also has a severe fire danger rating, while in the North Central it is very high.</p><p>On Sunday, fire danger ratings will remain at severe and very high for the Northern Country and North Central districts respectively, while in the Central district it will fall to high.</p><p>But temperatures will drop back to the mid to high 20s across most of the region, with possible showers.</p><p>BOM senior meteorologist Richard Carlyon said on Wednesday afternoon that most of the state could expect gusty westerly winds during Sunday.</p><p>Central Victoria has seen no rain since the start of the month, a situation repeated across most of the state.</p><p>Mr Carlyon said there was the possibility of a band of showers behind Sunday's change, but northern parts of the state were \"not likely to see any significant rain at all\".</p><p>Bendigo last received rain on February 23, when 2.2 millimetres fell, and last month's rainfall was below average for most of the region.</p><p>The lack of rain has contributed to extreme vegetation dryness across most of the region and much of the state.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

It's a shared foreshore between DELWP and a foreshore committee.</p><p>\"That committee took about $10,000 at Christmas at $15 a night and that all goes back into the system. They've just installed $30,000 worth of facilities such as toilets, showers and basins, all with power.</p><p>\"Our argument is they have about 1500 people living in the vicinity and have this wonderful infrastructure, yet we have a population of 110,000 and don't have anything.</p><p>\"Why can't we have what someone else has got with a fraction of the population?\"</p><p>Mr Hammond attended a meeting with DELWP last week where he said he was told that what he did was \"not on\".</p><p>\"Basically I agreed not to do this again and they agreed they wouldn't take it further,\" he said of the meeting.</p><p>DELWP spokeswoman Anne Bell said the barbecue and attached searing were removed because they were an unauthorised structure on public land.</p><p>\"DELWP has met with the person who erected the structure to make sure our concerns were understood and accepted,\" Ms Bell said.</p><p>\"Permission had not been sought for its construction. The barbecue had hazardous sharp edges and was constructed too close to both the waterfront and to public toilets.</p><p>\"As manager of this section of public land, DELWP cannot accept liability in such circumstances for risks to the public.\"</p><p>Ms Bell said DELWP was reviewing the management plan for Lake Burrumbeet.</p><p>\"The provision of improved recreational facilities will be considered as part of this plan,\" she said.</p><p>She added compliance officers from Forest Fire Management Victoria, Victoria Police and the Victorian Fisheries Authority will run regular patrols at the Lake Burrumbeet camp ground during the long weekend.</p><p>\"We want all lake users to enjoy themselves, but not at the expense of others or the environment,\" she said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc6z5k8zami2al5elhfvt</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RT9-XWF1-F0J6-J3NS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"461\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Internet Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 7, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>City</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000855</classCode><className>HOLIDAYS &amp; OBSERVANCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DSJU</classCode><className>PUBLIC RESTROOMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001620</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION FACILITIES &amp; VENUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001462</classCode><className>REGULATORY COMPLIANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He hosted many visitors to his Maleer Red Poll Stud, including international visitors on Australian Cattle Industry tours.</p><p>He took on presidency of both federal and state councils of the Red Poll Society and devoted more than 45 years at committee level, recently acknowledged with life membership.</p><p>John had extensive involvement in farm industry organisations, serving on numerous State and regional committees of the South Australian Farmers Federation, and its predecessor, United Farmers Graziers.</p><p>He was a member of the body that set up the Jamestown Truck Wash Facility and was also part of a lobby group which successfully retained Jamestown Hospital's acute services in the 1980's.</p><p>John was also involved in the organics industry, after he and his son Chris achieved certification as organic and biodynamic farmers in 1991.</p><p>Sport was an important part of John's life. He played football, tennis, golf and table tennis and in more recent years played bowls.</p><p>John was involved with the Bundaleer Sport and Recreation Association from its formation as the Bundaleer Progress Association in 1962.</p><p>John helped with the volunteer cropping program which funded the establishment of tennis courts, a cricket oval and the Bundaleer Hall adjacent the Bundaleer Picnic Ground.</p><p>In the last 15 years, John and Veronica have been the contact for hundreds of visitors who have camped at the grounds and hired the facilities at Bundaleer.</p><p>John was also actively involved in the St James Catholic Church and was a great supporter of greater interaction between the churches, as a member of the interdenominational group.</p><p>John loved classical music and was extremely proud of his daughter Mary Jane's great talent for singing and was a regular at her gigs.</p><p>John was a major contributor to planning and managing all seven music and art festivals held in the Bundaleer Forest between 1999 and 2013 and he chaired the 2011 event. For John, the Bundaleer Festival was a way to showcase and share the beauty and special nature of that place that he loved so much.</p><p>Following the Bundaleer Forest fire, he was a key part of the community-led campaign to replant the forest, save the local timber industry and ensure Australia's first plantation forest remained accessible by locals and visitors. John was very proud to be part of the community's efforts to secure ownership and control of the sport and recreation grounds and co-management of the Bundaleer Forest Picnic Ground.</p><p>He was a highly social being and made sincere enduring friendships through every facet of his life.</p><p>John was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and he endured the rigorous treatment regime with his usual cheerful optimistic approach to life. With the loving care and attention of Veronica and family he was able to stay at home until just days before his passing.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NRTHAR-doc74y6igsp7oy1fk2kdnge</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NRTHAR2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VWX-BPH1-JD34-V3KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390616</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"685\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It will be dry, it will be hot &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;brvbar; and as we know in Victoria, all we need is those strong north-westerly winds and they're the days that bring the recipe together.\"</p><p>Mr Lapsley said the grasses in central Victoria had already dried out and farmers were already harvesting bumper crops, in contrast with last year when it was so dry that there was no hay to be cut.</p><p>\"It's a different season to last year. We've had one of the wettest winters on record and now we're moving into this period of prolific growth,\" he said.</p><p>\"They've got bumper crops so we're going to see bumper fuel available &amp;acirc;&amp;euro;&amp;brvbar; when that dries out, that's obviously the fuel. You won't get rid of it all, fire prevention work is about mitigating some of it but not all of it so there will be high level's of grass out there.\"</p><p>\"The Macedon Ranges will be really dry. In fact, they are already dry and have a lot of fuel in them.\"</p><p>Mr Lapsley said population growth in Bendigo and the city's close proximity to forested areas resulted in particular challenges for fire management in the region.</p><p>\"There's a bigger population, it's a growing population, we've got people living in the area that are more interfaced with the bush so you've got a bigger interface in Bendigo,\" he said.</p><p>\"Ten years ago Marong was just a little place, now it's got a number of new sub-divisions and some of them are small-acreage blocks, they're not just town blocks, so we've got a larger number of houses to protect.\"</p><p>Mr Lapsley said more people moving to rural areas like Marong, could be a double edged sword in terms of bushfire prevention, and encouraged those new to the area to seek out advice on how to prepare.</p><p>\"There are positives that you've got a large population which means hopefully you've got more hands to do the work in those interface areas, but are they able to do what's required?\" he said.</p><p>\"It might mean they've got to ask advice from others to help them do that or use livestock effectively to eat the grass down.\"</p><p>Another challenge for the upcoming season would be residents increased mobility in modern society, which added another dimension to bushfire planning, Mr Lapsley said.</p><p>\"We're more mobile, every community, so people in any one day will travel more probably today than what they did ten years ago, which means we're on the roads and we've got to be conscious that it's not just about my property, it's about where I'm going and what I'm doing,\" he said.</p><p>The picture is vastly different to last season, when 116 houses were lost in fires that raged through the sleepy coastal hamlets of Wye River and Separation Creek along the Great Ocean Road on Christmas Day.</p><p>\"I couldn't see that we will have major problems for any of the coastal areas for Christmas, unless we have a dramatic change in weather,\" Mr Lapsley said.</p><p>This season's first major fire - a grass fire at Swan Hill - occurred on November 21, more than a month after last year's first blaze.</p><p>Last year's first major bushfire was a planned backburn in the Cobaw State Forest at Lancefield that jumped containment lines on grand final day.</p><p>Mr Lapsley said all Victorians should prepare for the bushfire season as soon as possible.</p><p>\"Know where to get information, know what you're going to do with your pets, know what to do if you're travelling,\" he said.</p><p>Heavy spring rain has pushed Forest Fire Management Victoria's planned burns program out towards the start of the fire danger period, with the final burn scheduled for Golden Square this afternoon.</p><p>But FFMV senior forest fire management officer Simon Brown said the delay would not have a \"huge impact\" on fuel loads in and around Bendigo.</p><p>\"It's just more around the timing, normally by mid-November our planned burning program is normally sort of complete and this year obviously with the spring rainfalls that we've had it's pushed it out later into the season,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Brown said while the burning off program had reached its end, there were other means of reducing fuel loads going into the fire season.</p><p>\"We've had huge fuel management programs [in place], in slashing programs and mechanical works,\" he said. \"So although this will be our last planned burn as such, we'll be continuing slashing and other fuel reduction works.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

hazard reduction burns in up to 20,000 hectares of State forest near Batemans Bay, Narooma, Bega, Eden and Nowra to protect against wildfires.</p><p>\"Fire season has recently wrapped up for another year, which means it's time to start preparing for next summer,\" Mr Armstrong said.</p><p>The coastal strip between Nowra and the Victorian border is one of the most fire-prone regions of Australia and managing fuel levels by completing hazard reduction burns is critical to our capacity to manage wildfires over summer.</p><p>\"There's a narrow window of opportunity to safely complete hazard reduction burns, when it's not too hot or damp and the wind conditions limit the impact of smoke on neighbours, so we will be taking advantage of favourable conditions over the coming months to reduce fuel in local forests.</p><p>\"We will also be burning recently harvested areas to remove flammable material such as leaves and small limbs and create a rich seed bed that promotes forest regrowth.\"</p><p>\"While Forestry Corporation fire fighters will carefully monitor all controlled burns to ensure they stay within containment lines, we do ask people to pay attention to any signs in the forest or instructions from staff and stay away from any burning or recently burnt areas for their own safety.\"</p><p>\"Forest fire fighters play an important role fighting fires in the region's State forests, but fire prevention is a fundamental part of our role and is a vital way to mitigate the threat of a bad fire season in future years.</p><p>\"Over the winter months we will also be investing in training firefighting staff, maintaining and upgrading equipment, improving key forest roads for rapid access and maintaining fire towers to aid rapid fire detection and quick response next fire season.\"</p><p>Forestry Corporation is responsible for more than 2.2 million hectares of native and planted forests and has been formally involved in fire-fighting in NSW for 100 years.</p><p>Hazard reduction burns will be listed on the Rural Fire Service's Fires Near Me website and app. For more information about hazard reduction burns, contact the Forestry Corporation Batemans Bay Office on 1300 880 548.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

For this bit of futurology, I described a Sydney in 2050 where the air is full of smoke: \"Right now all parks around Sydney are up in flames. There is a new fire regime. They blaze all year ... Outside, the howling winds seem to pick up, blowing the burnt matter from the Blue Mountains.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My idea was that this was 30 years off. Instead, Sydney is now experiencing air pollution that would have disposed of Sydney's Olympic bid.</p><p>How could we have asked athletes to heave in lungfuls of particulate pollution when merely walking in a park is a health risk? We would have been running harder than Cathy Freeman to persuade the International Olympic Committee that while we now suffer savage fires in November, we should be safe in September.</p><p>The CSIRO first warned in 1988 that, with the climate changing, we would see a worsening fire danger in grasslands and forests. Since then, it has revisited the subject on multiple occasions. In 2005, its scientists predicted that by 2020 the number of days when forest fire danger was very high to extreme would rise by up to 25 per cent - which is where we've arrived- and up to 70 per cent by 2050.</p><p>The idea that the climate shift is speeding up was captured in an authoritative November 27 article in Nature. It warns we are in danger of shooting beyond tipping points in the earth system. It had been thought that these \"large-scale discontinuities\" would be triggered if warming exceeded 5 degrees but in the past two years, there is evidence the tipping points could be exceeded with only 1-2 degrees.</p><p>These tipping points include frequent droughts in the Amazon, reduction in Arctic sea ice, the accelerating loss of Greenland ice and permafrost thawing.</p><p>Scientists are struggling with the last. How fast is the permafrost breaking up? How fatal are the gas releases?</p><p>As a rule, scientists have erred on the side of caution. If the CSIRO had tipped fire seasons so unkind that Sydney's air would be as polluted as Jakarta's and a jog along Bondi was a health risk, the climate deniers would have shrieked \"Alarmist!\"</p><p>Are the deniers absorbing the evidence - even as they read last week in The Australian Financial Review that medical experts believe Sydney's Third World air pollution poses a cardiac risk? Neither the Institute of Public Affairs nor the Centre for Independent Studies has sponsored a conference or report on climate in memory, not even exploring market-based solutions. Are the conservative think tanks ready at last to treat the thing as real?</p><p>I recall arguments on climate with the late right-wing columnist Paddy McGuinness. It was not over data or research, about brittle coral or fire frequency. The thing most distasteful for him, as I think for John Howard or Tony Abbott, was that it was being championed by people on the left.</p><p>\"All I know was that Al Gore was for it so I had to be against it,\" said Bob Inglis, a former Republican congressman, capturing this sentiment. He changed his view after seeing Antarctica and today leads the US \"eco-right\". His quote exposed the tribal prejudice, the cultural orthodoxy, behind climate denialism.</p><p>But with smoke in the air, it's time for conservatives to stop dilating on the bogey of the Australian Greens party or university Marxists. Heightened concern over climate is coming not from revolutionary sects but from scientists who study coral bleaching or methane leaking from exposed Arctic soils.</p><p>None of the nature conservationists I got to know when I was NSW planning and environment minister in the 1980s had an anti-capitalist agenda. People like Milo Dunphy enjoyed an intimate feel for wild Australia and wanted to save as much as possible before it was too late. Their campaigns sprang from the smell of the eucalypts, the melody of wild flowing rivers or the north coast rainforests.</p><p>Scott Morrison has promised a statement on climate next year. He has an opportunity to commit to a transmission system so resilient that it will allow cost-competitive energy to surge from distant wind farms and thousands of rooftops to any consumer who wants to be green; plus, storing this renewable energy so it's not there only when the wind blows and the sun shines.</p><p>Dismissing sceptics and deniers in his own ranks, he could say what most of us believe: the evidence is in.</p><p>\"Even if it weren't,\" he could add, \"this fire season suggests we ought to assume the worst, and take out insurance, specifically by exceeding the Paris targets we've signed on to.\"</p><p>He could even announce it before Christmas, while eyes and throats are still stinging.</p><p>Bob Carr is a former foreign minister and NSW premier. He is professor of climate and business at UTS.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc78baxbclx49k9thhd91</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP6-0G51-JD34-V1PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Aboriginal burning practices were first reintroduced to the Victorian landscape this year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The first burns, conducted at Whipstick and Maryborough in May, marked a significant milestone in the recognition of Aboriginal heritage in Victoria, and a change in an approach to land management.</p><p>On Wednesday, elders and younger members of the Dja Dja Wurrung community conducted a ceremony at the site of the Whipstick burn in acknowledgement of its significance.</p><p>The site has now been named Djandak Wi, which means 'fire country' in the language of the Dja Dja Wurrung people.</p><p>The reintroduction of traditional burning practices is the result of an ongoing partnership between the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation and Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>Uncle Tom Baksh, one of the elders who attended Wednesday's ceremony, said it was pleasing to see younger members of the Aboriginal community take up the lead with such initiatives and form fruitful partnerships.</p><p>He said it was also good to see these people combine their contemporary knowledge with traditional knowledge.</p><p>Uncle Gary Nelson said it was important for the Aboriginal community to make connections with the broader community.</p><p>He said things were improving for Aboriginal people after the hardships that had followed the arrival of Europeans, and the traditional burns stood for everything the Aboriginal community had been fighting for.</p><p>\"It's a matter of working together... for the [good] outcome of everyone,\" he said.</p><p>Victorian Environment Minister Lily D'Ambrosio also attended the ceremony and said the government wanted to ensure such partnerships were aligned with the aspirations of the Aboriginal community and made some sort of reparation for past wrongs.</p><p>Ms D'Ambrosio told the Bendigo Advertiser that the absence of Aboriginal burning practices from this land for 170-odd years represented a missed opportunity to employ thousands of years of knowledge.</p><p>Fire Forest Management Victoria assistant chief fire officer Scott Falconer said the initiative was about \"walking together\", referencing a quote from Pastor Doug Nicholls, a Yorta Yorta man.</p><p>Local elders were responsible for inspecting and approving suitable sites ahead of the burns, but Wednesday's occasion was the first time they had returned to the site since then.</p><p>Following European settlement, the use of traditional burns in land management in Victoria dwindled and for decades, such practices were only undertaken for ceremonial reasons.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Prime Minister, do something.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Three years ago I was shaping a chapter on climate for my political memoir. For this bit of futurology, I described a Sydney in 2050 where the air is full of smoke: \"Right now all parks around Sydney are up in flames. There is a new fire regime. They blaze all year ... Outside, the howling winds seem to pick up, blowing the burnt matter from the Blue Mountains.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My idea was that this was 30 years off. Instead, Sydney is now experiencing air pollution that would have disposed of Sydney's Olympic bid.</p><p>How could we have asked athletes to heave in lungfuls of particulate pollution when merely walking in a park is a health risk? We would have been running harder than Cathy Freeman to persuade the IOC that while we now suffer savage fires in November, we should be safe in September.</p><p>The CSIRO first warned in 1988 that, with the climate changing, we would see a worsening fire danger in grasslands and forests. Since then, it has revisited the subject on multiple occasions. In 2005, its scientists predicted that by 2020 the number of days when forest fire danger was very high to extreme would rise by up to 25 per cent - which is where we've arrived- and up to 70 per cent by 2050.</p><p>The idea that the climate shift is speeding up was captured in an authoritative November 27 article in Nature. It warns we are in danger of shooting beyond tipping points in the earth system. It had been thought that these \"large-scale discontinuities\" would be triggered if warming exceeded 5 degrees but in the past two years, there is evidence the tipping points could be exceeded with only 1 or 2 degrees.</p><p>These tipping points include frequent droughts in the Amazon, reduction in Arctic sea ice, the accelerating loss of Greenland ice and the thawing of permafrost.</p><p>Scientists are struggling with the last. How fast is the permafrost breaking up? How fatal are the gas releases?</p><p>As a rule, scientists have erred on the side of caution. If the CSIRO had tipped fire seasons so unkind that Sydney's air would be as polluted as Jakarta's and a jog along Bondi was a health risk, the climate deniers would have shrieked \"Alarmist!\"</p><p>Are the deniers absorbing the evidence - even as they read last week in The Australian Financial Review that medical experts believe Sydney's Third World air pollution poses a cardiac risk? Neither the Institute of Public Affairs nor the Centre for Independent Studies has sponsored a conference or commissioned a report on climate in memory, not even exploring market-based solutions. Are the conservative think tanks ready at last to treat the thing as real?</p><p>I recall arguments on climate with the late right-wing columnist Paddy McGuinness. It was not over data or research, about brittle coral or fire frequency. The thing most distasteful about this climate talk for him, as I think for John Howard or Tony Abbott, was that it was being championed by people on the left.</p><p>\"All I know was that Al Gore was for it so I had to be against it,\" said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/bob-inglis-republican-believer-climate-change-out-convert-his-party-n912066\">Bob Inglis</url>, a former Republican Congressman, capturing this sentiment. He changed his view after seeing Antarctica and today leads the US \"eco-right\". His quote exposed the tribal prejudice, the cultural orthodoxy, behind climate denialism.</p><p>But with smoke in the air, it's time for conservatives to stop dilating on the bogey of the Australian Greens party or university Marxists. Heightened concern over climate is coming not from revolutionary sects but from scientists who study coral bleaching or methane leaking from exposed Arctic soils.</p><p>None of the nature conservationists I got to know when I was NSW planning and environment minister in the 1980s had an anti-capitalist agenda. People like Milo Dunphy enjoyed an intimate feel for wild Australia and wanted to save as much as possible before it was too late. Their campaigns sprang from the smell of the eucalypts, the melody of wild flowing rivers like the Kowmung or the majesty of the Colong Plateau or the north coast rainforests.</p><p>Scott Morrison has promised a statement on climate next year. He has an opportunity to commit to a transmission system so resilient that it will allow cost-competitive energy to surge from distant wind farms and thousands of rooftops to any consumer who wants to be green; plus, storing this renewable energy so it's not there only when the wind blows and the sun shines.</p><p>Dismissing sceptics and deniers in his own ranks, he could say what most of us believe: the evidence is in.</p><p>\"Even if it weren't,\" he could add, \"this fire season suggests we ought to assume the worst, and take out insurance, specifically by exceeding the Paris targets we've signed on to.\"</p><p>He could even announce it before Christmas, while eyes and throats are still stinging.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bob Carr is a former foreign minister and NSW premier. He is professor of Climate and Business at UTS.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520215606</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XP6-0WS1-JBJ7-N18Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"800\"/><timeReceived>00:10 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Stay safe everyone,\" Maarama Kamira said on Facebook.</p><p>\"Regardless where it's from it feels unsettling,\" another Facebook commenter, Lauren Irvine, said.</p><p>But the advice from authorities was to keep calm, urging only people who see fire, and not smoke, to call in.</p><p>\"I think it's a combination of concern from our community and also the fact that we've asked our community to remain vigilant throughout this fire season,\" ESA Commissioner Georgeina Whelan said.</p><p>\"We're saying to our community they should not be alarmed - at this stage our territory is not under threat.\"</p><p>'Quite surreal': Farmers prepare to evacuate</p><p>Rural Fire Service district officer Darren Marks said this morning the fire was \"fairly benign\" and conditions had eased off for the time being.</p><p>But some properties outside Bungendore and Braidwood have prepared to evacuate as the fire burns close to boundaries.</p><p>\"Those two fires are quite close together and given the forecast there is a good chance the two of those will merge,\" Mr Marks said.</p><p>\"In these conditions the existing fires are going to be very hard to control and anybody who is in the area, particularly in Bombay, Little Bombay and Bendoura should be prepared.</p><p>\"I think it's fair to say that the bushfire danger season has well and truly appeared down in the local area.\"</p><p>Farmer Ellie Merriman, who lives about 10km outside Bungendore on the edge of the Tallaganda Forest, said she had been watching the fire burn on the other side of her boundary for days.</p><p>They had moved their livestock and were prepared to evacuate if the wind changed later in the day, she told the ABC.</p><p>\"For the first time ever, I don't want the cool change to come through,\" she said.</p><p>\"We're physically right next door to it, so where our property is it's just a hop and a skip away.</p><p>\"Weirdly, it looks quite beautiful.\"</p><p>She urged anyone in a bushfire prone area to get ready early and know their emergency evacuation plan.</p><p>\"We're organised, we've got our fire plan, we've tested all our plans ... we feel as prepared as we can be,\" she said.</p><p>\"It just takes you so much longer that you think, moving horses, getting stuff together.\"</p><p>The family is now sleeping away from the property and returning during the day to monitor the situation.</p><p>\"It's quite strange, very surreal, because we've been going through it for the past three days,\" she said.</p><p>'Don't go for a run': Smoke poses risk to chronically ill</p><p>Those with chronic conditions have been told to stay indoors and avoid any strenuous activities as the smoke lies across the Canberra region.</p><p>ACT Chief Health Officer Kerryn Coleman said a reduction in air quality had been registered and posed a risk to people with heart and lung conditions.</p><p>\"We don't expect the majority of the community to have impacts, but those with chronic and existing heart and lung conditions may experience an exacerbation of their symptoms,\" she said.</p><p>\"Some pregnant women may also be susceptible.</p><p>\"We recommend these people limit their outdoor activities ... don't go for a run, don't do boot camp this morning.\"</p><p>Anyone who experiences a change in their symptoms should contact their GP or triple-0 if they are concerned about their health, she said.</p><p>\"But we hope and don't expect to have a big jump in our numbers coming through.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

nitf:lede=\"true\">The Environment Department is encouraging central Victorian residents to share their local knowledge and become involved in the fire operations plan for the Murray Goldfields fire district through two 'open houses'.</p><p>Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning Murray Goldfields district manager Paul Bates said he was keen to hear community members' views on fire management.</p><p>'I would encourage the community to come and speak to our forest fire management staff at one of two open houses to discuss the plans, which outline the frequency and location of planned burns, and the three year schedule of burns and mulching, slashing and grooming activities planned for Central Victoria,' he said.</p><p>'By engaging our communities, utilising their local knowledge and combining it with Phoenix Rapidfire technology, the simulation software we use to predict the spread and intensity of bushfires, we can be more strategic in our planning.</p><p>'This will ensure our fuel reduction activities occur in areas which will most effectively reduce the impacts of bushfire on human life and property.'</p><p>Mr Bates said once the department determined the location of a planned burn, it was added to the draft fire operations plan which was open for community comment.</p><p>'The plan lists all fuel reduction activities, including burning, slashing, grooming, mulching and fuel breaks that will take place over the next three years,' he said.</p><p>'Reducing bushfire fuel means fires are less intense, making it more likely that firefighters can contain them before they impact on people, property and the environment.'</p><p>The first open house is on Tuesday, May 24 at the Bendigo Town Hall between 2pm and 7pm and features a presentation on box ironbark landscape mosaic burning.</p><p>The second open house will be at the Ray Bradfield Room in Frederick Street, Castlemaine between 2pm and 7pm on Wednesday, June 1.</p><p>The plan can be

The fire started on Saturday night on Spain's southern coast, then advanced east to reach the Donana Nature Reserve, one of the country's most important wildlife sanctuaries and a UNESCO World Heritage site since 1994. The reserve protects over 107,000ha considered of extreme ecological value for their mix of ecosystems, including wetlands, dunes and woods.</p><p>2 Explosion toll rises LAHORE: The death toll from a tanker explosion in Pakistan has climbed to at least 153. Dozens more are in a critical condition, hospital and rescue officials said. The tragedy on Sunday was sparked by an announcement over a mosque's loudspeaker that an overturned tanker truck had sprung a leak. Scores of villagers then raced to the scene with fuel containers to gather the oil. Then the wreck exploded, engulfing people in flames as they screamed in terror.</p><p>3 Pharmacy boss guilty BOSTON: The co-founder of a Massachusetts compounding pharmacy is set to be sentenced in a deadly nationwide meningitis outbreak that killed more than 60 people and sickened hundreds more. Barry Cadden was acquitted of second-degree murder charges under federal racketeering law, but convicted on conspiracy and fraud charges. Sentencing is scheduled for Monday in federal court in Boston.</p><p>Cadden was charged in connection with a 2012 fungal meningitis outbreak that was traced to contaminated injections of medical steroids made by the New England Compounding Centre in Framingham. Prosecutors say Cadden ran the centre in a dangerous way by skirting industry regulations on sterility in an effort to push production and make more money.</p><p>4 Disney map goes for $1mLOS ANGELES: The original colour map of Disneyland, used by Walt Disney to win funding for his first theme park, has been sold for almost $A1 million. The 1953 artefact became the most lucrative Disneyland map when it went under the hammer for $US708,000 ($A935,480) in Los Angeles on Sunday, according to the auctioneers. It had been hidden away for more than 60 years after the cartoonist gave it to a production assistant. Van Eaton Galleries co-owner Mike Eaton said: \"After some pretty exciting bidding the map sold for $US708,000, making it the most expensive Disneyland map ever sold.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TWNBUL-TownsvilleBulletin20170627Townsville17000288764703</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QTWNBL2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5NWY-9B01-F0JP-W15S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463812</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"407\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Townsville Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Townsville Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"06\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>June 27, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0002LO7</classCode><className>WALT DISNEY CO</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp;

divide the Government is going</p><p>to have to cross,\" he said.</p><p>This week's announcement that State Cabinet would consider a</p><p>proposal to allow private enterprise</p><p>to operate camping grounds and other facilities within national</p><p>parks was a blunt illustration</p><p>of the size of the ideological gulf separating the increasingly</p><p>hostile camps.</p><p>The previous Goss Labor administration</p><p>faced several similar protests during its tenure, the most</p><p>controversial being its backing of the Skyrail project linking the</p><p>tourist village of Kuranda</p><p>to the northern outskirts of Cairns, an enterprise which now</p><p>attracts almost universal acclaim</p><p>.</p><p>But with the spectre of the Bjelke-Petersen years still clinging to</p><p>the new-look Borbidge administration</p><p>, greens are becoming concerned that Littleproud will open the</p><p>floodgates to another chapter of environmental thuggery.</p><p>The claim that he was set to clean out the Wet Tropics Management</p><p>Authority and stack it with sympathetic members was, according to</p><p>Hutton, an even more powerful indication than the privatising of</p><p>national parks that the Government was intent on a bold new agenda.</p><p>Littleproud's office dismissed that accusation as \"\"fanciful\",</p><p>saying the two board vacancies would be filled in keeping with the</p><p>Government's commitment to a policy of openness.</p><p>Wet Tropics board member Aila Keto won't comment on Littleproud's</p><p>performance or recent</p><p>media comments, preferring to say that within the current legal</p><p>framework the State Government, with the Federal Government, was</p><p>obliged to administer</p><p>World Heritage Authority legislation.</p><p>Dr Keto believed a change in legislation would be required if the</p><p>Government appointed new board members who significantly altered the</p><p>Authority's direction.</p><p>\"\"Our statutory obligation is only to protect the Wet Tropics,\"</p><p>she said. \"\"We are not sanctioned to satisfy as a matter of priority</p><p>any development interests.\"</p><p>She also said that Australia had an obligation to protect areas of</p><p>outstanding heritage value. \"\"It just seems to me to put in dams in</p><p>these places _ and the Minister is on the record as wanting to put in</p><p>dams, power lines and roads in the wet tropics _ is an extraordinarily</p><p>worrying proposition.\"</p><p>In blunter language, Hutton said any attempt to stack the board</p><p>would result in a bloody battle between the Government and the state's</p><p>environmental lobby.</p><p>\"\"Any attempt to stack the board with compliant members will just</p><p>be the touchstone to all-out war.\"</p><p>Like almost all key figures in the conservation movement, Hutton</p><p>believed the new agenda was not so much a sinister attempt</p><p>to return to the \"\"good old days\" of environmental insensitivity</p><p>as a lack of understanding of the issues.</p><p>He said the role of the Environment Minister in Cabinet should be</p><p>played out along traditional lines, with the Minister displaying a</p><p>determination to protect and enhance the interests within the</p><p>portfolio. Just as a minerals and energy minister would lobby for a new</p><p>power station, or enhance</p><p>existing units, environment ministers should be fighting for the</p><p>betterment of national parks and the environment, he said.</p><p>But in Hutton's view, the Minister was heading in the opposite</p><p>direction.</p><p>Despite that criticism, Littleproud retains a fair degree of</p><p>goodwill among many in the environmental movement.</p><p>Queensland Greens convenor Angela Jones, albeit disappointed by</p><p>recent signs of \"\"bad faith\", pointed to the Minister's good start in</p><p>addressing waste management.</p><p>She said conservationists across the state also were relieved</p><p>that a review of the Environmental Protection Act had left it</p><p>virtually intact.</p><p>Littleproud is surprised and apologetic at the perception that he</p><p>is philosophically at odds with conservationists, most of whom he holds</p><p>in high esteem.</p><p>\"\"I'm sorry there is a belief there is a rift developing,\" he said</p><p>yesterday, adding that his first few months in the job had been taken</p><p>up with addressing practical management and resource issues</p><p>within national parks.</p><p>That focus, along with his public comments on those issues, perhaps</p><p>created the incorrect perception he was not supportive of the wider</p><p>\"\"big-picture\" agenda.</p><p>Hutton, he said, held \"\"very sincere\" views, while society owed a</p><p>debt to the activism of people of Hutton's ilk, who over the past two</p><p>decades had drawn attention to the pressing need for environmental</p><p>reforms.</p><p>But the Minister said the public had to keep in mind the wider</p><p>picture: while most conservationists could snipe from a relatively</p><p>comfortable position of unelected representation, he had to address a</p><p>much wider agenda. \"\"We are going to have development in this state and</p><p>my job is to ensure it is environmentally sustainable development,\" he</p><p>said.</p><p>He will meet Federal Environment Minister Senator Robert Hill today</p><p>to discuss proposed changes to the Wet Tropics Authority</p><p>.</p><p>D ESPITE the Minister's assurances of good faith, Angela Jo nes</p><p>believes his Government had been positively deceitful in stating its</p><p>position on national parks.</p><p>She pointed out that in the lead-up to the Mundingburra poll, the</p><p>Coalition had made a show of concern about the lack of available</p><p>funding for national parks, and the poor management of those parks the</p><p>previous Labor government had purchased.</p><p>Yet just months into power the Coalition had drafted plans to</p><p>introduce</p><p>private enterprise to the national park sphere without even a</p><p>pretence of consultation.</p><p>\"\"On the real green issues they are definitely going back on</p><p>promises they made before the election,\" she said. \"\"The fact is, the</p><p>Government's constituency will naturally push it in a certain</p><p>direction.\"</p><p>Queensland Conservation head Roger Kitching has proved reluctant to</p><p>say anything about the Environment Minister's performance \"\"for fear of</p><p>incriminating myself\", preferring to point out that the apparent</p><p>radical environmental</p><p>agenda was not necessarily backed by a mandate.</p><p>\"\"You've got to remember they are only there by a whisker,\" he</p><p>said, remarking that the new Minister had made few friends _ \"\"he</p><p>certainly got the environment movement offside from Day One but that</p><p>could be more to do with his manner than anything else\". He was also</p><p>unhappy with the policy direction.</p><p>Privatisation of national parks was only one issue and not, in</p><p>itself</p><p>, an unacceptable idea, he said.</p><p>But the concern was that fundamental elements of national park management fell into private, and inexperienced hands.</p><p>\"\"A national park is a public resource</p><p>and it is society which determines how it is used,\" he said.</p><p>\"\"Politicians mess with it at their peril.\"</p><p>CONFLICTING views . . . Dr Aila Keto, above, Brian Littleproud, top</p><p>right and Drew Hutton . . . more questions than answers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML9607042015198528</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIER-MAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4582-18H0-0197-F417-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1221\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Courier Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"07\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>July 4, 1996, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

This type of cloud can be common in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44awwgj7kVA\">large fires</url>.</p><p>However, with the right environmental conditions the plume goes much higher and pyrocumulonimbus clouds can form, towering up to 15km in some cases. As it rises, the plume cools, and the upper part of the clouds form ice particles that collide and can produce lightning.</p><p>These thunderstorms can create erratic and dangerously strong wind gusts. These can drive blizzards of embers that ignite spot fires beyond the fire font.   </p><p>Lightning from the plume can start new fires, well ahead of the main fire. In one case, lightning generated in a pyrocumulonimbus cloud has been recorded starting new fires up to <url normalizedValue=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2017JD026577\">100km ahead</url> of the main fire.</p><h>How climate change makes firestorms more likely</h><p>One of the key elements to a firestorm forming is the precondition of the atmosphere above it. We wanted to investigate how a changing climate might affect the likelihood of firestorms happening.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cawcr.gov.au/technical-reports/CTR_020.pdf\">Previous research</url> has found there is more dynamic interaction between a large fire and the atmosphere when the air about 1.5km above the surface is relatively dry, and when there are larger temperature differences across increasing altitudes. </p><p>The larger the temperature difference, the more unstable the atmosphere may become. When higher altitudes get cold more quickly than normal, and are also very dry at low levels, it can become more likely that a pyrocumulonimbus event will develop during a large fire.</p><p>We used high-resolution climate modelling of projected lower atmospheric instability and dryness conditions to assess the risk of pyrocumulonimbus in southeastern Australia between 2060 and 2079, compared with 1990-2009. We then overlaid this information with the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/Research/Environment/Extreme-Events/Bushfire/Fire-danger-meters/Mk5-forest-fire-danger-meter\">forest fire danger index</url> to identify particularly dangerous fire days.</p><p>We were then able to identify how often dangerous fire weather days occurred at the same time as a dry and unstable atmosphere. Verifying our models against <url normalizedValue=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/2017GL076654\">past observations</url>, we then examined how often these two characteristics coincided in the future under climate change, should our greenhouse gas emissions remain on their current trajectory.</p><p>The results were startling. From 2060 onwards, we saw sharp increases in dangerous fire days across southeast Australia that coincided with atmospheric conditions primed to <url normalizedValue=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL083699\">generate firestorms</url>.</p><p>These extremely dangerous days also shifted across seasons, starting to appear in late spring, whereas historically Australian pyrocumulonimbus wildfires have typically been <url normalizedValue=\"https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1029/2019GL083699\">summer phenomena</url>. </p><p>Across large areas of Victoria and South Australia, on average, we saw four or five more days every spring that were conducive to pyrocumulonimbus events.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: A surprising answer to a hot question: controlled burns often fail to slow a bushfire</emphasis></p><p>These were sobering findings, even in a land of extremes like Australia.
