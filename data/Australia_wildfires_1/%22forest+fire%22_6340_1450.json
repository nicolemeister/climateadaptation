East Gippsland Hillside volunteer and former captain Nick Barton said getting roadside burns done under the CFA's onerous rules was \"pretty well impossible\".</p><p>\"The last section (of the Princes Highway) we burnt was 10 years ago, and there's some areas that haven't been done in decades\" Mr Barton said.</p><p>\"Community safety is impacted.\" As happened on Black Saturday in 2009, Mr Barton said roadsides acted as wicks that fires travelled along before flashing out into forests and farms.</p><p>\" Continued Page 4 \" From Page 1 Mount Taylor CFA volunteer sector commander and strike team leader Don Roderick said the build-up of fuel loads was not just a problem on major highways, with volunteers struggling to undertake burns on critical access roads to smaller settlements.</p><p>\"When I first joined 40 years ago we'd burn sections of the Bullumwaal Rd (north of Bairnsdale) in stages every three to five years, up where there's about 50 homes,\" Mr Roderick said.</p><p>\"It's their only escape route, but none of it has been burnt for about 10 years.\" CFA flow charts show brigades must lodge applications for planned burns at least 12 months in advance, so their regional Vegetation Management Officer has time to organise ecological and cultural heritage assessments, plus any site preparation work.</p><p>\"One year prior to the burn the VMO will assess (and cost) the required works on site and prepare a job plan specifying the track, asset protection and hazardous tree work required - total time approx. four to seven months,\" the flow chart states.</p><p>The VMO must then identify ecological vegetation classes of significance, calculate tolerable fire intervals to ensure vegetation is not burnt too frequently, and get biodiversity officers' advice on species listed under state and federal conservation legislation.</p><p>Traditional owners must also be contacted if there are cultural heritage sites within 2km, such as scar or birthing trees.</p><p>The flow chart also shows risk ratings must then be calculated in regard to the value of the burn in protecting homes and lives.</p><p>Mr Roderick said the situation was made worse by the fact that District 11, covering a region from Bairnsdale to the NSW border, had just one VMO to service about 50 to 60 brigades.</p><p>He said once the CFA was granted a burn permit local brigades were even more constrained by demands that ensure excessive numbers of trucks and crews attend, plus organise traffic management contractors, all of which could be cancelled at the last minute due to changing weather conditions.</p><p>Mr Brownrigg said brigades also had to find a volunteer qualified as a Planned Burn Operations Officer, of whom there was a shortage due to CFA inaction on training.</p><p>CFA District 11, from Bairnsdale to Orbost, has just four PBOOs qualified to undertake complexity rating two type burns, the most common burn level in East Gippsland.</p><p>\"This is unlikely to change in the short term due to the Recognition of Prior Learning process still being developed, and the training of PBOOs stalled due to the loss of Registered Training Organisation recognition.</p><p>The Weekly Times has previously reported on brigades in western Victoria walking away from planned burns, with Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria chief executive Adam Barnett warning \"red tape and ever-increasing bureaucracy were strangling the ability of brigades to undertake planned burns\".</p><p>But a CFA spokesman said the fire service had \"launched a planned burn program, the Planned Burn Taskforce, to increase the number of fuel management activities that can be done across the state.</p><p>\"The Taskforce is comprised of more than 600 volunteers who are activated when required to assist in the delivery of planned burns across Victoria when conditions allow,\" he said.</p><p>\"CFA is doing everything it can to further engage its brigades about fuel management activities, particularly in the south-east of the state.\" CFA's Planned Burn Taskforce accounted for 15 fuel treatment activities last year, conducted by 156 members.</p><p>\"

Their study suggests that the absence of a rapid, contemporary decline in global wildfire emissions with burned area is the increasing forest wildfire emissions. This study can guide the future development of a global carbon budget monitoring and inversion framework based on satellite remote sensing. Dr. Zheng's research article, \" Increasing forest fire emissions despite the decline in global burned area,\" has been published in Science Advances on 24th Sep (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh2646\">https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abh2646</url>).</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Satellites have detected a global decline in fire burned areas over grasslands, coincident with a small increase over forests over the past decades. Bo Zheng and his colleagues developed an atmospheric inversion system to show that global fire emissions have been stable or slightly decreasing despite the substantial decline in global burned area since 2000, caused by emission increase from forest fires offsetting the decreasing emissions from grass and shrubland fires. Forest fires are larger CO2 sources per unit area burned than grassland fires, with a slow or incomplete follow-up recovery -- sometimes no recovery due to degradation and deforestation. With fires expanding over forest areas, the slow recovery of CO2 uptake over burned forest lands weakens land sink capacity, implying that pressures from global fires on climate have not been relieved despite the decline in global burned area.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 About:<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Tsinghua SIGS is a graduate education and research institution jointly established by the prestigious Tsinghua University and the Shenzhen Government.

An incident management team from NSW and WA totalling 65 personnel includes 10 members from Fire and Rescue NSW (FRNSW). Members were chosen for their skill and current COVID-19 vaccination status.</p><p>\"Each of them has specialist skills in incident management and will provide relief to the Incident management teams that have been working vigorously since April,\" said New England North West FRNSW zone commander Supt Tom Cooper.</p><p>\"Matt is the only one to be chosen from our zone, and I'm very proud of him. He put his hand up to go, and he fits the criteria and for AFAC to recognise those skills in someone from our team is great. It is also good for our emergency services to have someone of his calibre in the community. Matt was very involved with the Black Summer Bushfires in Glen Innes and other parts of the state, so he will take that experience with him, and he will also learn a hell of a lot of new skills, which he'll bring back to us. This is a wonderful opportunity to return the favour of the Canadians that supported Australia during the 2019-20 bushfire season.\"</p><p>Mr Goldman and the rest of the team gathered in Sydney this week to attend briefings, equipment familiarisation, and final fitness checks. Then, after a final briefing on Tuesday afternoon with the Commissioner of FRNSW Paul Baxter, they boarded a chartered Air Canada flight to Vancouver where they will be tasked to the wildfires in British Columbia or Ontario.</p><p>The six-week deployment will be for 30 days in the field and includes a mandatory 14-day quarantine upon return to Australia.</p><p>Western Canada has been experiencing hot, dry weather with large fires burning in British Columbia and Ontario provinces decimating more than one and one quarter billion hectares.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GIENWS-doc7gup9ski5o5ipin34lj</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GIENWS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:637R-HPR1-JD34-V4MD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390558</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

They burnt more than 10 million hectares, mostly forests in southeast Australia. Many of our most distinctive, ancient and vulnerable species were worst affected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new book released today, titled <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/8085/\">Australia's Megafires</url>, synthesises the extent of the losses. The work involved contributions from more than 200 scientists and experts. It provides the most comprehensive assessment yet of how the fires affected biodiversity and Indigenous cultural values, and how nature has recovered. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The work reveals a picture of almost unfathomable destruction. More than 1,600 native species had at least half their range burnt. And hundreds of species and ecosystems became nationally threatened for the first time, or were pushed closer to extinction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We must use Black Summer as an opportunity to learn - and make fundamental changes. Here, we outline six lessons to heed.</p><h>1. Natural systems are already stressed</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Problem:</emphasis> Even before Black Summer, most Australian ecosystems were already struggling due to multiple threats.</p><p>The threatened alpine bog communities in the Australian Capital Territory, for example, were already being damaged by climate change, weeds and feral animals. Then the Black Summer fires came through and burnt 86% of known sites.</p><p>Put all these threats together, and recovery for these ecosystems - which are slow to develop - will not be easy. They may be lost altogether, along with threatened animals that call the bogs home, such as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/meet-the-broad-toothed-rat-a-chubby-cheeked-and-inquisitive-australian-rodent-that-needs-our-help-160929\">broad-toothed rat</url>. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solution:</emphasis> Managing crises such as fires is not enough on its own. Our natural systems must be made more resilient. More effective legislation and management is needed to control all threats that degrade nature. And in some cases, threatened species may need to be relocated to put them out of harm's way.</p><h>2. We don't know what, or where, all species are</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Problem:</emphasis> Thousands of Australian species are not (or barely) known to science. It's very hard to protect a species if we don't know it exists, where it lives or how it responds to fire.</p><p>For example, it's likely that the Black Summer fires sent many invertebrate species - such as insects and spiders - to extinction. But we'll never know because <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/australias-bushfires-could-drive-more-than-700-animal-species-to-extinction-check-the-numbers-for-yourself-129773\">they were never</url> described by Western science, and their distributions were never traced.</p><p>Only about 30% of Australia's estimated 320,000 invertebrate species have been <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dcceew.gov.au/sites/default/files/env/pages/2ee3f4a1-f130-465b-9c7a-79373680a067/files/nlsaw-2nd-complete.pdf\">described</url> by taxonomists. Of those that are described, most are known from only one or two records, which provides only limited insight. Information is similarly poor for fungi.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solution:</emphasis> We need to gather more information about how species and environments respond to fires, and to what extent conservation efforts after fires are working. This is especially true for poorly known species groups. And the data should be made accessible to all who seek it. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: They might not have a spine, but invertebrates are the backbone of our ecosystems. Let's help them out</emphasis></p><h>3. Emergency responders don't have enough information</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Problem:</emphasis> Emergency responders told us that during the fires, they didn't have the information to prioritise the most important areas for conservation. </p><p>We found across 13 agencies, just two threatened species were covered by a specific and accessible emergency plan: the Wollemi pine and the eastern bristlebird. These plans told emergency responders what rescue action was needed.</p><p>For example, a plan was in place to protect the only known natural stand of Wollemi pines, in New South Wales. This prompted an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2020/jan/15/dinosaur-trees-firefighters-save-endangered-wollemi-pines-from-nsw-bushfires\">extraordinary firefighting effort</url> during the Black  Summer fires. The effort was successful.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solution:</emphasis> More than 1,800 of Australia's plant and animal species are at risk of extinction. We must identify which are a priority, where they are, and how to protect them from bushfires. This information must be communicated to emergency responders and incorporated into regional fire management plans.</p><h>4. Biodiversity usually comes last</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Problem:</emphasis> Traditionally, the hierarchy of what to protect in disasters goes like <url normalizedValue=\"https://naturaldisaster.royalcommission.gov.au/\">this</url>: first human life, then infrastructure, and finally biodiversity. If this hierarchy continues, some of our most significant species and natural environments will be lost. </p><p>In <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.publish.csiro.au/book/8085/\">one example</url> recounted to the book's researchers, fire authorities decided to prioritise saving a few farm sheds over 5,000 hectares of national park. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solution:</emphasis> There are cases, such as avoiding extinctions, where protecting nature is more important than saving infrastructure. Community priorities should be surveyed, and the information used to inform planning and policy. </p><p>Legal obligations to protect biodiversity in fires are few. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/bad-and-getting-worse-labor-promises-law-reform-for-australias-environment-heres-what-you-need-to-know-186562\">current re-working</url> of federal environment laws provides an opportunity to change this.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: 'Bad and getting worse': Labor promises law reform for Australia's environment. Here's what you need to know</emphasis></p><h>5. Conservation funding is grossly insufficient</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Problem:</emphasis> Decades of sustained management effort is needed to recover many species and environments affected by fire. Unfortunately, funding for the task is short-term and inadequate.</p><p>For example, both state and federal governments invested heavily in controlling feral herbivores, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/jul/31/australias-black-summer-bushfires-showed-the-impact-of-human-wrought-change-aoe\">such as deer</url>, in the months after the fires. This was done to protect unburnt and regenerating vegetation. Yet, eventually the funding dries up and feral <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.canberratimes.com.au/story/7319105/rapid-rise-in-feral-deer-numbers-in-the-act/\">populations rebound</url>. </p><p>Extra funding for some short-term recovery projects flowed in the wake of the Black Summer fires - from governments, the private sector and the community. But for many species, recovery will be a long-term proposition - if it happens at all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solution:</emphasis> Governments must stop seeing spending on the environment as optional. It's as fundamental to our society and well-being as health and education - and funding levels should reflect this.</p><h>6. First Nations knowledge has been sidelined</h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Problem:</emphasis> First Nations people have <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/indigenous-expertise-is-reducing-bushfires-in-northern-australia-its-time-to-consider-similar-approaches-for-other-disasters-155361\">used fire</url> to manage forested landscapes for millenia. Yet their knowledge and perspectives have  not been incorporated into forest fire management and recovery.</p><p>So how has this come about? Barriers identified in the book include inadequate employment and training opportunities for First Nations people to undertake cultural burning activities. Also, First Nations people are frequently denied access to Country to rekindle and develop their land management skills, and lack the legal authority to undertake cultural burning.</p><p>And as the book shows, cross-cultural challenges mean non-Indigenous fire officers can have limited appreciation or knowledge of Indigenous cultural burning protocols.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solution:</emphasis> Indigenous people should be supported to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.firesticks.org.au/\">rekindle</url> cultural fire practices in forests. And non-Indigenous fire managers should, with consent from First Nations people, incorporate these practices into policies governing fire management and recovery. </p><p>What's more, species and sites that are culturally important to First Nations people should be prioritised for protection and recovery.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Fire management in Australia has reached a crossroads and 'business as usual' won't cut it</emphasis></p><h>Harnessing our grief</h><p>The Black Summer fires showed people care. The disaster triggered an outpouring of grief from Australia and around the world. We understood one thing clearly: we were losing what enriches our lives. </p><p>But protecting our precious natural assets requires a fundamental reset of Australia's fire management. </p><p>More broadly, the Black Summer fires kickstarted a huge collaborative recovery effort from governments, conservation and research organisations, and First Nations groups. If we're to be better prepared for future megafires, this impetus must continue.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Libby Rumpff received funding from the NESP Threatened Species Hub, which funded the book.

were only a few weeks into their careers, a court has heard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pair were called as witnesses to speak on day three of a coronial inquest into the death of Gomeroi man Gordon Copeland on Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Copeland's body was found three months after he disappeared into the Gwydir River in the early hours of July 10, 2021.</p><p>An inquest into his death started at Moree on Monday.</p><p>Counsel assisting Dr Peggy Dwyer questioned constables Katerina Hinton and Joshua Jones on Wednesday about their training prior to arriving in Moree.</p><p>They explained they conducted online training before attending the police academy at Goulburn, and were attested at Inverell before starting duties at the Moree Police Station.</p><p>\"Did any part of your training involve anything about cross-cultural issues?\" Dr Dwyer asked.</p><p>\"Did you engage with Aboriginal people?\"</p><p>She asked if they had been provided any information to understand local issues relating to Aboriginal people or if they had any communications with elders once on the job.</p><p>\"There was a full day of training about cultural issues to help give us an understanding of the Aboriginal community of Moree,\" Constable Hinton said.</p><p>The inquest heard it was run by Aboriginal Community Liaison Officers (ACLOs), and there was another event that involved visiting culturally significant sites, but not everyone attended.</p><p>\"Do you recall learning anything about the history of injustice Aboriginal people in this area have experienced?\" Dr Dwyer asked.</p><p>\"Yes, at that training day provided by the ACLOs,\" Constable Hinton said.</p><p>\"But that is the only day you can recall that you learned about that?\" Dr Dwyer asked.</p><p>\"Correct,\" the constable said.</p><p>READ ALSO:</p><p>Bee lockdown to lift as permit system allows for movement Safety works begin at 'dangerous' corner on edge of town Man jailed after stolen diesel set alight fuelled costly forest fire Dr Dwyer asked the officers about their training with police vehicles and their understanding of a pursuit, revisiting the topic of whether the car Mr Copeland was in on the night was only being \"followed\" by police.</p><p>She also focused on what happened at the scene where Mr Copeland went missing and the events that followed the initial search of the river area.</p><p>\"You were pretty fresh in terms of being a police officer, did you wonder yourself what you were doing or did it seem pretty clear to you?\" asked Dr Dwyer.</p><p>\"Do you think more of your focus at that stage was on apprehending someone rather than worrying about the person's welfare?\"</p><p>\"I was more worried about somebody potentially being in that river than apprehending somebody,\" Constable Hinton said.</p><p>The three officers who have appeared before the inquest so far all said they believed they were at the scene for longer than they actually were.</p><p>Time stamps on vehicle radios and body cameras show the search only took place for about 12 minutes.</p><p>During that time they witnessed the \"dangerous\" water conditions.</p><p>\"I thought if someone was to be in that river potentially, with the current as quick as it was, and the debris banging and crashing... they would have found it incredibly difficult to swim, even if they were a strong swimmer, in that circumstance,\" Constable Hinton said.</p><p>Footage from two body cameras worn by officers at the scene show the discussion the officers had at the vehicle and after they had stopped the search.</p><p>The officer in charge at the scene was told by a probationary constable that someone had gone in the river and may have hurt themselves because they were groaning.</p><p>\"They either swam across to the other side or were washed downstream in the current,\" the young officer said.</p><p>\"Do you agree when you look at the footage now, it looks like the police are not taking it seriously that someone could be in the river?\" Dr Dwyer asked.</p><p>\"When you look at that video, do you agree it shows male officers laughing? That it appears to look jovial or there is a sense of fun or frivolity, a lightness in the discussion?\"</p><p>Constable Hinton responded that the job of a police officer was to protect life and property.</p><p>\"If I knew somebody was in that river at that point in time we wouldn't have returned to that car,\" she said.</p><p>\"None of those conversations would have ever taken place.</p><p>\"I believe if somebody needed our help, they would have let us know that they needed our help ... we would have been willing to protect that person's life,\" she said, fighting back tears.</p><p>The inquest continues.</p><p>Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

were only a few weeks into their careers, a court has heard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The pair were called as witnesses to speak on day three of a coronial inquest into the death of Gomeroi man Gordon Copeland on Wednesday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Copeland's body was found three months after he disappeared into the Gwydir River in the early hours of July 10, 2021.</p><p>An inquest into his death started at Moree on Monday.</p><p>Counsel assisting Dr Peggy Dwyer questioned constables Katerina Hinton and Joshua Jones on Wednesday about their training prior to arriving in Moree.</p><p>They explained they conducted online training before attending the police academy at Goulburn, and were attested at Inverell before starting duties at the Moree Police Station.</p><p>\"Did any part of your training involve anything about cross-cultural issues?\" Dr Dwyer asked.</p><p>\"Did you engage with Aboriginal people?\"</p><p>She asked if they had been provided any information to understand local issues relating to Aboriginal people or if they had any communications with elders once on the job.</p><p>\"There was a full day of training about cultural issues to help give us an understanding of the Aboriginal community of Moree,\" Constable Hinton said.</p><p>The inquest heard it was run by Aboriginal Community Liaison Officers (ACLOs), and there was another event that involved visiting culturally significant sites, but not everyone attended.</p><p>\"Do you recall learning anything about the history of injustice Aboriginal people in this area have experienced?\" Dr Dwyer asked.</p><p>\"Yes, at that training day provided by the ACLOs,\" Constable Hinton said.</p><p>\"But that is the only day you can recall that you learned about that?\" Dr Dwyer asked.</p><p>\"Correct,\" the constable said.</p><p>READ ALSO:</p><p>Bee lockdown to lift as permit system allows for movement Safety works begin at 'dangerous' corner on edge of town Man jailed after stolen diesel set alight fuelled costly forest fire Dr Dwyer asked the officers about their training with police vehicles and their understanding of a pursuit, revisiting the topic of whether the car Mr Copeland was in on the night was only being \"followed\" by police.</p><p>She also focused on what happened at the scene where Mr Copeland went missing and the events that followed the initial search of the river area.</p><p>\"You were pretty fresh in terms of being a police officer, did you wonder yourself what you were doing or did it seem pretty clear to you?\" asked Dr Dwyer.</p><p>\"Do you think more of your focus at that stage was on apprehending someone rather than worrying about the person's welfare?\"</p><p>\"I was more worried about somebody potentially being in that river than apprehending somebody,\" Constable Hinton said.</p><p>The three officers who have appeared before the inquest so far all said they believed they were at the scene for longer than they actually were.</p><p>Time stamps on vehicle radios and body cameras show the search only took place for about 12 minutes.</p><p>During that time they witnessed the \"dangerous\" water conditions.</p><p>\"I thought if someone was to be in that river potentially, with the current as quick as it was, and the debris banging and crashing... they would have found it incredibly difficult to swim, even if they were a strong swimmer, in that circumstance,\" Constable Hinton said.</p><p>Footage from two body cameras worn by officers at the scene show the discussion the officers had at the vehicle and after they had stopped the search.</p><p>The officer in charge at the scene was told by a probationary constable that someone had gone in the river and may have hurt themselves because they were groaning.</p><p>\"They either swam across to the other side or were washed downstream in the current,\" the young officer said.</p><p>\"Do you agree when you look at the footage now, it looks like the police are not taking it seriously that someone could be in the river?\" Dr Dwyer asked.</p><p>\"When you look at that video, do you agree it shows male officers laughing? That it appears to look jovial or there is a sense of fun or frivolity, a lightness in the discussion?\"</p><p>Constable Hinton responded that the job of a police officer was to protect life and property.</p><p>\"If I knew somebody was in that river at that point in time we wouldn't have returned to that car,\" she said.</p><p>\"None of those conversations would have ever taken place.</p><p>\"I believe if somebody needed our help, they would have let us know that they needed our help ... we would have been willing to protect that person's life,\" she said, fighting back tears.</p><p>The inquest continues.</p><p>Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

While desperately searching for her younger sister, Towa wanders into a mysterious tunnel that sends her into present-day Japan, where she is found and raised by Kagome Higurashi's brother, Sota, and his family,\"read the official series synopsis, according to Crunchyroll[2]. <br/>\"Ten years later, the tunnel that connects the two eras has reopened, allowing Towa to be reunited with Setsuna, who is now a demon slayer working for Kohaku. But to Towa's shock, Setsuna appears to have lost all memories of her older sister,\"it continued. <br/>The cast of \"Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon\" anime includes Azusa Tadokoro as Moroha, Sara Matsumoto as Towa, Mikako Komatsu as Setsuna, Ai Fairouz as Takechiyo, Kappei Yamaguchi as Inuyasha, Ken Narita as Sesshomaru, Mamiko Noto as Rin, Ryohei Kimura as Kohaku, Takehiro Urao as Hisui, Hitomi Ueda as Gyokuto, Hiroki Yasumoto as Konton, Tsuyoshi Koyama as Hisui, Makoto Yasumura as Miroku, Noriko Hidaka as Spirit of the Tree of Ages, Aya Gomazuru as Kin'u, Asako Dodo as Grammy and Maaya Sakamoto as Zero. <br/>Fans can watch \"Yashahime: Princess Half-Demon\" Episode 48[3] online on Crunchyroll.

He was a big man but a very gentle man... a gentle giant.\"</p><p>Mrs Pymer said she was proud that his name was being added to the memorial.</p><p>\"There was a thanksgiving service in Horsham in 2005 and because it was a burn-off, not a fire, they recognised him as being in service, not dying in the line of duty,\" she said.</p><p>\"Mum would be so proud that he has been recognised this way.</p><p>\"He was only 43 when he died and Mum had to raise me while trying to hang on to the farm, which she did.\"</p><p>The accident happened on the Henty Highway south of Horsham during a roadside burn in conjunction with the Country Roads Board (CRB), now known as VicRoads.</p><p>An empty fuel truck heading to Portland clipped a CRB patrol vehicle and overturned onto Mr McGennisken and a CRB worker, who also died later in hospital.</p><p>A campaign to formally recognise his contribution was started in the early 2000s by former Wonwondah brigade member Jim Heard who was at the scene when Mr McGennisken was killed.</p><p>\"When Jim Heard was writing the history of the brigade, he started the campaign to have Jack's name added to the memorial wall on behalf of the brigade,\" Mr Dumesny said.</p><p>\"At the time it was deemed by the CFA to be a road accident but we kept pushing for it and we're honoured that he has been finally added.\"</p><p>A plaque in the Wonwondah Hall also recognises Mr McGennisken, who was captain of the brigade at the time of his death.</p><p>Mr McGennisken's name will also be forwarded to the national memorial in Canberra.</p><p>The new memorial was completed last year and is a tribute to fallen members from CFA, Forest Fire Management Victoria, MFB, VICSES, Ambulance Victoria, Live Saving Victoria and Marine Search and Rescue.</p><p>VFBV chief executive Adam Barnett said Mr McGennisken's addition to the honour roll alongside 79 other CFA firefighters was an important tribute to his family, friends and loved ones and recognised those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty on behalf of their communities.</p><p>\"I thank the local community, brigades and VFBV District Council 17 who all assisted in the long advocacy for Jack to be recognised,\" Mr Barnett said.</p><p>\"Mr McGennisken's addition to the honour roll is a fitting tribute to a CFA firefighter who has selflessly given their lives to protect the lives of other Victorians.</p><p>\"CFA volunteers play a critical role in fire prevention across the state, and roadside burns like the one being undertaken by Mr McGennisken's crew have no doubt saved countless lives as part of Victoria's fire prevention works.</p><p>\"Mr McGennisken tragic sacrifice will forever be remembered, as we mark our respect and deep sorrow for each of the precious lives lost in service of their community.</p><p>A memorial service was held on May 2 where Jack McGennisken was inducted to the honour roll.

The reserve hosts a variety of indigenous plants and animals, including species extinct elsewhere on the peninsula.</p><p>Ms Neville said it was important the community understood the management of the reserve.</p><p>\"I completely understand that people feel increased stress regarding fires at the moment,\" she said.</p><p>\"Parks Victoria, working with the Friends of Ocean Grove Nature Reserve, has undertaken significant fuel management work in the lead-up to this summer, and with the current mild conditions will be doing some additional work.\" Liberal senator Sarah Henderson weighed in on the issue last week, accusing the State Government of failing to keep the reserve - and others at -Inverleigh and Bannockburn - clear of debris.</p><p>The community meeting will be hosted by the CFA and will include residents, staff from Forest Fire Management Victoria, Parks Victoria and the City of Greater Geelong.It is scheduled to run from 5.30-7pm today at the Shell Rd Pavilion, 50 Shell Rd, Ocean Grove.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-24d657703b2511ea9115ab9a48d67c3187f2a937bf5064f48acb9c8b18194d1c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1C-C751-JD3N-5095-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Geelong Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp;

bushfires had ravaged the area has been sentenced to a two-year probation order.</p><p>Jeremy Daniel Doolan, 19, was linked to the forest fire after leaving behind at the scene a jerry can on which his fingerprints were found, Crown prosecutor Shontelle Petrie told Toowoomba District Court.</p><p>Police investigations led to CCTV footage from a 7-Eleven service station which showed Doolan and co-offender William John Kevin Horrigan, 19, obtaining the jerry can, she said.</p><p>When spoken to by police, Doolan had initially told a \"fanciful\" story of having given a lift to a man who went onto light the fire.</p><p>However, Horrigan had given a more truthful account after which Doolan had come clean, she said.</p><p>Fortunately, a volunteer rural fire service unit responding to a call and quickly doused the blaze which by then had burnt a 50m by 40m area, Ms Petrie said.</p><p>Horrigan had been placed on 18 months probation with no conviction recorded when he was sentenced by the same court in November last year.</p><p>Doolan pleaded guilty to wilfully setting fire to vegetation.</p><p>His barrister Daniel Boddice told the court the teenager had endured a \"tumultuous\" childhood which included homelessness at times.</p><p>Doolan had a child with his then partner at 17 but at the time of this offending the relationship had broken down and he had little access to his child and started drinking heavily.</p><p>\"He was drunk at the time of this,\" Mr Boddice said.</p><p>He said his client was remorseful and had written a letter of apology to the court.</p><p>He said Doolan had been doing work experience on a farm tree lopping and he was hoping to obtain employment there.</p><p>Judge Katherine McGuinness said she took into account Doolan's youth and plea of guilty and ordered the conviction not be recorded.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

frequency of those large events\u00a0or the seasons with the large damaging fires is a big increase on what it used to be,\" he said.</p><p>Consider the statistics:\u00a0 before 2004, there were two recorded fires that burnt 1 million hectares of land.</p><p>In the past 17 years, there have been three of those seasons.\u00a0</p><h>Dealing with fires and COVID would've been 'difficult'</h><p>Then

teams.</p><p>\"It is manageable but it would've been very difficult.\"</p><p>For example, moving resources around the state, or even interstate as they did with the NSW fires, would have been very difficult.\u00a0\u00a0</p><h>Extra funding for firefighters</h><p>In a pre-budget announcement, Environment\u00a0and Climate Change Minister Lily D'Ambrosio revealed\u00a0technology upgrades for the firefighting agencies, and the creation of a new Office of Bushfire Risk Management.</p><p>Ms D'Ambrosio said $133 million would be spent on new digital radios for Forest Fire Management Victoria as part of a $517 million package aimed at improving technology and agency responses to bushfires in Victoria.</p><p>The announcement comes as fire agencies like the CFA prepare for the upcoming fire season.</p><p>Mr Slijepcevic said all of the CFA's\u00a0fire agency's procedures were reviewed to work out what would need to change in the event of a COVID outbreak during a fire.</p><p>The CFA and Forest Fire Management Victoria have also doubled the number of hectares of planned burns.\u00a0</p><p>There have been 380 burns so far this year totalling 110,000 hectares.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>Asked what the forecast is for the next season, Mr Slijepcevic said it was about three months too early to know for sure.</p><p>One thing is certain: while it may seem like it was a wet summer it really wasn't.</p><p>\"People in Melbourne would probably think this was a really wet year but even in Melbourne it was just an average year,\" he said.</p><p>\"Yes we received more rainfall than previous years but it would still only be an average year for Victoria.</p><p>\"Conditions are returning to what we've been seeing for the last 50 years. There is quite a significant decline in the rainfall, in late autumn and winter, of about 15 per cent less.\"</p><p>He said the fuels were 35 per cent drier than they were 30 years ago.</p><p>So his prediction for the fire season ahead?</p><p>\"We would not expect a fire season like what we had last year, that's for sure,\" he said.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-100109332</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62M8-1N31-DY47-514D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"736\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 8, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents:Fires:Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment:Climate Change</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia:VIC:Melbourne</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia:VIC:Bairnsdale</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
