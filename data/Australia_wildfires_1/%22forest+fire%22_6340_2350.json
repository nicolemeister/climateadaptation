Together with the El Ni\u00f1o, this created a \"double whammy\" of drought conditions which provided the climatic backdrop for the fires.</p><p>Similarly, the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/about-us/our-districts/mia/photovideo-gallery/2014-photovideo-gallery/twenty-years-on-since-the-1994-fires-seven-news-flashback\">1994 Sydney fires</url> were also influenced by a combination of El Ni\u00f1o and positive IOD conditions.</p><p>However the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/drought/\">current drought</url> is affecting areas such as coastal NSW which have not historically been influenced by positive IOD and El Ni\u00f1o events. This suggests other drivers are at play. </p><p>Perhaps most alarmingly, this summer's bushfire crisis also differs from the past is the spread and extent of landscape burned. More so than during Victoria's Ash Wednesday or Black Saturday, this season's fires have burned large swathes of the country. In some cases, fires merged to form unprecedented <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/nsw/the-monster-a-short-history-of-australia-s-biggest-forest-fire-20191218-p53l4y.html\">\"mega fires\"</url>.

In fact, the extraordinary conditions experienced during <url normalizedValue=\"https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/bushfire-black-saturday-victoria-2009/\">Victoria's Black Saturday fires</url> in February 2009 later prompted the creation of a new \"catastrophic\" fire rating, represented by a FFDI of 100 or greater. </p><p>On September 6 last year - less than a week out from winter - severe bushfires burned across Queensland and NSW. In most affected areas, daily FFDI values that day (pictured in the bottom right of the graphic below) were higher than anything observed so early in the season <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs71.pdf\">since records began in 1950</url>. Astoundingly, a FDDI of 174 was recorded at Murrurundi Gap in the Hunter region of NSW. </p><h>Rewriting history</h><p>In the past, Australia only had to contend with natural climate variability.

Amid scenes of desperate Australians being rescued from beaches, national security writer Craig Hooper has called the operation a \"mini-Dunkirk\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At least 25 lives have been lost and many others are missing. Hundreds of homes and busi-nesses have been incinerated, as have more than 60,000sq km of bushland. NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian describes the crisis as \"uncharted territory\", with some towns at risk of being completely wiped out. Scott Morrison, who took a brief holiday at the start of the crisis, has been accused of poor leadership. And critics have taken the opportunity to demand that Australia's climate policy be -immediately overhauled to reflect this national disaster.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what exactly is causing this year's extreme fire season? Climate change? Arson? Drought? In fact, it's all of the above.</p><p>Last year short-term weather fluctuations in the Indian Ocean - the Indian Ocean Dipole, as scientists call it - pushed moist ocean air away from Australia's shores, causing a severe drought and drying out the leaves, sticks and soil on the bush floor.</p><p>This has come in tandem with unusually strong and sustained winds associated with a separate phenomenon known as the Antarctic Oscillation that have -pushed fires in all directions, turning isolated local crises into -regional disasters. And of course all of this comes amid a steady -increase in average temperatures across Australia, a phenomenon climate scientists have warned us about for decades.</p><p>They also have correctly predicted that long-term climate-change trends will increasingly interact disastrously with short-term climate phenomena in a way that cata-lyses and exacerbates extreme weather events.</p><p>Unfortunately, successive Australian governments have failed to adequately heed these warnings. A more aggressive use of controlled burns might have given fire-fighters a chance to control this season's bushfires. But, as has been the case in other nations, climate policy in Australia has been mired in partisan politics, with both sides using the issue to score points -instead of implementing sensible and pragmatic policies. Conservatives in Australia, under the leadership of former prime minister Tony Abbott, have rejected warnings about long-term -climate trends. The Greens, on the other hand, err in the other -direction, -inventing direct causal -relationships between individual politicians and unusual weather events, implying that short-term weather trends can be manipulated by -national governments. Both approaches are wrong.</p><p>As recent events show, variations in the aforementioned -Indian Ocean Dipole can make Australian weather patterns -inherently volatile, especially since the drying effects of a positive IOD phase often coincide with El Nino events in the southern Pacific, which weaken (or -reverse) the trade winds that bring rain to Australia from the east. -(Indeed, an El Nino did arise in 2018-19, though its effects ended in late summer.) When the Black Saturday bushfires occurred in 2009, killing 173 Australians, the IOD was in a positive phase, as it is now. The same was true of the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1982, which killed 75.</p><p>Although climate change -affects the entire planet, the sudden stratospheric warming taking place above Antarctica has a particularly acute effect on Australia. The phenomenon, identified and named by Melbourne Bureau of Meteorology scientist Eun-Pa Lim, has caused an astounding 40C spike in localised upper--atmosphere temperatures. Lim predicted that this would exacerbate the spread of hot, dry winds across eastern Australia. And she was right.</p><p>Since at least the 1990s, -researchers at the CSIRO, have warned that fire frequency would increase thanks to global warming. In 2005, a CSIRO research team published a report titled Climate Change Impacts on Fire-Weather in South-East Australia, which -concluded that \"the combined -frequencies of days with very high and extreme Forest Fire -Danger Index ratings are likely to increase 4-25 per cent by 2020 and 15-70 per cent by 2050\". We can't say we weren't warned.</p><p>Local inaction also has contributed to this season's catastrophe. CSIRO scientist David Packman has been warning governments for years to reduce fuel loads on the bush floor through controlled burns (also known as \"prescribed burning\" - or \"backburning\" when done on an emergency basis). Speaking to Sky News -recently, Packman noted that the available fuel loads for fires now are \"10 times greater\" than existed before European settlement. \"The concept has been (that) every fire is a bad fire,\" he explained. But \"in the Australian context, you need fire to keep the bush healthy and safe\". (When asked about the areas most at risk, Packman identified the north-facing slopes of the Dandenong Ranges east of Melbourne, site of the Black Saturday tragedy. Future fires, he predicted, could produce death tolls in four figures.) In 2002, a parliamentary inquiry into bushfires noted substantial political resistance to fuel-reduction/controlled-burn strategies. \"The fundamental issue in carrying out fuel reduction burning close to urban areas is that many of the inhabitants prefer living in green leafy bushland,\" wrote Bill McCormick of the government's Science, Technology, Environment and Resources Group. \"Burning can be unpleasant, -reduce amenity, kill plants and wildlife, and cause pollution so there is a build-up of political resistance to increasing the frequencies and proximity of the burns.\" Another study found that the pollution caused by backburning aggravated health conditions in vulnerable people, probably causing premature deaths.</p><p>So what are Australians to do? Firstly, we need to depoliticise the issue of climate change. It should not be considered a \"left-wing\" issue, and the overwhelming evidence indicating the reality of -anthropogenic climate change needs to be decoupled from moral arguments in favour of proposed solutions. It should be recognised that fair-minded and reasonable people can agree with the reality of climate change, while disagreeing about the best ways to tackle it.</p><p>In some cases, ideological inflexi-bility has obstructed incre-mental measures that were at one point politically feasible. When a carbon pollution reduction scheme was introduced by the Labor government in 2009, the plan attracted the support of the Liberal Party, then under the leadership of Malcolm Turnbull. But it was the Greens who blocked the measure for not going far enough. The country has lacked a proactive policy ever since.</p><p>Today, Greens MPs tweet about bushfires being directly caused by particular politicians and fantasise about \"climate trials\", at which their political -opponents are tried (and presumably convicted). All this does is -inflame conservatives, who feel that the climate change issue is exaggerated and exploited for partisan reasons.</p><p>But conservatives must also wake up. It is hypocritical to complain about science denial when it comes to the reality of biological sex or gender differences while at the same time denying that the predictions made by climate scientists years ago are generally coming true. While all scientific and empirical claims should be subjected to scrutiny and doubt, it is unwise to simply dismiss entire fields of research out of hand. Trust in the scientific method should not be domain-specific.</p><p>Secondly, we need to talk about solutions to climate change that go beyond reducing consumption. Anyone who can read a graph knows that emissions reductions made in rich countries are easily cancelled out by increases in emissions from developing countries.</p><p>Unless rich countries want to start forcing poorer countries to stop improving their living standards, we're not going to be able to deindustrialise our way out of this problem. We need to find a way to make clean energy cheap, not just make dirty energy expensive. Consider that Australia holds 33 per cent of the world's uranium deposits and yet does not have a single plant generating (zero-emission) nuclear power. We also have a tremendously underused capacity for hydrogen exports. Rather than tweeting about fictional climate trials, politicians in wealthy nations such as Australia should be investing in research that will yield scalable and reliable clean-energy technologies. This can be done in a way that respects legitimate concerns about jobs in legacy energy sectors such as coal, which have provided a livelihood to generations of blue-collar and middle-class workers.</p><p>The sight of huddled masses -escaping the ravages of mother -nature has created anxiety among victims, politicians and activists alike. And Australia's leaders, past and present, should be held to -account for the many missed -opportunities they had to mitigate the damage bushfires cause.</p><p>But scapegoating these leaders for complicated climate phenomena will do nothing to stop the fires, much less cool the planet. Confronting the problem of climate change is one of the biggest challenges of our time - a global Apollo mission for the 21st century. With visionary leadership, resource-rich nations such as Australia can help establish a path forward. Once the immediate crisis is over, we must make that happen.Claire Lehmann is the founding editor of Quillette, where this piece was first published.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-a7e3447a32ba11ea9bfac6b843f25483caa7ec540ec2a0d5af4f1c45676d0534</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY7-NC51-F0JP-W4SW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1588\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 11, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp;

I've got my big girl pants on, and my big girl shirt over the top of it and a broad brim hat and lots of hoses ready to go,\" she said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-04/nsw-victoria-bushfire-conditions-to-worsen-until-unstoppable/11839672\">Authorities had been warning communities across Victoria's declared disaster zone to evacuate the area before today</url>, amid fears the extreme weather would make bushfires unstoppable.</p><p>This afternoon, five evacuation notices and more than a dozen emergency warnings were in place in the state's east and north-east.</p><p>Mr Gillham said residents at Cann River, who were urged to evacuate this week, were \"essentially isolated\" now as fire moved towards them from the east.</p><p>\"We have been in there with the Australian Defence Force aircraft and we have also conveyed people out of Cann River but it is essentially an isolated community, the road is completely blocked by fallen trees,\" he told ABC Gippsland.</p><p>Ember attack at Club Terrace</p><p>Club Terrace is another community where residents have been cut off by trees on roads.</p><p>This afternoon, ABC Radio Melbourne caller Graham said the sky had turned red there, and he and other residents were waiting to fight fires as the area came under ember attack.</p><p>\"It's been completely blacked out and red again. But all we can see near us is a few flare-ups,\" he said.</p><p>About 50 firefighters from the United States are preparing to join the battle against the East Gippsland bushfires, which authorities estimate have torn through more than 700,000 hectares of land.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria's deputy chief fire officer Beth Roberts said authorities were working to juggle both firefighting and relief as they responded to the \"unprecedented\" bushfire emergency across East Gippsland.</p><p>\"While we are absolutely concentrating on response, it is important for us to be looking at immediate relief and recovery,\" she said.</p><p>Late this afternoon, cooler temperatures reached East Gippsland. It dropped to 17 degrees Celsius at Mount Nowa Nowa and 20C at Orbost, a dramatic drop from 40C earlier in the day.</p><p>'Lots of embers falling out of the sky' in Mallacoota</p><p>Days after Mallacoota was cut off by bushfires, prompting the evacuation of more than 900 people by sea, the sky has turned black once again.</p><p>The town was devastated by fire on New Year's Eve. Mallacoota resident Sean Rainey said gusty winds were now pushing a fire, burning on the other side of the lake, to the south.</p><p>\"I guess a whole lot of smoke has gone up and covered the sky,\" he said.</p><p>\"It took about 15 minutes to go from pretty much deep yellow to blood red and pretty much black.</p><p>\"You know there's lots of embers falling out of the sky, but they're pretty much burnt up and, yeah, we're told ... it is pretty safe.\"</p><p>Amy Houghton, who is waiting to be evacuated from Mallacoota along with her two-year-old son and her 92-year-old grandmother, said air evacuations planned for Saturday afternoon had been cancelled due to the smoke.</p><p>Erin Lehman, who is also waiting to be evacuated along with her three children, said the situation was still \"a bit scary\" as the sky moved from darkness to orange and back to darkness.</p><p>\"The smoke's horrendous and that's my concern with my kids,\" she said.</p><p>\"What's going to be the long term effects on their health being exposed to all this smoke for extended periods of time.</p><p>\"It's quite difficult trying to keep a mask on a four-year-old and a two-year-old.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, authorities said a relief centre at Sale, west of the fires, was beginning to overflow and encouraged those who could to drive further west to the Latrobe Valley town of Morwell.</p><p>Fuel won't arrive in time to keep power on in Mallacoota, Omeo</p><p>Several bushfire-affected communities have already lost power and phone connections and authorities have warned generators in Mallacoota and Omeo are running out of power.</p><p>Ausnet said fuel they had hoped would reach the East Gippsland towns had not arrived, and it was estimated the generators had between 12 and 36 hours of power left.</p><p>\"Obviously charge your communication devices, charge your backup power packs and anything you need to do to stay healthy and well,\" Ausnet's Steve Brown told ABC Gippsland.</p><p>\"The ADF [Australian Defence Force] has got a lot on their plate at the moment, so we probably aren't going to get those fuel deliveries in time to keep the generators going unfortunately. \"</p><p>Meanwhile, Telstra said of roughly 25 mobile tower sites hit by bushfires across eastern Victoria, about 15 had been restored.</p><p>Technicians had been unable to get to Cudgewa and Bonang so had been working with emergency services to deliver satellite phones to those places.</p><p>The Alpine community of Dartmouth was told it would lose power from 7:00pm and the town was experiencing

Mindful of bushfires, they set out for somewhere wet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It led them to Terania Creek, a pocket of cheap farmland not far from the hippy epicentre of Australia, Nimbin, in NSW's lush north-east. The couple bought 100 hectares of land for $20,000.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We wanted to live a simplified lifestyle, and that worked,\" says Nan. \"Except that we soon found out that the rainforest nearby was to be logged. We weren't expecting that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On August 16, 1979, despite more than four years of writing letters to politicians, a bulldozer and two forestry trucks arrived to begin work. But Terania Creek had been changing demographically, and the loggers found themselves greeted by 200 singing, guitar-playing protesters. Nan and Hugh's one-room cabin became campaign headquarters, 120 police were sent and 17 people were arrested. Terania Creek became national news.</p><p>The month-long dispute eventually swung the way of the greenies and, in 1982, the Wran state government protected 120,000 hectares. Australia's first environmental blockade became a template for campaigns to follow, including the Franklin River in Tasmania and Victoria's East Gippsland native forests.</p><p>But last November, Nan and Hugh watched as Terania Creek burned. Lack of rain, dry conditions and climate change made the usually wet and lush understorey vulnerable. Despite the community's best efforts, flames trickled through the dry leaf litter until they got into the big trees and ignited the canopy.</p><p>Nan estimates about half of the forest has been burnt. \"I still haven't come to terms with the grief, I'm putting it off,\" she says. \"This forest is so beloved, not just by Hugh and I, because we've been working on rainforests our whole lives, but the whole community utterly loves the surrounding forests and has worked so hard to protect them.\"</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV) chief Chris Hardman, who has been fighting fires for more than 30 years, said when he first started firefighting the season extended from December through the end of February to mid-March. \"Anecdotally, now it's first of November through to April 30.\"</p><p>The lesser-known cousin of the Country Fire Authority (CFA), Hardman's team is responsible for fighting fires in state forests, national parks and other conservation areas that span a third of the state - that's all public land and nearly 8 million hectares of forest. To do that, it relies on 2800 personnel and a fleet of 50 aircraft (with another 100 on call). It also boasts Australia's only rappelling firefighters, trained to drop into remote forested areas down ropes from helicopters.</p><p>Could Victoria's rainforests suffer the same fate as those in NSW? Hardman says the short answer is yes: \"Where you get long-term drought or lack of rainfall and the soils are dry, which means the fuels are dry, we will see our wet forests burn more readily.\"</p><p>Last year, Victoria weathered just over 2000 bushfires, with 95 per cent of those kept to under five hectares, according to FFMV figures. Hardman says firefighters can no longer rely on patches of rainforest and wet gullies to form natural breaks.</p><p>Victoria's State Control Centre recently estimated 675,600 hectares has burnt this year. The Victorian National Parks Association's Phil Ingamells is concerned that fire has moved through the high-altitude temperate rainforests of the Errinundra Plateau in East Gippsland: \"Some ecosystems are very resilient to repeated fire, like grasslands, but others really cannot handle frequent fire.\"</p><p>Although wetter forests, such as those in West Gippsland, would be unlikely to ignite at this time of year, come March or April it's a different story.</p><p>\"If you get four or five days of 40 degrees and you get those big, windy blow-up days, then fire will move through the landscape and it's beyond human capacity to do anything about that, no matter what,\" Hardman says.</p><p>In September, researchers from the CFA and the Bureau of Meteorology published a paper with the catchy title Understanding the variability of Australian fire weather between 1973 and 2017. After examining 44 years of seasonal fire weather history from 39 weather stations across the country, Sarah Harris and Chris Lucas concluded that \"human-induced climate change is the most likely driver behind Australia's earlier and longer fire seasons\".</p><p>Although we should still expect variability from one season to the next due to changes in climatic conditions (El Nino, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode), Victorians may have special cause for concern.</p><p>\"There is also a long-term upward trend in fire weather, with the strongest trend found in southern Australia, in spring,\" they wrote.</p><p>The pattern of longer fire seasons and more frequent fires has others worried, too. The Australian National University's Professor David Lindenmayer is a forest ecologist interested in biodiversity.</p><p>\"Many species of plants and animals are able to deal with a single major fire event in terms of their populations recovering. But once you start to have many events in rapid succession, then you really have a problem.\"</p><p>Lindenmayer is particularly concerned about the wet mountain ash forests to the north-east of Melbourne. Here, he says, the \"fire return interval\" (the time elapsed between major fires) should be about 100 years, which allows the ecosystem time to regenerate. \"But that's changing in Victoria quite dramatically,\" he says. \"In the Central Highlands region, which is so important for supplying almost all the water for the city, we've had fires in 1926, 1932, massive fires in 1939, 1983 and the catastrophic 2009 fires. \"The sheer number of fires and how quickly they're returning to the system tells us that the fire regime is changing,\" Lindenmayer says.</p><p>He applauds the Andrews government for recently announcing the phase-out of native forest logging by 2030, although he wants it to happen sooner.</p><p>\"When you cut all the trees down and then you regrow the forest, that regrown forest becomes much more prone to high severity fire,\" he says, adding that this is due to extra fuel from timber debris and the action of new, thirsty saplings drying out the forest floor.</p><p>\"The other thing that happens when you log a forest is that you remove almost all of the tree ferns. That further dries out the forest floor.\"</p><p>But when native forest logging finally does end, Lindenmayer doesn't want to see the community lose critical firefighting skills brought by contractors, who routinely use their bulldozers and other heavy equipment to clear dangerous trees and build fire breaks. He hopes they one day will become part of an elite firefighting force.</p><p>Powelltown logging contractor Peter McConachy is sceptical. \"Fires in Victoria are only around, say, two to three months. Is [Daniel Andrews] going to pay us for our machinery ... for 12 months' work? Because we have dozers, we have excavators - they all have monthly payments on them.\"</p><p>McConachy, 63, is part of a sawmilling family that spans five generations and has been employed by the Department of Land, Water and Planning to fight every fire since Ash Wednesday in 1983. He questions Lindenmayer's claim that logging makes them any more fire-prone, pointing to state-owned harvester VicForests figures showing that of 450,000 hectares available in Victoria, only 3000 hectares, or 0.04 per cent, is taken each year. \"Locking up forests and stopping the loggers is not going to stop a bushfire. It's not the answer.\"</p><p>Back in Melbourne, Hardman is less interested in whether a forest is disturbed by man (logging) or nature (bushfires). He says FFMV will adapt to the changing risks and threats by taking lessons from fires in Victoria and other parts of Australia. Sections of forest that pose a particular fuel risk to communities will continue to be purposefully burnt and, in the future, the more flammable parts of forests, such as the ridgetops, western and northern slopes, may be the subject of \"large-scale broad fuel treatments\", creating a \"mosaic pattern\" with the aim of suppressing fires caused by lightning strikes.</p><p>Though we may do our best to manage their intensity and impact, bushfires are part of the landscape.</p><p>\"On a Black Saturday-type day we would be doing aggressive first attacks; we'd be attacking every single fire in the bush as hard and as fast as we can,\" says Hardman.</p><p>\"But if some of those fires get away then we'll just be trying to get people out the way as fast as we can.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc78okmos8o6111u0l1ahr</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWR-71J1-F0J6-J4SS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1429\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Mallacoota resident Sean Rainey said gusty winds were now pushing a fire, burning on the other side of the lake, to the south.</p><p>\"I guess a whole lot of smoke has gone up and covered the sky,\" he said.</p><p>\"It took about 15 minutes to go from pretty much deep yellow to blood red and pretty much black.</p><p>\"You know there's lots of embers falling out of the sky, but they're pretty much burnt up and, yeah, we're told ... it is pretty safe.\"</p><p>Amy Houghton, who is waiting to be evacuated from Mallacoota along with her two-year-old son and her 92-year-old grandmother, said air evacuations planned for Saturday afternoon had been cancelled due to the smoke.</p><p>Erin Lehman, who is also waiting to be evacuated along with her three children, said the situation was still \"a

Mindful of bushfires, they set out for somewhere wet. It led them to Terania Creek, a pocket of cheap farmland not far from the hippy epicentre of Australia, Nimbin, in NSW's lush north-east. The couple bought 100 hectares of land for $20,000. \"We wanted to live a simplified lifestyle, and that worked,\" says Nan. \"Except that we soon found out that the rainforest nearby was to be logged. We weren't expecting that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On August 16, 1979, despite more than four years of writing letters to politicians, the bulldozer and two forestry trucks arrived to begin work. But Terania Creek had been changing demographically, and the loggers found themselves greeted by 200 singing, guitar-playing protesters. Nan and Hugh's one-room cabin became campaign headquarters, 120 police were sent in and 17 people were arrested. Suddenly, Terania Creek was national news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The month-long dispute eventually swung the way of the greenies and, in 1982, the Wran state government protected 120,000 hectares. Australia's first environmental blockade became a template for campaigns to follow, including the Franklin River in Tasmania and Victoria's East Gippsland native forests.</p><p>But last November, Nan and Hugh watched as Terania Creek burned. Lack of rain, extremely dry conditions and climate change had conspired to make the usually wet and lush understorey vulnerable. Despite the local community's best efforts, flames \"trickled through\" the dry leaf litter until they got into the big trees and ignited the canopy.</p><p>Nan estimates about half of the forest has been burnt. \"I still haven't come to terms with the grief, I'm putting it off,\" she says. \"This forest is so beloved, not just by Hugh and I, because we've been working on rainforests our whole lives, but the whole community utterly loves the surrounding forests and has worked so hard to protect them.\"</p><p>\"When I first started firefighting [the season extended from] December to the end of February, mid-March,\" says Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV) chief Chris Hardman, who has been fighting fires for more than 30 years. \"Anecdotally, now it's first of November through to April 30.\"</p><p>The lesser-known cousin of the Country Fire Authority (CFA), Hardman's team is responsible for fighting fires in state forests, national parks and other conservation areas that span a third of the state - that's all public land and nearly 8 million hectares of forest. To do that it relies on 2800 personnel and a fleet of 50 aircraft (with another 100 on call). It also boasts Australia's only rappelling firefighters, trained to drop into remote forested areas down ropes from helicopters.</p><p>Could Victoria's rainforests suffer the same fate as those in NSW? Hardman says the short answer is yes: \"Where you get long-term drought or lack of rainfall and the soils are dry, which means the fuels are dry, we will see our wet forests burn more readily.\"</p><p> Last year, Victoria weathered just over 2000 bushfires, with 95 per cent of those kept to under five hectares, according to FFMV figures. Hardman says firefighters can no longer rely on patches of rain forest and wet gullies to form natural breaks.</p><p>The Victorian National Parks Association's Phil Ingamells is concerned that fire has moved through the high-altitude temperate rainforests of the Errinundra Plateau in East Gippsland: \"Some ecosystems are very resilient to repeated fire, like grasslands, but others really cannot handle frequent fire.\"</p><p>Although wetter forests, such as those in West Gippsland, would be unlikely to ignite at this time of year, come March or April it's a different story.</p><p>\"If you get four or five days of 40 degrees and you get those big, windy blow-up days, then fire will move through the landscape and it's beyond human capacity to do anything about that, no matter what,\" Hardman says.</p><p>In September, researchers from the CFA and the Bureau of Meteorology published a paper with the catchy title <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335942313_Understanding_the_variability_of_Australian_fire_weather_between_1973_and_2017\">Understanding the variability of Australian fire weather between 1973 and 2017</url>. After examining 44 years of seasonal fire weather history from 39 weather stations across the country, Sarah Harris and Chris Lucas concluded that \"human-induced climate change is the most likely driver behind Australia's earlier and longer fire seasons\".</p><p>Although we should still expect variability from one season to the next due to changes in climatic conditions (El Nino, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode), Victorians may have special cause for concern. \"There is also a long-term upward trend in fire weather, with the strongest trend found in southern Australia, in spring,\" they wrote.</p><p>The pattern of longer fire seasons and more frequent fires has others worried, too. The Australian National University's Professor David Lindenmayer is a forest ecologist interested in biodiversity. \"Many species of plants and animals are able to deal with a single major fire event in terms of their populations recovering. But once you start to have many events in rapid succession, then you really have a problem.\"</p><p>Lindenmayer is particularly concerned about the wet mountain ash forests to the north-east of Melbourne. Here, he says, the \"fire return interval\" (the time elapsed between major fires) should be about 100 years, which allows the ecosystem time to regenerate. \"But that's changing in Victoria quite dramatically,\" he says. \"In the Central Highlands region, which is so important for supplying almost all the water for the city, we've had fires in 1926, 1932, massive fires in 1939, 1983 and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2019/black-saturday-kilmore-to-murrindindi-the-devastating-bushfires-line-of-destruction-10-years-ago/\">the catastrophic 2009 fires</url>. The sheer number of fires and how quickly they're returning to the system tells us that the fire regime is changing.\"</p><p>Lindenmayer applauds the Andrews government for recently announcing the phase-out of native forest logging by 2030, although he wants it to happen even sooner.</p><p>\"When you cut all the trees down and then you regrow the forest, that regrown forest becomes much more prone to high severity fire,\" he says, adding that this is due to extra fuel from timber debris and the action of new, thirsty saplings drying out the forest floor.</p><p>\"The other thing that happens when you log a forest is that you remove almost all of the tree ferns. That further dries out the forest floor.\"</p><p>But when native forest logging finally does end, Lindenmayer doesn't want to see the community lose important firefighting skills brought by contractors, who routinely use their bulldozers and other heavy equipment to clear dangerous trees and build fire breaks. He hopes they one day will become part of an elite firefighting force.</p><p>Powelltown logging contractor Peter McConachy is sceptical. \"Fires in Victoria are only around, say, two to three months. Is [Daniel Andrews] going to pay us for our machinery ??? for 12 months' work? Because we have dozers, we have excavators - they all have monthly payments on them.\"</p><p>McConachy, 63, is part of a sawmilling family that spans five generations and has been employed by the Department of Land, Water and Planning (DLWP) to fight every fire since Ash Wednesday in 1983. He questions Lindenmayer's claim that logging makes them any more fire-prone, pointing to state-owned harvester VicForests figures showing that of 450,000 hectares available in Victoria, only 3000 hectares, or 0.04 per cent, is taken each year. \"Locking up forests and stopping the loggers is not going to stop a bushfire. It's not the answer.\"</p><p>Back in Melbourne, Hardman is less interested in whether a forest is disturbed by man (logging) or nature (bushfires). \"Every forest, either through man-made disturbances or natural disturbances, will have a range of age classes. And at different age classes, different forests offer different levels of flammability.\"</p><p>Hardman says FFMV will adapt to the changing risks and threats by taking lessons from fires in Victoria and other parts of Australia. Sections of forest that pose a particular fuel risk to communities will continue to be purposefully burnt and, in the future, the more flammable parts of forests, such as the ridgetops, western and northern slopes, may be the subject of \"large-scale broad fuel treatments\", creating a \"mosaic pattern\" with the aim of suppressing fires caused by lightning strikes.</p><p>Though we may do our best to manage their intensity and impact, bushfires are part of the landscape. \"On a Black Saturday-type day we would be doing aggressive first attacks; we'd be attacking every single fire in the bush as hard and as fast as we can,\" says Hardman.</p><p>\"But if some of those fires get away then we'll just be trying to get people out the way as fast as we can.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520221485</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWR-7501-DY19-C3T0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1441\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Mindful of bushfires, they set out for somewhere wet. It led them to Terania Creek, a pocket of cheap farmland not far from the hippy epicentre of Australia, Nimbin, in NSW's lush north-east. The couple bought 100 hectares of land for $20,000. \"We wanted to live a simplified lifestyle, and that worked,\" says Nan. \"Except that we soon found out that the rainforest nearby was to be logged. We weren't expecting that.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On August 16, 1979, despite more than four years of writing letters to politicians, the bulldozer and two forestry trucks arrived to begin work. But Terania Creek had been changing demographically, and the loggers found themselves greeted by 200 singing, guitar-playing protesters. Nan and Hugh's one-room cabin became campaign headquarters, 120 police were sent in and 17 people were arrested. Suddenly, Terania Creek was national news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The month-long dispute eventually swung the way of the greenies and, in 1982, the Wran state government protected 120,000 hectares. Australia's first environmental blockade became a template for campaigns to follow, including the Franklin River in Tasmania and Victoria's East Gippsland native forests.</p><p>But last November, Nan and Hugh watched as Terania Creek burned. Lack of rain, extremely dry conditions and climate change had conspired to make the usually wet and lush understorey vulnerable. Despite the local community's best efforts, flames \"trickled through\" the dry leaf litter until they got into the big trees and ignited the canopy.</p><p>Nan estimates about half of the forest has been burnt. \"I still haven't come to terms with the grief, I'm putting it off,\" she says. \"This forest is so beloved, not just by Hugh and I, because we've been working on rainforests our whole lives, but the whole community utterly loves the surrounding forests and has worked so hard to protect them.\"</p><p>\"When I first started firefighting [the season extended from] December to the end of February, mid-March,\" says Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV) chief Chris Hardman, who has been fighting fires for more than 30 years. \"Anecdotally, now it's first of November through to April 30.\"</p><p>The lesser-known cousin of the Country Fire Authority (CFA), Hardman's team is responsible for fighting fires in state forests, national parks and other conservation areas that span a third of the state - that's all public land and nearly 8 million hectares of forest. To do that it relies on 2800 personnel and a fleet of 50 aircraft (with another 100 on call). It also boasts Australia's only rappelling firefighters, trained to drop into remote forested areas down ropes from helicopters.</p><p>Could Victoria's rainforests suffer the same fate as those in NSW? Hardman says the short answer is yes: \"Where you get long-term drought or lack of rainfall and the soils are dry, which means the fuels are dry, we will see our wet forests burn more readily.\"</p><p> Last year, Victoria weathered just over 2000 bushfires, with 95 per cent of those kept to under five hectares, according to FFMV figures. Hardman says firefighters can no longer rely on patches of rain forest and wet gullies to form natural breaks.</p><p>The Victorian National Parks Association's Phil Ingamells is concerned that fire has moved through the high-altitude temperate rainforests of the Errinundra Plateau in East Gippsland: \"Some ecosystems are very resilient to repeated fire, like grasslands, but others really cannot handle frequent fire.\"</p><p>Although wetter forests, such as those in West Gippsland, would be unlikely to ignite at this time of year, come March or April it's a different story.</p><p>\"If you get four or five days of 40 degrees and you get those big, windy blow-up days, then fire will move through the landscape and it's beyond human capacity to do anything about that, no matter what,\" Hardman says.</p><p>In September, researchers from the CFA and the Bureau of Meteorology published a paper with the catchy title <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335942313_Understanding_the_variability_of_Australian_fire_weather_between_1973_and_2017\">Understanding the variability of Australian fire weather between 1973 and 2017</url>. After examining 44 years of seasonal fire weather history from 39 weather stations across the country, Sarah Harris and Chris Lucas concluded that \"human-induced climate change is the most likely driver behind Australia's earlier and longer fire seasons\".</p><p>Although we should still expect variability from one season to the next due to changes in climatic conditions (El Nino, the Indian Ocean Dipole and the Southern Annular Mode), Victorians may have special cause for concern. \"There is also a long-term upward trend in fire weather, with the strongest trend found in southern Australia, in spring,\" they wrote.</p><p>The pattern of longer fire seasons and more frequent fires has others worried, too. The Australian National University's Professor David Lindenmayer is a forest ecologist interested in biodiversity. \"Many species of plants and animals are able to deal with a single major fire event in terms of their populations recovering. But once you start to have many events in rapid succession, then you really have a problem.\"</p><p>Lindenmayer is particularly concerned about the wet mountain ash forests to the north-east of Melbourne. Here, he says, the \"fire return interval\" (the time elapsed between major fires) should be about 100 years, which allows the ecosystem time to regenerate. \"But that's changing in Victoria quite dramatically,\" he says. \"In the Central Highlands region, which is so important for supplying almost all the water for the city, we've had fires in 1926, 1932, massive fires in 1939, 1983 and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/interactive/2019/black-saturday-kilmore-to-murrindindi-the-devastating-bushfires-line-of-destruction-10-years-ago/\">the catastrophic 2009 fires</url>. The sheer number of fires and how quickly they're returning to the system tells us that the fire regime is changing.\"</p><p>Lindenmayer applauds the Andrews government for recently announcing the phase-out of native forest logging by 2030, although he wants it to happen even sooner.</p><p>\"When you cut all the trees down and then you regrow the forest, that regrown forest becomes much more prone to high severity fire,\" he says, adding that this is due to extra fuel from timber debris and the action of new, thirsty saplings drying out the forest floor.</p><p>\"The other thing that happens when you log a forest is that you remove almost all of the tree ferns. That further dries out the forest floor.\"</p><p>But when native forest logging finally does end, Lindenmayer doesn't want to see the community lose important firefighting skills brought by contractors, who routinely use their bulldozers and other heavy equipment to clear dangerous trees and build fire breaks. He hopes they one day will become part of an elite firefighting force.</p><p>Powelltown logging contractor Peter McConachy is sceptical. \"Fires in Victoria are only around, say, two to three months. Is [Daniel Andrews] going to pay us for our machinery ??? for 12 months' work? Because we have dozers, we have excavators - they all have monthly payments on them.\"</p><p>McConachy, 63, is part of a sawmilling family that spans five generations and has been employed by the Department of Land, Water and Planning (DLWP) to fight every fire since Ash Wednesday in 1983. He questions Lindenmayer's claim that logging makes them any more fire-prone, pointing to state-owned harvester VicForests figures showing that of 450,000 hectares available in Victoria, only 3000 hectares, or 0.04 per cent, is taken each year. \"Locking up forests and stopping the loggers is not going to stop a bushfire. It's not the answer.\"</p><p>Back in Melbourne, Hardman is less interested in whether a forest is disturbed by man (logging) or nature (bushfires). \"Every forest, either through man-made disturbances or natural disturbances, will have a range of age classes. And at different age classes, different forests offer different levels of flammability.\"</p><p>Hardman says FFMV will adapt to the changing risks and threats by taking lessons from fires in Victoria and other parts of Australia. Sections of forest that pose a particular fuel risk to communities will continue to be purposefully burnt and, in the future, the more flammable parts of forests, such as the ridgetops, western and northern slopes, may be the subject of \"large-scale broad fuel treatments\", creating a \"mosaic pattern\" with the aim of suppressing fires caused by lightning strikes.</p><p>Though we may do our best to manage their intensity and impact, bushfires are part of the landscape. \"On a Black Saturday-type day we would be doing aggressive first attacks; we'd be attacking every single fire in the bush as hard and as fast as we can,\" says Hardman.</p><p>\"But if some of those fires get away then we'll just be trying to get people out the way as fast as we can.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520221485</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XWR-7501-DY19-C3SH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1441\"/><timeReceived>00:00 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Mallacoota resident Sean Rainey said gusty winds were now pushing a fire, burning on the other side of the lake, to the south.</p><p>\"I guess a whole lot of smoke has gone up and covered the sky,\" he said.</p><p>\"It took about 15 minutes to go from pretty much deep yellow to blood red and pretty much black.</p><p>\"You know there's lots of embers falling out of the sky, but they're pretty much burnt up and, yeah, we're told ... it is pretty safe.\"</p><p>Amy Houghton, who is waiting to be evacuated from Mallacoota along with her two-year-old son and her 92-year-old grandmother, said air evacuations planned for Saturday afternoon had been cancelled due to the smoke.</p><p>Erin Lehman, who is also waiting to be evacuated along with her three children, said the situation was still \"a bit scary\" as the sky moved from darkness to orange and back to darkness.</p><p>\"The smoke's horrendous and that's my concern with my kids,\" she said.</p><p>\"What's going to be the long term effects on their health being exposed to all this smoke for extended periods of time.</p><p>\"It's quite difficult trying to keep a mask on a four-year-old and a two-year-old.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, authorities said a relief centre at Sale, west of the fires, was beginning to overflow and encouraged those who could to drive further west to the Latrobe Valley town of Morwell.</p><p>Fuel won't arrive in time to keep power on in Mallacoota, Omeo</p><p>Several bushfire-affected communities have already lost power and phone connections and authorities have warned generators in Mallacoota and Omeo are running out of power.</p><p>Ausnet said fuel they had hoped would reach the East Gippsland towns had not arrived, and it was estimated the generators had between 12 and 36 hours of power left.</p><p>\"Obviously charge your communication devices, charge your backup power packs and anything you need to do to stay healthy and well,\" Ausnet's Steve Brown told ABC Gippsland.</p><p>\"The ADF [Australian Defence Force] has got a lot on their plate at the moment, so we probably aren't going to get those fuel deliveries in time to keep the generators going unfortunately. \"</p><p>Meanwhile, Telstra said of roughly 25 mobile tower sites hit by bushfires across eastern Victoria, about 15 had been restored.</p><p>Technicians had been unable to get to Cudgewa and Bonang

but the full scale of the damage is not yet known after thousands of people fled threatened communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There's still many, many communities that we've not been able to really get into and do a proper assessment,\" he said.</p><p>Premier Daniel Andrews said the number of people missing had been revised down from 21 to six, but the state was by \"no means out of this\".</p><p>\"Our biggest concern at the moment is very significant fire activity in the north-east of the state,\" Premier Daniel Andrews said this evening.</p><p>\"We have about 1,000 firefighters on the fire ground.\"</p><p>In the East Gippsland town of Omeo, residents have described seeing the sky turn red, and then black, as a fire front hit.</p><p>Around 50 people were evacuated using Army helicopters as residents huddled on a sports oval.</p><p>Local Brian Hadden said it had been \"a hell of a day\".</p><p>\"I can see lots of wind and hell of a lot of smoke,\" he told ABC Gippsland this afternoon.</p><p>\"Where I am at the Omeo Recreation Reserve, there is about six or seven big choppers, army and police.\"</p><p>Alpine and border towns face overnight threat</p><p>Just to the west, bushfires are threatening Alpine communities at Dinner Plain, Mount Hotham, Falls Creek and Bright, with hot temperatures persisting into the night.</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said there was a risk fires that had threatened Harrietville and Wandiligong could flare and impact the popular tourist town of Bright as well.</p><p>\"So we are doing what we can, but keeping a very close eye on that particular fire and the potential impact into those valleys,\" he said.</p><p>Close to the border, Commissioner Crisp said <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-02/fears-bushfires-in-north-east-victoria-could-merge/11837430\">the destructive blaze that hit the outskirts of Corryong earlier in the week</url> was being pushed back towards the town, as well as Tintaldra and Towong.</p><p>He said property losses in those towns were likely as the Victorian blaze came together with another fire burning parallel to it over the NSW border.</p><p>Many residents from that region evacuated to Tallangatta, Wangaratta and Wodonga on Friday.</p><p>On Saturday, Australian Defence Force members ran further evacuations from Tallangatta to take people further back from the fire zone.</p><p>Authorities said forecast \"firestorm conditions which may not be survivable\" were playing out, with a \"significant\" increase in fire activity.</p><p>Cooler temperatures which swept East Gippsland are taking longer to reach the north-east, with Albury still sitting at 41C at 6:00pm.</p><p>The Murray Valley Highway has been closed because of the risk of it being hit by fire.</p><p>Euroa bushfire threatens Hume Freeway</p><p>Firefighters were further stretched in the afternoon when a new blaze broke out near Euroa, south-west of Wangaratta, and began to head towards the Hume Freeway.</p><p>A large air tanker dropped fire retardant on the Euroa service centre in the path of the blaze and some freeway lanes were closed.</p><p>About 50 trucks and aircraft were sent to Euroa and the spread of the fire was slowed, but authorities warned that could change at any time overnight.</p><p>The freeway is one of Victoria's biggest roads, linking Melbourne to the north-east of the state and on to Sydney.</p><p>Southbound lanes of the freeway at Euroa will remain closed overnight, with traffic detoured through the town before a hazard assessment can be done on Sunday.</p><p>Omeo residents shelter together, Cann River cut off</p><p>Before the helicopter evacuations from Omeo began, Sandy Beltrame from the Omeo Caravan Park said about 150 people were sheltering at the local recreation reserve as she and other residents prepared to defend their homes.</p><p>\"How am I feeling at the moment? I've got my big girl pants on, and my big girl shirt over the top of it and a broad brim hat and lots of hoses ready to go,\" she said.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-04/nsw-victoria-bushfire-conditions-to-worsen-until-unstoppable/11839672\">Authorities had been warning communities across Victoria's declared disaster zone to evacuate the area before today</url>, amid fears the extreme weather would make bushfires unstoppable.</p><p>This afternoon, five evacuation notices and more than a dozen emergency warnings were in place in the state's east and north-east.</p><p>Mr Gillham said residents at Cann River, who were urged to evacuate this week, were \"essentially isolated\" now as fire moved towards them from the east.</p><p>\"We have been in there with the Australian Defence Force aircraft and we have also conveyed people out of Cann River but it is essentially an isolated community, the road is completely blocked by fallen trees,\" he told ABC Gippsland.</p><p>Ember attack at Club Terrace</p><p>Club Terrace is another community where residents have been cut off by trees on roads.</p><p>This afternoon, ABC Radio Melbourne caller Graham said the sky had turned red there, and he and other residents were waiting to fight fires as the area came under ember attack.</p><p>\"It's been completely blacked out and red again. But all we can see near us is a few flare-ups,\" he said.</p><p>About 50 firefighters from the United States are preparing to join the battle against the East Gippsland bushfires, which authorities estimate have torn through more than 700,000 hectares of land.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria's deputy chief fire officer Beth Roberts said authorities were working to juggle both firefighting and relief as they responded to the \"unprecedented\" bushfire emergency across East Gippsland.</p><p>\"While we are absolutely concentrating on response, it is important for us to be looking at immediate relief and recovery,\" she said.</p><p>Late this afternoon, cooler temperatures reached East Gippsland. It dropped to 17 degrees Celsius at Mount Nowa Nowa and 20C at Orbost, a dramatic drop from 40C earlier in the day.</p><p>'Lots of embers falling out of the sky' in Mallacoota</p><p>Days after Mallacoota was cut off by bushfires, prompting the evacuation of more than 900 people by sea, the sky has turned black once again.</p><p>The town was devastated by fire on New Year's Eve. Mallacoota resident Sean Rainey said gusty winds were now pushing a fire, burning on the other side of the lake, to the south.</p><p>\"I guess a whole lot of smoke has gone up and covered the sky,\" he said.</p><p>\"It took about 15 minutes to go from pretty much deep yellow to blood red and pretty much black.</p><p>\"You know there's lots of embers falling out of the sky, but they're pretty much burnt up and, yeah, we're told ... it is pretty safe.\"</p><p>Amy Houghton, who is waiting to be evacuated from Mallacoota along with her two-year-old son and her 92-year-old grandmother, said air evacuations planned for Saturday afternoon had been cancelled due to the smoke.</p><p>Erin Lehman, who is also waiting to be evacuated along with her three children, said the situation was still \"a bit scary\" as the sky moved from darkness to orange and back to darkness.</p><p>\"The smoke's horrendous and that's my concern with my kids,\" she said.</p><p>\"What's going to be the long term effects on their health being exposed to all this smoke for extended periods of time.</p><p>\"It's quite difficult trying to keep a mask on a four-year-old and a two-year-old.\"</p><p>Meanwhile, authorities said a relief centre at Sale, west of the fires, was beginning to overflow and encouraged those who could to drive further west to the Latrobe Valley town of Morwell.</p><p>Fuel won't arrive in time to keep power on in Mallacoota, Omeo</p><p>Several bushfire-affected communities have already lost power and phone connections and authorities have warned generators in Mallacoota and Omeo are running out of power.</p><p>Ausnet said fuel they had hoped would reach the East Gippsland towns had not arrived, and it was estimated the generators had between 12 and 36 hours of power left.</p><p>\"Obviously charge your communication devices, charge your backup power packs and anything you need to do to stay healthy and well,\" Ausnet's Steve Brown told ABC Gippsland.</p><p>\"The ADF [Australian Defence Force] has got a lot on their plate at the moment, so we probably aren't going to get those fuel deliveries in time to keep the generators going unfortunately. \"</p><p>Meanwhile, Telstra said of roughly 25 mobile tower sites hit by bushfires across eastern Victoria, about 15 had been restored.</p><p>Technicians had been unable to get to Cudgewa and Bonang so had been working with emergency services to deliver satellite phones to those places.</p><p>The Alpine community of Dartmouth was told it would lose power from 7:00pm and the town was experiencing power surges during the afternoon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Things are looking a bit dicey with our suppliers in the Middle East but I am sure you are \"on to it\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jonathan Emes, Ballarat</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yarra Valley has changed</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Thank you for the editorial - \"Make safer country roads a priority\" (The Age, 9/1). I am concerned about the safety on the Maroondah Highway between Coldstream and Healesville.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As many wineries now populate this road and the surrounding areas, driving at 100km/h for locals - while tourists are looking for their destinations - is no longer viable and accidents are occurring. Heavy farming machinery needs road access as well. If the speed limit were lowered to 80km/h, drivers would have time to adjust to the conditions. Now, at 100km/h, there is no time at all.</p><p>Lynne Donchi, Coldstream</p><p>Congested fire exits</p><p>The aerial photo of a housing estate (Letter, 8/1) is an excellent example of the lack of two exits to an estate of nearly 100 households causing potential trapping of residents in the event of a bushfire.</p><p>In my fringe town of Kilmore, since Black Saturday, many new housing developments with courts and only one exit for emergencies have been approved. There has also been no access improvement for similar older estates. Neither state nor local governments have provided funding for escape routes from these areas. How long will it be before such estates on the fringe of Melbourne are impacted by severe bushfires and residents are unable to leave safely?</p><p>Anne Rose, Kilmore</p><p>Protesting for our future</p><p>Ellen Mcgregor says climate activists who plan to protest on Friday \"lack understanding and consideration for the emergency services and the people who have been traumatised by the bushfires\" (Letters, 9/1). The same could be said for anyone participating in any community activity which requires police attendance. Anyone for cricket? Or how about some alcohol and fireworks on New Year's Eve?</p><p>These protests are part of a nationwide action and cannot simply be shuffled to a time that better suits those in the government who would like to close down discussion on global warming. We will be protesting on behalf of bushfire victims, farms and forests dying from drought, emergency workers who are being asked to save a country from its own folly - on behalf of all of our wildlife, rivers, oceans and wetlands. In these times of climate peril, a quiet Australian is a dead Australian.Jenny Zimmerman,</p><p>Woodend</p><p>Don't do as I do. . .</p><p>Scott Morrison tells us that places like a scorched Kangaroo Island are still great holiday spots and encourages us to go there to support the local economies (The Age, 9/1). Is this why he chose to go to Hawaii for his holiday?</p><p>Eric Butcher, Eltham</p><p>We know all the answers</p><p>Is the proposed royal commission into the bushfires an expensive way of appearing to do something? Scott Morrison refused to meet with 23 former fire and emergency leaders and ignored specialist advice. The answers are already available. The millions of dollars can be better spent</p><p>John Young, North Fitzroy</p><p>The PM's unenviable job</p><p>All who criticise Scott Morrison should reflect on how they would cope with not only dealing with the bushfire crisis, but being on top of what is happening with Iran plus demands of countless lobby groups and all that his ministers refer to him. He is never out of contact and is available 24/7. And then there is the relentless media seeking to trip him up and never complimenting him on what he is actually achieving. Few could handle it.</p><p>John Weymouth,</p><p>Ringwood East</p><p>High cost of our lifestyles</p><p>Ken Barnes (Letters, 8/1) hits the nail on the head. We are all responsible for this tragedy. We continue to live our profligate lifestyles, build massive homes, drive huge cars, eat prodigious amounts of red meat and use disposable items as though there were no alternative. All these excesses contribute to the destruction of our planet but we make little or no effort to change.</p><p>We got what we deserve but sadly, our most vulnerable people and our beloved native animals and birds are the ones who suffer.</p><p>Judy Addison, Barwon Heads</p><p>The government's duty</p><p>Barbara Kingston (Letters, 8/1) raises some valid points regarding our consumption of \"things\". However, to absolve our politicians (especially the federal government which is responsible for our climate policy) from the need to take action is ridiculous.</p><p>There are many ways in which they could drive policy to reduce our greenhouse emissions and, by doing so now, as global leaders could actually help the budget surplus in the not so distant future.</p><p>Chrissie Schubert, Windsor</p><p>Red tape protects us</p><p>When I see the headline \"Recovery boss vows to slash red tape\" (The Age, 8/1), I immediately see the door open to shonky operators. Think deadly roof insulation, faulty solar panel installations, and the vocational and training college rorts. Our bushfire victims deserve better than this.</p><p>Glenn Hilling, Watsonia North</p><p>The choice where to live</p><p>Old saying to sharks: \"I won't swim in your ocean if you don't swim in my pool\". The same may be analogous of people who choose to live in the volatile Australian bush.</p><p>Greg Reiffel, Hoppers Crossing</p><p>Dangerous chemicals</p><p>Climate change deniers may argue that pollutants produced by the burning of fossil fuels are not affecting the climate. However, what is difficult to deny is that some chemicals released from myriad human activities have been found in the tissues of wildlife in remote parts of the planet far away from their source.</p><p>Some of these chemicals have been detected in the air we breathe, the water we drink, the breast milk we feed our young, the food we eat, and even some of our body tissues. Whether they play a role in the development of any of the dozens of unexplained cancers and autoimmune diseases remains to be determined but seems likely.Alfred Poulos,</p><p>retired professor of genetics/biochemistry, Thornbury</p><p>Importance of language</p><p>Are the 2019-20 Victorian bushfires \"unprecedented\" given thus far that three lives have been lost, and 1.2 million hectares, 110 homes and 220 outbuildings have been burnt (The Age 5/1)? Fire has been present for millions of years.</p><p>According to the Forest Fire Management Victoria website: In terms of total area burnt, the 1851 (5 million hectares) and 1939 (1.5 to 2 million hectares) fires were larger. The 2006-07 (1.2 million hectares) and 2003 (1.3 million hectares) fires were comparable. Black Saturday 2009 (173 lives) and Black Friday 1939 (71 lives) led to greater loss of life. In 2009, 2000 properties and 80 businesses were burnt. Make no mistake, these are big, intense fires but let us be careful about the language used to describe them.</p><p>Stephen Platt, Rosanna</p><p>A culture to be proud of</p><p>Acknowledging the wisdom of Aboriginal practices, such as cultural burning, respecting the land and adopting traditional agricultural practices, would go a long way towards preventing future bushfire disasters. We have arrogantly ignored Aboriginal wisdom for the past 200 or so years. Embracing this ancient culture and forming a treaty with our Indigenous Australians would give us all a culture to be proud of, and a significant date that would give genuine meaning to the term \"Australia Day\". We are the only commonwealth country that has failed to form a treaty with its Indigenous population.</p><p>Sue Lyons, Carlton North</p><p>The pollies we need</p><p>The fires have seen so many Australians respond magnificently with empathy, generosity, courage and action. This has won them admiration and respect. How happy it would be if our politicians, especially the party hierarchies, responded in ways that won for them that same community regard. Dare we hope?</p><p>Murray Ainsworth,</p><p>Hawthorn East</p><p>Welcome all our refugees</p><p>As I watched HMAS Choules rescue refugees from burning Mallacoota, it occurred to me how cruel it would be to use it to turn refugees back to where they came from, or incarcerate them in a distant island, in order to deter others wanting to escape similar fires. That is what we have done with refugees seeking the safety of our shores. Perhaps it is time for some of the empathy we feel for our countrymen to ripple to those outside our borders, as people from overseas feel for us now.</p><p>We could bring all the refugees from New Guinea and Nauru to Australia, where they could provide valuable support to our exhausted survivors. The many millions of dollars spent on keeping them idle could be used to diminish our coming deficit. And if they felt like staying in this country, they could help in the massive rebuilding to come. We certainly do not need them to suffer in order to deter others from coming to our shores. Our country does not look very appealing at the moment.</p><p>Paul Valent, South Yarra</p><p>Fair go for Boomers</p><p>Some sympathy goes to your editors in trying to find a suitable headline - \"Blame new era of low growth, low rates on Boomers\" (Business, 9/1) - to fit the complexities of Stephen Bartholomeusz' take on the economy. However, please spare us the tired blaming and labelling of a particular generation.</p><p>John Phillips, Carlton North</p><p>Please, give us a break</p><p>John Meaney (Letters, 9/1), I could not agree more with your comment about annoying advertisements on television. My mute button was hit nine times the other night. Not only does the ad annoy me beyond measure, it is the number of times that it is on. I will never use that advertiser.</p><p>Val Hyde, Blackburn North</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc78rpot4wqw61j7pvcmtw</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY1-24X1-F0J6-J4H2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1569\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Many scientific studies have shown that under extreme climatic conditions, fuel reduction burning will have little impact on bushfire severity and that burning well away from human assets will do little to protect them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Daniel Andrews correctly stated that burning off must only be done in strategic areas to protect human assets. Victoria's policy was developed after comprehensive reviews of the Black Saturday royal commission's recommendations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fuel reduction burning is only effective in moderating fire behaviour under milder weather conditions and for the first few years after burning. It does many undesirable things, such as destroying plant and animal species and wildlife habitat, creating more flammable forests, and increasing death of vegetation by promoting disease fungi.</p><p>A focus on fuel reduction seems badly misplaced when 90 per cent of all fires in Victoria are caused by people - 27 per cent of such fires are due to arsonists and 63 per cent are due to accidents.Michael Feller (professor emeritus, faculty of forestry, University of British Columbia), Healesville</p><p>In favour of burning</p><p>The argument that fuel reduction burns are pointless because they have failed to stop fires under extreme conditions is akin to arguing that seatbelt laws are useless because drivers wearing seatbelts have been killed in car accidents. Both measures are of benefit during most conditions.</p><p>Nick Barton, Hillside</p><p>Lessons from disasters</p><p>Amid the devastation of the bushfires and subsequent analysis and political blaming, it is important to celebrate that so many people heeded the emergency warnings and left areas of extreme danger. Technology - such as the VicEmergency app - has been used for accurate forecasting of weather and fire behaviour, and that has enabled accurate warnings to the public.</p><p>We now lament the loss of property and infrastructure, forest, wildlife and stock, and tragically mourn the loss of two people's lives in Victoria. Let us give thanks that the number of fatalities have been so few in contrast to Ash Wednesday and Black Saturday. Much was learnt from those disasters and that has surely saved many in the face of this crisis.Christine Sebire,</p><p>Echuca</p><p>Disaster management 101</p><p>When the going gets tough, the tough ... make an advertisement, get public endorsement from John Howard, and announce a review to be conducted by Philip Ruddock. Two out of three so far.</p><p>Richard Clarke, Malvern</p><p>Sport stars with big hearts</p><p>Sam Duncan (Comment, 7/1) rightly commends our sports stars, headed by Nick Kyrgios, for their wonderful support for the bushfire victims. This shows that as well as their amazing talent, they also have, in spades, empathy, generosity and a true Christian spirit. I wonder if Israel Folau has dipped into his multimillion-dollar payout and shown us the real meaning of his Christianity?</p><p>Liz Harvey, Mount Eliza</p><p>Manage money well. . .</p><p>With so many agencies and individuals donating money to bushfire victims, there needs to be a central fund to collect donations. Otherwise how can the public be assured their donations are really going to the most needy cases? The fund could be controlled and audited by an accounting firm. Local councils could quickly distribute the funds as they have the best knowledge of properties which have been affected.</p><p>David Fry, Moonee Ponds</p><p>. . . and avoid duplication</p><p>Why do our political leaders think that creating more agencies is the correct response to recovery from the fires? My experience as a very senior CFA officer was that locals are best able to manage the recovery process.</p><p>Councils may not be perfect for some purposes but they do perform extremely well in times of trauma and emergency because they understand the needs of their people. They will allocate any funds provided to them quickly, fairly and to greatest benefit of the affected communities. We do not need more bureaucracy to complicate and duplicate the established recovery arrangements.Ian Symons,</p><p>Drouin</p><p>The timing isn't right</p><p>The climate change activists who plan to protest on Friday lack understanding and consideration for the emergency services and the people who have been traumatised by the bushfires. There is no valid reason as to why this protest cannot be held in a few weeks' time. Why not have a media boycott of the event but a promise to cover protests that are held in the future?Ellen Mcgregor,</p><p>Frankston</p><p>The fires' economic cost</p><p>How many beehives have been lost in the fires across the country? Agriculture and dairy products as well as honey supplies will be in short supply over the coming months. Food costs for everyone will rise. Fewer people will dine out. Cafes and restaurants will feel the pinch. Jobs will inevitably go. Just think what a forward-thinking and planning government could have done. And as for Craig Kelly on British television. He is a walking denial disaster.</p><p>Elaine O'Shannessy, Buxton</p><p>Getting our comeuppance</p><p>All those United Nations representatives and the like who have had to listen to Australia's excuses for its lack of action on climate change and who mourn with us now as Australia burns. I wonder, can we Aussies blame them if the thought pops up in their heads: \"It serves them right\".</p><p>Judie Litchfield,</p><p>Sandringham</p><p>Ignore any further advice</p><p>So the Prime Minister has been \"consulting his mentor John Howard\" about the fires (Letters, 7/1). In further mentoring, will Howard blindly recommend Australia's ongoing and unwinnable involvement in Donald Trump's escalating Middle East hostilities? As Howard himself gave ignorant support to Tony Blair's and George W. Bush's \"weapons of mass destruction\".</p><p>Karen Fry, Bairnsdale</p><p>Protecting his children</p><p>Will any of Donald Trump's sons or daughters go to war, or are bone spurs hereditary?</p><p>Richard Hughes, Woodend</p><p>Act now to avoid war</p><p>Former presidents of the United States must now band together, regardless of their political affiliations, and demand that Congress immediately censure Donald Trump's irrational behaviour and enable emergency legislation preventing actions from the White House that can escalate further tensions in the Middle East and beyond.</p><p>Maurie Johns, Mount Eliza</p><p>Our voice of desperation</p><p>Australia begging to stay in Iraq (The Age, 8/1): \"Please don't make me leave. Remember I came to save you from a dictator and give you democracy, regardless of the United Nations' wishes. Your economy and infrastructure may be in ruins, many Iraqis have died needlessly but I am your willing coalition friend. Please let me stay.\"Ludi Servadei,</p><p>Malvern East</p><p>Reneging on agreement</p><p>It looks like there will be another war in the Middle East and hundreds of thousands of people may die, with millions displaced. Why? There was an agreement in place, with the United States a party to it. The US reneged on it and imposed severe sanctions on Iran. Australia, despite supporting this agreement, as did most of the world, remained quiet regarding the unilateral repudiation of it.</p><p>Withdrawal from the agreement was instigated and supported by two leaders who have been subject to criminal investigations and, but for the technicality of immunity due to incumbency, might have been prosecuted and jailed under their own judicial systems. In that case, war would not be an issue.</p><p>Carlo Ursida, Kensington</p><p>Don't 'average out' cricket</p><p>We might be talking about \"salvaging the classic form of the game by shortening it\", Greg Baum (Sport, 7/1), but at the risk of savaging Test cricket. Women's Tests are played over four days and are so undervalued as a spectacle that they are infrequently scheduled. The fifth day is not a bonus day; it sets the parameters of the game as it unfolds, giving rise to a declaration, or enforcing the opponents to follow-on, to substantial run partnerships and valiant individual scores, with changes in the pitch (and weather) integral to the long form.</p><p>Test cricket is a battle of minds and bodies with long practised skills, session after session, where neither team may win after five days but a long fight to draw can be its own victory. If, as Baum suggests, the move is an attempt to \"average out cricket\" across all shortened forms, I fear that we will end up with average cricket.</p><p>Lisa Frazer, Templestowe</p><p>Sportsmanship, NZ style</p><p>We may have won the recent cricket Test series against New Zealand but the Kiwis won hands down when it came to sportsmanship. There was little or no sledging. When Marcus Labuschagne reached 200, many of the Kiwi fielders applauded him and when he was finally out, several ran over to him as he was leaving the field and congratulated him. Haven't seen that in a long time.John Cummings, Anglesea</p><p>Enough with the ads</p><p>Could The Age please run a poll on the most annoying advertisements on television. I used to enjoy sitting down at night with a glass of wine to watch my favourite programs. Now I sit with the remote control ready to hit the mute button when a certain ad for hotel bookings comes on. At least with a newspaper advertisement, you can skip it if it is of no interest to you but an annoying TV ad just makes you respond negatively to that advertiser.John Meaney,</p><p>Frankston South</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc78r6yj9i08gzkz46jkp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXT-5851-F0J6-J3WK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1539\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

We are talking about 60, 70 metre flame heights, 60, 70 metre flame heights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">FIRE FIGHTER: Get into the water, it's chaos. I've never seen anything like it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LUCY CARTER, REPORTER: Thousands of people right across Australia had their lives changed forever this summer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On New Year's Eve, fire all but wiped Cobargo off the map.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">JADE CORBY, COBARGO RESIDENT: So we were going around, my brother and my brother-in-law were going around and that, putting out spot fires and protecting what they could, when they could.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: As the fire front approached, Jade Corby, his wife and two sons fled to his brother's house on the outskirts of Cobargo.</p><p>JADE CORBY: Until it got that bad that it was right up against the house and then we all just come back, fell back to the house and just looked after the house.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: His own family home and most of his livestock were wiped out.</p><p>JADE CORBY: Strange when you see what it left, what it took. Just little things you'd find that it didn't burn.</p><p>The young fella's little four-wheeler motorbike is sitting only probably five metres from the house and the fire burnt right around it and everything. Didn't even burn tyres off it. It's still sitting there and the house and the ground, you know, there is nothing left of the house.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Life is slowly returning to normal for the Corby's. They now rent a property a few kilometres from where their old home used to stand.</p><p>JADE CORBY: It hasn't been easy but there's a lot of people that are worse off out there.</p><p>A lot of families that are harder done by but we were all safe so that was the main thing.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: This bushfire season has been nothing short of extraordinary. More than 8 million hectares of land has burned, 33 people have died, and more than 2,500 homes destroyed.</p><p>An unexpectedly early and severe start to Queensland's fire season was quickly followed by fatal fires on the New South Wales North Coast.</p><p>ROB ROGERS, DEPUTY COMMISSIONER, NSW RURAL FIRE SERVICE: We're having extreme fire danger and I think that's unprecedented at this time of year in the state.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Dry lightning in the New South Wales Blue Mountains ignited a blaze that would later become the nation's biggest ever forest fire.</p><p>Massive blazes in almost every Australian state and territory followed, with temperature records shattered and thousands of homes lost.</p><p>GLADYS BEREJIKLIAN, PREMIER OF NEW SOUTH WALES: I have accepted the advice of Commissioner Fitzsimmons and declared a state of emergency.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: The New Year saw Australians cowering on beaches under blood-red skies and the Defence Force called in for emergency evacuations.</p><p>LISA NEVILLE, VICTORIAN MINISTER FOR POLICE AND EMERGENCY SERVICES: I wish I could say this was over, but we've still got a long way to go.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Widespread rain finally extinguished most of the fires in early February, but officially this fire season isn't over yet.</p><p>SHANE FITZSIMMONS, RFS COMMISSIONER: There is no doubt that this season is unprecedented in terms of the fire danger ratings that we experienced, the ones that were forecast and realised, and then, of course, the amount of area that was burnt by fire.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: The New South Wales Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons has been at the front-line of this disaster from the beginning.</p><p>SHANE FITZSIMMONS: The damage, and death toll particularly, has had a profound effect on all of us that are involved here in New South Wales and right across the country.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Six firefighters are among the dead. It's a burden he shoulders daily.</p><p>SHANE FITZSIMMONS: And the lives of people have changed forever as a result of this fire season.</p><p>DAINTRY GERRAND: Little herbaceous, native herbaceous things coming back from seed.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: For Daintry and Ian Gerrand, life will never be the same.</p><p>DAINTRY GERRAND: Yeah, well you can see, if we hadn't taken out the canopy cover between this big tree, the lilly pilly, and the house, it would have carried right through to the house and been a totally different story.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: They almost lost their home in the November blaze that swept through the tiny town of Johns River.</p><p>DAINTRY GERRAND: When that wind change hit, it would have been kilometres away from us before the change and then it just blew that out and rushed through in minutes.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: A greater danger was facing Daintry's sister, Julie Fletcher, less than two kilometres down the road.</p><p>They couldn't reach her.</p><p>DAINTRY GERRAND: We left a light on, so the fire truck could find the house and then I rang Julie again but it was too late.</p><p>She said that the fire, you know, had come.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: When did you hear about what had happened to Julie?</p><p>DAINTRY GERRAND: I knew when the phone went dead. Well, in my heart I knew.</p><p>But, it wasn't until, well, it wasn't until the early hours of the morning that I was able to get confirmation that the house had burnt down.</p><p>Julie loved the farm and she loved that it was a beautiful environment down there, it was a family farm.</p><p>She was caring. Julie was a really caring and compassionate lady.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: What do you want Australians to know about preparing their homes for bushfire?</p><p>DAINTRY GERRAND: I think we need to all think about how we redesign the gardens around our house, to give us a more defendable space. That space around the house is really important.</p><p>PROFESSOR ROSS BRADSTOCK, UNIVERSITY OF WOLLONGONG: I don't think it's the new normal, but I think it's possibly an indication of the new extreme. Well, a five million or six million hectare season may be the new extreme event.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Ahead of this bushfire season large areas of south-eastern Australia were identified as being extremely dry and vulnerable to fire.</p><p>These maps, produced exclusively for 7.30, show how alarmingly accurate those predictions were.</p><p>Forecasters were still shocked by the amount of land that eventually burned.</p><p>ROSS BRADSTOCK: We've literally had an unprecedented area burned. As of mid-January about 21 per cent of the forests in south-eastern Australia burned and if we examine similar forests elsewhere in the world, the best figure we can come up with in the last 20 years is about 10 per cent.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: While the Federal Government is pushing for increased hazard reduction burning, Professor Ross Bradstock says it may not be the best or most cost effective way to reduce the risk of fire.</p><p>ROSS BRADSTOCK: We might be better off spending money on retro-fitting houses. We might be better off actually modifying vegetation permanently, particularly around the interface between developments and flammable bushland.</p><p>We know that the 50 metres or so around houses is absolutely critical.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Professor Bradstock says climate change means Australians are going to have to come to terms with increased fire danger.</p><p>ROSS BRADSTOCK: The risks posed by bushfires can't be eliminated. They can be mitigated, or reduced to some degree, but that's expensive and it means educating people to understand that there is some background level of risk.</p><p>SHANE FITZSIMMONS: There are legitimate health concerns with polluted air, with smoke in the air.</p><p>The reality is we have got to have a sensible conversation because I can't burn the bush without smoke coming from it. A by-product of combustion is actual smoke and whilst ever we're burning the landscape, and it's an effective tool to help manage fuel loads, whilst it is not an panacea, it it's an effective tool, it has side effects.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Kangaroo Island, off the coast of South Australia, has been one of the worst affected areas.</p><p>It's been about two months since fire ripped through and destroyed more than half of the island, but so many residents are still struggling.</p><p>They are camping on their own land and relying on handouts to stay afloat.</p><p>JADE HINTON: It's unbelievable. Most of what I've seen out the west end here, like people's properties, have just been annihilated and they've got nothing, nothing left.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Jade Hinton is running a makeshift recovery centre for the west of the island from the change rooms of the sports club.</p><p>JADE HINTON: This is them here. Do you reckon you would use the smaller ones?</p><p>LUCY CARTER: She was on the island for a Christmas holiday when the fires started. Almost three months later, Jade is still here.</p><p>JADE HINTON: They're so reliant on what we've got here. I think if we didn't have this, people would be struggling big time.</p><p>RYAN COUCHMAN: Yeah, it's a game changer. The community's never seen anything like this before.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Ryan Couchman estimates the Kangaroo Island fires caused more than a million dollars' worth of damage to his farm.</p><p>RYAN COUCHMAN: We lost all of our pasture, we've lost all of our fences. We've lost between 800 and 900 sheep.</p><p>So basically all we're left with here is the workshop and most of the machinery. Everything else is gone - house, shearing shed, sheds, cars, machinery.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Like so many around Australia, he's going to be hand feeding his surviving animals for months. Getting this farm operational again will take years.</p><p>RYAN COUCHMAN: So going back to a working farm, like we had beforehand, with our shearing sheds and obviously having a house where you can live on-site, is going to make it pretty difficult.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Further west on the edge of Kangaroo Island, Kyra Phillips and her partner, Robert Engelbarts, are still coming to terms with the destruction around them.</p><p>ROBERT ENGELBARTS: I still can't control myself as far as crying. Every time I think of it, because it's just...</p><p>So many animals, didn't stand a chance. Like when we came in here, we found a kangaroo that was blinded on the side of the road. How's that going to survive?</p><p>LUCY CARTER: The couple are camping in the ruins of the farm stay they used to manage.</p><p>ROBERT ENGELBARTS: We lost virtually everything, to be honest. We just took, like, one bag with our passports and etc, and a change of clothes.</p><p>KYRA PHILLIPS: There is families that are underinsured that have children that can't rebuild their homes.</p><p>Where are they going to be in six months' time? That's what us, as a community, is worried about.</p><p>LUCY CARTER: Like so many right across Australia's burned south-east, they're unsure of what the future now holds.</p><p>What's clear is that the recovery will be a long road.</p><p>JADE CORBY: Resilience to me means family and keeping going for the family and keeping strong for the family.</p><p>You know, family means everything to me and that's, I suppose, the thing that keeps me going the most.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-12040534</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YCT-P751-F031-X1FM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1752\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 9, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents:Fires:Bushfire</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

More interesting than the theories themselves, however, are how individuals get drawn into their thrall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IT'S THE day of Joe Biden's inauguration as US President, and conspiracy hives around the world are abuzz with news of his imminent arrest as part of a military coup. As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and Vice-President Kamala Harris will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated ... Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds.</p><p>Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen ... and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening.</p><p>She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on ... I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment ... I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! ... I just want to 'be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning ... the best is yet to come!\" \u00e2\u02c6\u2019 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen.</p><p>\"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos&amp;#xE9;\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song: And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at all The needle returns to the start of the song And we all sing along like before... Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night ... devastated. Can't believe nothing happened ... such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! ... I don't believe a word of their ceremony ... [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his 'crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off ... exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in ... as I believe you feel we all have ...\" After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p>NONE OF this orchestrated craziness is new to me.</p><p>When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth anymore. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy ... when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing ... the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting an heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites.</p><p>QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p>BUSINESSMAN EMMANUEL Goubert was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth ... and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their ... god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, 'Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \" He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\" And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting ...\" Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an importexport business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled ... and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely.</p><p>\"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar.</p><p>I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was banned from entering Australia in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologistteacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs.</p><p>He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story.</p><p>He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.) Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.) \"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, 'It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street.</p><p>Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses.</p><p>\"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, 'Yeah, of course. Why not?' \" AMONG AUSTRALIA'S busiest spreaders of QAnon material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous ... brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\" Me: \"Of course ... And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like antivaccination ... I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\" LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes ... when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\" LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources ... [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\" LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p>ACURIOUS side-effect of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterlanddwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media, and his appearance in a podcast hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer Pete Evans.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media.</p><p>He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit.</p><p>Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools ... because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p>JENI EDGLEY is a fan of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business.</p><p>They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I ... agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] ... I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff.</p><p>So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p>BY THE time Edgley calls me back after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, nothing happened.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\" \"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (Writing of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief ... It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\") Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health advisor, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls.</p><p>\"And he laughed and said, 'Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \" But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, oncetrusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic. \u00ef\u00ae</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7f9zmcsa7hzmbe1rh5m</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62FR-PRJ1-JD34-V4PP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4276\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/hope-rising-america-s-first-female-vice-president-20201203-p56k9k.html\">Vice-President Kamala Harris</url> will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated \u2026 Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds. Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen \u2026 and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening. She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on \u2026 I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment \u2026 I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! \u2026 I just want to \u2018be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning \u2026 the best is yet to come!\" \u2212 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen. \"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos\u00e9\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song:</p><p>And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at allThe needle returns to the start of the songAnd we all sing along like before\u2026</p><p>Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night \u2026 devastated. Can't believe nothing happened \u2026 such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! \u2026 I don't believe a word of their ceremony \u2026 [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his \u2018crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off \u2026 exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in \u2026 as I believe you feel we all have \u2026\"</p><p>After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of this orchestrated craziness is new to me</emphasis>. When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth any more. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy \u2026 when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing \u2026 the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting a heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites. QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Businessman Emmanuel Goubert</emphasis> was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth \u2026 and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their \u2026 god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, \u2018Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \"</p><p>He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\"</p><p>And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting \u2026\"</p><p>Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an import-export business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled \u2026 and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely. \"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar. I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-bans-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-ahead-of-planned-australian-tour-20190220-p50z2n.html\"> banned from entering Australia</url> in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologist-teacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs. He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story. He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.)</p><p>Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.)</p><p>\"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, \u2018It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street. Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses. \"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, \u2018Yeah, of course. Why not?' \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Among Australia's busiest spreaders of QAnon</emphasis> material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous \u2026 brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\"</p><p>Me: \"Of course \u2026 And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like anti-vaccination \u2026 I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\"</p><p>LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes \u2026 when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\"</p><p>LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources \u2026 [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\"</p><p>LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curious side-effect</emphasis> of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterland-dwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/instagram-bans-pete-evans-for-spreading-misinformation-20210217-p573fv.html\">appearance in a podcast</url> hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/oh-for-pete-s-sake-the-rise-and-fall-and-possible-rise-of-pete-evans-20201119-p56fzu.html\">Pete Evans</url>.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media. He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit. Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools \u2026 because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Edgley is a fan</emphasis> of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business. They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I \u2026 agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] \u2026 I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff. So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the time Edgley</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">calls me back</emphasis> after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/handful-of-qanon-supporters-show-up-at-secured-us-capitol-20210305-p5780f.html\">nothing happened</url>.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\"</p><p>\"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/james-meek/red-pill-blue-pill\">Writing</url> of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief \u2026 It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\" )</p><p>Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health adviser, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls. \"And he laughed and said, \u2018Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \"</p><p>But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, once-trusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To read more from</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Good Weekend </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">magazine, visit our page at</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brisbane Times</emphasis></url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520389219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62FP-2TH1-DY19-C0HS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4242\"/><timeReceived>02:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/hope-rising-america-s-first-female-vice-president-20201203-p56k9k.html\">Vice-President Kamala Harris</url> will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated \u2026 Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds. Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen \u2026 and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening. She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on \u2026 I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment \u2026 I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! \u2026 I just want to \u2018be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning \u2026 the best is yet to come!\" \u2212 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen. \"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos\u00e9\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song:</p><p>And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at allThe needle returns to the start of the songAnd we all sing along like before\u2026</p><p>Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night \u2026 devastated. Can't believe nothing happened \u2026 such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! \u2026 I don't believe a word of their ceremony \u2026 [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his \u2018crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off \u2026 exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in \u2026 as I believe you feel we all have \u2026\"</p><p>After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of this orchestrated craziness is new to me</emphasis>. When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth any more. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy \u2026 when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing \u2026 the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting a heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites. QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Businessman Emmanuel Goubert</emphasis> was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth \u2026 and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their \u2026 god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, \u2018Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \"</p><p>He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\"</p><p>And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting \u2026\"</p><p>Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an import-export business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled \u2026 and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely. \"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar. I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-bans-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-ahead-of-planned-australian-tour-20190220-p50z2n.html\"> banned from entering Australia</url> in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologist-teacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs. He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story. He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.)</p><p>Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.)</p><p>\"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, \u2018It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street. Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses. \"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, \u2018Yeah, of course. Why not?' \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Among Australia's busiest spreaders of QAnon</emphasis> material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous \u2026 brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\"</p><p>Me: \"Of course \u2026 And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like anti-vaccination \u2026 I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\"</p><p>LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes \u2026 when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\"</p><p>LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources \u2026 [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\"</p><p>LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curious side-effect</emphasis> of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterland-dwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/instagram-bans-pete-evans-for-spreading-misinformation-20210217-p573fv.html\">appearance in a podcast</url> hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/oh-for-pete-s-sake-the-rise-and-fall-and-possible-rise-of-pete-evans-20201119-p56fzu.html\">Pete Evans</url>.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media. He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit. Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools \u2026 because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Edgley is a fan</emphasis> of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business. They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I \u2026 agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] \u2026 I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff. So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the time Edgley</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">calls me back</emphasis> after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/handful-of-qanon-supporters-show-up-at-secured-us-capitol-20210305-p5780f.html\">nothing happened</url>.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\"</p><p>\"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/james-meek/red-pill-blue-pill\">Writing</url> of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief \u2026 It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\" )</p><p>Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health adviser, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls. \"And he laughed and said, \u2018Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \"</p><p>But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, once-trusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To read more from</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Good Weekend </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">magazine, visit our page at</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brisbane Times</emphasis></url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520389219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62FR-2G31-DY19-C2DW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4242\"/><timeReceived>02:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/hope-rising-america-s-first-female-vice-president-20201203-p56k9k.html\">Vice-President Kamala Harris</url> will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated \u2026 Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds. Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen \u2026 and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening. She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on \u2026 I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment \u2026 I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! \u2026 I just want to \u2018be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning \u2026 the best is yet to come!\" \u2212 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen. \"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos\u00e9\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song:</p><p>And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at allThe needle returns to the start of the songAnd we all sing along like before\u2026</p><p>Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night \u2026 devastated. Can't believe nothing happened \u2026 such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! \u2026 I don't believe a word of their ceremony \u2026 [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his \u2018crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off \u2026 exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in \u2026 as I believe you feel we all have \u2026\"</p><p>After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of this orchestrated craziness is new to me</emphasis>. When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth any more. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy \u2026 when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing \u2026 the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting a heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites. QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Businessman Emmanuel Goubert</emphasis> was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth \u2026 and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their \u2026 god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, \u2018Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \"</p><p>He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\"</p><p>And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting \u2026\"</p><p>Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an import-export business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled \u2026 and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely. \"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar. I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-bans-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-ahead-of-planned-australian-tour-20190220-p50z2n.html\"> banned from entering Australia</url> in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologist-teacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs. He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story. He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.)</p><p>Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.)</p><p>\"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, \u2018It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street. Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses. \"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, \u2018Yeah, of course. Why not?' \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Among Australia's busiest spreaders of QAnon</emphasis> material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous \u2026 brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\"</p><p>Me: \"Of course \u2026 And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like anti-vaccination \u2026 I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\"</p><p>LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes \u2026 when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\"</p><p>LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources \u2026 [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\"</p><p>LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curious side-effect</emphasis> of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterland-dwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/instagram-bans-pete-evans-for-spreading-misinformation-20210217-p573fv.html\">appearance in a podcast</url> hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/oh-for-pete-s-sake-the-rise-and-fall-and-possible-rise-of-pete-evans-20201119-p56fzu.html\">Pete Evans</url>.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media. He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit. Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools \u2026 because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Edgley is a fan</emphasis> of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business. They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I \u2026 agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] \u2026 I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff. So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the time Edgley</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">calls me back</emphasis> after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/handful-of-qanon-supporters-show-up-at-secured-us-capitol-20210305-p5780f.html\">nothing happened</url>.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\"</p><p>\"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/james-meek/red-pill-blue-pill\">Writing</url> of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief \u2026 It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\" )</p><p>Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health adviser, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls. \"And he laughed and said, \u2018Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \"</p><p>But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, once-trusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To read more from</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Good Weekend </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">magazine, visit our page at</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brisbane Times</emphasis></url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520389219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62FW-CST1-DY19-C0D3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4242\"/><timeReceived>02:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/hope-rising-america-s-first-female-vice-president-20201203-p56k9k.html\">Vice-President Kamala Harris</url> will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated \u2026 Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds. Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen \u2026 and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening. She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on \u2026 I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment \u2026 I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! \u2026 I just want to \u2018be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning \u2026 the best is yet to come!\" \u2212 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen. \"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos\u00e9\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song:</p><p>And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at allThe needle returns to the start of the songAnd we all sing along like before\u2026</p><p>Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night \u2026 devastated. Can't believe nothing happened \u2026 such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! \u2026 I don't believe a word of their ceremony \u2026 [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his \u2018crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off \u2026 exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in \u2026 as I believe you feel we all have \u2026\"</p><p>After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of this orchestrated craziness is new to me</emphasis>. When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth any more. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy \u2026 when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing \u2026 the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting a heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites. QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Businessman Emmanuel Goubert</emphasis> was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth \u2026 and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their \u2026 god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, \u2018Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \"</p><p>He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\"</p><p>And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting \u2026\"</p><p>Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an import-export business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled \u2026 and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely. \"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar. I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-bans-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-ahead-of-planned-australian-tour-20190220-p50z2n.html\"> banned from entering Australia</url> in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologist-teacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs. He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story. He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.)</p><p>Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.)</p><p>\"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, \u2018It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street. Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses. \"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, \u2018Yeah, of course. Why not?' \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Among Australia's busiest spreaders of QAnon</emphasis> material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous \u2026 brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\"</p><p>Me: \"Of course \u2026 And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like anti-vaccination \u2026 I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\"</p><p>LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes \u2026 when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\"</p><p>LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources \u2026 [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\"</p><p>LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curious side-effect</emphasis> of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterland-dwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/instagram-bans-pete-evans-for-spreading-misinformation-20210217-p573fv.html\">appearance in a podcast</url> hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/oh-for-pete-s-sake-the-rise-and-fall-and-possible-rise-of-pete-evans-20201119-p56fzu.html\">Pete Evans</url>.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media. He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit. Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools \u2026 because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Edgley is a fan</emphasis> of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business. They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I \u2026 agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] \u2026 I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff. So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the time Edgley</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">calls me back</emphasis> after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/handful-of-qanon-supporters-show-up-at-secured-us-capitol-20210305-p5780f.html\">nothing happened</url>.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\"</p><p>\"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/james-meek/red-pill-blue-pill\">Writing</url> of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief \u2026 It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\" )</p><p>Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health adviser, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls. \"And he laughed and said, \u2018Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \"</p><p>But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, once-trusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To read more from</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Good Weekend </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">magazine, visit our page at</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brisbane Times</emphasis></url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520389219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6306-9561-JBJ7-N1S9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4242\"/><timeReceived>02:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/hope-rising-america-s-first-female-vice-president-20201203-p56k9k.html\">Vice-President Kamala Harris</url> will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated \u2026 Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds. Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen \u2026 and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening. She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on \u2026 I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment \u2026 I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! \u2026 I just want to \u2018be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning \u2026 the best is yet to come!\" \u2212 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen. \"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos\u00e9\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song:</p><p>And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at allThe needle returns to the start of the songAnd we all sing along like before\u2026</p><p>Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night \u2026 devastated. Can't believe nothing happened \u2026 such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! \u2026 I don't believe a word of their ceremony \u2026 [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his \u2018crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off \u2026 exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in \u2026 as I believe you feel we all have \u2026\"</p><p>After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of this orchestrated craziness is new to me</emphasis>. When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth any more. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy \u2026 when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing \u2026 the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting a heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites. QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Businessman Emmanuel Goubert</emphasis> was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth \u2026 and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their \u2026 god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, \u2018Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \"</p><p>He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\"</p><p>And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting \u2026\"</p><p>Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an import-export business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled \u2026 and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely. \"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar. I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-bans-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-ahead-of-planned-australian-tour-20190220-p50z2n.html\"> banned from entering Australia</url> in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologist-teacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs. He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story. He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.)</p><p>Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.)</p><p>\"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, \u2018It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street. Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses. \"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, \u2018Yeah, of course. Why not?' \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Among Australia's busiest spreaders of QAnon</emphasis> material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous \u2026 brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\"</p><p>Me: \"Of course \u2026 And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like anti-vaccination \u2026 I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\"</p><p>LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes \u2026 when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\"</p><p>LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources \u2026 [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\"</p><p>LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curious side-effect</emphasis> of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterland-dwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/instagram-bans-pete-evans-for-spreading-misinformation-20210217-p573fv.html\">appearance in a podcast</url> hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/oh-for-pete-s-sake-the-rise-and-fall-and-possible-rise-of-pete-evans-20201119-p56fzu.html\">Pete Evans</url>.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media. He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit. Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools \u2026 because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Edgley is a fan</emphasis> of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business. They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I \u2026 agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] \u2026 I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff. So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the time Edgley</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">calls me back</emphasis> after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/handful-of-qanon-supporters-show-up-at-secured-us-capitol-20210305-p5780f.html\">nothing happened</url>.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\"</p><p>\"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/james-meek/red-pill-blue-pill\">Writing</url> of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief \u2026 It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\" )</p><p>Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health adviser, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls. \"And he laughed and said, \u2018Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \"</p><p>But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, once-trusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To read more from</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Good Weekend </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">magazine, visit our page at</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brisbane Times</emphasis></url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BRBTMS-1520389219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BRBTMS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6306-86P1-JBJ7-N0XC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404061</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4242\"/><timeReceived>02:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/hope-rising-america-s-first-female-vice-president-20201203-p56k9k.html\">Vice-President Kamala Harris</url> will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated \u2026 Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds. Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen \u2026 and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening. She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on \u2026 I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment \u2026 I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! \u2026 I just want to \u2018be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning \u2026 the best is yet to come!\" \u2212 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen. \"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos\u00e9\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song:</p><p>And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at allThe needle returns to the start of the songAnd we all sing along like before\u2026</p><p>Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night \u2026 devastated. Can't believe nothing happened \u2026 such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! \u2026 I don't believe a word of their ceremony \u2026 [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his \u2018crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off \u2026 exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in \u2026 as I believe you feel we all have \u2026\"</p><p>After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of this orchestrated craziness is new to me</emphasis>. When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth any more. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy \u2026 when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing \u2026 the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting a heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites. QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Businessman Emmanuel Goubert</emphasis> was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth \u2026 and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their \u2026 god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, \u2018Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \"</p><p>He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\"</p><p>And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting \u2026\"</p><p>Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an import-export business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled \u2026 and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely. \"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar. I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-bans-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-ahead-of-planned-australian-tour-20190220-p50z2n.html\"> banned from entering Australia</url> in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologist-teacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs. He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story. He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.)</p><p>Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.)</p><p>\"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, \u2018It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street. Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses. \"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, \u2018Yeah, of course. Why not?' \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Among Australia's busiest spreaders of QAnon</emphasis> material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous \u2026 brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\"</p><p>Me: \"Of course \u2026 And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like anti-vaccination \u2026 I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\"</p><p>LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes \u2026 when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\"</p><p>LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources \u2026 [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\"</p><p>LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curious side-effect</emphasis> of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterland-dwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/instagram-bans-pete-evans-for-spreading-misinformation-20210217-p573fv.html\">appearance in a podcast</url> hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/oh-for-pete-s-sake-the-rise-and-fall-and-possible-rise-of-pete-evans-20201119-p56fzu.html\">Pete Evans</url>.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media. He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit. Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools \u2026 because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Edgley is a fan</emphasis> of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business. They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I \u2026 agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] \u2026 I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff. So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the time Edgley</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">calls me back</emphasis> after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/handful-of-qanon-supporters-show-up-at-secured-us-capitol-20210305-p5780f.html\">nothing happened</url>.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\"</p><p>\"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/james-meek/red-pill-blue-pill\">Writing</url> of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief \u2026 It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\" )</p><p>Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health adviser, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls. \"And he laughed and said, \u2018Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \"</p><p>But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, once-trusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To read more from</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Good Weekend </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">magazine, visit our page at</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brisbane Times</emphasis></url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-1520389219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62FT-7H21-DY19-C50C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4242\"/><timeReceived>02:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/hope-rising-america-s-first-female-vice-president-20201203-p56k9k.html\">Vice-President Kamala Harris</url> will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated \u2026 Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds. Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen \u2026 and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening. She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on \u2026 I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment \u2026 I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! \u2026 I just want to \u2018be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning \u2026 the best is yet to come!\" \u2212 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen. \"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos\u00e9\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song:</p><p>And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at allThe needle returns to the start of the songAnd we all sing along like before\u2026</p><p>Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night \u2026 devastated. Can't believe nothing happened \u2026 such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! \u2026 I don't believe a word of their ceremony \u2026 [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his \u2018crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off \u2026 exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in \u2026 as I believe you feel we all have \u2026\"</p><p>After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of this orchestrated craziness is new to me</emphasis>. When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth any more. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy \u2026 when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing \u2026 the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting a heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites. QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Businessman Emmanuel Goubert</emphasis> was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth \u2026 and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their \u2026 god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, \u2018Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \"</p><p>He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\"</p><p>And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting \u2026\"</p><p>Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an import-export business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled \u2026 and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely. \"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar. I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-bans-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-ahead-of-planned-australian-tour-20190220-p50z2n.html\"> banned from entering Australia</url> in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologist-teacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs. He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story. He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.)</p><p>Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.)</p><p>\"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, \u2018It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street. Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses. \"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, \u2018Yeah, of course. Why not?' \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Among Australia's busiest spreaders of QAnon</emphasis> material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous \u2026 brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\"</p><p>Me: \"Of course \u2026 And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like anti-vaccination \u2026 I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\"</p><p>LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes \u2026 when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\"</p><p>LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources \u2026 [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\"</p><p>LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curious side-effect</emphasis> of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterland-dwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/instagram-bans-pete-evans-for-spreading-misinformation-20210217-p573fv.html\">appearance in a podcast</url> hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/oh-for-pete-s-sake-the-rise-and-fall-and-possible-rise-of-pete-evans-20201119-p56fzu.html\">Pete Evans</url>.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media. He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit. Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools \u2026 because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Edgley is a fan</emphasis> of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business. They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I \u2026 agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] \u2026 I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff. So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the time Edgley</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">calls me back</emphasis> after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/handful-of-qanon-supporters-show-up-at-secured-us-capitol-20210305-p5780f.html\">nothing happened</url>.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\"</p><p>\"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/james-meek/red-pill-blue-pill\">Writing</url> of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief \u2026 It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\" )</p><p>Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health adviser, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls. \"And he laughed and said, \u2018Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \"</p><p>But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, once-trusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To read more from</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Good Weekend </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">magazine, visit our page at</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brisbane Times</emphasis></url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520389219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6306-86P1-JBJ7-N13F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4242\"/><timeReceived>02:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

As usual, details are vague and sources unnamed. Yet online conspiracy feeders gobble it up, believing Biden's arrest - for \"illegal dealings\", or something - will lead, somehow or other, to Donald Trump's return as leader of the free world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And why wouldn't they?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Trump told them repeatedly that he was the greatest president ever. And, despite everything, they believed it. He told them the US election was \"stolen\", and they should march on Capitol Hill in protest, and they believed that, too - with fatal consequences for five people.</p><p>Now, just hours before Biden is due to be sworn in as America's 46th president at 3.30am on January 21 (AEST), self-proclaimed \"Truthers\" are once more united in their belief that this is conspiracy movement QAnon's promised \"Great Awakening\" or \"The Storm\", when Trump will expose a cabal of Satan-worshipping paedophile cannibal liberal elites, and that Biden and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/hope-rising-america-s-first-female-vice-president-20201203-p56k9k.html\">Vice-President Kamala Harris</url> will never make it to the White House.</p><p>\"There's millions of us who hope [martial law] will actually start tomorrow,\" I'm told by veteran Australian conspiracist Jeni Edgley the day before it's all supposed to happen. \"Some believe Biden will be arrested as he is inaugurated \u2026 Trump wants to cause the least amount of damage to the military and the American people. That's why everything has been kept under wraps.\"</p><p>Like others who buy this stuff, Edgley (once married to showbiz tycoon Michael Edgley) sounds thrilled to possess information at odds with what she scornfully calls \"The Narrative\" - meaning pretty much everything the rest of us accept as factual.</p><p>At 70, the anti-vaxxer and former natural health practitioner lives in retirement in North Queensland. Although I tell her I'm interested only in how she came to be a believer, she soon swamps my phone with the type of videos she recycles ad infinitum via her social media feeds. Most are from extreme right or religious sources in the US, and include the usual QAnon rants about mass murders committed by the Clintons; the COVID-19 \"conspiracy\"; Michelle Obama's secret life as a transgender male; \"proof\" of how the US election was stolen \u2026 and so on.</p><p>I ask Edgley if I can call her again around the time of Biden's inauguration to talk about whatever's happening. She agrees, but points out that she's been advised via a \"10-second clip from some military person\" that because of \"worldwide social media censorship\", and the distortions of mainstream hacks like me, Trump will be launching an alternative broadcasting system to tell people about the coup.</p><p>\"We're all supposed to switch to this emergency system worldwide,\" she says. \"So you and I may not be able to call each other.\"</p><p>That night, watching eerie scenes of the empty US capitol in security lockdown, I'm torn between confidence that nothing will happen, and concern (based on televised repeats of the insane Washington riot just a fortnight earlier) that anything could happen.</p><p>Edgley's first message, opting out of our planned chat, arrives at 8.30pm. An hour later, she elaborates: \"Hi Frank, There is SO much going on \u2026 I'm receiving a post a minute from all over the world. I'm loving seeing all the complexities of different viewpoints and don't want to miss a moment \u2026 I don't want to be sharing this time (I've waited for over 40 years) with a serious journalist! \u2026 I just want to \u2018be' with it all.\"</p><p>Edgley isn't sure when the military coup will unfold, but suggests Trump's farewell speech earlier in the day - \"The movement we started is only just beginning \u2026 the best is yet to come!\" \u2212 is a likely pointer to what's about to happen. \"TO THAT EXTENT,\" she concludes, \"I WON'T BE AVAILABLE FOR CALLS TONIGHT.\"</p><p>To my horror, she sends another raft of fact-free videos: a bald English charlatan spruiking the sale of gold and silver; a Fox News \"expos\u00e9\" involving China; predictions of soaring death rates from COVID vaccinations, and something Edgley labels \"the selling of aborted baby parts illegally\".</p><p>By 4am the following day, Biden and Harris have been sworn in without incident, and I go to sleep soothed by a classic by the Scottish band Del Amitri that could serve as QAnon's theme song:</p><p>And nothing ever happens, nothing happens at allThe needle returns to the start of the songAnd we all sing along like before\u2026</p><p>Much later, I find a message Edgley sent at 4.45 am: \"Yes, I was up all night \u2026 devastated. Can't believe nothing happened \u2026 such a corrupt group of individuals back in power !!!!!! The tentacles run deep! \u2026 I don't believe a word of their ceremony \u2026 [they] said all the right words [but] I've seen [too] much about them from Hunter Biden with his \u2018crack pipe' and having sex with his niece to Michelle Obama being a transvestite. Signing off \u2026 exhausted and saddened.\"</p><p>Another message that afternoon says she's been in touch with lots of other Truthers equally stricken by the failure of \"good\" to prevail over \"evil\", presumably by destroying the world's largest democracy before their eyes. But she watched a couple of old conspiracy videos and felt a little better - \"or have we all been sucked in \u2026 as I believe you feel we all have \u2026\"</p><p>After that, with her question yet unanswered, Edgley goes to ground - \"fasting and meditating\". It's almost three weeks before I hear from her again.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">None of this orchestrated craziness is new to me</emphasis>. When I was a kid, my father - a conspiracy theorist all his adult life - became convinced a man camped in scrub near our house had been sent to murder him by fiendish Jewish plotters for One World Government. (He turned out to be just a lonely man with a ready ear for conspiracy theories.) I've written before about the toll Dad's mania took on our family (\"My Father the Fascist\", Good Weekend, March 8, 2019). Yet even in his wildest imaginings I doubt that FNick, as my brother and I called our war-damaged father, could have envisaged what conspiracy theories would look like by 2021.</p><p>Waves of corrosive bullshit lash the planet, driven by the unholy confluence of internet, Trump and pandemic. Fear, aggression and monumental stupidity conspire to swamp science and reason; truth and accuracy are shouted down by people who think facts are \"points of view\" and that watching YouTube propaganda videos is research.</p><p>\"If I trust the scientist and you trust the guy on YouTube,\" says Roland Imhoff, a social psychologist at Germany's Johannes Gutenberg University, \"there's no common ground between us. And having a shared understanding of reality is essential to society. Without it, there is no truth any more. That's a huge danger.\"</p><p>Long before the web gave credible scientists and credulous YouTube researchers equal access to global audiences, FNick was evolving and pushing his favoured theories - Jewish plots, Holocaust denial, anti-vaccination, anti-fluoridation - in the old way. An experienced journalist, he read a lot (in support of what he already believed), communicated by mail with obscure right-wing bookstores and fellow believers, addressed public gatherings and plagued newspaper editors with the racist, anti-science screeds that clattered almost daily from his typewriter.</p><p>FNick died in 1987, aged 93, still fighting to spur a then largely indifferent world to action before it was \"too late\". Most of his awful beliefs survived, as they had for centuries before him, and have now been given comic book touches for the social media crowd. Dad was a societal outsider: bombastic, contrary, distrustful of governments and scornful of all opposing views.</p><p>Most of these traits, along with anxiety, depression and impulsiveness, are emerging through research as indicative of the modern conspiracy mindset.</p><p>\"[Studies show] up to 80 per cent of people now believe in at least one conspiracy theory,\" Dr Mathew Marques, a lecturer in social psychology at Melbourne's La Trobe University, tells Good Weekend. \"They usually involve a group of malevolent people having covered something up, although there's no evidence of that having occurred.\"</p><p>Increasingly, Marques suggests, committed conspiracists tend to \"interpret any and all events as part of some conspiracy \u2026 when they don't find evidence of the thing they believe in, they just move on to the next thing \u2026 the current level of scepticism [over science and established facts] is just off the rails, off the charts.\"</p><p>Of course, lots of things in the world aren't what they seem to be: vested interests influence wars, economies and elections; politicians and governments lie and cheat in the name of expedience. But this has little to do with the current crop of conspiracy theories, which seem more like part of a mental contagion than shared concern over actual wrongs or injustices.</p><p>Some identify the contagion as QAnon itself. The movement began in 2017 with a series of posts from an anonymous user on the message board 4Chan. Claiming to have a level of US security approval known as \"Q clearance\", the user signed off as \"Q\". By a process too asinine to dwell on, this reportedly led to today's QAnon: essentially a pro-Trump propaganda machine, built around its own inaugural lie about Trump fighting a heroic war against a network of child-trafficking Democrats and Hollywood elites. QAnon's cryptic, coded fabrications are now feverishly \"interpreted\" by legions of devotees. Perhaps coincidentally, the movement gained ever wider audiences as sections of the global media abandoned actual news gathering in favour of propagandised \"entertainment\".</p><p>Why do grown people take this stuff seriously? Even more perplexing, why do they keep believing when - time after time - the conspiracies and their authors fail to be publicly \"revealed\" as predicted? In a lot of cases, believers seem unaware they're being politically manipulated, or lack even a basic understanding of the political divisions involved.</p><p>After ploughing through hours of Australian social media feeds, my feeling is that conspiracies have become a sort of global, online \"game\". Some get involved because it suits their beliefs, but others play the game because they like the idea of themselves as \"independent thinkers\" who see through the deceptions fed to \"sheeples\" and \"normies\" by corrupt governments and scientific institutions. This isn't a story about the theories themselves, but an attempt to understand how people are drawn into their thrall.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Businessman Emmanuel Goubert</emphasis> was in his 20s and attending business school in France when the scales of conventional belief began falling from his eyes and attaching themselves to giant, bloodthirsty lizards. \"If you'd told me [before then] that the world was controlled by an elite that controls all the wealth \u2026 and that these guys are actually of extra-terrestrial origin, and that their \u2026 god is a demon, and they do a lot of sacrifices of kids, and blood rituals, I would tell you, \u2018Man, just go back in your box! I don't want to hear it!' \"</p><p>He'd have thought they were crazy?</p><p>Goubert: \"Oh, 100 per cent!\"</p><p>And now?</p><p>\"Now I [know] the real lie was the lie I was living in since I was born, which is so huge and so disgusting \u2026\"</p><p>Goubert, 32, moved to Australia from France eight years ago. He lives with his partner on North Stradbroke Island, near Brisbane, where he operates an import-export business from their home at Point Lookout. He's intelligent, good looking, polite, well-travelled \u2026 and absolutely committed to outlandish conspiracy theories.</p><p>His core belief is that the world has been controlled for thousands of years by shape-shifting aliens. They live underground and follow what another writer has called a \"marvellously slow\" plan for the ultimate enslavement of humanity.</p><p>\"They are called draco reptilians. They are from three to four metres tall, can weigh up to 200 kilograms, and they feed on fear and blood,\" Goubert explains gravely. \"They are the mosquitoes of the universe.\"</p><p>Apart from the lizards, this sounds strangely familiar. I tell Goubert how my father believed in an ancient Jewish plot to enslave humanity through a crippling system of \"false debt\".</p><p>\"Yes,\" he says. \"That is correct.\"</p><p>It turns out that Goubert's space lizards are aided and abetted by Jews, who are the wealth-controlling elite he mentioned earlier. FNick's old favourite has been rejigged over the years, largely by mega conspiracy spreader David Icke, a former soccer player and BBC sports presenter who was<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/government-bans-conspiracy-theorist-david-icke-ahead-of-planned-australian-tour-20190220-p50z2n.html\"> banned from entering Australia</url> in 2019. On social media, Icke has variously blamed Jews for the pandemic, linked it to the 5G mobile network, claimed that COVID-19 can't be transmitted via physical contact, and played down the infectiousness of viruses in general.</p><p>On his public Facebook page, Goubert reposts daily updates from extreme-right sources, including the pro-Trump \"Enemies of the People\" movement. He tells me he's from a \"traditional\" French family in Bayonne, and that his geologist-teacher mother and builder father support and share his beliefs. He provides their names, and the name of his Australian partner, but later insists that only his name, in a reduced form, be used in this story. He says even he wouldn't have spoken out in the past through fear he would be ridiculed, or \"have an accident tomorrow and just disappear from the planet\". (Using his full name in Facebook posts doesn't seem to trouble him.)</p><p>Belief in extraterrestrial visitations apparently came to his \"spiritual, meditating\" father long before Goubert himself embraced the reptile plot, largely through his membership of Gaia - a streaming service that focuses on pseudoscience, yoga, conspiracy theories and alternative medicine.</p><p>\"When my father was young, he and his sisters saw UFOs above a property in France,\" he says. Much later, when Goubert told his father he'd come to believe the world was controlled by aliens, and that he feared he was \"going crazy\", his father confessed to having reached a similar conclusion years earlier. (He'd kept it to himself through fear of ridicule.)</p><p>\"All of the true stuff is ridiculed,\" says Goubert, echoing one of FNick's recurring laments. (I remember our mother actually running away when he was laughed at while banging on about The Plot in public.) \"People just laugh about it,\" Goubert tells me. \"They tell us, \u2018It's all just bullshit, har, har, har!' And the har-har-har is the biggest weapon that has always been used to stop people seeing the truth.\"</p><p>His reaction has been to cut himself off from all credible news sources. This began involuntarily in 2001 when his father, outraged by the media \"spreading fear\" about the Twin Towers terrorism attack, seized the family's only TV set and threw it into the street. Goubert, who thinks terrorism is \"another agenda from the New World Order\", insists he hasn't used any conventional news outlets since that day. He's somehow aware, though, that all the news he misses is \"manipulated\" by aliens via their Jewish lackeys.</p><p>Goubert gets most of his information from Gaia, YouTube and other internet sources, and the rest from books with \"spiritual\" or extra-terrestrial themes recommended within his online \"community\". He thinks almost everything taught in conventional schools is alien lies, and estimates that since he turned to conspiracy theories, roughly 90 per cent of those he considers friends are people he hasn't met in person.</p><p>\"There is a lot of disinformation on the internet,\" he concedes, adding, \"but when you know where to look, it's incredible. It has allowed people to open their minds and be receptive to new possibilities faster.\"</p><p>Goubert has opened his mind to most QAnon fabrications, including the claim that COVID-19 was deliberately created (with its vaccines set to kill more people than the virus itself) as part of \"a strategy to get less people on the planet and then control them all\".</p><p>He sees himself and fellow believers as \"soldiers\" for the cause, and seems genuinely confused by the difference between fact and fantasy. \"Younger people are really open to all this [conspiracy] stuff,\" he enthuses. \"And [because of] all these alien and hero and superpower movies, when you start talking to them about the possibility of having aliens on the planet, these guys are already saying, \u2018Yeah, of course. Why not?' \"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Among Australia's busiest spreaders of QAnon</emphasis> material is a 60-something couples counsellor who calls herself the \"Love Coach\". The description sits oddly on her public Facebook page above hateful rants accusing legally innocent people of crimes including mass murder, paedophilia, political assassinations, embezzlement, treason, sedition and drug dealing.</p><p>And that was just on a single day during the pre-inauguration conspiracy frenzy, when she shared a series of baseless claims - \"From a Marine at CIA headquarters\" - against the Clintons, George Bush snr, Barack Obama, Dick Cheney and others. Since then, she's maintained her daily habit of sharing propaganda, especially fear-mongering anti-vaxxer themes, almost hourly with her 1900-plus Facebook followers.</p><p>No fan of the established media, which she calls \"treasonous \u2026 brainwashed, blackmailed scum\", the Love Coach nonetheless boasts on her website of having promoted her services via the ABC, 2UE, 2GB, the Daily Telegraph and Cosmopolitan magazine.</p><p>When I phone her at her NSW home, she agrees to discuss how she became a conspiracy theorist but only if her name isn't used. I tell her that wouldn't make sense because she's already using her name to publicly accuse people of serious crimes.</p><p>LC: \"So you're actually using real names?\"</p><p>Me: \"Of course \u2026 And real facts.\"</p><p>LC says it would be dangerous for her to use her name because US authorities are shutting down social media sites if people even \"mention anything like anti-vaccination \u2026 I seem to have got away with it on Facebook for some obscure reason.\"</p><p>Me: \"You're worried about your privacy, yet you're happy to accuse people of murder on a public forum?\"</p><p>LC: \"Yeah, I'm completely happy to suggest that somebody has been paedophiling [sic] children and committing heinous crimes \u2026 when there's enormous amounts of proof around.\"</p><p>Me: \"What sort of evidence do you need before sharing this stuff?\"</p><p>LC: \"I need about five bits of information from top level sources \u2026 [such as] people who have access to M16, CIA, umm - white-hat stuff, Q stuff which has access to military intelligence.\"</p><p>She suggests that if the \"utterly biased\" mainstream media wanted balance, it would regularly allow Truthers to comment on issues of the day. \"Truthers,\" she adds, \"is a better word than conspiracy theorists because they're not conspiracy theories, they're conspiracy facts, most of them.\" She insists that, \"along with all the other Trumpers\", she is just a private person who \"really believes in the truth\".</p><p>Me: \"Do you believe the US election was stolen?\"</p><p>LC: \"Without a skerrick of a doubt, yes.\"</p><p>Me: \"Okay, well I think the reality is there's not much hope for you. But thanks anyway.\" A few minutes after the call ends, the Love Coach fires back in a text: \"You're obviously not very skilled at building trust - a valuable asset in these days.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A curious side-effect</emphasis> of the Age of Conspiracy is the unlikely bedfellows it creates. Such as the romance between Australia's \"alternative\" hinterland-dwellers, once inclined to the left, and former federal Liberal backbencher Craig Kelly, a climate change denier and supporter of some QAnon positions. Central to this peculiar alliance are Kelly's promotion of unproven COVID therapies on social media and his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/instagram-bans-pete-evans-for-spreading-misinformation-20210217-p573fv.html\">appearance in a podcast</url> hosted by controversial celebrity chef and anti-vaxxer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/national/oh-for-pete-s-sake-the-rise-and-fall-and-possible-rise-of-pete-evans-20201119-p56fzu.html\">Pete Evans</url>.</p><p>In keeping with the beliefs of many latter-day hippies, who also tend to be among the most fervent conspiracy theorists, Evans calls COVID a \"scam\" and a \"fake pandemic narrative\", and eulogises Kelly as a \"beautiful and beyond-courageous man\".</p><p>Kelly quit the Liberal Party in February after being rebuked by PM Scott Morrison for posting misinformation about COVID on social media. He now occupies the crossbench.</p><p>Banned from Facebook in December for repeated violations of its misinformation policies, Evans' plan to run for federal politics has apparently been fuelled by his devoted following among conspiracists.</p><p>Global health authorities are troubled by the extent of misinformation about COVID vaccines, and are countering with online fact sheets about the immunisation process and gee-ups from prominent people. \"Research teams are also looking at ways of trying to train people to identify misinformation through things like online games,\" says social psychologist Mathew Marques.</p><p>\"They show how people use conspiracy theories and other forms of misinformation for gain and profit. Hopefully, this kind of research can be expanded to schools \u2026 because the concern is that this sort of thing isn't going away anytime soon.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jeni Edgley is a fan</emphasis> of both Kelly and Evans. In the '70s and '80s, she and impresario Michael Edgley were the power couple of Australian show business. They ran the multimillion-dollar entertainment business, Michael Edgley International, owned a series of mansions in Perth and Sydney, drove a yellow Rolls, hung out with the rich and famous, and captivated the media.</p><p>\"Jeni Edgley has deep brown eyes, dark circles under them, and a cheeky smile,\" ran a piece in The Australian Women's Weekly in 1981. \"She is instantly likeable. She talks and smokes furiously and is as down to earth in her conversation as in her clothing.\"</p><p>She qualified as a naturopath in Sydney, parted from Michael in the late 1980s, and started her Hideaway Health Retreat in the Gold Coast hinterland soon afterwards.</p><p>Intrigued, even then, by fringe beliefs, she hosted \"Nitty Gritty\" days at the retreat, where guest speakers lectured on UFOs, yowies, the Loch Ness monster, lost cities, the JFK assassination, and the sins of the medical establishment. \"In my knowledge,\" Edgley told a Good Weekend writer in 1996, \"there are three people who have come up with cures for cancer which were banned because they didn't fit in with medical orthodoxy.\"</p><p>Edgley tells me she was so disturbed by what she heard at the Nitty Gritty lectures, she began storing food in fear of a societal breakdown. One lecture was about the spread of paedophilia, \"Which I'd never heard of!\" But later, after watching \"thousands of hours\" of conspiracy videos on the theme, she accepted QAnon claims about Trump fighting a global child abuse ring.</p><p>\"I'm not saying I \u2026 agree with everything Trump's done, whether it's [grabbing] pussies or politics, but I do like that he's done some stuff nobody else had the guts to do.\" Trump, she adds, \"always reminds me of my ex [Michael Edgley] \u2026 I mean, in that money is his life, and deals and negotiations and all that sorta stuff. So I know his sort of character.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">By the time Edgley</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">calls me back</emphasis> after the Big Fizzer on January 20, conspiracy tragics have moved their deadline for Trump's return as president to March 4. (When, yet again, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/world/north-america/handful-of-qanon-supporters-show-up-at-secured-us-capitol-20210305-p5780f.html\">nothing happened</url>.) They're also reposting claims that martial law and the Insurrection Act have already been invoked, and that Biden isn't really president. Does Edgley still believe this crap?</p><p>\"Yes,\" she says, without hesitation.</p><p>\"Oh, Jeni,\" I groan. \"Surely not!\"</p><p>\"If it isn't true,\" she demands, \"how come Biden hasn't been seen on Air Force One? And how come military people are turning their backs and not saluting him?\" (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v42/n20/james-meek/red-pill-blue-pill\">Writing</url> of the conspiracist mind in the London Review of Books last October, British novelist James Meek counsels against arguing with believers: \"You're faced with a choice between challenging limitless errors one by one, or denouncing an entire edifice of belief \u2026 It's like a forest fire that can only be put out one square inch at a time, or all at once, and so can never be put out.\" )</p><p>Which is a pity. Because the AWW was right: Jeni Edgley is likeable. When she isn't plunging down mad rabbit holes. \"Listen to that beautiful storm!\" she hollers at one stage, pacing the garden with her phone as a thunderstorm rumbles in. I even like that she still smokes - an outrageous habit for a health adviser, alternative or not, yet in keeping with her maverick disposition. At times, she even manages a nod to the absurdity of conspiracist thinking. \"I told my son I was frightened [the authorities] were going to come after me [for reposting conspiracy theories],\" she recalls. \"And he laughed and said, \u2018Aww Mum, you're a little old granny living in North Queensland. Get over it!' \"</p><p>But will she? Will Emmanuel Goubert, the Love Coach and all the other believers ever get over the lizard monsters, killer vaccines and sinister ex-presidents that move about in their thoughts like squatters in unsecured buildings? Large numbers of them seem to genuinely believe that what they're doing will help bring about a sort of heaven on earth.</p><p>My father often used a Biblical quote to invoke his vision of how things would be after he'd helped to save the world from The Plotters: \"But they shall sit every man under his vine and under his fig tree; and none shall make them afraid...\" (Micah 4:4). The new reality, of course, is that when it comes to making people afraid - of ethnic differences, democratic processes, once-trusted institutions, even one another - nothing does the job like an online conspiracy epidemic.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">To read more from</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> Good Weekend </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">magazine, visit our page at</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">,</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Age</emphasis></url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> and</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/topic/good-weekend-1qq\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Brisbane Times</emphasis></url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520389219</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6306-9561-JBJ7-N1KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4242\"/><timeReceived>02:26 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

That's not something that we're proud of, but we're proud of those men and women that fought it bravely and fought it bravely to the point that they saved countless lives and countless homes because of the professionalism, the meticulous planning but also in terms of the fighting, the bravery of those men and women, out there on the front line and are still there today, although the fire is contained. The work that they have done in saving so many lives and so many homes, and we should be profoundly proud of them. And day 79 for them. The fatigue of these men and women, but to keep on turning up says a lot about them. </p><p>It says a lot about our country. Can I say that obviously the announcement yesterday around mental health is important. Around the trauma that a lot of these men and women have seen. Not only the firefighters, but those out in the community that have been touched by this. There is a lot of hurt and there is a lot of grief, but their nation grieves with them and they will help them recover.</p><p>This is not a recovery just about infrastructure. This is a recovery about lives, and we'll continue to do that and make sure that that over $70 million is targeted at a local level. We've said from the start this wasn't going to be a Canberra-led recovery, this was going to be a local-led recovery. Our primary health networks will play an important part of that. They'll make sure that we get targeted solutions at a local level, that they'll be the ones that decide the programs predicated off the community, what will best work for them because what works here may not work in Victoria or Kangaroo Island and we need to understand that and appreciate that. We've got the money. Money is not the issue. People is the issue. So we'll continue to work through that and we'll make sure that those men and women on the frontline are also targeted not only in the here and now, but in the post-sense. The PTSD part is one element of this that we'll be looking at and working with emergency personnel to make sure we get it right, because some of that hurt will come down the track. And we need to make sure we're working with them, not only the full-time firefighters, but also the volunteers to make sure it's targeted to them in making sure that their lives that have been touched by this disastrous event are suitably looked after.</p><p>It's also, as we just heard before, about the environment and today we've made significant investment, first investment, in the environment. And that's about emergency management and of making sure those species out there, those native species are looked after, those that have been hurt by these fires are being protected and their lives are being repaired and as quickly as we possibly can. That's the first tranche. There's a long tranche around the actual habitat recovery and there's opportunity and Andrew and I have been talking about this as how do we tie that in with making sure that our tourism sector recovers? Because that's one of our national assets that we need to help recover, repair and be part of the recovery story. And also the small business element of this. Those small businesses that predicate a lot of their business model on tourism and our environment, how do we tie all that in?</p><p>And so, this isn't going to be something that we're kicking down the road. In the next couple of days there will be further announcements. In fact, tomorrow Andrew and I will be with the National Security Committee putting towards further programs that we'll be announcing very soon. And we've done that in a methodical way working with industry groups because, again, we want this to be locally-led and not Canberra-led and making sure the money that we put out - Australian taxpayers' money that we put out - is targeted where it needs to and hits the mark. So this will be a comprehensive plan, but it's more than infrastructure. It's rebuilding the lives of our strong nation. We're a proud nation and we'll get through this because we'll stick together and we'll work together.</p><p>Marise, did you want to say something?</p><p>Marise Payne:</p><p>Very briefly, if I may. Thank you very much. I want to thank both David and Andrew, particularly, for coming to our part of the world here this week with Robyn and Barry and Susan. We know that we represent very resilient communities, but resilient communities still feel the pressure of extraordinary fires of this nature in a very deep way. And the initiatives that we are taking across government to address some of those pressures are very important ones. But they are the beginning of the process and I will be relying strongly on feedback from local leadership in these communities to make sure that where there are pressure points and where there are gaps, we are able to address those.</p><p>I want to acknowledge Karen and her team for what they have done over the last 79 days, but honestly, much longer in advance of that as well in ensuring that so much of this part of an iconic part of Australia was protected in the way that it was. So many homes, so many businesses, so many lives saved. For those who have experienced the most catastrophic losses - and we'll be meeting some of them later this morning - we acknowledge and understand the extraordinarily traumatic experience that that is and we want to support you. We want to help you. We want to work with you as you recover from that experience. So Andrew, David, thank you very much for being here in our part of the world and we look forward to working with you in the coming months and I suspect years as well to make sure that this area recovers and is once again on the world stage as an iconic part of Australia's natural heritage.</p><p>Andrew Colvin:</p><p>Ah look, thank you. Good morning everybody, I'll be brief. Firstly, to the ministers, our local members, the mayor, it's wonderful to be here today. Of course, we all wish it was under different circumstances, but to hear directly from Karen and her deputy controller, Andrew, about the incredible job that they've done here today just galvanises what is already in my mind about the short-term needs of the community, what we have to do now, but also those long-term needs that you've heard Minister Littleproud talk about.</p><p>Today will be a difficult day for us. It will be a difficult day for those community members who are going to share their stories with us, but it's an important day because we need to hear that. We need to hear what will work at the local level. We need to make sure that we have a very local focus in what we're doing here, but also that we have a long-term focus. This isn't about rebuilding now. This is about rebuilding for the future as well. So, we will visit a number of communities, a number of small businesses, hear from them directly and that's all a part of the process of listening to make sure that what we do is sustainable and is what they need. So thank you very much to everybody who has hosted us today. I look forward to coming back and hearing a little bit more in the future days, weeks and months and I really do wish that you and your teams get a bit of a break, and congratulations on the status of the fire being now contained. Thank you.</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Questions?</p><p>Question:</p><p>Minister Littleproud, I know you being from Queensland and a proud Queenslander, there's been a few of your LNP colleagues who are a bit disappointed at the Prime Minister's comments yesterday that he wants to do a bit more on climate change. Do you think that coal has a place in Australia in the short term?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Yes, and in fact what the Prime Minister said was we'd made an international commitment and we're going to live up to that. In fact, we should proudly celebrate that we're one of the few countries that lived up to the first international commitment at Kyoto. You know, we knock ourselves a lot in this nation, but you know what, we're one of the world leaders in that. We were the first ones to get up and say we were going to commit to Kyoto and we delivered it, plus some and we've made international commitment. We've got the runs on the board. We will do it in a responsible way that doesn't wreck the economy, that does it in a sensible way that protects jobs and reduces emissions but we need the rest of the world to come with us. We'll lead by example, by our actions and our commitments. We're a fair nation. We're an honest nation. Everything we've said to the international community we've lived up to. Let's be proud of that and let's continue to work towards achieving that.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Mr Morrison's approval rating's dropped by eight points. Do you think that this a reaction to his handling of the bushfire crisis and how do you think he's handled it?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Well, let me say since I entered Parliament just over three years ago, I made a self-imposed rule never to comment on polls because polls go up and they go down .</p><p>Question:</p><p>How do you think he's handled the bushfire crisis?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>I think the Prime Minister's done everything he possibly humanly could with respect to these fires. Obviously community expectation has changed around where Federal Government involvement interplays with these disasters. This has been meticulously planned around responsibilities between state and federal governments and we have worked to that to the letter. In fact, I've had over 50 tasking requests from state governments since these fires started in September for Defence Force assets to be used. All of those have been approved within minutes of receiving them. So we have been working collaboratively with the states and I have to congratulate the state agencies for the way that they have handled this. We've just heard about the number of lives that have been saved. This is the largest fire event in our nation's written history.</p><p>And the fact that while tragically we've lost 28 lives, 28 Australians, four of those emergency services personnel, this could have been so much more worse had we not meticulously planned. And I have to say, our fire commissioners are world-leading because they have thought about this, they have understood this and they've planned for this. Obviously there is a community expectation with respect to recovery where the Australian Defence Force becomes involved. We took a forward-leaning approach and the Prime Minister wasn't going to wait for us to be asked, we were going to be prepared to act as soon as it was required and he took a forward-leaning approach with the Defence Minister. We modelled it in November. We've done all the work. We've meticulously planned as well and we will continue to make sure that the state agencies lead this, but we'll have a mature conversation when we've put the fires out and in the cold, hard light of day we can work together to continue to keep more Australians safe.</p><p>Question:</p><p>The Prime Minister said climate change policy would continue to evolve. What will that mean and how can it evolve if you don't change your emissions reduction targets?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Well, it's how we achieve and the way in which we achieve it. We invest in technology. We're a smart nation. We're a world-leading nation. We should back ourselves with new technologies to continue to reduce our emissions. We've got $3.5 billion set aside for the Climate Solutions Fund to empower our industries to look at how they can reduce emissions, making it industry lead rather than a big government approach. Making sure that we continue to invest in technologies, even in coal, to ensure that we continue to reduce emissions. This is about us backing ourselves as one of the smartest nations in the world and that's about empowering its people, not by big-arm government. They know better and they'll do better.</p><p>Question:</p><p>One element of this drought is obviously the bushfires. Another is water supply. We're here in Sydney, Warragamba dam is running dry. You've said in the past the states aren't doing enough to keep up with population. What do you make of the efforts New South Wales has undergone to keep water flowing in Sydney?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Well, at least they've started. Some states are still on the back foot on this. We've had money, over $3 billion, ready for a state to take our hand to build water infrastructure. Since 2003, there have been 20 dams built in this country. Sixteen of those have been in Tasmania and we've said we'll pay because it is illegal for me to pick a shovel up in any state and start digging a hole to build a dam because our forefathers gave the constitutional ownership to our states. But we asked them to give us the approval. We'll help pay for it because this is imperative. It's imperative not just in fighting fires, it's imperative in making sure we continue to develop our country and have a sustainable water supply, not just to rural areas but to metropolitan areas. There'll be a 37 per cent reduction in storage capacity per person per mega-litre by 2030 because of population increase, unless the states decide let's dig some holes. We're ready to dig holes. We're investing in infrastructure. It's time to get on the job and the Environment Minister Susan Lee has said that she'll make sure that the red tape is cut so that we can get it done. I think people are fatigued on this. All they want to do is see bulldozers and excavators moving and get something moving.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Does Sydney need a new dam and have you had any talks with New South Wales government about this?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Well, that's a decision for the states around where their water needs are. Obviously we've created the National Water Grid to also complement them with some real science from scientists and hydrologists. There's a lot of bush hydrologists out there at the moment and what we need is the real science, the real hydrology about where our water needs are and how we develop our country further with water because that's the source of all life. So we'll complement the states but we expect them to be forward-leaning on this and lead the way and tell us where they see their water needs appearing, not only domestically but also for the development of our nation.</p><p>Question:</p><p>You've been all around the country with this bushfire recovery process. Are you hearing a lot about land clearing from people in these bushfire affected places?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Well obviously there's a conversation that needs to happen around land management, land use, even building standards and that's what the Prime Minister quite maturely has flagged but in consultation with the states and the states own that. But what we want them to do is take ownership of that, to make sure .</p><p>Question:</p><p>[Interrupts] Are you hearing the frustration?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Oh definitely, and in some parts of the country we're hearing not only from farmers and landowners, but also from rural firefighters themselves, frustrated by the fact that there has been impediments for them. Now, you've got to understand it's not as simple as just throwing a punch. There's some complications in that and that's why we take the advice of the fire commissioners. But, you know, we need to have a solid conversation about what that looks like and how do we do better. We shouldn't be afraid to have that conversation in a mature way at all levels and hold ourselves to account. No one is above reproach on this. We need to continue to work together but there needs to be some serious questions asked about how we manage fuel loads into the future.</p><p>Question:</p><p>And that- with all respect to Barry, Hawkesbury Council especially around up near Bilpin, they're blaming Hawkesbury Council for being culpable for the fact that they just can't manage what's on their land and now they've lost their homes.</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Well that's where a mature conversation has to come in and I'm not going speak for any particular council and Barry's more than welcome to add to it, but you know, this is where the emotion, we need to work through. We need to get through the grief process and then with cool heads, calm heads talk about what we can do better, both local, state and federal. We can do that. We're a smart country but we've got to do that in the right environment, create the right environment for that conversation to happen so that you get the right outcomes, not emotional outcomes. But there definitely is concern, not only here but right across the country, people have raised these concerns with us and we'll continue to hear that and that's why the Prime Minister hasn't put away the opportunity of looking at a Royal Commission. But we need the states to be with us on that because this is and that needs to be a nationally coordinated approach to one.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Yes, on that Royal Commission, how quickly could that happen to make sure any recommendations are in place before the next fire season?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Well look obviously we've got states that are still fighting fires. So I think the priority just in the very short term is about us putting out the fires and supporting our state agencies. They don't need a talk-fest at the moment. That's why we didn't support a meeting at COAG. I mean, why would you take premiers away from fighting fires and being at the forefront of the operational management of putting these fires out. You need to make sure that we allow due process to take place, and then the Prime Minister has clearly said that he wants to have that conversation with the states about what a royal commission could look like. But we wanted to be on the same page in what we were looking at and the outcomes that we needed as a nation and what role the Federal Government plays.</p><p>That's one of the issues that obviously the Prime Minister wants to know and get an understanding of, what are those trigger points that we as a Federal Government can simply say we're ready to go? Now we've done that by our own volition and this fire, we've pre-emptively pulled out the Defence Force before being asked to make sure that they are there in this recovery. But what are those trigger points and how can we make sure that in the future there's a more streamlined process and one that the community understands, because obviously the community doesn't really care who does the work, they just want it done. But there's been a lot of planning about roles and responsibilities and can we do that better and can we say as a Federal Government, we'll pull the trigger when we're ready and this what it should look like?</p><p>Question:</p><p>On a different subject, what do you make of Young Queensland Liberals yelling at drag queens during books for kids?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Well look, everyone's- everyone wants a cause these days and we all want to be angry, but let's show some respect to one another. I think those young people probably could have reached out to the Lord Mayor, who's an LNP Lord Mayor and made their views well and truly known. Let's show some respect as a country and as a nation. What we're more focused on at the moment is putting out these fires and supporting these brave men and women and those thousands of people who've lost their homes. I think that's more important at the moment.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Defence Minister, can I ask you about HMAS Toowoomba?</p><p>David Littleproud:</p><p>Foreign Minister.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Sorry, foreign, sorry. [Indistinct] well, may I ask you about HMAS Toowoomba has been sent. Are you concerned that Australia's taking part in an escalating conflict between the United States and Iran?</p><p>Marise Payne:</p><p>Well, Australia is very focused on ensuring the safety and security of the men and women who represent us internationally in the ADF and certainly in my own Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the deployment of HMAS Toowoomba is no exception to that. We will be ensuring that they are carefully monitored, that they work very closely with the leadership of the Defence Force, with the Defence Minister, of course, the Prime Minister as we monitor that situation. But we are also very clear in saying that we are very committed to supporting in any way we can processes of de-escalation in the Middle East. That includes what has been a long term presence from Australia in the Combined Maritime Force and also of course our efforts in support of counter-terrorism activities, particularly in Iraq, the counter-Daesh activity remains our absolute priority in Iraq and we hope that we can continue to work with the international coalition in that regard. It has an impact on us internationally. It has an impact on us regionally and we know it's had an impact on our own shores here in Australia. So that remains our first priority.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Minister, the academic who is in a jail in Tehran at the moment, has this made it more difficult?</p><p>Marise Payne:</p><p>We work every day with our agencies here and with counterparts in Iran to endeavour to secure Dr Moore-Gilbert's release. We have had an opportunity for a consular visit towards the end of last year. We're very focused on working closely to make sure that our view which is that we don't accept the charges upon which she was detained, held, charged and convicted and we want to ensure the conditions in which she is held are appropriate every single day. That is part of my focus and I want to assure Australians that we are working very hard to secure her release.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Can I ask Mr Colvin a couple of things, I know that you're going out to visit communities today, you have already been in some communities. Are you finding that there is a different, sort of, need between communities out there, and what are you finding the differences are?</p><p>Andrew Colvin:</p><p>Look, it's early days in that engagement, this is only really the second opportunity that I've had to get out and see on the ground what the impact has been and talk to people. There is some common ground around our resilience, our ability in the community to work to understand how these fires affect us. There's certainly common ground around the mental health impacts, the impacts on families, the longer-term impacts. But really at this stage I just want to stay and spend a little bit of time before I start making stronger comments about what those threads are. We've got a long way to go. It's quite clear to me that as we've talked about many times, this is a massive undertaking, but it's made complex because of the range of communities that are affected. I have no doubt in my mind that a community in Central Queensland will have very different impacts and very different needs to a community in East Gippsland or down the South Coast of New South Wales. So at this stage it's about listening, it's about learning, it's about understanding, it's about hearing those stories frankly.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Can I ask you about the concert as well? Obviously Australians are desperate to do anything they can to help their fellow Australians. Is something like that, in your mind, a helpful initiative to kind of help show.</p><p>Andrew Colvin:</p><p>This is the concert?</p><p>Question:</p><p>Yeah the concert.</p><p>Andrew Colvin:</p><p>Yeah, I think anything we can do is part of the community spirit. I will encourage anything that I see as constructive and positive to helping rebuild community spirit. To help rebuild infrastructure is only part of this. In fact the larger part is redevelop that community spirit, helping people deal with the loss and the grief and making sure we don't just see this for now, we don't just look at this for the next six months. The agency's been put up for two years but the Prime Minister's made it very clear that we will do whatever we need. My own experience from this space and my background tells me that the impacts will be felt long down the track, six years, ten years, I'll have that focus in mind as well.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Are you hearing residents talk to you about climate change a lot?</p><p>Andrew Colvin:</p><p>Not to me, not yet, but look I'm all ears for whatever the conversation that residents in those affected communities want to have.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Given your background in police and in counter terrorism and that sort of thing. If this was a terrorist event, this would have been a Commonwealth response from day dot. Have you sort of, used that experience thinking this is something we might need to do going forward?</p><p>Andrew Colvin:</p><p>Well look, the experience I have is dealing in federation. The reality of policing is no different to the reality of any emergency management, it's a combined effort between the Commonwealth, the state and the local government. That's what we see in terrorism and that's what we see here in the bushfire response as we have seen in the drought response and the flood response and whatever natural disasters we've had to come to deal with. There are lessons that I can take away from my policing experience and certainly bring to this space but the biggest lesson here is this needs to be a joint effort.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Is there a balance between what you can get the defence force to do [indistinct] what you can get local businesses to do, i.e. you don't want defence to steal [indistinct]?</p><p>Andrew Colvin:</p><p>There's absolutely a balance and that's a really good question. It's a good point. The defence force are out there right now doing amazing work. Lifting the spirits of local communities everywhere the defence force goes you can feel the community lift. They're doing work that needs to be done right now and it's important work. But longer term we need that work to be done by the local contractors, we need that work to be done by the local small businesses, the local farmers because that is what will rebuild these communities for a long-term future. There is a balance and right now I think we've got that balance right because we need the defence force along with our state and territory partners out there on the ground, making life better for communities out there right now. Longer term this has to be a local rebuild.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Minister Payne, another Australian has died overnight from the White Island volcano tragedy. Do you have any update on conditions of other Australians being treated?</p><p>Marise Payne:</p><p>If I may say, the White Island tragedy inflicted some of the most extraordinary injuries on those who survived, both in New Zealand and those who have been repatriated to Australia. All of those individuals, no matter where they come from, are receiving the best possible care, but this is a very long road for every single one of them. For privacy reasons I'm not going to go into details of particular conditions, but I know, from being for example in the Middlemore Hospital in Auckland, in the Hutt Hospital in Wellington, that the level of sophistication that was brought to bear by initial responders, both those who were part of taking people, retrieving people, from the island and those who were initially treating people in hospitals with intensive surgeries, all that sort of thing - that was extraordinary. It saved a large number of lives and I think, as I've said before, we hope and we pray that those people survive these traumatic injuries. But we've been working very closely with New Zealand - the New South Wales Health Department, the Victorian Health Department, doing an extraordinary job for those who are in hospitals here. This is a response from both of our countries to what was a horrific event and we wish everyone the very, very best.</p><p>Question:</p><p>Senator, just back on the Iranian attacks, has the Government reduced its Australian personnel, either Defence or diplomatic, since that happened?</p><p>Marise Payne:</p><p>There's been no change to our positioning in Iraq in relation to Australian Defence personnel, except to say they have taken every step that could possibly be required to ensure their own safety in such circumstances. We indicated last week that we had reduced our DFAT presence, our foreign affairs and trade presence, in Baghdad to the essential staff only in recognition of the uncertain environment. That continues and we review that on a regular basis.</p><p>Thank you everyone.

This is one of the few koala populations that has not had a severe fire pass through it, which makes it a very important population now.</p><p>\"It's still not known how they've fared through the drought, so we will keep monitoring.</p><p>\"Every koala is really precious at this stage.

He said samples of her faeces have been sent to Sydney University to test for chlamydia and koala retrovirus.</p><p>\"She is feeding well, browsing and suckling her young, who is beginning to eat leaves in the tree, and eating supplementary food from branches left under the tree,\" Mr Allen said.</p><p>He said recently captured video of the pair indicates the joey is likely around 14-months-old, and two months beyond the usual age for weening off its mother's milk. There is also evidence of koala scats in areas burnt by the fire, which has brought \"some form of optimism\", Mr Allen said.</p><p>It is unknown why the local population, which sits at 50 individuals spanning 25,000 hectares, has remained relatively unchanged over the last few decades. Mr Allen said the number could be an \"underestimate\", but there hasn't been \"any evidence of a shift in the numbers\" since 2009.</p><p>The mother and joey are part of the last remaining known population of the marsupials on the Far South Coast. It's a population which Mr Allen said very little is actually known about, as its low-density nature makes collecting relevant data difficult task.</p><p>\"It involves quite a bit of field work each year to stay in touch with the occupation rates,\" he said.</p><p>\"I hesitate to say the population is stable, but the numbers are very small and persisting.\"</p><p>Environment minister Sussan Ley, who has access to the governments $50 million wildlife and habitat recovery package, will facilitate a roundtable with zoos, wildlife carers and koala researchers in Canberra this week. Meanwhile, Australia's Threatened Species Commissioner Dr Sally Box will host a Wildlife and Threatened Species Bushfire Recovery Expert Panel, which includes academics in the field of koala conservation.</p><p>\"My focus will be on finding new opportunities for bringing communities together to support koala recovery,\" Ms Ley said.</p><p>The animal was once a common sight across the region, even around Bega, where at the time of the arrival of Europeans around 1829, Bega, home to the Djiringanj people, was covered in tall grass and populated with many emus, kangaroos and koalas.</p><p>Djiringanj elder Aunty Colleen Dixon said there are historical stories of miners around the Biamanga area eating koalas, and she said the numbers could have been considerably large.</p><p>\"A lot of the koalas didn't exist there afterwards. They are lovely creatures, it's nice to see what everyone is doing after these fires to try to look after them.\"</p><p>A local newspaper article in 1879 describes the animals being shot for fun by colonialists in the Tanja area, south of where the known population is today. Described incorrectly as a \"native bear\", a \"monkey\", and even as a cousin of the South American sloth, the article, written by a local resident, paints a sad picture of past dealings with the animal.</p><p>The article describes how bullets would just \"tickle\" the animals, with one local describing how four 12 gauge bullets were needed to \"to disturb a koala's balance\".</p><p>\"A gentleman pedestrian from Bega chanced to pass at the time, had a six inch 'Colt' revolver with him, and being shown another bear, at least 70 feet from the ground, managed to bring him down with the second bullet; economy of powder and good shooting combined,\" the Bega Standard reads.</p><p>\"One of our people purposes stuffing a specimen of these aboriginal inhabitants of the forest for exhibition.\"</p><p>A letter to the editor of the Sydney Morning Herald in 1934, details how the koala had been common in the Bega district 50 years earlier, and had \"practically vanished from all settled areas by 1892\".</p><p>The letter, written by an S.A Hanscombe from Parramatta, says the animals were forced to be nomadic or \"back into the wild, unsettled mountain country\", due to the extensive clearing of land for commercial cattle grazing.</p><p>He describes the koala's disappearance as \"rapid\" and \"tragic\", so much so it garnered international interest.</p><p>\"Some German scientists were busy in 1912-1914 in collecting any stray skeletons of the koala for scientific purposes in order to diagnose the disease that swept right down the coast of New South Wales and through Victoria about 1890 and killed many of the creatures,\" Mr Hanscombe said.</p><p>\"At the time most skeletons found indicated certain growths on the skulls, but the (Second World) war apparently killed the investigation at that period.\"</p><p>The animals were also hunted across the district for their fur, which is waterproof, and used to make hats and gloves.</p><p>By as recently as 1986, the remaining population was in \"sad decline\", just six years after national parks had described their numbers as \"encouraging\". With the organisation's Philip Reid saying bushfires May have been a \"big factor\" in their decline.</p><p>While the koala is a decedent of the giant marsupial Diprotodon, which possibly lived until as recently as 40,000 years ago and it's closest living relative is the wombat, it evolved to climb trees, possibly to take advantage of a resource not being used by other animals.</p><p>Sightings of koalas have been made in recent years, with state government contractors running three surveys over the last decade, and sightings from Bermagui to Gillards Beach and Doctor George Mountain.</p><p>Last year, a joey was successfully bred in captivity at Potoroo Palace to a mother named Sapphire who was also born at the sanctuary.</p><p>The Australian Koala Foundation estimates there were between 43,000 and 80,000 koalas in the wild before this season's bushfires, with most of their habitat already lost.</p><p>The state government is currently holding an inquiry into koala populations and habitats, which last week heard from representatives protecting the vulnerable animal's populations throughout the bushfires.</p><p>World Wide Fund for Nature conservation scientist Dr Stuart Blanch told the inquiry as many as 10,000 koalas, or a third of the total NSW population, may have been lost to drought and bushfires.</p><p>Murrah resident for almost 30 years Robert Bertram is a supporter and advocate for sustainable forest management practices, and runs a website dedicated to promoting the restoration of biodiversity and forests for koalas living between the important catchments of Dignams Creek and Wapengo.</p><p>Mr Bertram made a submission to the inquiry last year arguing the government's poor understanding of environmental science and reluctance to adapt its management to increase biodiversity and soil fertility are threats to koalas.</p><p>He said he is concerned drought-induced forest dieback is threatening the population's survival, and even a low intensity fire may reduce the quality of the habitat to a point where it can no longer support koalas.</p><p>Mr Bertram captured rare images of a mother koala with her joey in November last year at a watering station, and started a crowdfunding page to raise money to place more of these water stations south of the Murrah River, as similar stations are reported to have been placed by the government around Cuttagee.</p><p>Since the fires he said he hasn't seen any evidence of koala activity.</p><p>National Parks Association Far South Coast branch president David Gallan was part of the combined team organised by Mr Allen, tasked with searching previously documented koala sites for post-bushfire scat activity when they were contacted by the private landholders about the mother and her joey.</p><p>The team also included Bega Local Land Service's and traditional custodian Dan Morgan, National Parks and Wildlife Service's David McCreery and koala scat surveyors Mark Lems and Roger Park.</p><p>\"It would appear that they [the koalas] had moved away from the fire in the Murrah Flora Reserve,\" Mr Gallan said.</p><p>\"While assessment is ongoing about the precise impact of the mega-fires across our state, it is reasonable to assume tree dwelling species that were already vulnerable, would be badly affected by the intensity and scale of the fires.</p><p>\"Before the fires there were deep concerns about species such as koalas, greater gliders and yellow bellied gliders. Now, more than ever, we need to protect the trees they live in.</p><p>\"The NPA supports the stance of the [state] environment minister, who refuses to let the fires be an excuse for cattle grazing or logging in national parks.\"</p><p>Mr Gallan said firefighters from Bermagui, Cobargo, Tathra and Tanja, as well as local farmers had worked hard to protect areas with known koala populations, as well as other wildlife within the national park and flora reserve from the 300,000 hectare Badja Forest bushfire fire.</p><p>Firefighting crews from Queensland also supported national parks firefighters in containing the fire, protecting critical habitats.</p><p>Mr Gallan said the association \"has been concerned for years at the loss of firefighting knowledge and expertise through continual restructures and loss of key NPWS staff\".</p><p>He said the association is also advocating for the Murrah Flora Reserves to be absorbed into the neighbouring Biamanga National Park.</p><p>\"NPA supports the aspirations of the traditional custodians, represented by the Biamanga board of management members, to have responsibility for managing this ecologically and culturally significant area in partnership with NPWS,\" he said.</p><p>Campaigners said in 2018 the state government's NSW Koala Strategy completely ignored the Far South Coast's koala population, with the region kept within the Saving our Species threatened species program.</p><p>The strategy aimed to aside more than 20,000 hectares of state forest on the Central Coast, Southern Highlands, North Coast, Hawkesbury and Hunter as new koala reserves, and transfer 4000 hectares of native forest on the Mid North Coast to the national parks estate.</p><p>A further $20million from the NSW Environmental Trust will be used to \"purchase land with prime koala habitat that can be permanently reserved as national parks\".</p><p>Fixing priority road-kill hotspots across NSW, creating a network of koala and wildlife hospitals and a single wildlife rescue call number are also be part of the strategy.</p><p>\"The government removed the brakes on deforestation on private land in 2016, and now plans to spend $20million to buy habitat at risk due to that decision. That's a questionable use of public money,\" NPA senior ecologist Oisn Sweeney said at the time.</p><p>\"The best chance to recover koalas are large, well connected reserves that protect habitat and provide east-west links to deal with climate change.</p><p>\"Small isolated patches are highly vulnerable to catastrophic events like fire and ignore the threat of climate change,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BEGDIS-doc79gjp008cbd1fk6weco</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BEGDIS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y98-YS21-F0J6-J0SF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386742</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1964\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

At one point, there were 20 or 30 new outbreaks every day. We are at four or five now each day, which is another positive sign. </p><p>\"The number of active cases in aged care is beginning to stabilise. It's still far, far, far too much at 2000. </p><p/><p>\"The number of active cases amongst health care workers is stabilising. It is also far, far too much.\"</p><p>But Prof Sutton urged against complacency and encouraged Victorians to continue following the rules.</p><p>\"We are seeing the fruits of a very difficult period of restrictions, stage three and stage four, and it should continue to trend down,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our effective reproduction number, so the average number of people that one person infects, is almost certainly below one now. It can get to 0.4, 0.5 if everyone can do the right thing.\"</p><p>He said most infected people did not go on to reinfect anyone, but warned of \"super spreaders\" and settings that could amplify the risk of infection.</p><p>\"The reality is most people don't infect anyone. But there is a small percentage, maybe 20 or 30 per cent who might infect dozens of people,\" Prof Sutton said.</p><p>\"So there are these super spreading events and especially indoor settings, work settings where people are in close contact where you can have a great number of people infected. </p><p>\"That's what cruise ships did, the restaurants in NSW had 100-plus cases. We know from our meatworks you can get hundreds of cases. </p><p/><p/><p>\"Germany had a meatworks where 1500 people got infected. There are settings that amplify that risk. </p><p>\"If on average we can get that reff number below one, then every generation of transmission we will see fewer and fewer cases over time. </p><p>\"That number is completely affected by what we do at a community level, how much time we are spending at home, limiting the number of people that we might meet for essential reasons, but also at that micro distance, so whenever we are meeting someone that we have got a mask on, that we are not shaking hands, we are not hugging and kissing and not getting closer than 1.5m.\"</p><p>There is a total of 7875 active cases statewide, with 7200 in metropolitan Melbourne and 484 in regional Victoria.</p><p>\"Those regional numbers are actually down on where they were four or five days ago,\" Mr Andrews said. </p><p>\"We peaked at about 512 if memory serves correctly. They are relatively stable but we have seen growth in those bigger cities.\"</p><p/><p>Active cases among Victoria's healthcare workers number at 1178.

top of Australia's $100 million commitment in support for the COVAX initiative aimed at ensuring equitable access for vaccines across the globe, including for lower and middle income nations unable to

new energy sources and stability in the Indo-Pacific and the world.</p><p>Amid reports that Joe Biden plans to use the G7 meeting to lobby the group against Chinese economic coercion and its treatment of Uighurs in XinJiang, Mr Morrison said that Australia always welcomed the \"great friendship and support that we have from our ally the United States.\"</p><p>He said Australia would discuss defence and technology co-operation at the G7, as well as the importance of maintaining strong supply chains across the globe, arguing the meeting was about \"ensuring a world that favours freedom.\"</p><p>Mr Morrison said that all nations should be able to \"trade with each other and all countries, wherever they are, whoever they are ... without coercion.\"</p><p>He said there was \"no substitute for leaders getting together\" but noted the pandemic was raging outside Australia, noting that the UK was recording 7,000 cases a day despite having a vaccination rate on first doses of well over 70 per

Ann and Barry La Fontaine</p><p>\"If you haven't been affected by fires, come help those who have\" I have lived on the Sapphire Coast for 15 years, and have been a co-owner of Tathra Beachside, a holiday park at Tathra, for the last 10 years.</p><p>I have learnt much about the ingenuity and resilience of country people, particularly small business owners and operators in the regions. They put their balls on the line to provide for their families and employ others. They are self-motivators and self-sufficient. But they need help now, for sure. Tathra itself was badly damaged by fires in March 2018, less than two years ago, with the loss of over 80 homes, and we were just about recovered from that shock when this comes along.</p><p>Tathra and the Sapphire Coast has escaped much of the direct fire damage in this current crisis, but the economic damage will be widespread and devastating unless action is taken very quickly. I am not talking about government action, although that will be welcome when it starts to flow. I am talking about people action. Right now.</p><p>What the Sapphire Coast needs quickly is people. We need Australians to cancel their trip to Bali, Thailand or the Pacific Islands, please do not enrich P &amp; O shareholders by going cruising. Instead, please come to the fire-affected areas as soon as you can and help your fellow Aussies.</p><p>If you haven't been affected by the fires where you live, please come and help those who have. Bring an empty Esky and a full wallet. We need your dollars and we also miss the sounds of families having fun in what remains a very beautiful part of Australia.</p><p>Frankie J. Holden, entertainer</p><p>\"Victims need us today, tomorrow and well into the future\" Like many others, I have sat and watched in horror and disbelief as our country burns, shedding tears for our fellow Aussies who have lost everything. My heart breaks witnessing the devastation of our unique, beautiful wildlife and innocent livestock.</p><p>This unprecedented destruction that will forever change the face of our country. It's a fact that victims of traumatic events need time to process their grief. The least we can do is offer comfort and empathy during this time. Offering financial assistance and donating essential items is a great starting point. I am just so grateful for Foodbank Australia and that I have been able to contribute in some way and hopefully inspire others to do the same.</p><p>It's crucial to maintain and not lose momentum in our support for these communities.</p><p>Deborah Hutton, Foxtel presenter</p><p>\"Thanks for your tireless work\" Just want to give a massive shout-out and thank you to all of our firefighters around the country who have worked tirelessly to help protect homes and communities. We can't thank you enough for all you have done.</p><p>Alex de Minaur, tennis player</p><p>\"High praise for the RFS commissioner and his crews\" Sending respect and moral support to Shane Fitzsimmons and all at the RFS HQ. I cannot imagine how difficult it has been for the commissioner to stand up day after day and report on devastation and the challenges faced by his crews. He is doing a brilliant job.</p><p>Jennifer Elliott</p><p>\"Like all Victorians, my husband Tony and I are saddened by the bushfires ravaging our State\" And the heavy losses caused by them. Loss of precious lives, of homes, businesses, livestock, bushland and wildlife.</p><p>We are also buoyed when we see the bravery and tireless work of all those fighting the fires, our emergency services personnel and the men and women of the ADF - whether in the field or in headquarters and control centres around the State.</p><p>We have the good fortune to be meeting and to be able to thank some of them. We also see the spirit of collaboration and practical teamwork amongst the countless generous groups and individuals who are donating and volunteering, to provide help wherever, whenever and however it's needed.</p><p>Thank you to everyone still fighting these fires, and to everyone supporting those affected as they embark upon rebuilding and recovery.</p><p>Linda Dessau, Governor of Victoria</p><p>\"A new take on our love for our precious sunburnt country\" Our Blazing Country We've loved our \"Sunburnt Country\" - our land of sweeping plains, Of ragged mountain ranges - of drought and flooding plains, We've loved her far horizons - we've loved her jewel sea, But now she brings sheer terror - with fires that thousands flee. In all our years we've never seen such total devastation, Relentless adverse weather brings destruction to our nation, Our daily news reports repeat the horror and the grief, With forecasts of returning winds that promise no relief.</p><p>How does a family start again when everything is gone?</p><p>How do parents explain to kids, we have to just go on?</p><p>Without a home, without their toys and precious bits and pieces, A future they see only filled with loss that never ceases, For every age the bushfires their trauma scars will leave, And generations through the years may struggle to believe, That Mother Nature could inflict such utter ruination, Erasing whole communities in massive conflagration.</p><p>Future generations too will hear of fireys brave, Those who gave their everything for others' homes to save.</p><p>With courage and tenacity they've fought day after day In places that resembled hell, they never walked away.</p><p>Where did they find the energy, how could they keep going back? Their efforts almost superhuman - their hands and faces black. They all deserve a medal, they all deserve much more, The fight they fought took all they had - as much as any war. And here are we all safe and sound with nothing we can do, We don't have skills to fight the fires - we've ageing bodies too! So what we can do, let's dig deep for those whose homes are gone, Let's show them that we really care and help them carry on.</p><p>Jan Woolmer, Eagleby</p><p>\"You are our generation's equivalent of the Anzacs\" A century after the Anzacs first came into being, you are our generation's modern equivalent. Facing an adversary that is fearsome, not to mention often both faster and better-placed, you've responded with courage, loyalty and selflessness, finding new reserves of stamina week after gruelling week. You astound us all.</p><p>Thank you for your work, your generosity and your powerful demonstration that when a catastrophe approaches, it is better to fight united than divided.</p><p>Annabel Crabb, ABC political writer</p><p>\"It takes a special person to defend another's home\" This brave army of quiet Australians defend strangers' homes as if they were their own.</p><p>You are special people who give not just at times of disaster but all year round to make this the amazing country we all love.</p><p>Paul Murray, Sky News TV anchor</p><p>\"Let's all continue to pray for more rain to end this disaster\" To all the firefighters, volunteers and anybody that has contributed even in the smallest way during this devastating time, thank you!</p><p>We are such a strong country and there is no greater example of that than right now.</p><p>The way we band together as one, stick by each other and find a way to get through the tough times makes me so proud to call myself an Aussie. Let's all continue to pray for rain.</p><p>Michael Clarke, former Australian cricket captain</p><p>\"Even in some of our darkest days our true spirit has shone through\" Bravery takes many forms, but I can't think of any more noble than that displayed by the women and men of our fire brigades. These people put their lives on the line day in, day out to keep people, animals, homes and businesses safe.</p><p>Every Australian owes them an enormous debt of gratitude. They are the very best of us.</p><p>Our hearts go out to the families and friends of those who made the ultimate sacrifice.</p><p>I can't begin to fathom the enormity of their loss. The memories of their loved ones will never fade. But even in some of our darkest days, the true Australian spirit has shone through.</p><p>It has been heartening to see communities rallying together and people supporting each other in the face of these terrible fires.</p><p>I pray that conditions improve, the rains come soon and the recovery process can begin.</p><p>Justin Langer, Australian cricket coach</p><p>\"You have inspired and united us\" On behalf of the entire AFL community - including our clubs, players, officials and supporters - I wanted to say thank you so much to everyone who has been involved in fighting fires and supporting the communities that have been affected by these bushfires. Our firefighters, emergency services and defence personnel, support agencies and the thousands of volunteers who have given so freely of their time to protect our communities have inspired and united all of us. As an industry we are coming together to raise money through a number of initiatives but also to stage a double header on Friday, February 28 where AFL and AFLW football supporters have an opportunity to show their respect and gratitude. The football industry will support you through this time and is fully committed to working together to rebuild over the longer term.</p><p>Gill McLachlan, AFL boss</p><p>\"The burdens that you shoulder belong to all of us\" Australia's volunteer ranks have no peer anywhere in the world. When we need them the most, they are there - often at great personal risk. But we honour them most by joining them because the burdens they shoulder belong to all of us.</p><p>Peta Credlin, Sky News anchor and columnist</p><p>\"Our continued support is needed to help communities rebuild\" The amazing response from our volunteer firefighters and emergency services people during this unprecedented and catastrophic bushfire season has been nothing short of heroic.</p><p>The stories of bravery and selflessness, many after losing everything themselves, has been truly awe-inspiring.</p><p>Coupled with this, the way Australians have rallied to donate and help their fellow Aussies proves that we truly are at our best in times of need. I've had the privilege of seeing this generosity and compassion on display first-hand at the Foodbank warehouse in Western Sydney, where the donations continue to flow in.</p><p>Our continued support is needed.</p><p>Rodger Corser, actor</p><p>\"A grateful nation that is now forever in your debt\" To the incredible fireys and volunteer workers, thank you for your tireless efforts, for the time spent away from your own homes and families and for encapsulating all that is good about the Australian spirit. We are forever indebted to you.</p><p>Nicole Da Silva, actor</p><p>\"Forget the Oscars, the real award winners are in the fire zones\" In a world obsessed with Oscars, Emmys and Logies, the biggest awards and recognition should be given to the fireys and emergency service workers who courageously risk their lives to save and protect ordinary folk and wildlife.</p><p>I would like to say the biggest thank you to them, from the bottom of my heart. Stefan Dennis, Neighbours star</p><p>\"Let's hope more rain - and more resources - is on its way\" Thank you to the firefighters that have fought so hard to keep everyone out of harm's way, despite a lack of support and no resources from our government. There are so many Australians that have lost their homes and many Aboriginal communities have been affected.</p><p>Let's hope more rain comes along soon.</p><p>Miranda Tapsell, actor</p><p>\"We will always be grateful to those who have put themselves in harm's way\" The Victorian community and our emergency management personnel have faced tough conditions over the last few weeks and months.</p><p>Our people have been working very hard since November on fires across the state, including significant fire activity in East Gippsland and the northeast. These fires have impacted Victorian communities. There has been significant property losses and that is devastating for those community members. We continue to do everything we can to support communities and our people during this time.</p><p>My thoughts are with the families and friends of each one of those individuals who have lost their lives. We will always be grateful to those who have put themselves in harm's way during difficult and dangerous situations, in the interests of their local communities.</p><p>It is important to consider the risk Victorian firefighters take every time they step onto the fireground. Managing the response to our fires, as well as the immediate relief and recovery across the state has truly been a team effort and I have seen first hand the work between agencies, brigades, teams and colleagues, at all levels.</p><p>As my colleagues CFA chief officer Steve Warrington and Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman have said, we will, and are doing everything we can to keep our communities and our people safe.</p><p>Thank you to everyone for their efforts so far, and the effort still to come. Take care.Andrew Crisp, Victoria Emergency Management Commissioner</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-1b9f344a38ed11ea9ebeb43f0ebb14891af89d351a30ae5fdf01d113e43f5082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y1C-C751-JD3N-50R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2352\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSunFeatureA Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 21, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp; REEFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001581</classCode><className>SMALL BUSINESS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC313</classCode><className>THAILAND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Ten people died.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A decade later, nearly every house has been rebuilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That one will not survive,\" says Professor Kevin Tolhurst, nodding at a house on his left. \"Neither will that one.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We stroll to the edge of the road, where it starts to slope steeply away. There is a bare patch here. A \"For Sale\" sign has been stuck in the yard. We're surrounded by trees.</p><p>From here you can see further down the hill. Stretching away beneath us is kilometre after kilometre of rolling green forest. In 2009 the fire roared through that forest, charged up the hill and destroyed this little strip of houses.</p><p>A decade later, the forest has grown back. Tolhurst believes it has grown back dramatically more flammable than before the fire.</p><p>Much of this thick forest grows in a heavily populated ring running 120 kilometres around Melbourne.</p><p>We are trapped in a spiral, Tolhurst argues.</p><p>The climate crisis is making big fires more likely. Each time a big fire burns the bush it becomes more flammable, leading in turn to more big fires.</p><p>To break that cycle, he believes we need to implement the recommendation he crafted as part of the 2009 Bushfires Royal Commission's expert panel: burn at least 5 per cent of Victoria's public forests every year.</p><p>As the Prime Minister leads the charge on planned burning, calling for national hazard reduction standards, the scientific evidence is split on whether he - and Tolhurst - are right.</p><p>Many scientists argue a fire in extreme conditions - becoming more likely as the climate heats - won't be slowed by a planned burn.</p><p>\"We're in record drought. We're seeing the effects of the climate crisis. You cannot say that's just down to more fuel,\" says Professor Ross Bradstock, one of Australia's leading bushfire scientists.</p><p>\"It is misleading to suggest that prescribed burning will provide the sole means of risk minimisation. Risk goes up and down. It does not go up forever.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock led a comprehensive 2010 study that found planned burns do almost nothing to stop bushfires.</p><p>But the 2009 royal commission concluded the planned burning that had been done did cut the spread of the fires on Black Saturday and helped firefighters contain them. And one 2013 study found that as Western Australia halved the amount of planned burning it does over the past 30 years, the size of bushfires in the region quadrupled.</p><p>Tolhurst is one of Australia's most respected bushfire experts. He was in the state control centre on Black Saturday, working with bushfire analysts; later he was one of the royal commission's appointed planned burning experts. He remains a bushfire researcher at the University of Melbourne.</p><p>He and the man behind the wheel of the Jeep, Victoria's former chief fire officer Gary Morgan, are foresters, a profession that conjures images of men with thick beards living in the wilderness. That is not far from the truth. Tolhurst's hobbies include finding and registering historic trees for the National Trust. His beard is voluminous.</p><p>It seems like common sense: if you burn a forest, it will take decades to grow back ready to burn again. Hence areas burnt in Black Saturday shouldn't burn again any time soon.</p><p>This, Tolhurst believes, is wrong. It takes as little as four years for landscape to grow back after an intense, raging bushfire. When it does, it is more flammable, he says.</p><p>\"Wherever there was one tree, now there are 10 trees, or 50 trees,\" he says. \"And the chances are it will burn again. So those 10 trees will become 100 trees.\"</p><p>Why? First, an extremely hot fire kills big trees. This opens the way for a lot of new, small and much more flammable trees to grow in their place.</p><p>After a fire, thick shrubs and bushes grow back at ground level, Tolhurst says. And young trees make up a mid level. Up above, fire encourages eucalypts to spawn thick canopies.</p><p>We're standing in a patch of eucalypt forest near Kinglake, burnt in 2009. Tolhurst traces a line upward. This is not a forest, he says. It's a ladder, with foliage at each level, allowing the fire to race up into the thick forest canopy, where it turns into a mega-blaze.</p><p>Planned burns are different, says Tolhurst.

The government, anxious to act, implements it. And then, often within just a few years, the target is either dropped or ignored.</p><p>Take the 2002 Victorian bushfires. Afterwards, the secretary of the state's environment department set a long-term aspiration of burning about 260,000 hectares a year.</p><p>By 2008 the same bureaucrat told Parliament the government was trying to move away from hectare-based targets.</p><p>In the lead-up to Black Saturday in 2009 the environment department was targeting about 130,000 hectares in planned burns every year. The department wanted to do more, but that was the limit of what they could do given their financial resources.</p><p>Fire crews at Kinglake and Strathewen reported seeing so much timber in the landscape they knew they would be powerless to stop a fire if it took off.</p><p>The 2009 royal commission convened a panel of experts. It reviewed thousands of published studies. It heard from fire experts around the world.</p><p>It recommended a minimum of 385,000 hectares of Victorian bushland be burnt every year.</p><p>The government accepted the recommendation. For a brief window, we almost implemented it, treating more than 250,000 hectares in 2012-13 with burning and other risk-reduction measures. It wouldn't last.</p><p>The problem with hectare-based targets is they can encourage indiscriminate burning. This, according to reports from both the Bushfires Royal Commission Implementation Monitor and the Inspector-General for Emergency Management, is exactly what happened. Huge swathes of scrub that was of no risk to anyone was burnt, the reports found.</p><p>\"There were problems in achieving the [royal commission] target, and that a lot of areas in western Victoria were being treated that had very little value in terms of risk reduction,\" says Bradstock, a member of the royal commission's expert panel.</p><p>Both recommended the hectare target be dropped and replaced with a different kind of target. Rather than burn a given amount of bush, they advocated burning to cut risk by 20 per cent compared to what the risk would be if no planned burning was done.</p><p>At about the same time, a planned burn in Lancefield got away, consuming several homes. The government, under pressure, dropped the 350,000-hectare goal, replacing it with a risk-based target.</p><p>\"It was the right decision,\" says Craig Lapsley, who was head of Emergency Management Victoria at the time. \"However, the application has now shown there has not been enough burnt.\"</p><p>Immediately after the target was dropped, the amount of land treated nosedived to just 74,728 hectares in 2017-18, before increasing to 130,044 hectares in 2018-19.</p><p>The Age does not suggest dropping the target is directly linked to a fall in the amount of land treated. Planned burns are notoriously difficult to do safely - the weather has to be hot enough for a blaze, but cool enough that the fire can be kept under control. There are perhaps 10 days a year with the right weather conditions.</p><p>In 2013-14, for example, Victoria had a hectare-based target but managed to burn only 82,022 hectares. \"It is harder and harder to find enough days for the safe and effective conduct of planned burning,\" a spokesman for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said in a statement.</p><p>\"The suggestion we're not prepared to undertake planned burns is wrong and anyone claiming it is either misinformed or deliberately spreading misinformation.\"</p><p>Still, three members of the expert panel appointed by the royal commission told The Age they strongly condemned the decision to drop the target.</p><p>\"It's politics,\" says Professor Mark Adams, a bushfire scientist now based at Swinburne University. \"It's not science. It's politics. The expert panel arrived unanimously at that figure of 5 to 10 per cent. Unfortunately, some of the members of the panel have seemingly changed their views since then.\"</p><p>Phil Cheney is blunt.</p><p>\"The long-term consequences of dropping the target is what is happening in NSW right now.</p><p>\"You will burn.\"</p><p>Since huge blazes ripped through East Gippsland, destroying hundreds of homes, planned burning has become - once again - a political football.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to pressure the states to ramp up prescribed burning, and has been discussing national standards for hazard reduction. At a news conference earlier this month Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was quick to defend his record.</p><p>\"I think there's some good examples of where land that had been back-burned quite hard - quite heavy fuel reduction burning only three or four years ago - burnt pretty hot last weekend,\" he said.</p><p>The Country Fire Authority's chief officer Steve Warrington, standing alongside him, labelled claims planned burning was \"the solution to all our problems\" as \"really just quite an emotional load of rubbish\".</p><p>A spokesman for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said in a statement: \"The suggestion we're not prepared to undertake planned burns is wrong and anyone claiming it is either misinformed or deliberately spreading misinformation.\".</p><p>And record levels of hazard reduction in NSW do not appear to have stopped the mega-fires there.</p><p>We arrive at a lookout atop Mount Sugarloaf. Below us, tucked in a valley, sits the sleepy town of Strathewen.</p><p>Local authorities have worked hard to build big clearings around it, to stop fire reaching the town.</p><p>If there is a big fire, they are next to useless, says Tolhurst.</p><p>We look the other way, towards a row of hills.</p><p>Mount Disappointment towers in the distance. During Black Saturday, the fire raced up the mountain. It moved so fast that when it reached the top, rather than burning down into the valley below, it simply leapt to the next peak. And then to the one we're standing on.</p><p>And then it catapulted flaming embers the size of fingers down into Strathewen.</p><p>Twenty-two people died in the town.</p><p>But look around, says Tolhurst. The danger is not down there in the town, where the clearing has been cut - it's up here, where we're standing. And this patch has grown back more flammable than it was before.</p><p>All the waterbombers in the world won't stop a fire that can leap mountains in a single bound, he says.</p><p>Other experts disagree. Cleared buffer zones within 40 metres of houses were far more effective at reducing house losses than planned burning, says Associate Professor Philip Gibbons, a bushfire researcher at the Australian National University.</p><p>\"This summer's fires have burnt though many areas that had hazard-reduction burning,\" he says.</p><p>\"They can help control fires in moderate weather conditions, but in severe conditions it might just help reduce the severity.</p><p>\"If there was a silver bullet on bushfires we'd have found it by now, after the 51 inquiries since 1939.\"</p><p>Later, heading back to Melbourne, Morgan pulls off to the side of a road as we head into Steels Creek. On our right, a house surrounded by a large clearing. On our left, thick forest.</p><p>Morgan nods at the house. He'd be feeling pretty safe, he says. Hundred-metre-plus clearing. No way for the fire to get to him.</p><p>Tolhurst leans forward from the back seat. This forest burnt intensely a few years ago. See how it's grown back with much more fuel than last time? If it burns hot, thousands of pieces of bark will curl off these tall eucalypts, ignite, and fly towards the house. They can travel for kilometres. They will get into the attic and under the veranda and ignite, and the house will burn down.</p><p>What happens if we don't take action?</p><p>\"We're seeing that now. Disaster after disaster,\" says Tolhurst. With Mike Foley</p><p>tagCaptionCQ6Picture5 ID 9194258 SUNDAY AGE 6/6/09 Kevin Tolhurst bushfire specialist and scientist.

Ten people died.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A decade later, nearly every house has been rebuilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That one will not survive,\" says Professor Kevin Tolhurst, nodding at a house on his left. \"Neither will that one.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We stroll to the edge of the road, where it starts to slope steeply away. There is a bare patch here. A \"For Sale\" sign has been stuck in the yard. We're surrounded by trees.</p><p>From here you can see further down the hill. Stretching away beneath us is kilometre after kilometre of rolling green forest. In 2009, the fire roared through that forest, charged up the hill and destroyed this little strip of houses.</p><p>A decade later, the forest has grown back. Tolhurst believes it has grown back dramatically more flammable than before the bushfire.</p><p>Much of this thick forest grows in a heavily populated ring running 120 kilometres around Melbourne.</p><p>We are trapped in a spiral, Tolhurst argues.</p><p>The climate crisis is making big fires more likely. Each time a big fire burns the bush it becomes more flammable, leading in turn to more big fires.</p><p>To break that cycle, he believes we need to implement the recommendation he crafted as part of the 2009 Bushfire Royal Commission's expert panel: <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>burn at least 5 per cent of Victoria's public forests every year.</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>As the Prime Minister leads the charge on planned burning, calling for national hazard reduction standards, the scientific evidence is split on whether he - and Tolhurst - are right.</p><p>Many scientists argue a fire in extreme conditions - becoming more likely as the climate heats - won't be slowed down by a planned burn.</p><p>\"We're in record drought. We're seeing the effects of the climate crisis. You cannot say that's just down to more fuel,\" says Professor Ross Bradstock, one of Australia's leading bushfire scientists.</p><p>\"It is misleading to suggest that prescribed burning will provide the sole means of risk minimisation. Risk goes up and down. It does not go up forever.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock led a <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>comprehensive 2010 study</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> that found planned burns do almost nothing to stop bushfires.</p><p>But the 2009 Royal Commission <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>concluded</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> what planned burning had been done did cut the spread of the fires on Black Saturday and helped firefighters contain them.

He was in the state control centre on Black Saturday, working with bushfire analysts; later he was one of the Royal Commission's appointed planned burning experts. He remains a bushfire researcher at the University of Melbourne.</p><p>He and the man behind the wheel of the jeep, Victoria's former chief fire officer Gary Morgan, are foresters, a profession which conjures images of men with thick beards living in the wilderness. That is not far from the truth. Tolhurst's hobbies include finding and registering historic trees for the National Trust. His beard is voluminous.</p><p>It seems like common sense: if you burn a forest, it will take decades to grow back ready to burn again. Hence areas burnt in Black Saturday shouldn't burn again any time soon.</p><p>This, Tolhurst believes, is wrong. It takes as little as four years for landscape to grow back after an intense raging bushfire. When it does, it is more flammable, he says.</p><p>\"Wherever there was one tree, now there are 10 trees, or 50 trees,\" he says. \"And the chances are it will burn again. So those 10 trees will become 100 trees.\"</p><p>Why? First, an extremely hot fire kills big trees. This opens the way for a lot of new, small and much more flammable trees to grow in their place.</p><p>After a fire, thick shrubs and bushes grow back at ground level, Tolhurst says. And young trees make up a mid level. Up above, fire encourages eucalypts to spawn thick canopies.</p><p>We're standing in a patch of eucalypt forest near Kinglake burnt in 2009. Tolhurst traces a line upward. This is not a forest, he says. It's a ladder, with foliage at each level, allowing the fire to race up into the thick forest canopy, where it turns into a mega-blaze.</p><p>Planned burns are different, says Tolhurst. Done right, they burn cool and slow.</p><p>Further down the highway, Morgan turns left into Castella Road. A planned burn went through here in 2008. The forest floor is shrubby, and the eucalypts stand tall and erect. But there are no young trees, no mid level. The planned burn took it all off. We crane our necks to look up at sunlight filtering through the thick canopy.</p><p>No way fire is getting up there, says Morgan.</p><p>Maybe. Other scientists argue when the conditions are bad enough, fire will burn anything.</p><p>\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously.

Ten people died.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A decade later, nearly every house has been rebuilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That one will not survive,\" says Professor Kevin Tolhurst, nodding at a house on his left. \"Neither will that one.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We stroll to the edge of the road, where it starts to slope steeply away. There is a bare patch here. A \"For Sale\" sign has been stuck in the yard. We're surrounded by trees.</p><p>From here you can see further down the hill. Stretching away beneath us is kilometre after kilometre of rolling green forest. In 2009, the fire roared through that forest, charged up the hill and destroyed this little strip of houses.</p><p>A decade later, the forest has grown back. Tolhurst believes it has grown back dramatically more flammable than before the bushfire.</p><p>Much of this thick forest grows in a heavily populated ring running 120 kilometres around Melbourne.</p><p>We are trapped in a spiral, Tolhurst argues.</p><p>The climate crisis is making big fires more likely. Each time a big fire burns the bush it becomes more flammable, leading in turn to more big fires.</p><p>To break that cycle, he believes we need to implement the recommendation he crafted as part of the 2009 Bushfire Royal Commission's expert panel: <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>burn at least 5 per cent of Victoria's public forests every year.</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>As the Prime Minister leads the charge on planned burning, calling for national hazard reduction standards, the scientific evidence is split on whether he - and Tolhurst - are right.</p><p>Many scientists argue a fire in extreme conditions - becoming more likely as the climate heats - won't be slowed down by a planned burn.</p><p>\"We're in record drought. We're seeing the effects of the climate crisis. You cannot say that's just down to more fuel,\" says Professor Ross Bradstock, one of Australia's leading bushfire scientists.</p><p>\"It is misleading to suggest that prescribed burning will provide the sole means of risk minimisation. Risk goes up and down. It does not go up forever.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock led a <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>comprehensive 2010 study</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> that found planned burns do almost nothing to stop bushfires.</p><p>But the 2009 Royal Commission <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>concluded</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> what planned burning had been done did cut the spread of the fires on Black Saturday and helped firefighters contain them. And       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>one 2013 study</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> found that as Western Australia halved the amount of planned burning it does over the last 30 years, the size of bushfires in the region quadrupled. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Burning trees makes them </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">flammable</emphasis></p><p>Tolhurst is one of Australia's most respected bushfire experts. He was in the state control centre on Black Saturday, working with bushfire analysts; later he was one of the Royal Commission's appointed planned burning experts. He remains a bushfire researcher at the University of Melbourne.</p><p>He and the man behind the wheel of the jeep, Victoria's former chief fire officer Gary Morgan, are foresters, a profession which conjures images of men with thick beards living in the wilderness. That is not far from the truth. Tolhurst's hobbies include finding and registering historic trees for the National Trust. His beard is voluminous.</p><p>It seems like common sense: if you burn a forest, it will take decades to grow back ready to burn again. Hence areas burnt in Black Saturday shouldn't burn again any time soon.</p><p>This, Tolhurst believes, is wrong. It takes as little as four years for landscape to grow back after an intense raging bushfire. When it does, it is more flammable, he says.</p><p>\"Wherever there was one tree, now there are 10 trees, or 50 trees,\" he says. \"And the chances are it will burn again. So those 10 trees will become 100 trees.\"</p><p>Why? First, an extremely hot fire kills big trees. This opens the way for a lot of new, small and much more flammable trees to grow in their place.</p><p>After a fire, thick shrubs and bushes grow back at ground level, Tolhurst says. And young trees make up a mid level. Up above, fire encourages eucalypts to spawn thick canopies.</p><p>We're standing in a patch of eucalypt forest near Kinglake burnt in 2009. Tolhurst traces a line upward. This is not a forest, he says. It's a ladder, with foliage at each level, allowing the fire to race up into the thick forest canopy, where it turns into a mega-blaze.</p><p>Planned burns are different, says Tolhurst. Done right, they burn cool and slow.</p><p>Further down the highway, Morgan turns left into Castella Road. A planned burn went through here in 2008. The forest floor is shrubby, and the eucalypts stand tall and erect. But there are no young trees, no mid level. The planned burn took it all off. We crane our necks to look up at sunlight filtering through the thick canopy.</p><p>No way fire is getting up there, says Morgan.</p><p>Maybe. Other scientists argue when the conditions are bad enough, fire will burn anything.</p><p>\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour,\" University of Tasmania planned burning expert Professor David Bowman <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/hazard-reduction-burns-bushfires/11817336\">told the ABC</url>.</p><p>Large parts of Australia's landscape crave fire, Tolhurst and Morgan argue. Our trees and animals are adapted to it after thousands of years of bushfires lit by lightning strikes and Aboriginal burning practices. Dry eucalypt forest needs low-intensity fire every decade or so to stay healthy.</p><p>\"We have stories, we have research documents, that state that when first settlers were coming into our areas, they saw smoke plumes across the country,\" says Trent Nelson, chair of the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation. Dja Dja Wurrung territory centres around Kooyoora State Park in central Victoria.</p><p>\"Traditional owners were burning country nearly every day of the year. Fire was in the landscape,\" says Nelson.</p><p>Fire returns nutrients to the soil. They change the environment, making way for mosses and lichens - which recycle their own nutrients - to thrive. Cool blazes lead to rapid growth of small plants which feed insects, which in turn feed small birds. Scientists recently discovered bats love to roost under the curled, blackened bark. Possums, mallee fowl and parrots shelter in old bits of bush but get their most nutritious food from newly-burnt patches.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria, working with traditional owners, last year reintroduced cultural burning to some parts of the state.</p><p>The fires the Dja Dja Wurrung light are exactly the type Tolhurst talks about: slow-burning, less intense. That gives animals and insects plenty of warning to flee, says Nelson.</p><p>Phil Cheney spent his career working as a fire behaviouralist for the CSIRO and was on the Royal Commission's expert panel after the 2009 blazes.</p><p>He recently travelled through a part of Gippsland untouched by fire for too long. \"You could see the tops were dying off,\" he says. All the nutrients had been leached from the soils. \"It's an indication the health of the whole system is declining.\"</p><p>Importantly, a healthy forest needs a patchwork mosaic of burnt areas. Possums, mallee fowl and parrots rely on recently burnt areas to feed, but live in old-growth areas that are full of good nesting sites.</p><p>Over lunch, Morgan pulls out his phone and shows off an image of a dot painting he's had commissioned by Pauline Bonney, a Wongi artist from Western Australia.</p><p>It's a stand of banksia trees being licked by flames, the fire a matrix of red and purple and black dots. Banksias need fire to open their seed pods and spread the seed. Without fire, they die. \"Fire's not about destruction,\" says Morgan. \"It's about regeneration.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A history of fires - and unmet targets</emphasis></p><p>Planned burning tends to follow a pattern.</p><p>A huge fire rips through the state, destroying homes and taking lives. Afterwards, an investigation or Royal Commission sifts through the ashes and lays some of the blame for the fire on inadequate planned burning.</p><p>This happened in the 1939 and 2009 royal commissions, the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfire review, the 2002-03 Victorian bushfire inquiry and a 2008 parliamentary inquiry.</p><p>A target is then set. The government, anxious to act, implements it.</p><p>And then, often within just a few years, the target is either dropped or ignored.</p><p>Take the 2002 Victorian bushfires. Afterwards, the secretary of the state's environment department set a long-term aspiration of burning about 260,000 hectares a year.</p><p>By 2008, the same bureaucrat told Parliament the government was trying to move away from hectare-based targets.</p><p>In the lead-up to Black Saturday in 2009, the environment department was targeting about 130,000 hectares in planned burns every year. The department wanted to do more, but that was the limit of what they could do given their financial resources.</p><p>Fire crews at Kinglake and Strathewen reported seeing so much timber in the landscape they knew they would be powerless to stop a fire if it took off.</p><p>The 2009 Royal Commission convened a panel of experts. It reviewed thousands of published studies. It heard from fire experts around the world.</p><p>It recommended a minimum of 385,000 hectares of Victorian bushland be burnt every year.</p><p>The government accepted the recommendation. For a brief window, we almost implemented it, treating more than 250,000 hectares in 2012-13 with burning and other risk-reduction measures.</p><p>It wouldn't last.</p><p>The problem with hectare-based targets is they can encourage indiscriminate burning. This, according to reports from both the the Bushfire Royal Commission Implementation Monitor and the Inspector-General for Emergency Management, is exactly what happened.</p><p>Huge swathes of scrub that was of no risk to anyone was burnt, the reports found.</p><p>\"There were problems in achieving the [Royal Commission] target, and that a lot of areas in western Victoria were being treated that had very little value in terms of risk reduction,\" says Professor Bradstock, himself a member of the Royal Commission's expert panel.</p><p>Both recommended the hectare target be dropped and replaced with a different kind of target. Rather than burn a given amount of bush, they advocated burning to cut risk by 20 per cent compared to what the risk would be if no planned burning was done at all.</p><p>At about the same time, a planned burn in Lancefield got away, consuming several homes. The government, under pressure, dropped the 350,000-hectare goal, replacing it with a risk-based target.</p><p>\"It was the right decision,\" says Craig Lapsley, who was head of Emergency Management Victoria at the time. \"However the application has now shown there has not been enough burnt.\"</p><p>Immediately after the target was dropped, the amount of land treated nosedived, down to just 74,728 hectares in 2017-18, before increasing to 130,044 hectares in 2018-19.</p><p>The Age does not suggest dropping the target is directly linked to a fall in the amount of land treated. Planned burns are notoriously difficult to do safely - the weather has to be hot enough for a blaze, but cool enough that the blaze can be kept under control. There are perhaps 10 days a year with the right weather conditions.</p><p>In 2013-14, for example, Victoria had a hectare-based target but managed to burn only 82,022 hectares.</p><p>\"It is harder and harder to find enough days for the safe and effective conduct of planned burning,\" a spokesman for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said in a statement.</p><p>\"The suggestion we're not prepared to undertake planned burns is wrong and anyone claiming it is either misinformed or deliberately spreading misinformation.\"</p><p>Still, three members of the expert panel appointed by the Royal Commission told The Age they strongly condemned the decision to drop the target.</p><p>\"It's politics,\" says Professor Mark Adams, a bushfire scientist now based at Swinburne University. \"It's not science.

Unfortunately, some of the members of the panel have seemingly changed their views since then.\"</p><p>Phil Cheney was blunt.</p><p>\"The long-term consequences of dropping the target is what is happening in NSW right now.</p><p>\"You will burn.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A burning political football </emphasis></p><p>Since huge blazes ripped through East Gippsland, burning down hundreds of homes, planned burning has become - once again - a political football.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to pressure the states to ramp up prescribed burning, and has been discussing national standards for hazard reduction.</p><p>At a news conference earlier this month Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was quick to defend his record.</p><p>\"I think there's some good examples of where land that had been backburned quite hard ??? quite heavy fuel reduction burning only three or four years ago ??? burnt pretty hot last weekend,\" he said.</p><p>The Country Fire Authority's chief officer Steve Warrington, standing along side him, labelled claims planned burning was \"the solution to all our problems\" as \"really just quite an emotional load of rubbish\".</p><p>\"The suggestion we're not prepared to undertake planned burns is wrong and anyone claiming it is either misinformed or deliberately spreading misinformation,\" a spokesman for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said in a statement.</p><p>And record levels of hazard reduction in NSW do not appear to have stopped the mega-fires there.</p><p>We arrive at a lookout atop Mount Sugarloaf.

Ten people died.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A decade later, nearly every house has been rebuilt.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"That one will not survive,\" says Professor Kevin Tolhurst, nodding at a house on his left. \"Neither will that one.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We stroll to the edge of the road, where it starts to slope steeply away. There is a bare patch here. A \"For Sale\" sign has been stuck in the yard. We're surrounded by trees.</p><p>From here you can see further down the hill. Stretching away beneath us is kilometre after kilometre of rolling green forest. In 2009, the fire roared through that forest, charged up the hill and destroyed this little strip of houses.</p><p>A decade later, the forest has grown back. Tolhurst believes it has grown back dramatically more flammable than before the bushfire.</p><p>Much of this thick forest grows in a heavily populated ring running 120 kilometres around Melbourne.</p><p>We are trapped in a spiral, Tolhurst argues.</p><p>The climate crisis is making big fires more likely. Each time a big fire burns the bush it becomes more flammable, leading in turn to more big fires.</p><p>To break that cycle, he believes we need to implement the recommendation he crafted as part of the 2009 Bushfire Royal Commission's expert panel: <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>burn at least 5 per cent of Victoria's public forests every year.</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link></p><p>As the Prime Minister leads the charge on planned burning, calling for national hazard reduction standards, the scientific evidence is split on whether he - and Tolhurst - are right.</p><p>Many scientists argue a fire in extreme conditions - becoming more likely as the climate heats - won't be slowed down by a planned burn.</p><p>\"We're in record drought. We're seeing the effects of the climate crisis. You cannot say that's just down to more fuel,\" says Professor Ross Bradstock, one of Australia's leading bushfire scientists.</p><p>\"It is misleading to suggest that prescribed burning will provide the sole means of risk minimisation. Risk goes up and down. It does not go up forever.\"</p><p>Professor Bradstock led a <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>comprehensive 2010 study</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> that found planned burns do almost nothing to stop bushfires.</p><p>But the 2009 Royal Commission <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>concluded</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> what planned burning had been done did cut the spread of the fires on Black Saturday and helped firefighters contain them. And       \u00a0    <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>one 2013 study</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link> found that as Western Australia halved the amount of planned burning it does over the last 30 years, the size of bushfires in the region quadrupled. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Burning trees makes them </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">more </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">flammable</emphasis></p><p>Tolhurst is one of Australia's most respected bushfire experts. He was in the state control centre on Black Saturday, working with bushfire analysts; later he was one of the Royal Commission's appointed planned burning experts. He remains a bushfire researcher at the University of Melbourne.</p><p>He and the man behind the wheel of the jeep, Victoria's former chief fire officer Gary Morgan, are foresters, a profession which conjures images of men with thick beards living in the wilderness. That is not far from the truth. Tolhurst's hobbies include finding and registering historic trees for the National Trust. His beard is voluminous.</p><p>It seems like common sense: if you burn a forest, it will take decades to grow back ready to burn again. Hence areas burnt in Black Saturday shouldn't burn again any time soon.</p><p>This, Tolhurst believes, is wrong. It takes as little as four years for landscape to grow back after an intense raging bushfire. When it does, it is more flammable, he says.</p><p>\"Wherever there was one tree, now there are 10 trees, or 50 trees,\" he says. \"And the chances are it will burn again. So those 10 trees will become 100 trees.\"</p><p>Why? First, an extremely hot fire kills big trees. This opens the way for a lot of new, small and much more flammable trees to grow in their place.</p><p>After a fire, thick shrubs and bushes grow back at ground level, Tolhurst says. And young trees make up a mid level. Up above, fire encourages eucalypts to spawn thick canopies.</p><p>We're standing in a patch of eucalypt forest near Kinglake burnt in 2009. Tolhurst traces a line upward. This is not a forest, he says. It's a ladder, with foliage at each level, allowing the fire to race up into the thick forest canopy, where it turns into a mega-blaze.</p><p>Planned burns are different, says Tolhurst. Done right, they burn cool and slow.</p><p>Further down the highway, Morgan turns left into Castella Road. A planned burn went through here in 2008. The forest floor is shrubby, and the eucalypts stand tall and erect. But there are no young trees, no mid level. The planned burn took it all off. We crane our necks to look up at sunlight filtering through the thick canopy.</p><p>No way fire is getting up there, says Morgan.</p><p>Maybe. Other scientists argue when the conditions are bad enough, fire will burn anything.</p><p>\"There's so much heat and strong winds that the fire is able to travel across landscapes regardless of whether they've been burnt previously. It doesn't affect the [fire] behaviour,\" University of Tasmania planned burning expert Professor David Bowman <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-20/hazard-reduction-burns-bushfires/11817336\">told the ABC</url>.</p><p>Large parts of Australia's landscape crave fire, Tolhurst and Morgan argue. Our trees and animals are adapted to it after thousands of years of bushfires lit by lightning strikes and Aboriginal burning practices. Dry eucalypt forest needs low-intensity fire every decade or so to stay healthy.</p><p>\"We have stories, we have research documents, that state that when first settlers were coming into our areas, they saw smoke plumes across the country,\" says Trent Nelson, chair of the Dja Dja Wurrung Clans Aboriginal Corporation. Dja Dja Wurrung territory centres around Kooyoora State Park in central Victoria.</p><p>\"Traditional owners were burning country nearly every day of the year. Fire was in the landscape,\" says Nelson.</p><p>Fire returns nutrients to the soil. They change the environment, making way for mosses and lichens - which recycle their own nutrients - to thrive. Cool blazes lead to rapid growth of small plants which feed insects, which in turn feed small birds. Scientists recently discovered bats love to roost under the curled, blackened bark. Possums, mallee fowl and parrots shelter in old bits of bush but get their most nutritious food from newly-burnt patches.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria, working with traditional owners, last year reintroduced cultural burning to some parts of the state.</p><p>The fires the Dja Dja Wurrung light are exactly the type Tolhurst talks about: slow-burning, less intense. That gives animals and insects plenty of warning to flee, says Nelson.</p><p>Phil Cheney spent his career working as a fire behaviouralist for the CSIRO and was on the Royal Commission's expert panel after the 2009 blazes.</p><p>He recently travelled through a part of Gippsland untouched by fire for too long. \"You could see the tops were dying off,\" he says. All the nutrients had been leached from the soils. \"It's an indication the health of the whole system is declining.\"</p><p>Importantly, a healthy forest needs a patchwork mosaic of burnt areas. Possums, mallee fowl and parrots rely on recently burnt areas to feed, but live in old-growth areas that are full of good nesting sites.</p><p>Over lunch, Morgan pulls out his phone and shows off an image of a dot painting he's had commissioned by Pauline Bonney, a Wongi artist from Western Australia.</p><p>It's a stand of banksia trees being licked by flames, the fire a matrix of red and purple and black dots. Banksias need fire to open their seed pods and spread the seed. Without fire, they die. \"Fire's not about destruction,\" says Morgan. \"It's about regeneration.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A history of fires - and unmet targets</emphasis></p><p>Planned burning tends to follow a pattern.</p><p>A huge fire rips through the state, destroying homes and taking lives. Afterwards, an investigation or Royal Commission sifts through the ashes and lays some of the blame for the fire on inadequate planned burning.</p><p>This happened in the 1939 and 2009 royal commissions, the 1983 Ash Wednesday bushfire review, the 2002-03 Victorian bushfire inquiry and a 2008 parliamentary inquiry.</p><p>A target is then set. The government, anxious to act, implements it.</p><p>And then, often within just a few years, the target is either dropped or ignored.</p><p>Take the 2002 Victorian bushfires. Afterwards, the secretary of the state's environment department set a long-term aspiration of burning about 260,000 hectares a year.</p><p>By 2008, the same bureaucrat told Parliament the government was trying to move away from hectare-based targets.</p><p>In the lead-up to Black Saturday in 2009, the environment department was targeting about 130,000 hectares in planned burns every year. The department wanted to do more, but that was the limit of what they could do given their financial resources.</p><p>Fire crews at Kinglake and Strathewen reported seeing so much timber in the landscape they knew they would be powerless to stop a fire if it took off.</p><p>The 2009 Royal Commission convened a panel of experts. It reviewed thousands of published studies. It heard from fire experts around the world.</p><p>It recommended a minimum of 385,000 hectares of Victorian bushland be burnt every year.</p><p>The government accepted the recommendation. For a brief window, we almost implemented it, treating more than 250,000 hectares in 2012-13 with burning and other risk-reduction measures.</p><p>It wouldn't last.</p><p>The problem with hectare-based targets is they can encourage indiscriminate burning. This, according to reports from both the the Bushfire Royal Commission Implementation Monitor and the Inspector-General for Emergency Management, is exactly what happened.</p><p>Huge swathes of scrub that was of no risk to anyone was burnt, the reports found.</p><p>\"There were problems in achieving the [Royal Commission] target, and that a lot of areas in western Victoria were being treated that had very little value in terms of risk reduction,\" says Professor Bradstock, himself a member of the Royal Commission's expert panel.</p><p>Both recommended the hectare target be dropped and replaced with a different kind of target. Rather than burn a given amount of bush, they advocated burning to cut risk by 20 per cent compared to what the risk would be if no planned burning was done at all.</p><p>At about the same time, a planned burn in Lancefield got away, consuming several homes. The government, under pressure, dropped the 350,000-hectare goal, replacing it with a risk-based target.</p><p>\"It was the right decision,\" says Craig Lapsley, who was head of Emergency Management Victoria at the time. \"However the application has now shown there has not been enough burnt.\"</p><p>Immediately after the target was dropped, the amount of land treated nosedived, down to just 74,728 hectares in 2017-18, before increasing to 130,044 hectares in 2018-19.</p><p>The Age does not suggest dropping the target is directly linked to a fall in the amount of land treated. Planned burns are notoriously difficult to do safely - the weather has to be hot enough for a blaze, but cool enough that the blaze can be kept under control. There are perhaps 10 days a year with the right weather conditions.</p><p>In 2013-14, for example, Victoria had a hectare-based target but managed to burn only 82,022 hectares.</p><p>\"It is harder and harder to find enough days for the safe and effective conduct of planned burning,\" a spokesman for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said in a statement.</p><p>\"The suggestion we're not prepared to undertake planned burns is wrong and anyone claiming it is either misinformed or deliberately spreading misinformation.\"</p><p>Still, three members of the expert panel appointed by the Royal Commission told The Age they strongly condemned the decision to drop the target.</p><p>\"It's politics,\" says Professor Mark Adams, a bushfire scientist now based at Swinburne University. \"It's not science. It's politics.</p><p>\"The expert panel arrived unanimously at that figure of 5 to 10 per cent. Unfortunately, some of the members of the panel have seemingly changed their views since then.\"</p><p>Phil Cheney was blunt.</p><p>\"The long-term consequences of dropping the target is what is happening in NSW right now.</p><p>\"You will burn.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">A burning political football </emphasis></p><p>Since huge blazes ripped through East Gippsland, burning down hundreds of homes, planned burning has become - once again - a political football.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison is expected to pressure the states to ramp up prescribed burning, and has been discussing national standards for hazard reduction.</p><p>At a news conference earlier this month Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews was quick to defend his record.</p><p>\"I think there's some good examples of where land that had been backburned quite hard ??? quite heavy fuel reduction burning only three or four years ago ??? burnt pretty hot last weekend,\" he said.</p><p>The Country Fire Authority's chief officer Steve Warrington, standing along side him, labelled claims planned burning was \"the solution to all our problems\" as \"really just quite an emotional load of rubbish\".</p><p>\"The suggestion we're not prepared to undertake planned burns is wrong and anyone claiming it is either misinformed or deliberately spreading misinformation,\" a spokesman for the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning said in a statement.</p><p>And record levels of hazard reduction in NSW do not appear to have stopped the mega-fires there.</p><p>We arrive at a lookout atop Mount Sugarloaf. Below us, tucked in a valley, sits the sleepy town of Strathewen. Local authorities have worked hard to build big clearings around it to stop fire reaching the town.</p><p>If there is a big fire, they are next to useless, says Tolhurst.</p><p>We look the other way, towards a row of hills. Mount Disappointment towers in the distance. During Black Saturday, the fire raced up the mountain. It moved so fast that when it reached the top, rather than burning down into the valley below, it simply leapt to the next peak. And then to the one we're standing on.</p><p>And then it catapulted flaming embers the size of fingers down into Strathewen.</p><p>Twenty-two people died in the town.</p><p>But look around, says Tolhurst. The danger is not down there in the town, where the clearing has been cut - it's up here, where we're standing. And this patch has grown back more flammable than it was before.</p><p>All the waterbombers in the world won't stop a fire that can leap mountains in a single bound, he says.</p><p>Other experts disagree. Cleared buffer zones within 40 metres of houses were far more effective at reducing house losses than planned burning, says associate professor Philip Gibbons, a bushfire researcher at the Australian National University.</p><p>\"This summer's fires have burnt though many areas that had hazard-reduction burning. They can help control fires in moderate weather conditions, but in severe conditions it might just help reduce the severity,\" he said.</p><p>\"If there was a silver bullet on bushfires we'd have found it by now, after the 51 inquiries since 1939.\"</p><p>Later, heading back to Melbourne, Morgan pulls off to the side of a road as we head into Steels Creek. On our right, a house surrounded by a large clearing. On our left, thick forest.</p><p>Morgan nods at the house. He'd be feeling pretty safe, he says. Hundred metre-plus clearing. No way for the fire to get to him.</p><p>Tolhurst leans forward from the back seat. This forest burnt intensely a few years ago. See how it's grown back with much more fuel than last time? If it burns hot, thousands of pieces of bark will curl off these tall eucalypts, ignite, and fly toward the house. They can travel for kilometres. They will get into the attic and under the veranda and ignite, and the house will burn down.</p><p>What happens if we don't take action?</p><p>\"We're seeing that now. Disaster after disaster,\" says Tolhurst.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">with Mike Foley</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520231552</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2K-D531-DY19-C11M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2620\"/><timeReceived>09:17 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Nowhere is this more evident than the eastern seaboard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The yellow you see is infrared imagery that shows where the fires have been.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The charred landscape, now doused in torrential rain, is a reminder of the awesome power of fire, and the mammoth recovery task ahead.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crisis has found a way to touch almost every Australian state and territory - a truly national emergency.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When our federal politicians left Canberra in December, the bush capital was untouched by fire.</p><p>Now they fly in over a blackened landscape.</p><p>Since July, the fires have burned through almost 16 million hectares in Queensland, NSW, Victoria, WA, SA, Tasmania and the ACT.</p><p>Conservative estimates put animal deaths at over 1 billion nationwide.</p><p>More than 3,500 homes have been destroyed.</p><p>And 33 people lost their lives. Among them, volunteer firefighters selflessly lending a hand.</p><p>So how did this happen?</p><p>A bushfire relies on four main factors to take hold: high temperatures, low humidity, strong winds, and a fuel source.</p><p>In early September 2019, in the Gold Coast hinterland, these four factors conspire to create a kind of bushfire rarely seen in Australia - a warning of what is in store for the rest of the country.</p><p>The southern half of Australia has just come off its <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/current/statements/scs71.pdf\">driest January to August</url> on record. Three years into a record drought, much of the country is bone-dry.</p><p>This is Lamington National Park in south-east Queensland as seen from one of the European Union's Copernicus Sentinel satellites. It is an outpost of an ancient rainforest surrounded by farmland 30 kilometres from the Gold Coast.</p><p>In 2016, the ridges of the area are tinged green.</p><p>But as several years of drought take their toll, the green recedes.</p><p>It creates the perfect conditions for a fire to take hold. All that is needed is a spark somewhere in the right place and the right weather conditions.</p><p>On September 2, a fire starts in difficult terrain at Sarabah. Higher-than-average temperatures, very low humidity and gusty winds lead to very dangerous fire conditions.</p><p>On September 6, the temperature hits 33.6 degrees Celsius. Strong and dry west-to-north-westerly winds send the fire through the wet sclerophyll, the eucalypt forest that grows on the boundaries of the sub-tropical rainforest near Binna Burra.</p><p>The yellow you're seeing among the smoke is infrared satellite data, which allows us to show the fire front.</p><p>The vegetation in this area is normally noted for its fire resistance, but conditions have caused the fire to take hold in an area where it normally wouldn't.</p><p>Days later the historic Binna Burra Lodge, a hub of eco-tourism opened 86 years ago, is taken by the fire.</p><p>The difference in the infrared imagery before and after the fire highlights the extent of the damage.</p><p>The fires burn through more than 3,600 hectares and continue to smoulder for months, re-igniting when temperatures push into the extremes, and each time pushing further into the rainforest. The area around the Binna Burra Lodge has never before burned in modern times.</p><p>By September 9, 80 fires burn across Queensland, and another 50 in New South Wales.</p><p>Forest Fire Danger Indices in south-east Queensland are around the highest they have ever been at that time of year.</p><p>Grant Williamson, a senior research fellow for the NSW Advanced Bushfire Research Hub, says the fires show just how dry conditions are.</p><p>\"[In Queensland] we do have fires through the winter ... but the fact that these fires were severe enough to burn through rainforest really suggests a huge moisture deficit there,\" he says.</p><p>\"The conditions were very dry and very hot, compared to what you'd expect.\"</p><p>Imagery from the Japanese Himawari weather satellite shows plumes of smoke clearly visible from space.</p><p>These are from vast fires burning through the forests of northern New South Wales.</p><p>\"Once we started to see fires coming up in September through these parts of NSW it became clear to me that this was going to be a very long season.\"</p><p>Beneath the smoke are towns such as Nymboida, where close to 100 homes are lost <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-08/bushfire-victims-in-nymboida-still-at-clean-up-stage-a-month-on/11769330\">when a wall of fire rips through the town</url>.</p><p>More than 500 houses across the region are destroyed and four people are killed.</p><p>A confluence of climate events</p><p>Against the backdrop of record global warming, 2019 was a particularly bad year for bushfire weather.</p><p>Cooler waters off Western Australia combined with relatively warmer waters closer to Africa - a phenomenon known as a positive Indian Ocean Dipole - and resulted in less moisture in the atmosphere in the continent's north-west, changing the path of weather systems coming towards the country from the Indian Ocean.</p><p>The Australian Bureau of Meteorology says this phenomenon was long-lived, lasting from May until the end of the year. Lower than average rain during that period was the result.</p><p>Furthermore: \"Spring brought an <url normalizedValue=\"http://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/2195/the-air-above-antarctica-is-suddenly-getting-warmerheres-what-it-means-for-australia/\">unusual breakdown of the southern polar vortex</url> which allowed westerly winds to affect mainland Australia. This reduced rainfall, raising temperature and contributing to the increased fire risk.\"</p><p>It was amid these conditions that a bushfire, the size of which Australia had never seen, was sparked.</p><p>On October 26, a single lightning strike amongst dry tinder north-west of Sydney is the progenitor of Australia's largest recorded bushfire.</p><p>The blaze begins innocuously enough. Against the backdrop of a great number of fires at emergency level, it barely rates a mention at first.</p><p>But by mid-November, the fire has grown to 85,000 hectares and is poised to threaten properties.</p><p>Infrared imagery shows the scale of the expansion in less than a month.</p><p>The fast-expanding fire soon begins to blow smoke over the Sydney basin.</p><p>By December 16, the Gospers Mountain blaze joins with other nearby fires. Together, they have already burned through nearly half a million hectares, and would go on to burn close to 900,000.</p><p>On December 17, <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-19/australia-heatwave-sets-hottest-day-for-second-time-in-two-days/11813446\">temperature records begin to tumble across the country</url>. The average maximum temperature for Australia is 40.7C, surpassing the record of 40.3C set in January 2013, previously Australia's hottest year on record. Then on the 18th, the record is topped again, with 41.9C - more than a degree higher than the day before.</p><p>Satellite imagery from December 21 shows the scale of the blaze.</p><p>Sydney is ringed by the Gospers Mountain blaze, and to the south the Green Wattle Creek blaze, which is threatening properties and townships on the outskirts of the city.</p><p>The harbour city's backyard, which it has long been driving its fingers into in the quest for more land, has caught fire.</p><p>Dr Williamson says weather, topography and vegetation combined to allow the mega-fire to burn through such a vast area.</p><p>\"We didn't have any significant rain events to slow it down, to put it out,\" he says.</p><p>\"There aren't many breaks in terms of natural rivers, or roads or settlements, where the fire would naturally come to a stop, and be unable to spread.</p><p>\"When you've got essentially a wilderness area with continuous vegetation going on for such a large area it's difficult to stop a fire. The length of the boundary you've got to fight it across just makes it very difficult to do.\"</p><p>Extreme heat</p><p>Amid the unfolding chaos, renowned US climatologist Michael Mann begins a family holiday in Australia ahead of a long-planned sabbatical in Sydney to study the very type of crisis he has just flown into.</p><p>Dr Mann was part of a group of scientists who were the first to show the drastic impact fossil fuels have had on global temperatures compared to historic records, and has been at the forefront of communicating the science of climate change for the past two decades.</p><p>\"Given that I had planned my sabbatical more than a year ago - and the topic of my research was to be the impact of climate change in extreme weather events in Australia - it was rather surreal to arrive just in time to experience the most extreme example on record,\" he says.</p><p>On holiday in the Blue Mountains, sandwiched somewhere in between the two blazes, Dr Mann witnesses the devastating effects of the tragedy firsthand.</p><p>\"I travelled with my family to see the Blue Mountains, only to arrive to see smoke-shrouded valleys and largely hidden cliffs and ridges.\"</p><p>Dr Mann is unequivocal about the cause of the tragedy: \"Take record heat, combine it with unprecedented drought in already dry regions and you get unprecedented bushfires like the ones engulfing the Blue Mountains and spreading across the continent. It's not complicated.\"</p><p>It's during these unprecedented conditions that <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2019-12-20/two-volunteer-firefighrers-dead-after-nsw-rfs-truck-rolls/11816732\">two volunteer firefighters die</url> when the cabin of their truck is crushed by a falling tree near Buxton, on the front line of the Green Wattle Creek fire.</p><p>Both men were fathers to young children.</p><p>Days later the fire tears through the regional town of Balmoral.</p><p>Twenty of the village's 120 homes are destroyed.</p><p>Under red skies</p><p>Christmas fails to bring respite, as the danger shifts to the south coast of NSW.</p><p>The area is dotted with towns set among eucalypt forests. Australians have holidayed here for generations.</p><p>Fires have been burning in the region around the town of Nowra since before Christmas, but the scorching temperatures supercharge the blaze.</p><p>The extreme heat from the fire front is clearly visible here in yellow and orange, as picked up by the Sentinel satellite's infrared sensors.</p><p>Further south, at 5:00am on New Year's Eve, an emergency warning is issued to residents of the small town of Cobargo.</p><p>Firefighters expect a southerly change to move the fireground north, and residents are advised to evacuate.</p><p>By 6:23am the fire is moving so fast that the Rural Fire Service is advising people in the town that it is too late to leave and to take shelter instead.</p><p>Satellite imagery from New Year's Eve shows thick smoke from infernos in Victoria's East Gippsland, burning since late November, blocking out the sky.</p><p>Underneath this smoke the bushfire is bearing down on Cobargo.</p><p>The tight-knit community of only 700 loses two of its members - a father and son defending their property. Many historic buildings on the main street are lost to the blaze.</p><p>Also beneath the plumes of smoke, the small holiday town of Mallacoota is under siege from the flames.</p><p>Thousands of people choose this spot to holiday during summer every year. But now the fire front has them trapped - there is no way out by road.</p><p>Sunrise on New Year's Eve brings an ominous, red glow; each photo emerging from the besieged town looks as if it is still developing in a darkroom.</p><p>The fire front pushes holiday-makers and residents onto the beach or the town's jetty - a small sliver of refuge against the blazes.</p><p>But even near the water, it isn't entirely safe. Evacuees are told they may need to get into the ocean to protect themselves if the fire gets too close.</p><p>A thousand people are eventually evacuated on Navy ships, with several hundred more leaving by air.</p><p>A new record for a new year</p><p>Early in the new year, the Bureau of Meteorology confirms what we all felt.</p><p>Not only was 2019 the hottest year on record for the country, 1.52C above average, but the nation also experienced its lowest rainfall since these two records began. December 2019 was a full 3.2C above average.</p><p>\"Persistent drought and record temperatures were a major driver of the fire activity, and the context for 2019 lies in the past three years of drought,\" the bureau <url normalizedValue=\"http://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/2304/hottest-driest-year-on-record-led-to-extreme-bushfire-season/\">says</url>.</p><p>Tom Beer is often referred to as the 'godfather' of bushfire and climate science in Australia. In 1988, he released the first research on the effects of climate change on bushfires in Australia.</p><p>While researching in 1987, when climate science was in its infancy, Dr Beer attempted to find a year where the temperature had varied more than 3.5 degrees above the average so that he could study what happened in that year as a model for the future. He was unable to find one.</p><p>\"Even finding a year that was 1 degree warmer was impossible,\" he says.</p><p>And according to Dr Beer, the 2019 fires may already be the new normal, even if the world limits emissions under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>\"Even limiting warming to 1.5 degrees under the Paris Agreement is more or less, in terms of bushfires, what you're seeing this year. If we get up to 3 degrees, then the fires are going to get worse.\"</p><p>Flames further west</p><p>The eastern states are not the only ones affected by blazes.</p><p>The same catastrophic temperatures in the lead-up to Christmas drive a blaze through the Adelaide Hills. More than 80 homes are destroyed, and one person is killed.</p><p>In the early days of the new year, the only sealed road between South Australia and Western Australia is closed for 12 days due to an out-of-control fire nearby.</p><p>And South Australia's Kangaroo Island, long a draw for holiday makers, becomes a microcosm for the situation facing the country, as soaring temperatures turbocharge fires that have been burning on the island since December.</p><p>Lightning sparks a number of fires <url normalizedValue=\"https://dhs.sa.gov.au/services/disaster-recovery/kangaroo-island-cfs-newsletter-4\">on the island</url> in mid-December; by New Year's Eve, two fires on the western end of the island are still burning out of control and threatening lives and property.</p><p>Two weeks later, the fires have laid waste to large swathes of the island's vegetation.</p><p>Around half of the island's area is touched by the inferno.</p><p>Two volunteer firefighters lose their lives ...</p><p>As well as countless native animals which call the island home.</p><p>Summer, the time of year when we as a nation collectively agree to switch off, had turned on us.</p><p>The picturesque scenery which undoubtedly drew tourists to the area, now black.</p><p>A national crisis goes global</p><p>As the new decade dawns, the rest of the world watches on in horror as Australia burns. Images of the tragedy make front-page news around the globe, and we become the face of what a climate future could hold.</p><p>But it is more than just images that spread: plumes of smoke from the east coast crisis cross the Tasman in early January ...</p><p>Turning the sky in Auckland orange ...</p><p>And glaciers brown with ash.</p><p>While New Zealand had received ash and smoke from Australian bushfires before, Dr Williamson says the sheer quantity of this year's event was \"probably unprecedented\".</p><p>\"[It's] a product of how much smoke there has been over such a long period that it's hanging around and able to travel a long way,\" he says.</p><p>\"It's just indicative of the size of the event - it's quite rare.\"</p><p>In time the smoke circles the globe and then returns to Australian skies.</p><p>Mega blaze 2.0</p><p>As the season's first mega-blaze is brought under control, a second mega-blaze is already forming.</p><p>The Dunns Road and Adaminaby Complex fires in NSW combine with two other blazes straddling the Victorian border near Albury, forming a fireground that will eventually burn through more than 800,000 hectares.</p><p>Smoke from the fires settles over Canberra, trapped again by the surrounding mountainous terrain. Flights are cancelled, national museums temporarily shuttered.</p><p>Melbourne doesn't escape the haze either.</p><p>The mega-blaze and East Gippsland fires send their payload to our second-largest city, a poignant reminder of a still evolving threat.</p><p>The eyes of the world are on Australia once again as the city gears up for the Australian Open.</p><p>The poor air quality makes headlines around the world as players speak out about the conditions; some matches are cancelled or forfeited in the lead up to the tournament.</p><p>Five people were killed in the blazes in Victoria, and more than 400 homes were consumed by the flames.</p><p>From fire to flood</p><p>After an agonising wait, rain finally arrives, in the same fashion as all the weather this summer - with extreme, destructive force. A tropical low dumps record amounts of rain, extinguishing the fires and creating flash flooding.</p><p>Down the coast firegrounds are turned to flood zones and Sydney streets are inundated just weeks after they were wreathed in smoke.</p><p>Even this is an example of what climate change can look like. Because the atmosphere can hold more water in warmer temperatures, when it does rain we're seeing more high-intensity, extreme rain events - the ones that are associated with flash flooding. Every degree of warming creates a 7 per cent increase in the intensity of those rain events.</p><p>There's still more summer to run, which means the threat of national disasters looms large over the continent. And experts warn this threat will only increase as the world heats and Australia's climate warms.</p><p>Michael Mann says it will \"only get worse\" and result in \"more extreme heat and drought, more destructive, faster-spreading bushfires, worse floods, more loss of life, more lost species\".</p><p>He says that even a 1.5C rise in average world temperatures, as mandated under the Paris Agreement, leads to a scenario \"in which Australians need to accept a new reality\".</p><p>\"Many fire-prone regions may become uninsurable, the first stage of uninhabitability.

It is testament to the incredible work of the RFS and emergency services that the losses were not greater.</p><p>I commend Captain Daryl Watkins of Batlow and everyone who defended the town for their remarkable efforts.</p><p>The Dunns Road Fire continues to burn on the southern edge of my electorate and at was only officially contained on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>It has turned some of our pristine wilderness in to funeral pyres of our unique flora and fauna.</p><p>It has taken an enormous effort to contain this beast.</p><p>The leadership of RFS Superintendent Roger Orr from Narrandera in the west of my electorate, in the face of this unprecedented challenge was nothing short of extraordinary.</p><p>I feel privileged to have met so many volunteers and emergency service workers who showed incredible courage in the face of unprecedented fire conditions. They were joined by colleagues in other organisations including Fire and Rescue NSW, the Forestry Corporation, National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Emergency and Fire Services of the ACT, the Northern Territory, Queensland, Tasmania, Western Australia, the United States and Canada.</p><p>I thank you for supporting our local RFS brigades and others from across NSW, many of whom I will mention shortly.</p><p>I got to see firsthand the amazing response of those on the front line of firefighting and in supporting roles.</p><p>We owe these volunteers and staff an enormous debt of gratitude.</p><p>I still marvel at the number of farmers and property owners who left their own homes undefended on severe and catastrophic fire condition days and came together to defend many properties and communities such as Tumbalong at the tip of the Cootamundra Electorate.</p><p>These crews included brigades from:</p><p>Tumblong Mundarlo Boorowa Gundagai Berremangra Maimuru Wombat Murringo Thuddungra Rugby Boorowa North Boara McMahons Kingsvale Adjungbilly Began Began Stockinbingal Cootamumdra Wallendbeen Frampton Cooneys Creek Brawlin Mt Horeb Coolac Wambanumba Boothenba Rye Park Quambone And let's not forget the 'Mosquito squad' - scores of farmers and their 'slip ons' across the fire ground who worked alongside the RFS and played such a vital part in saving properties.</p><p>Apologies if I have missed any of you.</p><p>It was a privilege to catch up with so many of you, to make you snack packs, to chat about your brigades and to see you in action.</p><p>At its core the RFS is a 'for the community, by the community' organisation, and it must always remain so.</p><p>It brings together people from all walks of life, and it's not uncommon to see several generations of the same family on the one tanker.</p><p>Fathers, daughters, sons, cousins, siblings, even grandparents and grandchildren.</p><p>I witnessed many of these relationships in the crews fighting the Dunns Road Fire, and worked alongside people like Di Lippaitt in the Tumut Fire Control Centre who not only silently carried the worries of the ever changing fire front, but how it would affect her husband and daughter out on tanker crews on the Tarcutta end of the fire, mostly in the Ellerslie Range and Westbrook Road.</p><p>Her daughter Courtney also spent time in Fire Comms in Tumut.</p><p>Also in Fire Comms were Wilma Cunningham from Griffith and Di Droscher from Batlow, who worked the day we thought Batlow would be lost, and then couldn't return home for several days after.</p><p>The fire comms team worked around the clock relaying messages between the Fire Control Centre and brigades on the fire ground, relaying critical information on what the fires were doing, the areas under threat and most importantly where all the firefighting personnel were on the ground.</p><p>The welfare checks were a highlight of our work during this uncertain time.</p><p>I want to thank them for helping me learn new skills like scribing, and logistics officers Geoff Frowd and Michael Borg for allowing me to be an active part of their team.</p><p>These are just some of the people who rarely make the news, but who are an integral part of the firefighting effort.</p><p>Seeing the incredible work of this close-knit organisation first hand was a privilege, RFS Superintendent Roger Orr, Inspector Jon Gregory and the teams under their command dealt with difficult terrain, in many places only accessible on foot or by aircraft, conditions permitting, fighting a bushfire that joined with the East Ournie Creek and Green Valley fires to become one of the largest on record.</p><p>The success of the RFS fire crews and those that joined them would not have been possible without the help of the Forestry Corporation and the team headed up by regional manager for the Snowy Mountains Dean Anderson.</p><p>The Corporation's employees joined firefighting crews, created fire breaks and helped save more than 120,000 hectares of pine trees which are so crucial to the region's economy and the state's timber industry.</p><p>The Forestry Corporation, Hume Forests, Hyne Timber, AKD, Visy and others are working more together closely than ever, to process the more than 50,000 hectares of burnt pine trees from the immediate supply area.</p><p>I want to note the efforts of the VRA and Search and Rescue in Batlow, Tumut and surrounding regions.</p><p>The members of these teams worked tirelessly to help others, and I know at least one member lost his own home while he was saving others.</p><p>My thoughts are with you and your family Mick.</p><p>To the volunteers of the SES, particularly those from Grenfell, my home town of Temora and my own unit at Junee, I thank you for your supporting efforts.</p><p>I want to particularly mention RFS volunteers Donna Martin and her husband Graham, who is the Tumut Group Captain.</p><p>They not only worked around the clock like so many others, they found room in their home to put me and my dear friend school teacher Nicole Sanderson, up for day, after day after day.</p><p>I will never forget your kindness and hospitality.</p><p>Our firefighters, Fire Control Centre and Emergency Operations Centres were fed by an army of volunteers.</p><p>Just down the road, the town famous for its dog and tuckerbox saw thousands of volunteers, led by Sue Houstein, making countless meals and snacks for more than a fortnight, feeding firefighters in places like Tumblong and Adelong, and making care packs for those who had lost everything.</p><p>This energy was seen everywhere. In Tumut a team of volunteers responded to a call out for help to make meals at 9pm.</p><p>Within a few hours we had made 500 sandwiches.</p><p>It would be remiss of me not to mention Robert Donges and Wendy Silk of Donges IGA in Young.</p><p>Like so many businesses and individuals, they went above and beyond to do their bit, holding a Bushfire Appeal.</p><p>Donges IGA appealed for donations of non-perishable food, water, toiletries, baby needs, pet supplies and money for the communities of the South Coast and Snowy Valleys.</p><p>To date Donges IGA has distributed $5,000 to the Snowy Valleys recovery centre, $12,000 to the South Coast, $1,700 to Cobargo $4,000 to Eden and $2,000 to Tumbalong in IGA gift cards.</p><p>They have also donated much needed water, food and toiletries valued at $20,000 to Tumut and Cobargo.</p><p>I was there to meet and unpack the trucks, what an incredible effort.</p><p>The town of Young is a small community, and this is not its only fundraising effort.</p><p>The Temora Rotary Club also gathered donations from Temora and surrounds.</p><p>They managed to collect more than four trailer loads of donations which they took the Tumut Boys Club.</p><p>That was a particularly special day because two of the cars were driven by my parents, Marie and Stephen.</p><p>In Junee Tearnna Mitchell, Madison Quinn and Jodie Coote, with the assistance of the Locomotive Hotel, organised a fantastic family day and fundraising event.</p><p>In Cootamundra, Justyn Smith put out a call for donations of non-perishable food and supplies to take to the evacuation centre at Bermagui.</p><p>When they ran out of bags to pack donations in and asked for more, around 2,000 were delivered by the community.</p><p>When they realised they didn't have enough bottles to go with baby formula, another 200 were donated.</p><p>Less than 7,000 people call Cootamundra home.</p><p>Further down the road in Wagga, people came from far and wide to drop off goods, sort donations and help displaced people find a change of clothes, and food for their families.</p><p>The volunteers ranged from locals lending a hand, to Yazidi refugees who know first-hand what it is like to have to flee their homes.</p><p>The people coming in to these centres were understandably shocked and shaken, but I was told a great story about one who hadn't lost his sense of humour.</p><p>After being overcome with emotion at the amount of donations on offer, a man who had evacuated from Batlow stopped crying, smiled and said 'imagine, all this help for us hillbillies'.</p><p>We have heard about the mental and emotional toll these fires have caused.</p><p>And we must ensure we have adequate mental health support moving forward.</p><p>People who would have normally had time to relax and recharge over January have instead given up their holidays to do what they could to help.</p><p>There are thousands, including in this chamber, who have come back to work after spending their summer dealing with this crisis.</p><p>I want to commend the EOC, FCC and Snowy Valleys Council who kept the residents of towns like Batlow, Tumbarumba and Tumut informed before, during and after the fires came through, and continue to deal with challenges of boil water notices, fallen and dangerous trees and helping property owners keen to get back on site.</p><p>Mayor James Hayes, Deputy Mayor John Larter, who is a paramedic himself, and General Manager Matthew Hyde are still working hard for their shire and have an enormous recovery ahead of them.</p><p>I also want to note the efforts of the Cootamundra-Gundagai Council, for their work in refilling water bombers, helping to create fire breaks and supporting their colleagues in the Snowy Valleys Council.</p><p>My commendations go to Superintendent Bob Noble, Inspectors Steve Radford (who very nearly lost his own home), Peter McClay, Adrian Telfer, John Achinger, Maggie Deal and others for their leadership in the EOC, evacuation centres and all the police who calmly did their jobs in and around fire grounds including Police Officers Mick Jones from Tumbarumba, Amy Zwickl from Batlow and Aaron Kilmurray, also from Batlow, who lost everything in the fire and still caught a looter who had stolen a car.</p><p>Their professionalism and courage is something we can all admire.</p><p>The efforts of the Murrumbidgee Local Health District are also noteworthy, the MLDH successfully relocated patients and residents of the Batlow Hospital and Aged Care facility to safety in Junee, and the residents from Tumbarumba MPS to facilities in West Wyalong, Temora and Narrandera, all wonderful health facilities in the Cootamundra Electorate.</p><p>The staff at these centres rose to the challenge of additional patients and went above and beyond to care for them.</p><p>The MLHD successfully returned all these evacuated patients home again.</p><p>That mammoth task was done with precision and care, and all staff should be praised for their skill in alleviating what must have been a distressing experience for those frail and vulnerable people.</p><p>Now we must head fearlessly in to the recovery phase.</p><p>Our National Parks rangers have worked as hard as many of the emergency services, with people like Matt White and Jake Shoard playing a huge role in the Tumut Fire Control Centre.</p><p>The task ahead of National Parks to help restore and rejuvenate our wilderness areas is enormous.</p><p>I acknowledge all of their efforts so far.</p><p>The outstanding work of BlazeAid is now well and truly underway, putting back thousands of kilometres of fencing and helping farmers get back to being the world-beating primary producers they are.</p><p>It would be impossible to name every person and every organisation that has gone above and beyond during this crisis.</p><p>The long efforts of recovery won't always be front page news.</p><p>But those efforts will dictate the future of many communities.</p><p>We often say 'regional communities are resilient'.</p><p>In the case of these fires, the term fits neatly.</p><p>These communities are already looking to the future.</p><p>Batlow is determined to hold CiderFest in 2020, thanks to community leader Ray Billings, despite extensive damage to the region's orchards and apple production.</p><p>Cider makers like Ralph Wilson want people to remember the best of the region, not the worst.</p><p>I hope many of you join me for this fantastic event and in sampling the region's delicious craft cider.</p><p>There are months of hard work ahead, I urge you to help in any way you can.</p><p>Buy a ticket to Tumbafest, make sure your apples are from Batlow, and stop in at Gundagai on your way there!</p><p>There are already people like James Zimmerman leading the Regrow Batlow movement working hard to get their towns back on their feet, and sharing stories about recovery.</p><p>Finally I want to thank the Premier Gladys Berejiklian and Deputy Premier John Barilaro, I can think of no better person to coordinate the state's recovery and rebuilding.</p><p>I also want to thank the Minister for Emergency Services David Elliot, and the entire Cabinet for their strength in leadership.</p><p>Your leadership has helped us all serve our communities better.</p><p>I want to acknowledge the work of the Member for Bega Andrew Constance, the Member for South Coast Shelly Hancock, the Member for Wagga Wagga Dr Joe McGirr, MLC Bronnie Taylor, who has been personally touched by this disaster with her property at Yaven Creek being one of the first burnt, and all members who have been so deeply and personally impacted.</p><p>I want to thank the Premier for announcing an Inquiry in to these fires, and look forward to us all working together to adopt its recommendations.</p><p>We must do everything in our power to protect the lives of our people, our communities and our unique flora and fauna from these sorts of disasters.</p><p>This summer was frightening, the fact so many of us are sharing our condolences is a tiny glimpse of the impact on our state and the nation.</p><p>May we do everything to ensure it does not happen again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Here's Ruth Morgan giving the annual address for the History Council of Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruth Morgan:</emphasis> Today, I want to reflect on futures from the past, that is on the kinds of futures that people in the past expected, hoped or feared. Although some futures past did unfold, it's not necessarily the realisation of these futures that makes them worthy of historical study, rather it's the particular conditions that produced these forecasts, predictions and possibilities, as well as what they set in train and how. That is the historian's concern. The future, after all, is always as much about the past as it is the present.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> As Professor Ruth Morgan implied, it's fascinating to hear predictions and why we thought the future would unfold in a certain way. When I presented <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> number one in 1975, I talked to futurologist Herman Kahn. Australia is fine, I suggested, we've got all those commodities. That's the problem, he replied, you'll remain stuck in the past. So let's go to the past, then the present, starting with some of the forecasting series we did nearly 20 years ago. Here's David Fisher:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Fisher:</emphasis> We begin with transport. Here's Robyn Williams in the future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> This is Perth. It's a lovely winter morning, August 2024, and I could be in any big Australian city. I'm walking down a street in the central business district and as you can hear it's so peaceful. No cars parked anywhere, because that stopped 15 years ago, and the road itself looks different. Smooth, like velvet.</p><p>Well, now I want to pick up a car to drive to meet Professor Peter Newman. He was the one who helped revolutionise city transport in this country and around the world about 20 years ago, in 2004. So I'm going to a pick-up spot where there are about 50 tiny two-seater carlets waiting, all shiny and spanking new like the ones you get from car rental firms. So I take out my smart card and wave it past the sensor of this nearest carlet, which can tell two things straight away. First, I'm not pissed, and second, that I've got funds in my account to pay. And I get in and drive off.</p><p>And so what's on the road? Well, not much more than carlets like mine. All have been picked up in the same way, rented for the moment. They are electric/hydrogen hybrids. The road itself is made of intelligent rubber plastic, self-repairing, and far less costly than the old tarmac roads which cost billions. It's made of old rubber tyres and some of the new polymers. And if there's a crack forming or a mini pothole, the material just grows back like a living skin.</p><p>In fact, it was quite amazing, when you come to think of it, way back then at the start of the century, that those enormously expensive roads were built and maintained from our tax dollars so that private cars could clog them up whenever they felt like it, more or less free. In fact, 30% to 40% of the city's surfaces are dedicated to the motor car. Imagine what a third of your city is worth.</p><p>Well, I'm in a suburban main road right now. Still no parked cars. Most houses don't have garages. Since the crisis there's been little point in owning a car. Renting is just so convenient. Laws about gas emissions are very strict, and most of us prefer to avoid what's left of the old petrol-slurping dinosaurs.</p><p>Okay, that was 2024. Now we're back in 2004 in one of the main streets, St Georges Terrace in downtown Perth, and the traffic isn't huge but it's heavy enough. Peter Newman, is my vision of what might happen in 20 years' time completely out of the question?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Peter Newman:</emphasis> Well, it's a little bit hard to imagine right now because I'm looking at about 20 four-wheel-drives in the middle of St Georges Terrace, which of course is pretty rugged country to have to drive through. The ridiculous nature of our transport systems is very hard to turn around and it all is about people's perceptions, it's about urban design, it's about where work is located, it's about the kind of society that we have in 2024.</p><p>But there are signs we could move towards that, there could be little carlets that have very clever facilities available to us. We certainly are getting a lot cleverer in all forms of transport. Perhaps the car is the least clever at the moment, it seems to have stood still for 20 or 30 years. But we have buses now that are linked with GPS so that you can tell exactly when they are arriving, and it won't be long before you'll be able to tell on your mobile phone.</p><p>This smart kind of transport is going to make our future transport systems a lot more sustainable, but they will still need people to have a conserver lifestyle to see that driving for the sake of it, even in a carlet, let alone a hydrogen-fuelled Hummer, is pretty stupid.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Peter Newman from Curtin University in 2004, as we were predicting 2024. So, half-right perhaps?</p><p>Back to reality and 2020. Historian Ruth Morgan reflects on the big story of 20 years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ruth Morgan:</emphasis> The year 2020 was always going to be a tantalising horizon for future thinkers, even its symmetry conjures the clear-sightedness and precision of 20/20 vision, to which policymakers and resource managers always aspire. Twenty years ago, most of southern Australia was still in the grip of the millennium drought. The dry conditions broke records around the nation. Perth's dams were at their lowest since the First World War, and the south-east of the country was on its way to the driest 13-year period since record-keeping began. As the Bureau of Meteorology put it at the time, this was the nation's first climate change drought. That observation came hot on the heels of the third assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which made headlines around the world with its conclusion that: there is new and stronger evidence that most of the global warming observed over the last 50 years is attributable to human activities.</p><p>If suburban households become complacent about their household water use, then the drought was a wake-up call. Across the nation, education campaigns and water-saving devices joined water restrictions in an effort to ease pressure on limited urban water supplies. In Melbourne, for instance, the voluntary Target 155 campaign aimed to more than halve the daily water consumption of residents by encouraging shorter showers while imposing strict limits on watering gardens and washing the car.</p><p>Brisbane went even further, aiming to reduce residential water consumption to 140 litres of water per person per day. The rainwater tank and greywater recycling became suburban must-haves, offering the means to keep gardens green in trying conditions. As the dam levels fell lower and lower, state governments turned to desalination, with Perth leading the way in 2006, a prospect that was unthinkable just a decade earlier.</p><p>Other states took notice, and before long desalination plants were on the drawing board for the Gold Coast, Sydney, Melbourne and Adelaide. But, for the most part, by the time those projects were completed, the rains had returned to the east coast and the plants built there were dismissed as white elephants.</p><p>Journalist Chris Hammer noticed this change in the weather himself as he reflected in the updated edition of his book on the Murray-Darling Basin in 2010. Browsing through his local bookshop, he'd realised that his book, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The River</emphasis>, had somehow migrated from the environment and ecology section where it had stood just six months ago, to a new place on the history shelves. Even so, this record La Ni\u00f1a rainfall that broke the millennium drought did not turn back the clock. A drying trend continued across the south of the continent, particularly in the south-west where winter rains had been in decline since the 1970s, due in part to human induced climate change. Indeed, while Eastern Australia experienced record high levels of rainfall in late 2010 and in 2011, Perth and much of south-western Western Australia experienced record dry weather.</p><p>These are just some of the challenges of planning for both climate variability and climate change on a continent of extremes. It's been looking ahead into the future that has been one of the ways in which Australians have long tried to come to terms with this continent of extreme climate variability.</p><p>In 2011, the Climate Commission released its first report, declaring that Australia was facing the critical decade. Back then of course the Climate Commission was a federal government body, established under the Gillard government, but it was dissolved under the Abbott government soon after its election in 2013. The decade to 2020, the Climate Commission's report argued, was critical in terms of meeting the 2 degrees Celsius guardrail by curbing emissions of carbon dioxide.</p><p>In the decade to 2020, global emissions had to be well on track to reaching zero by 2050 to limit the planet's warming. Taking the temperature on the nation's progress towards this goal in 2017, the Climate Council, the independent body that rose from the ashes of the Climate Commission, declared that Australia was now known as a global climate laggard. Already the concentration of carbon dioxide emissions had tipped over 400 parts per million, higher than at any other time for millions of years, and the planet's temperature was over one degree higher than temperatures before the Industrial Revolution of the late 18th century.</p><p>The report warned that the window of opportunity to limit worsening climate impacts is closing, and already extreme climate events were getting worse, pointing not only to bushfires and heatwaves but also to drought and drying across the south of the continent, just as the Garnaut Report of 2008 and countless other scientific studies had predicted. 2019 was the driest year since records began in 1900 and it was the country's warmest year. In fact, all the years since 2013 are among the ten warmest on record for Australia.</p><p>The impact of climate change has led to longer, more intense fire seasons, and an increase in the average number of elevated fire weather days as measured by the Forest Fire Danger Index. 2019 saw the highest accumulated index on record. Fires have burned before in Australia, but never like those we saw over the summer. It's cold comfort though, knowing that this disaster was no surprise. After all, the 2008 Garnaut Report warned that fire seasons will start earlier, end slightly later, and generally be more intense. This effect increases over time but should be directly observable by 2020.</p><p>In another 10 to 20 years' time, 2019 won't be so unusual. Although this year's emissions might be lower thanks to the Covid lockdowns, and the air might be cleaner, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere like carbon dioxide continues to rise, and the period 2016 to 2020 looks set to be the warmest five-year period on record.</p><p>Unfortunately, a few months of slowing down can't make up for the decades upon decades of greenhouse gas emissions that have accumulated in the atmosphere. History is weighing heavily on the planet's climate future.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Associate Professor Ruth Morgan at the ANU, a former ABC Top Five humanities star. Back to our 2024 Dreaming <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Science Show</emphasis> series and Lynne Malcolm.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lynne Malcolm:</emphasis> Like it or not, a good part of your future will be spent at work. 9 to 5 will be a dream of the past and you might still be at it well into your 70s. And don't get too comfortable about that corner office you've got your eyes on, by 2024 your office may be something you carry around on your belt, checking in with your business partners in China, with one eye on the kids playing in the local park. Don't get too attached to your current job either, you'll be constantly on the move, always learning and acquiring new skills. You'll need to be resilient, agile, and fast on your feet. And when you finally hit the nursing home, your carer may be an ever so considerate robot. In other words, put your seat belt on for the next 20 years.</p><p>Let's begin this trip to work in 2024 by imagining what life might be like in Australia by then. Richard Neville, once radical ratbag of the '70s, now spends his time speculating about the future. He sees it could go one of two ways, and the first is a turbulent and pacey ride.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Neville:</emphasis> It's gung ho Australia. It's more of the same only faster and faster because the future's now coming at the speed of light, and change is accelerating at an exponential rate. The gung ho Australia would really be based on the continuation of fossil fuels, it's burning, it's building, it's buying, it's booming, the cities will become huge and efficient and glamorous and exciting to live in. I guess the ethic is work hard, play hard. Growth in the jobs area will happen in conventional areas. Military, there's much more security required in this world, it's a slightly paranoid world, very materials based. And investment in the jobs of the future will be much more in infotech, robotech, biotech and nanotech. Sales and marketing will be enormous because people are shopping, we need to produce lots of consumer goods, that's where people get a lot of their sense of achievement. And so that's the gung ho Australian future scenario for the next 20 to 30 years.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lynne Malcolm:</emphasis> Alternatively, you may prefer to relax in your coastal retreat for a mind shift or a sea change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Richard Neville:</emphasis> The counter-trend to that is sea change Australia. This is predicated on a shift away from fossil fuels. I would state its theme as 'renew, reconnect and restore'. I guess one of its attitudes is 'slow down or die'. There would be a lot of jobs created by the research for renewable energy, green and friendly form of transport. In a sea change Australia, the whole discipline, if I can call it that, of economics would have to be reinvented because economics right now doesn't include nature in the costing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Well, closer to the mark perhaps, but sadly Richard Neville has now passed, and Lynne Malcolm has left the ABC. Do listen to this week's terrific <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Off Track</emphasis> program on RN about her brilliant career.</p><p>Meanwhile on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> here's Barry Jones whose book <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleepers, Wake!</emphasis> should have been a roadmap to innovation both in 1982 and 2000.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barry Jones:</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleepers, Wake!: Technology and the Future of Work</emphasis>, first published in 1982, was an attempt to describe the impact of technological change, especially the information revolution, on employment, industry, education and training. I aspired to make a grand synthesis, linking politics, history, economics, science, technology, education, psychology and information theory.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">What Is to Be Done</emphasis> is not an update or a revision - too much has changed since 1982 - but a sequel addressing the massive global changes that have occurred since then. A post-industrial workforce, the digital revolution, universal education to higher education, and the emergence of a 'third age' after retirement were all novel concepts, even after the last revision of the book in 1995. Now we take them for granted, but they did not develop as I had hoped.</p><p>There are nearly 6 billion users of the internet, more than 60% of the world's population. Our handheld devices have more capacity than the mainframe computers used in the 1969 Moon landing, giving us instant access to the world's intellectual resources.</p><p>As well, the United States, the United Kingdom, and Australia have by far the largest cohort of tertiary-qualified citizens in their history. This ought to provide us with an unparalleled capacity to understand the world's greatest problems - climate change, the refugee crisis, degradation of the environment, poverty, pandemics, the exploitation of women and children, terrorism - with an informed population and inspirational leadership.</p><p>However, in the digital age, far from exploring the universal and the long-term, both mainstream and social media emphasise the personal, or the tribal, in the short-term. Opinion is preferenced over evidence, and feeling over rationality, while science and free enquiry are rejected or discounted. Empathy, the common good, and preserving the planet have low priority. The planet, notoriously, has no vote. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Homo sapiens</emphasis> has morphed into <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Homo economicus</emphasis>, because all our politics revolves around production and consumption.</p><p>What is sometimes called 'the Enlightenment project' has come under sustained attack in the United States, much of Europe, and, to some extent, Australia. Instead, we see a retreat from reason; the rejection of facts and expertise; the rise of populism, snarling nationalisms, tribalism, and conspiracy theories; a fundamentalist revival and hostility to science; a failure of ethical leadership; deepening corruption of political processes; profound neglect of the climate change imperative; and the triumph of vested interests. All are existential threats to civilisation's advancement and the welfare of humanity here and elsewhere.</p><p>The greatest threat to liberal democracy and Enlightenment values has not been external - from ISIS or the Taliban or al-Qaeda, China, Russia, or even pandemics - but internal and self-inflicted. The four horsemen of the apocalypse that threaten humanity are: first, population growth; climate change; pandemics; and finally, racism and state violence. All four are inextricably linked. The pressure on resources, compounded by the threat of climate change, has been a major factor in tribal and racial conflicts over access to water and arable land. Meanwhile, millions of refugees are blamed for seeking security for their families, inequality grows exponentially, pandemics have devastating impacts not only for the aged, but on racial minorities who are stressed by insecurity, leading in turn to violent over-reactions by the custodians of law and order.</p><p>Donald Trump's election as president of the United States in 2016 was a turning point in modern history, and he has transformed politics beyond recognition, and he has imitators all over the world.</p><p>There has been a striking shift in political allegiances, centred on the 'culture wars'. People in the higher socioeconomic levels are becoming more progressive, eager to embrace change and take risks. Those in the lower levels are more conservative, anxious about change, and risk-averse, seeing themselves as potential victims.</p><p>When I began writing <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">What Is to Be Done</emphasis>, the book was to be structured around climate change/global warming and the world's failure to act. Back in 1982, I was well aware of this threat, and can claim to have been the first Australian politician to have grasped its significance. However, I did not discuss it in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleepers, Wake!</emphasis>.</p><p>But as I worked on this manuscript in 2020, new issues kept forcing me to rethink and recalibrate it, and they were all inter-related. The coronavirus pandemic, growing inequality, misogyny, the appeal of fundamentalism, state violence, state secrecy, the environmental stress caused by urbanisation and population growth, and gross increases in xenophobia, racism, and intolerance, culminating in the worldwide Black Lives Matter demonstrations. And the economic and social impact of climate change will exacerbate all these problems.</p><p>Australia can be outstanding in confronting crises, such as HIV/AIDS, the Global Financial Crisis, COVID-19, and most natural disasters. But its performance was patchy during the long, horrific bushfire season of 2019-20, and it has been woeful in failing to address climate change and transitioning to a post-carbon economy. COVID-19 demonstrated how well the federation could work, and it remains to be seen if this can be maintained in the post-pandemic era.</p><p>The better angels of our nature have been well hidden in our politics, with our part-time parliaments, the absence of serious debate, revolving-door prime ministerships, venality, vindictiveness, mediocrity, secrecy, and the influence of vested interests. Science (medical science excepted) is on the retreat, and the universities are under attack.</p><p>Citizens everywhere must engage in the great issues, and work together to master evidence and develop our capacity to define, debate, and decide. Without it, our fellow humans will be staring into an abyss.</p><p>Despite all this, we have to be optimistic that we will have the wisdom, courage, and skill to save the planet - and ourselves. It's the only way to go.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Barry Jones, former long-serving Science Minister. He offered a modern future for places like the Hunter Valley, away from coal towards high-tech 40 years ago, even 20. And I see this week the New South Wales government has acted with a fourth renewable energy zone for the valley. At last, the future. And Barry Jones's new book is called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">What Is to Be Done</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> and 'The Big 20' on RN.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexandra de Blas:</emphasis> I'm Alexandra de Blas, and today I'm guiding you through the innovations that will shape our homes of the future. Architect and designer Andreas Sederof sees it like this:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andreas Sederof:</emphasis>\u00c2 If you could imagine the Earth, with history condensed into, say, 100 years, dinosaurs came and went about a year ago, mankind turned up about a fortnight ago and started burning fossil fuel about five minutes ago, and in that five minutes we've so disrupted the balance of the planet that we've got less than four seconds to fix it. That roughly translates to about 50 to 80 years. But the good news is that because the building industry contributes to around about 40% of our environmental difficulties, we can actually make a big difference.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexandra de Blas:</emphasis>\u00c2 Dramatic changes are taking place in the world that could transform the way we live our lives. Here in Australia, the impacts of global warming are already being felt. The Murray-Darling and other river systems are overstressed and permanent water restrictions have become the norm. Our population is also aging. And yet we seem almost oblivious to the need to move to a more sustainable way of life. Dr Cameron Tonkinwise lectures in design studies at the University of Technology, Sydney.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Tonkinwise:</emphasis>\u00c2 The home of 25 years' time will be filled with much less permanence. So we're seeing people cycling through products at a faster and faster rate, and we're seeing new economies that actually cater for this, so we see the production of furniture that is deliberately styled in such a way that you know you're going to update your style at a particular point. So we're starting to see disposability move from everyday sort of objects of utility to actually objects that used to be permanent, like furnishings. So if the home becomes a place of changing products, of disposable products, this would be depressing in terms of sustainability but it might be positive in terms of people's self-perception or their ability to change their own perception of their self.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexandra de Blas:</emphasis>\u00c2 How do you think climate change will influence the type of homes we live in?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cameron Tonkinwise:</emphasis>\u00c2 I think that climate change will lead to more extreme weather events, I think that seems to be an emerging consensus in the scientific literature. In that case, the home is going to have to be more of a bunker, a place that needs to cater for a one-in-100-years storm every ten years, so the size of your gutters are going to have to enlarge maybe twofold, threefold. You're going to have to keep water on site because there's going to be less available water, so your home is actually going to also be a water reservoir. Your home needs to protect itself from high wind, your vegetation won't be the same sort of vegetation because frequently it will be felled or lose its leaves because of high wind. All of these are scenarios that are pretty depressing\u00c2 if\u00c2 we start to get more extreme weather events.</p><p>The other factor you could say is that if we start to get higher fluctuations in temperature, we're going to need more heavily controlled domestic environments in terms of their temperature, so they're going to have to have more insulation and they're going to have to have more active thermal comfort devices like air conditioners.</p><p>So houses will be very much more factories than they are now. At the moment, the only way they are factories is kind of in terms of the kitchen, the kitchen is a factory for producing food and a way of generating vast amounts of waste, and the bathroom is a type of factory, but everywhere else is sort of a place to live. But if the home of the future needs to compete against a changing environment it will all have to be a factory, a factory producing warm air, a factory producing cold air, a place producing clean water, a place handling water and moving that water off site as quickly as possible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alexandra de Blas:</emphasis>\u00c2 Cameron Tonkinwise.\u00c2</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Ali de Blas, who was then in the ABC 20 years ago. So are our houses as Cameron just described? <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> and 'The Big 20: Our century so far', an RN event for this week.</p><p>And we continue with someone whose life has been entirely this century. Zofia Witowski-Blake first spoke on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> when she was 15. Now, at 19, she is at the University of Melbourne. And here she describes a turning point in her career so far.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Zofia Witowski-Blake:</emphasis> I was 13 years old when I did my first competitive debate. It was in a small classroom at a neighbouring school with two tables set up facing the room for each of the teams to sit behind. I remember thinking that the room looked far too normal for the amount of adrenaline coursing through my body. But the opposing team came in, sat down, and we got ready to start.</p><p>They were from a private boys' school and were a year older and a head taller, and all of them wore these crisp red blazers with shiny gold badges. My team, all female and from a public school, wore daggy and baggy puffer jackets.</p><p>I was the third speaker for my team, which meant that I was supposed to come up with my speech during the debate by responding to the other side's points. By the first speaker, the fire alarm had gone off, and at the second, someone's phone started ringing. Things were not going to plan. My moment came, I stood up, said, 'As the third speaker I will be rebutting the arguments of the negative team,' looked down at my notes, and started to cry.</p><p>Glossophobia is the fear of public speaking, which translates literally to 'tongue dread'. And crying while public speaking is a worst-case scenario. But, thinking the situation could be salvaged by doubling down, I stood up there and kept on trying to speak, keeping everyone's eyes on me while struggling to form sentences, words getting mashed together into a soup. The tongue is made of a conglomeration of eight separate muscles, and on that day, mine were not working together.</p><p>This continued for three to four minutes, by the end of which I had made everyone in the room extremely uncomfortable. 'Mortification' comes from the word for death, and after that debate, I felt like I had died of embarrassment. It was physically painful. And while public speaking is the number one fear for many people, my whole life at age 13 felt like pinging from one incident of huge embarrassment to the next, which I think is a pretty common experience.</p><p>The pain of embarrassment at that age stems from not having a settled sense of self. There is the idea that one misstep could define your public memory, become what your classmates, teachers, everyone thinks when they look at you. Additionally, when we experience extreme embarrassment, our brains are flooded with adrenaline which acts as a glue for long-term memory. This is why I'm able to recall my debating failure so clearly seven years later, and probably until I die.</p><p>Early puberty is a period of immense growth in the brain. Your prefrontal cortex is still being developed, so decision-making is partly delegated to the amygdala, which is associated with emotions, impulses, aggression and instinctive behaviour. Furthermore, the huge amount of synapses, the connections between neurons that are formed when you are an infant are being pared back in a process called synaptic pruning. This is a really important part of brain development that makes the brain more efficient at processing information, and when it doesn't happen, it has been shown to increase the likelihood of conditions like schizophrenia. But when I hear the phrase 'synaptic pruning', it just sounds like a tiny little gardener running around my brain with giant sheers, chopping at neurons.</p><p>So, being 13 is like being stuck between being a kid and being an adult, and making mistakes about how to act in both directions. Meanwhile, a huge construction project is taking place in your head and in the rest of your body, making it harder to resist impulses and make decisions. No wonder it's so difficult to figure out what to do, and no wonder it's so painful when you get it wrong.</p><p>And that brings me back to debating, because speaking well in public is based on the fact that you're supposed to look completely at ease and in control or, at the very least, like you're not about to cry all over the podium.</p><p>So after that first disastrous debate, I could have easily never done another, except for the debate adjudicator who was there that day. He was a university student and his job was to decide on the outcome of the debate and provide feedback for each of the speakers. When he came to me, he said that I should try to concentrate on breathing and slow down. He said that it was okay to take a pause to gather my thoughts. His feedback was kind, and it made me want to try again.</p><p>Now, that feeling of terror, of tongue dread, didn't just go away. One time I made the mistake of having a cup of coffee before a public speaking heat, and experienced the curious sensation of simultaneously needing to go to the toilet, throw up, and sprint 500 metres at the same time. Doing a lot of public speaking and doing it badly was a very, very reliable way to experience mortification. But as I did it more and more, that feeling slowly started to lose its power.</p><p>In my first debate, the guys on the opposing team seemed to know everything, to be self-assured and in complete control. But it was an illusion and one that I learned how to perform just as well. I got better at speaking convincingly on issues I was just learning about, and I became faster at analysing my opponents' points while under pressure. By year 10 I felt confident enough to draw a mind-map of ideas on a piece of paper during the debate, then go up and speak for seven minutes straight. At the end of that year, I won the best speaker award for the region, competing against students who were a year older.</p><p>Debating felt like a safe space for practising to be an adult. I got to have a room full of people paying attention to what I was saying, on a range of different issues I wouldn't have known about otherwise. I was into science, while most topics were based on politics. Having already made a habit of embarrassing myself in public, it made it a lot easier to try new things I also felt completely unqualified for. Say, for instance, speaking on the radio.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Zofia Witkowski-Blake, now at the University of Melbourne studying science and Cantonese, and representing one of the major spectacular developments in science this century, the rise and rise of smart young women.</p><p>And so to 2024 Dreaming, briefly. The late Alan Saunders, on food.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alan Saunders:</emphasis>\u00c2 In many respects, of course, going to a restaurant in the year 2024 isn't a lot different to going to a restaurant 20 years ago in 2004. There's somebody meeting and greeting at the door (the element of human contact hasn't been completely removed), and you're ushered into a large slightly gloomy space full of people sitting down. But what about this? The gloom is broken by little lamps on every table, the sort of thing you might expect on a desk in an office. And what about the people? There can't be anybody here younger than about 65, so they're all what these days we've learned to call middle-aged. It all reminds me of a conversation I had back in 2004 with Bernard Salt, then a partner with KPMG. At the time he'd just published a book called\u00c2 <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Big Shift</emphasis>, about demographic and social change in Australia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bernard Salt:</emphasis>\u00c2 I think that if we could magically transport ourselves from 2004 through to, say, 2024 into a restaurant of the future, we would be confronted by a number of changes. We're talking about baby boomers, then aged 65 to 75, who are dominating society, so the lighting would be less dark and dim as we would expect it today. The menus would have a larger print because these people can't actually see as clearly as we can. The type of food would also be vastly different to what we see now. Fat-free food, salt-free, light menu items would be highlighted, perhaps blander for the baby boomers, less garlic, less onions, less acid based because that plays havoc with the boomer digestive system in their 60s and 70s. Even the time that people commonly eat I think will pull towards the earlier part of the evening as society naturally ages.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Alan Saunders:</emphasis>\u00c2 But what about the younger generations?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bernard Salt:</emphasis>\u00c2 Well, certainly the younger generations will be there in\u00c2 their\u00c2 types of restaurants, perhaps they'll be eating at a different time, perhaps there will be restaurants that are geared specifically towards younger people. And I do think that as the boomers age and start to dominate society there will be a reaction, if you like, by young, groovy, hip 20-somethings that carve out parts of the city and ways of living and ways of entertaining, different almost like an aged based apartheid, to keep boomers in their place and to keep young people in their place.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Bernard Salt, with the late Alan Saunders.</p><p>Finally in this review of 'The Big 20', a review of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Carbon Club</emphasis>, a new book by Marian Wilkinson. Here's Nick Rowley, former adviser to Bob Carr and Tony Blair.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nick Rowley:</emphasis> This time next year we must hope that COP26, the November 2021 UN meeting on climate change, will physically take place at the vast Scottish event campus in Glasgow. I say 'hope' because the meeting should have been taking place now. The facility is currently a temporary COVID hospital, hosting hundreds of beds and respirators.</p><p>Much as the COVID pandemic has caused untold pain and suffering around the world, it has done more than suck attention away from the social, environmental and economic threat of global climate change, it has physically replaced an international conference with a hospital.</p><p>Never should one expect shards of truth, light and wisdom to come from any international climate conference, but I believe, whether it be virtual or in person, Glasgow has the potential to be every bit as important as the 2015 Paris meeting that led to the Paris Accord.</p><p>Ten years prior to Paris, 2005 was the last time that the UK hosted a major meeting on the climate problem. In that year, Tony Blair had made climate change and African development his two key priorities for the G8 meeting at the Scottish golfing resort of Gleneagles. This was the first time that climate change had been presented as a challenge requiring intervention by heads of state. For the then Prime Minister, it was only decisions and leadership by presidents or prime ministers that could affect those of treasuries, energy ministers and international investment. For Blair, leave the required international response solely to negotiators working for environment ministers, and the decisions would not have the force required.</p><p>No country is an exemplar of climate policy response, but in the UK the debate regarding how to reduce the risk of global climate change has been largely civil, deliberative and characterised by hard work and leadership from all conservative and progressive prime ministers. Margaret Thatcher's early interventions on the national and international stage, Tony Blair and Gordon Brown's initiation of the seminal Stern Review, and passing the UK Climate Change Act entrenching national carbon budgets in law. Theresa May legislating the national goal of net zero emissions by 2050. And yes, despite all of his populist flourishes and focus on the European question, Boris Johnson's consistent appeal to being on the right side of the climate debate.</p><p>This is more than show. A series of political and policy decisions over the past 30 years have provided the continuity and stability required to deliver the investment and innovation essential to reducing emissions at scale. Ten years ago, around 40% of Britain's power came from burning coal. In June this year, the country went more than two months without generating any electricity from it. This is no accident, it has been a dramatic transformation in the energy system, born of scientific rigour and advocacy, political will and policy consistency. Sadly, this is far from the case in Australia.</p><p>When I first saw Marian Wilkinson's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Carbon Club</emphasis> on the shelves of a local bookshop, I thought it best to leave it there. Having spent much of the past 20 years working to achieve a more effective response to the global climate problem, the thought of me looking over my shoulder again at the train wreck of Australia's failed national climate policy efforts filled me with dread. Did I really need to consider the dynamics leading to the ill-conceived, incompetently sold, ridiculously technically complex CPRS policy acronym failing to secure the necessary parliamentary support again? What would I achieved by reading about the ways that the men in the shadows orchestrated an undermining of basic climate science through funding and supporting a group of crude but articulate pseudoscientific naysayers attacking world leading scientists and organisations such as the CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology again?</p><p>And what of the actors described? Mostly egotistical man, collectively driven by their own political or financial interests, seeking to thwart decisions intended to address a truly wicked problem, understood and explained by some of the most respected scientific, economic and policy minds in the country. What was the point? What more could I learn? We know this teenager's bedroom is a mess, did I really need another tour of the dirty washing, the grey sheets and the piles of apparently precious junk?</p><p>But, painful as it was, having read Marian Wilkinson's book, it is only by us looking back and examining this messy, costly, torrid tale of crude politics, incompetence and policy failure that all Australians might come to understand the roots of that failure and how we might embrace a better, cleaner and, yes, richer future.</p><p>It is surely a positive characteristic of our democracy that Australia is so well served by a number of brilliant investigative journalists: Kate McClymont at the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sydney Morning Herald</emphasis> uncovering corruption in New South Wales, Sally Neighbour leading multiple investigations for ABC television's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Four Corners</emphasis> program, and Marian Wilkinson who, with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Carbon Club</emphasis>, has written a tour de force revealing the ghastly entrails of Australia's climate policy failures. All have shed light on the dark doings and decisions of those looking to pursue private or self-interest at the expense of public value.</p><p>Over the more than 400 pages of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Carbon Club</emphasis>, Wilkinson systematically and forensically looks back over the past 20 years of our national failure to face up to the severe risks of climate change and develop a meaningful national policy to address it. From the corridor skills of getting the numbers in Canberra, to the international campaigns funded by fossil fuel interests in Washington, to the failed efforts of Prime Minister Rudd at Copenhagen, Wilkinson periodically brings us back to the effects of an ever hotter, more unstable climate on the Great Barrier Reef. The bad political theatre has consequences. No sooner are there moments where progress seems assured and the balloon will fly and a mixture of political ego, incompetence, overt rent seeking and events intervene to puncture it. Each time we are left with nothing more than a steady hiss as the air goes out of the climate response balloon.</p><p>With a few exceptions, most notably those public servants entrusted with developing coherent policy out of the inconsistent cacophony of Australia's toxic climate politics, the players, be they those opposed to meaningful climate response, or those who have tried, however incompetently, to lead, few come out of this story with their reputations enhanced.</p><p>Although it may be an easy story to tell and believe, this is no simple tale of the evil of the fossil fuel industry and those doing its bidding in a club triumphing over the forces of good. Much as former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd tried, his efforts on climate policy were constrained by his intellectual vanity and political ineptitude. There is no alternative history and all political leaders have their strengths and weaknesses, but the early sloth of his administration, producing endless analysis and reports, littered with numbers and acronyms and targets that few understood and no one could relate to, led to confusion and no command of the political agenda.</p><p>The rhetoric is not hard. The defining challenge of our generation and one of the greatest moral, economic and environmental challenges of our age at the UN Bali conference coming just two weeks after securing government was then addressed by a policy process of seemingly endless document production leading to an approach introduced at the wrong time in the wrong way, using a language of weak targets, timetables and perverse subsidies that few understood and opponents could easily attack.</p><p>Rather than lead and face up to the hard decisions and trade-offs required to achieve progress, Rudd attempted to manage Australia's position. And when the going got tough post-Copenhagen, he froze. In presenting this story, Wilkinson allows the reader to observe and reach their own conclusions. As each page turns, the more one realises that <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Carbon Club</emphasis> has a wide spectrum of members. Some, previously describing themselves during the Howard years as the Greenhouse Mafia, ruthlessly protect their interests and seek to ensure that ambitious Liberal and Labor Party politicians understand the importance of protecting the fossil fuel economy. Others are part of a wider group, those in either of the major parties who abstractly accept the science on climate change but aren't bold enough to shape rather than respond to the prevailing politics.</p><p>Nowhere is this better illustrated than the current Labor opposition's 'clarity' on the straightforward what question of committing to a net zero target by 2050, while remaining supportive of Prime Minister Morrison's gas lead recovery and unable to state a position on no new coal-fired power stations in Australia. Net zero with new coal-fired power stations is like committing to a goal of competing in the Olympics on a training regime involving the sofa, burgers, beer and chocolate cake. Not only impossible, but incoherent, confused and confusing to anyone concerned about Australia's future climate and economic security.</p><p>Yet none of this is easy. With the first policy including the purpose of reducing emissions being in California in the early 1990s, climate policy remains immature. But much like a marriage, deciding to argue for, develop and implement policies that reduce the risks of climate change is a strategic choice. Not sparkling wine and red roses every day, occasional tension, some annoying habits, but ultimately a decision which provides a mutually reinforcing positive structure to one's life. It is a choice that the UK hosts for COP26 made years ago, a choice that President Xi of China made clear in his speech to the UN General Assembly in September, and one that the new Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga announced in his first policy speech to the Japanese parliament last month. Both governments of our major trading partners have committed to net zero by 2050 or 2060 and are developing the policies to achieve it.</p><p>And with a new Biden presidency in the United States seeking to demonstrate positive global leadership, Glasgow has the potential to be a significant step forward in further legitimising and supporting the national, state and local actions required to respond effectively to global climate change. Australia, continuing to maintain its short-sighted, parochial and self-defeating position, self-servingly supported by the Carbon Club for so long, now exposes our economy to significant risk.</p><p>Like the coronavirus, climate change respects no boundaries. Emissions from Ohio affects the climate in Jakarta. And policies elsewhere also serve to affect decisions here. It might just be that the lack of leadership in Canberra will not end up being as consequential as it has been. Ultimately it may be the policy decisions of Australia's major trading partners, made in Glasgow and elsewhere, that will have more effect than the work of the Carbon Club and the toxic climate politics described so ably by Marian Wilkinson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And her book, yes, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Carbon Club</emphasis>, was reviewed by Nick Rowley, former adviser to Bob Carr and in 10 Downing Street to Prime Minister Tony Blair.

Even if men are typically identified as being responsible for most intimate partner violence (Heise &amp; Garcia-Moreno, 2002; Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000), there are studies that indicate that women can be as vio- lent as men in a relationship (Straus, 1999). Men's violence against women, however, has different causes and much more serious consequences than that of women against men (Cascardi, Langhinrichsen, &amp; Vivian, 1992; Lawson, 2003; Straus, 1999; Zlotnick, Kohn, Peterson, &amp; Pearlstein, 1998). This article deals with male violence\u2014the focus of the programs repre- sented by the interviewed professionals. Many elements are involved when violence takes place in a relationship. Even if intimate partner violence can largely be explained in terms of gender orders and power structures, it is multifaceted and cannot easily be explained without also considering the complexity of the interaction between individual, contextual, and sociocultural factors (Firestone, Harris, &amp; Vega, 2003; Heise, 1998). Nor are the solutions to intimate partner vio- lence simple and, in the long term, major efforts will be required to contin- ually change social structures, norms, and strategies. Yet, in the short term, at least according to a number of opinions, individuals who perpetrate inti- mate partner violence need to be confronted in efficient programs (Gelles, 2000). The efficacy of treatment programs for male offenders has, however, frequently been called into question, inviting further research and develop- ment (Babcock, Green, &amp; Robie, 2004; Gelles, 2000). Hence, to counteract intimate partner violence more effectively we certainly need a better and more specific understanding of how the problem is multifaceted. Intervention programs for men inclined to violence start out from curricula and are usually led by professionals by means of dialogues and group con- versations with the men aimed at changing their attitudes and behaviors. These professional discourses may come into play to a greater or lesser extent and are doubtless the result of a synthesis of the professionals' own preconceived ideas influenced by the media and public opinion, expert knowledge and experience, and insights gained from meeting men inclined to violence. Additionally, the standpoints taken do not simply correspond to the professionals as individuals but, as authorities, they have knowledge and power and are deemed to be or become the possessors of the truth (Hall, 2001). In view of this, it seems reasonable that not only the syllabus but also the professionals themselves exert an important influence on men in the intervention programs for those men inclined to violence. However, this dis- cursive influence is to date a little-known area and this article aims to con- tribute knowledge about professional discourses related to the underlying 227 causes of intimate partner violence. The results will be discussed by way of \u201cattribution theory\u201d (AT; Augoustinos &amp; Walker, 1995) with a focus on gender, because ideas about the complex construction and reconstruction of gender identities need to be encompassed and challenged when discussing the causes of attitudes and behaviors in men inclined to violence (Hearn, 1998; Heise, 1998). Objective The objective of this article was to explore discourses of intimate part- ner violence and causal attribution in professionals working with violent men, with a special focus on gender issues. The Theoretical Framework \u201cConstructionism\u201d views knowledge as a varying collective construct that is shaped, shared, and expressed in the daily interactions between people, individually and collectively, in a historically and culturally vary- ing reality (Burr, 2003). \u201cDiscourse\u201d is one way to embrace such a plural- ity of social contexts that are complex, conflicting, and change with time and place. To analyze a discourse is thus to construct a joint understanding through interpretation; this involves power and necessarily results not in complete but in only partial knowledge (Hall, 2001; Taylor, 2001). Gender is constructed in and by discourses that mainly position men as superior to women, and is normative but not consistent because it is socio- culturally reproduced and transformed. However, the change is usually very slow because it involves power and requires interactions and negotiations (Connell, 1995; Edley, 2001; Kimmel, 1987). To focus on gender as a nor- mative discourse implies opening up for change, as discourses are not sta- tic constructs but are changeable in interactions with others (Burr, 2003; Dahlgren, Emmelin, &amp; Winkvist, 2004). Discourses of causal attributions are constructed from many feelings, shared ideas, and social concepts and are often created spontaneously when negative or unexpected events occur. AT seeks to understand the way people attribute causes to their own and others' behavior; how and why they do this and the conditions under which they do and do not attribute. However, AT not only reveals regularities but also reasons for limitations and biases in how people make or alter causal attributions (Augoustinos &amp; Walker, 1995). 228 Methods Qualitative methods were chosen because the intention of the study was to explore and deepen the understanding of a very complex subject area. Data collection and analyses were informed by grounded theory and dis- course analysis\u2014methods that were found to be complementary (Dahlgren et al., 2004; Starrin, Dahlgren, Larsson, &amp; Styrborn, 1997; Wheterell, Taylor, &amp; Yates, 2001a, 2001b). Participants and Settings The sample was purposely chosen to find a variety of professionals who men inclined to violence meet when attending diverse intervention programs in Sweden, excluding, however, prison divisions for sexual offenders, psychi- atric care, and forensic care. This was done intentionally to keep the study within realistic bounds and restricted to programs where the clients were con- sidered unlikely to be explicitly identified as being psychopathological. The interviews were carried out at four institutions with different pro- grams and locations: two at a crisis center for men (where on admission 25% to 30% avowed being inclined to violence but declared various life crises; all men were admitted voluntarily and mostly had no police report); three at a joint center for families within the probation service (where all the men had been violent against women and the majority had a police report); and finally three interviews at two prisons (running different crime- prevention programs for men). Hence, it follows that these clients ranged from those who had used rather mild violence to others who had used very severe violence. One program was clearly based on family systems theory, whereas the other three seemed to mix a variety of theoretical approaches that, in practice, were more or less in agreement with cognitive behavioral therapy and referred to programs such as \u201cAlternatives to Violence\u201d in Norway (R\u00e5kil, 2002; Rothman, Butchart, &amp; Cerd\u00e1, 2003). The six male and two female informants had different professions (psy- chologists, social workers, and prison officers) and three of them were also certified therapists. The professionals had wide experience from a variety of work such as within social services, family counseling, psychiatry, and the prison establishment. Information about a client's violence was given to the professionals largely by the men themselves, but was also obtained from crime reports, if accessible, and some professionals occasionally listened to the women's side of the stories to gain a more balanced understanding. How- ever, two interviewees obviously had a different and more limited experience 229 of the interview objectives, since compared to the others who had open dia- logues with the men involving confrontation and uncompromisingly taking responsibility for violent behavior, they were required to strictly follow a curriculum allowing no space for free discussions within the group. The interviews aimed to discover discourses underlying the viewpoints presented by the professionals. Every interview was thus regarded as mir- roring larger structures and not just as giving words to individual positions (Connell, 1995). Interviews The qualitative research interviews were carried out by the first author (KE) between May 2002 and June 2003. Each session started with an open chat, followed by a recorded interview lasting approximately 2 hours. A mind map was used as a guide in the interviews, covering four broad subject areas: the professionals' experience and knowledge in general and regarding violence related to pregnancy, childbirth, and parenthood; about the meanings and definitions of violence; about opinions and attitudes regarding counteracting or triggering sources of violence; and finally ideas about intervention. Although detailed open-ended questions were available as a backup, the inquiries did not have a fixed format and individual ques- tions could be dropped and new ones introduced as indicated by the situa- tion (Kvale, 1996; Starrin et al., 1997). As soon as possible after each interview the recorded disc was transcribed verbatim (by KE) with small revisions to safeguard the informant's anonymity and minor corrections to improve comprehension. Regarding the four main subject areas (see above), the interviews resulted in very rich data (cf. Edin, Dahlgren, H\u00f6gberg, &amp; Lalos, in press) as well as opening up many related wide-ranging lines of rea- soning, and the results currently presented are a selection (of all those obtained) that meet the objective of this article. Analyses The analyses were performed by the first writer (KE) in cooperation with one of the other authors (LD). Memos and preliminary analyses were completed for each interview (Starrin et al., 1997). During the intial analysis, particular words and clauses were represented as codes and categories, leading gradually to the appearance of certain patterns as well as the identification of outlines and discursive elements (Dahlgren et al., 2004). Summaries were written for each interview and finally all notes were compared to seek agreements and 230 disagreements to emerging assumptions. To exclude misunderstandings, the results were constantly compared with earlier analyses and the original data. Ethics The study was approved by the local Ethics Committee at the Faculty of Medicine, Ume\u00e5 University, Sweden. Findings The findings are presented with the intention to give a broad picture of the professional discourses, and generally not to speak for each and every professional individually. When the words deviant and normal are used in the findings this does not refer to any categorization but rather represents how it was understood within the professional discourses. The results in the text are structured in accordance with Figure 1 and consist of four themes (main headings) with a number of underlying aspects (subheadings), fol- lowed by descriptive categories. The first three themes are dimensions of the professional discourse where \u201cviolent men's responsibility\u201d is superior and placed at the top of the figure as a guiding principle in the programs that largely focused on the misdeeds and the acts of violence (cf. Edin et al., in press). The fourth theme, \u201cmasculinity discourses of violent men,\u201d illustrates three generalized characteristics in violent men, as derived from the interviews with the professionals. Quotations are displayed, after care- ful translation from Swedish into English. Violent Men's Responsibility The programs focused on male violence, and the professionals thought it was excellent that men's violence towards women had become visible in society. Some professionals, however, questioned why women's violence against men was considered to be nonexistent and that talking about it was inappropriate for political or ideological reasons. All in all, the profession- als had open and positive attitudes and were generally very self-critical with a wish to develop the programs they were representing. The professionals all agreed on the importance of making men respon- sible for their own violent behavior, regardless of the circumstances. Although the men tended to excuse themselves, especially when they first joined the programs, they were allowed neither room for excuses nor to 231 Figure 1 Professional Discourses of Intimate Male Partner Violence blame anyone other than themselves. Some of the professionals neverthe- less brought up examples of exceptionally extreme situations with, for example, insult, where refraining from violence would have been very demanding and difficult. Consider Themselves as Innocent The professionals said that men tend to diminish what has happened, seem not to fully understand the consequences of their violent behavior, 232 and are thus able to justify themselves (such as quoted and commented on below) and even portray themselves as victims. \u201cI am not the person who is the abuser, if that is what you now believe, but in fact it was like this\u201d . . . so you are in a story that still touches very little on guilt and responsibility. According to the professionals, men do not seem to lack the standard norms, such as the taboo on hitting a woman, and after an act of violence men usually express regret for their own behavior. However, violent men often blame someone else, such as the woman or the circumstances in which the violence had occurred, and many of men serving sentences often consider themselves innocent. Men for instance might claim that women cheated on them or offended them emotionally or explain that they had both been fight- ing or that they had reacted to their partner hitting them first or else she was furious, hysterical, and acted badly so he was forced to keep a firm hold on her and to grapple and beat her. Ordinary Men with Deviant Behavior In the interviews it was mentioned that severe and sexual violence and violence during pregnancy are probably more commonly committed by men with various kinds of personality disorders and drug-addiction prob- lems. Yet, the majority of men inclined to violence seem to function well in most cases and are considered to be normal at work and in society. Nevertheless, as described by the professionals, in certain situations violent men act deviant in interplay with others; they have difficulties using emo- tional expressions and typically have a poor ability to communicate in inti- mate relationships. Thus, even though the professionals claimed that violent men are quite ordinary and that practically any man could transgress the limits and use violence, such behavior was never considered normal. . . . then he might be a physician or a politician or such . . . you can find such men in every stratum of society, but that doesn't mean it is a normal phenomenon . . . Violent Men's Interplay Deviant View of Women According to the professionals, it does not seem unusual that men see women more or less as objects and then generalize women into extremes 233 such as \u201cthe whore or the Madonna.\u201d However, men inclined to violence appeared to have a deviant view of women compared to other men, as well as ideal images of females with no firm connection to reality. The starting point of violence was seen by the professionals as somehow linked to a dis- contentment within the relationship, quite often related to the man's very high expectations and overly romantic beliefs regarding his partner and their relationship. Men overly adore women as \u201cprincesses\u201d and think highly of them; they are beautiful, mysterious, and always understanding and responsible. All this is of course untenable in the long run and, as emerged in the interviews, sooner or later the ambience will disappear and the feelings of love and devotion may become negative. Deviant Language The way people communicate was viewed as particularly important by the professionals. Negative language will move things from bad to worse while the norms are modified step-by-step until a limit is passed and phys- ical violence erupts. As was particularly pointed out by one of the respon- dents, being ironical and sarcastic in everyday language is neither sound nor good and implies criticism that actually denigrates people. To be ironi- cal is to be in power because the associated preferential right of interpreta- tion ensures insecurity in the one subjected to it. According to the interviews, negative language was described as a kind of defense that stems from not being able to cope with a particular situation. . . . when it comes to their act of violence, it starts with \u201cyou goddamned hag\u201d or \u201cslut\u201d and then progresses to \u201cfucking whore\u201d and in the next place \u201cyou bloody cunt\u201d and subsequently escalates and becomes more and more vilify- ing until it quite soon descends into violence . . . Deviant Interaction It came up in the interviews that men inclined to violence seem to act deviant in their interplay with others. The professionals considered men in general to have fewer close friends than women but also that it looks as if violent men have an even smaller circle of friends and often live in their own world. One of the professionals at a prison had made observations from dia- logues with clients and concluded that violent men and criminals in general seemed to have a distorted and twisted understanding of conversations. They tended to interpret the meaning of words and sentences somewhat dif- ferently from others and therefore often misunderstood them or did not 234 understand at all, and for this reason became uncertain in conversations with others. Violent Men's Aggression Respond to Fear and Threat As pointed out by the professionals, men's aggression and violence can largely be explained as responses to the partner's position that resulted in a variety of reactions in the men emanating from feelings of fear and threat and very often associated with jealousy. Even if \u201cpower and control\u201d was used by the interviewees to explain intimate partner violence, apart from one who deemed it to be just clich\u00e9d thinking that omits the complexity, it was not what the professionals generally met in their close contacts with men inclined to violence. The respondents reported a much more multifac- eted picture of violent men as commonly displaying themselves as threat- ened and afraid of being a \u201cnobody\u201d; in short, the opposite of feeling strong. The men lack self-confidence and feel insecure, unloved, depen- dent, inferior, unsuccessful, worthless, incapable, and inadequate (cf. Edin et al., in press). In the interviews it was said that as a result men tend to frighten their partners to subordinate them and to achieve power. Threat is experienced in proportion to the amount of fear and is, accordingly, a trig- ger for aggression and violence. According to the professionals, men might hold back aggressiveness out of worry about the consequences if they lose control of their aggression. However, if men do not dare to express their feelings of fear, weakness, and insecurity, these may build up and place them at risk at a later stage of fly- ing into a fit of rage that could be very dangerous. Learned Behavior The professionals described aggressiveness as apparently the only emo- tional expression accepted without challenge as part of the traditional male role. When men's security is disturbed they feel vulnerable, frightened, and threatened and then aggression might be the most familiar and best-known behavior to resort to. As was brought up in the interviews, men sometimes behave with the primitivism of small boys or in the same way as they have seen their own parents act, that is solving conflicts in such abnormal ways as by using both verbal and physical violence. The traditional male role was recurrently mentioned in the interviews as a major underlying cause of partner violence and even, if it is questioned, the messages from society are still ambiguous. According to the interviews, 235 it is obvious that the traditional, profitable, and competitive man is still in demand and that men have to hold back their humanity and empathy as these are not compatible with competition. The respondents suggested that when the traditional male role is counter- acted it may also lead to conflicts and violence because the demands for equal- ity put strains on the relationship and throw the roles into confusion for both men and women. Men who want a change think it is hard to find good role models to copy and many have negative experiences from their own fathers. Thus, as came up in the interviews, overall, men nowadays were understood to be more insecure in their roles and more dependent on women, often feel- ing lost and uncertain about what women in fact want and expect from them as men. The risk of violence increases if a man relates to a woman in terms of being guided by her, relying on her, and not standing up for himself. . . . because you have no one to take as a model, so in the relation men become too much like weathercocks in relation to a woman regarding what she thinks and believes; that also creates an increased sense of not being responsible, that \u201cit doesn't depend on me, I am directed by others\u201d and that also increases the risk of violence . . . Losing One's Head According to the interviews, the act of violence at the moment it occurs could be experienced as a sudden feeling of losing one's head. This feeling might happen in response to threatening and stressful events; alcohol is sometimes involved. Finally, the whole situation is just too much and men might lose their temper and give free rein to their impulses. It is almost a sense of \u201cif I give rein to this it will start a forest fire.\u201d As described by the professionals, all of a sudden men get a sense of madness like a lost moment, a total breakdown where they lose control and do not know what they are doing. This goes from bad to worse, as if some- one else takes control or it is like being on a sudden downhill slope and they feel as if they can neither escape nor cope with the situation nor else stop it. According to the respondents, after such a violent outburst they may become frightened of themselves and are subsequently unable to under- stand or defend their own strange aggressive behavior. . . . then it is something where the system is not sufficient; there's a leakage in the system or a weak spot and that is what we plan to look at . . . and that might be all kind of things. 236 As said in the interviews, most men inclined to violence can, on the face of it, appear quite normal but sometimes act as if they have a weakness, as if they are unfinished or incomplete as people and that something is missing. Violent men see no other way of acting and also lack the ability or willpower to stop their violent impulses. Most men, however, despite their uncontrolled feelings of losing their heads and of the situations being unmanageable, are able to cal- culate and to exert control. For example, according to the interviews, they often direct the violence to spots with the specific intention to hurt and to parts of the victim's body that afterwards are invisible for those around. Moreover, in many of those situations that trigger outbursts of violence, if other people are present, men inclined to violence might even be able to fully control them- selves so as to avoid or postpone the violence. . . . and if they are observed they are able to avoid violence, they themselves actually have full control. Masculinity Discourses of Violent Men In interviewing the professionals, various masculinity discourses of vio- lent men appeared and three generalized characteristics (sociologically, \u201cideal types\u201d) were found (see Figure 1). The three portrayals are simplifi- cations of men's characteristics and were given metaphorical names that match their attributes. The masculinity discourses might overlap and can all be present in one person while, in fact, they may not be found in a more complex reality. Although the \u201cpressure cooker\u201d was interpreted from a variety of data, the other two stylized characters\u2014\u201che-man\u201d and \u201csuper partner\u201d\u2014originated from one professional's own practical experience but seemed to be fairly congruent with the other professionals' descriptions. It seems to me that we have two categories of violent men. No, we certainly have more, but roughly anyway. But there are two ways of responding to threat and the one is to persuade, so to speak, and the other to attack. \u201cHe-Man\u201d\u2014Attacking Man\u2014Immediate Aggression The \u201che-man\u201d was described as the traditional male being a caricature of a real man working at a man's job (such as repair work, chopping wood, and hunting). The \u201che-man\u201d was expected to be more common in the coun- tryside than in urban areas. This authoritarian man was portrayed in the interviews as the head of the family and if he is threatened he defends him- self and attacks aggressively and immediately. 237 \u201cPressure Cooker\u201d\u2014Exploding Man\u2014Sudden Aggression The professionals described one type of violent man as a \u201cpressure cooker\u201d who has learned to keep silent and to keep a distance from emo- tional expressions such as fear, weakness, and insecurity. Men suppress their own feelings and deny aggressiveness because they are afraid of its results, and these feelings may build up and later put them at risk of an out- burst. According to the professionals, if such a man lets his emotions show it gives free rein to aggressiveness that gets worse and worse; he may sud- denly go totally mad, and the exploding man is a fact. \u201cSuper Partner\u201d\u2014Persuading Man\u2014Ultimately Aggressive The \u201csuper partner\u201d was portrayed as someone who did everything to meet and please his woman; was always willing to help with cleaning, fixing things at home, and taking care of the children. From his own viewpoint, he feels unloved and this represents a threat to him, he tries to persuade her with kind- ness but does not succeed, because whatever the \u201csuper partner\u201d does she is still never satisfied and still does not love him. As it was described, the woman might either run off or the situation will finally drive him to despair; he runs out of steam and gets angry, furious, or violent. Discussion In the discourses of professionals working with men inclined to vio- lence, the unconditional responsibility of men for their own violent behav- ior was emphasized. Intimate partner violence was not viewed simply as a result of \u201cpower and control\u201d but of a very complex situation and interplay. The professional discourses included ambivalence, because they retained an explanation of violent men as both ordinary and deviant. As came up in the interviews, violent men are for the most part like most men but yet something seemed to be missing and this was revealed in certain situations, such as when they attacked with aggression in interplay as in intimate rela- tionships. But before expanding into a discussion, the trustworthiness of the study needs to be considered. Trustworthiness The interviews were dialogues that, despite the specific themes, had dif- ferent and changing positions (such as gender, age, status, knowledge, and 238 power) that certainly influenced the pre-understanding and construction of the discourse during and between the interviews (Davies &amp; Harr\u00e9, 2001). Moreover, the study only reports on the professional discourses from the current and specific interview dialogues and not when standing face to face with violent men or others. Only two out of the eight interviewed professionals were women; how- ever, they were not underrepresented in view of the fact that most of the professionals at the four institutions involved in this interview study were men. No obvious diversity was evident between the responses of men and women in the interviews. Gender could in practice still be a very important aspect when meeting the male clients and planning programs. When interviewing the eight professionals it became apparent that their experience came from quite different sets of clients and programs. Even if the sample was intended to include professionals working with men not explicitly identified as being psychopathological, it was still possible that some of their clients had personality or even psychiatric disorders. However, they were still one among others in the variety of programs com- monly offered for men inclined to violence (in Sweden). In addition, sev- eral other different underlying factors to the professionals' understanding of men's violence and hence constructing their discourses about men's inti- mate partner violence are not covered by this study. This was a small interview study, however each interview was consid- ered a keyhole through which wider discourses could be glimpsed (Connell, 1995). Moreover, it is feasible to compare the study with other relevant research (Dahlgren et al., 2004). After eight interviews it was agreed that data had reached redundancy in terms of the purpose of the study (Kvale, 1996). Accordingly, the findings are probably transferable to other comparable programs for violent men, but could rather and probably more importantly start up fruitful discussions about professional discourses and their impact on violent men. Causal Attribution and Gender The efficacy of programs for male offenders has been questioned and new concepts have been requested (Babcock et al., 2004; Dankwort, 1994; Fox, 1999; Gelles, 2000). Professional discourses, because of their author- ity and expert status, have an important value and power (Hall, 2001). Accordingly, the professionals' discourses of causal attribution are relevant to the framing of intervention programs and when standing face to face with violent men. What follows below is a discussion concerning possible 239 influences on the professional discourses of causal attribution based on AT (see the section \u201cTheoretical Framework\u201d) as well as a discussion focusing on masculinity. The intention is not to provide fixed solutions but to chal- lenge the professional discourses by raising new questions and ideas that could make a difference regarding the target of changing violent men's behaviors and attitudes. Commonly, actors (in this study, the offenders) relate their actions to the concrete situation and circumstances (external attribution) whereas the observers (here the professionals) are more abstract and find the causes in the actors' personalities (internal attribution; Augoustinos &amp; Walker, 1995). According to what was said in the interviews, violent men's external attribution was actively counteracted by the professionals in making them individually confront and accept responsibility for their violent behavior. Though there seems no reason to abandon that standpoint, there is a risk that such discourses might close the door to deeper dialogues about emo- tions and about what in fact happened as well as a further elaboration of underlying models and social forces in society. Moreover, one might want to explore the complexity in the construction of men's gender identities and examine what formed them as men inclined to violence (Hearn, 1998; Heise, 1998). Men usually disconnect violence from other practices, but to fully understand the sources of violence, men need not just to be confronted with their violent acts but with the gendered performance of daily interplay and negotiations, especially as intimate partners and parents (Hearn, 1998). If this is not done, such narrow discourses might risk reinforcing and repro- ducing stereotypical masculinity discourses and hence support the violence (Hearn, 1998). Attribution might be influenced by personal and emotional reasons and may change over time and vary with age, class, status, various political opinions, culture, etc. Attribution is often made to serve one's own purposes (self-serving bias) and has a tendency to overestimate the commonality of one's own attribution. If something seems different or stands out in attribu- tion, this will be stated as being less significant when formulating one's own opinions. Moreover, there is a tendency to attribute behavior to a sin- gle rather than to multiple causes and the more one cause is favored as the explanation for a particular behavior the less likely the others are to be used (Augoustinos &amp; Walker, 1995). The professionals in this study might have made simplifications in sorting out a few common and accepted explana- tions just through an unconscious or convenient attribution to fit their own professional theories. They may also, in the interviews, have positioned themselves in relation to the interviewer as being someone with a certain 240 stance. There are other possible explanations such as the fear of being an embarrassment to colleagues, employers, creators of public opinion, etc. and thus finding themselves in an untenable position as a professional. On the other hand, they presented a rather multifaceted and heterogeneous dis- course about violent men (cf. Figure 1) quite concordant with what has been presented in research (cf. Cavanaugh &amp; Gelles, 2005; Holtzworth- Munroe &amp; Meehan, 2004; Holtzworth-Munroe &amp; Stuart, 1994). Such knowledge might possibly form, or at least exert an influence on, the pro- fessionals' construction of reality. The attribution regarding the actor's character is likely to be as negative as the observed behavior and if the actor's behavior differs from one's own behavior there is a tendency to attribute it to the deviances (Augoustinos &amp; Walker, 1995). For violent men there might be no extenuating excuses and hence they should be regarded with much suspicion. The professionals in this study described violent men as both ordinary and deviant, for example in their views of women, interaction, and language, as well as in daily inter- play, especially in close and intimate relationships. In many ways, the pro- fessional discourses seemed to construct and/or reproduce stereotypes of such men as being loners, \u201cpressure cookers\u201d, macho, unable to express feelings, and all in all as being insufficient (cf. Dankwort, 1994). However, apart from the violent behavior, most of the characteristics of violent men could be viewed as quite familiar and ordinary behavior for many and not as belonging only to violent men. In agreement with both theories about attribution and masculinity, people (such as the professionals) prefer to latch on to deviances when it comes to destructive behavior, maybe as a means of keeping a distance and confirming their own normality by alien- ating themselves from preferably lower status groups and from problematic masculinities (such as that of violent men; Augoustinos &amp; Walker, 1995; Kimmel, 1996). From this it follows that the deviant characteristics might then have been overstated as a way of producing normality and possibly of drawing a more visible line between normal and deviant because that line might be very vague. Moreover, to have reasonable motives for running programs for men inclined to violence (and not simply for all men), one probably needs to agree on some kind of deviancy and need for correction, at least to some extent (Fox, 1999). But the one does not exclude the other and the deviant behaviors could have been understated to support and follow the prevailing and politically correct public opinion in Sweden. How- ever, the professionals might diplomatically (self-serving bias) have posi- tioned themselves between these two standpoints; namely, violent men are like any other person (normal) but also with unacceptable behavior and in need of correction (deviant). 241 Masculinity is a constructed concept and the dominant and exaggerated forms of masculinities are wholly embodied in very few real men (Connell, 1995) but are maintained and reproduced by superiority and culture as reflected in the media, movies, music, etc. (Hearn, 1998). Men may act according to the inflated forms in certain situations and interactions, but because these are not static and not completely legitimate they need to be defended and strengthened by various means, such as the use of persuasion, pressure, and even violence (Connell, 1995; Hearn, 1998). However, neither deep-rooted gender belief nor causal attribution is static. Alteration can happen for many different reasons, such as the discovery of new understanding or new-found facts (Augoustinos &amp; Walker, 1995; Edley, 2001; Kimmel, 1987). The instability is a challenge for the possibility of change regarding the professional discourse of causal attribu- tion and a deeper understanding of gender constructions in men. If the mas- culinities are to be transformed one might need to go back to the basis of the constructs and discover the contradictions and meanings in the gendered prac- tices and interplay such as occur in parenthood as well as in intimate relation- ships and sexuality (Hearn, 1998, 2000). Accordingly, one practicable method to be used in the programs for violent men could be to analyze critically the everyday and ordinary masculinities as practiced in negotiation and renegotiation by men towards women and children as well as other men (Hearn, 2000). One cannot separate the violent behavior from the discourse because they are connected (Hearn, 1998). If on the one hand men are invited to be open but on the other are told that their thoughts are incor- rect, in turning them back on what they bring up, the dialogues may become con- trolled, resulting in coercive and repressive professional discourses (Fox, 1999). If men's refusal to go along with the professionals' way of thinking is interpreted as denial, it may reinforce the dichotomy between evil and good and paint real- ity in just Black and White (ibid.). Instead, the disagreement between the men's and the professionals' discourses could be viewed as a source of discovery and be used as a powerful tool to discover the underlying causes of profound attitudes and behavior (ibid.). It is a challenge to request further research and development where professionals dare to tackle new ways when counteracting intimate partner violence (cf. Edin et al., in press). One possibility could be to apply scientific assumptions using methods where the emphasis is on discourse, as a way to replace or perhaps complement ongoing programs. Conclusion The discourses of causal attribution in the professionals interviewed could be summarized as \u201cordinary and deviant\u201d because that mirrors quite 242 well the contradictions and complexities of intimate partner violence. In parallel to general and common mainstream beliefs, they expressed their own insights and vacillated between different explanations and viewed vio- lent men as being like any other men but with a deviant manly behavior. Masculinity is constructed in relation to femininity and in negotiated inter- actions and interplay and the depicted forms and concepts of masculinity need to be challenged. Much could be started on an individual level (as in the programs for violent men) by the professionals' confronting and oppos- ing men's discourses and usual everyday gender practices in, for instance, showing them power structures with examples from their own real and everyday life (Dankwort, 1994; Hearn, 2000). As the professionals are authorities, they could be a great asset as possible innovators working against current streams and hence contributing to various social and cul- tural processes that set new agendas.
