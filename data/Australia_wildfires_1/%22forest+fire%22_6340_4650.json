It is now certain that the future of the biosphere will be very different to what we have been acculturated to believe is 'normal' or 'natural'. We are yet to discover what it will be like, psycho-socially, to exist in an overpopulated and ecologically stressed world, where everyone knows the environment quality was substantially better for the previous generation.</p><p>Is it consistent with a civilisation on the brink of global environmental transformation that there should be a tiny investment in monitoring planetary health relative to, say, making blockbuster movies? The lack of data is a real problem for any accurate predictions of the future, particularly because we are unable to understand how the various components of the Earth system will interact.</p><p>It is true that satellite imagery now provides excellent global, and in some cases daily, coverage of changes to the atmosphere, and land and sea surface. But there are critical aspects of the Earth system that remain poorly monitored, including assessments of trends (such as functioning of marine and terrestrial ecosystems) and the effects of pollution and invasive organisms.</p><p>The GEO-5 report acknowledged that the lack of good data makes it difficult to get an accurate picture of the state of the global environment. Problematically, the functioning of the earth system hinges on the interaction of numerous ecological components. Scientists have only a rudimentary understanding of these interrelationships. In some cases trends may amplify each other; coral reefs, for example, are dying due to synergistic effects of global warming, overfishing and pollution.</p><p>The GEO-5 report provides some good news. Successes have included international treaties and agreements, phasing out ozone depleting chemicals and near-complete removal of lead in fuel. This shows humans will respond to immediate and clearly defined threats. There has been a steady expansion of declared national parks (even if funding for their management is insufficient) and increased efforts to slow the rate of deforestation.</p><p>Still, we are struggling to come to grips with more diffuse and intractable problems, such as climate change, water management, loss of biodiversity, human population growth and inequitable resource consumption. In these cases there is no simple remedy. Achieving global action has proven to be far more difficult. It needs poly-government policy development and enforcement, technological innovation and adoption. And while we're working on these, the sheer complexity means we risk perverse outcomes, such as destroying Indonesia's forests for '<url normalizedValue=\"http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37035\">sustainable' biofuels</url>.</p><p>The report says an \"ambitious set of sustainability targets by the middle of the century is possible if current policies and strategies are changed and strengthened.\" The question of who guards the global environmental guardians required to enforce these policies remains unresolved. But more fundamentally, achieving global environmental stewardship demands an iron political will at a global scale. And this, in turn, demands global constituency building. Until the global population cares enough, the political will to make changes won't be there.</p><p>Effectively communicating to the global community the bad news about the trajectory of the Earth system presents a substantial problem. Doctors know that shouting at a patient with an unhealthy lifestyle does not change their behaviour.</p><p>Often the driver for urgently lifestyle change comes from a major health scare. Despite describing a trajectory of unprecedented global environmental changes, the GEO-5 report does not carry enough emotional freight to galvanise global action. And it is obvious that the recent litany of environmental disasters - <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climatespectator.com.au/https://theconversation.edu.au/first-montara-then-deepwater-horizon-is-australia-protected-from-catastrophic-oil-spills-996\">Deepwater Horizon</url> oil spill, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climatespectator.com.au/https://theconversation.edu.au/pages/fukushima\">Fukushima</url> nuclear disaster, Black Saturday bushfires, Central America floods, French<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climatespectator.com.au/https://theconversation.edu.au/record-heatwaves-not-just-a-lot-of-hot-air-1335\">heat waves</url>, Moscow forest fire smoke disaster and so on - have not prompted significant changes in human behaviour towards the Earth system. Part of the problem is that these disasters can be considered in isolation, framed against 'natural' background risk, and thereby rationalised, blunting the clear signal that human civilisation is exposed to tremendous risk from both natural and anthropogenic extreme events.</p><p>The current state of the global environment is like a phony war. Nothing particularly bad has happened yet, despite protestation from environmental activists that something grave will happen soon. Nonetheless, the steady stream of data and reports, such as GEO-5, are all signalling that the future global environment will be seriously challenging - real war (literally and metaphorically) will eventually break out.</p><p>In the meantime, environmental scientists are caught in a bind - the public is numb to shock-and-awe predictions of global catastrophe. And in any case, scientific prognoses are constrained by the overwhelming complexity of the Earth system, which is poorly understood or monitored. There remains little serious science investment compared to the funding for the discovery of fundamental physical phenomena at the quantum or astronomical scales.</p><p>Beyond the certainty of dramatic global environmental changes, the only certainty is uncertainty. I suspect that most people have accepted that the environment will be dramatically transformed in their, and certainly their kids, lifetimes. But they are either in serious denial or hoping for the best. It seems collectively humans only demand drastic political change when confronted by overwhelmingly compelling and immediate threats. And as the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climatespectator.com.au/https://theconversation.edu.au/pages/arab-spring\">Arab Spring</url> has taught us, revolutionary moments are not always ordered or peaceful. It is a brave new world indeed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was <url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.edu.au/un-produces-another-boring-global-environmental-warning-world-continues-not-caring-7562\">originally published</url>by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.climatespectator.com.au/https://theconversation.edu.au/\">The Conversation</url>.

This report includes a new economic forecast for 2001<br/>and 2002. The combined effects of the recession in the United States<br/>and the preliminary countervailing duty on lumber exports to the US<br/>have had a significant effect on the British Columbia economy. As a<br/>result, we have lowered the British Columbia economic growth forecast<br/>to 0.9 per cent for 2001 and 0.6 per cent for 2002.This report includes financial results for the April-to-September<br/>period of the 2001/02 fiscal year. These show a deterioration in<br/>government revenues and in the financial position of certain major<br/>Crown corporations. This has been partly offset by expenditure<br/>control in most ministries. In total, the six-month surplus was $789<br/>million, or $76 million below budget. Without a one-time pension<br/>gain, the summary accounts would show a $617 million deficit.The Quarterly Report concludes with a revised financial forecast. The<br/>full-year deficit is now expected to be $2,036 million, or $55<br/>million higher than forecast in September. After removing a one-time<br/>$1,406 million pension gain, the forecast deficit stands at $3,442<br/>million. Changes in the forecast since September reflect a<br/>deterioration in natural resource revenues as energy prices have<br/>fallen faster than expected, and some setbacks in BC Rail and BC<br/>Hydro, partially offset by the effects of higher income tax returns<br/>for the 2000 taxation year.  year.</p><p>I have been monitoring spending pressures<br/>in various ministries, and I am pleased to report that the spending<br/>situation has improved. We continue to face challenges in this area,<br/>in particular with health care pressures, and I acknowledge the<br/>significant effort of ministries in keeping spending under control.This is my second Quarterly Report as Minister of Finance. I have made<br/>some changes to the layout of the report in order to increase the<br/>focus on the most material changes and risks.

The US economy fell into negative growth territory<br/>in the July-to-September quarter as a rapidly slowing economy was<br/>further impacted by the September 11 terrorist attacks.* In British Columbia, most economic indications were weak in the<br/>July-to-September quarter, reflecting the North American economic<br/>slowdown and the effect of the preliminary countervailing duty on<br/>lumber exports to the US.* Since the summer, private sector forecasters have progressively<br/>lowered their growth projections for the US, Canada and British<br/>Columbia.* Growth forecasts for British Columbia averaged 2.3 per cent for 2001<br/>and 3.2 per cent for 2002 in the summer.  Private sector forecasts<br/>have subsequently eroded and now average 1.3 per cent for 2001 and 1.5<br/>per cent for 2002.* The British Columbia government has also lowered its forecast of<br/>British Columbia economic growth.  Growth is now forecast to be 0.9<br/>per cent for 2001 and 0.6 per cent for 2002.* The revised forecast incorporates the unexpectedly rapid downturn in<br/>global economic activity, reduced consumer confidence in the US and<br/>Canada, and the preliminary US lumber countervailing and anti-dumping<br/>duty rulings on softwood lumber.* Due to the high degree of uncertainty encompassing the global<br/>economic outlook, the economic forecast is provided for two years<br/>only.* The government will be developing a five-year economic forecast for<br/>inclusion in the February 19 budget.  It is expected that the length<br/>and extent of the global and in particular the North American economic<br/>slowdown will become clearer, allowing for greater certainty as to the<br/>medium term outlook.MORE TO FOLLOW</p><p>HOMEX - Sydney<br/>-------------------------<br/>Quarterly Report - Second Quarter April to September 2001HIGHLIGHTS - FISCAL YEAR-TO-DATE REPORTSECOND QUARTERLY REPORT 2001/02* The summary accounts showed a $789 million surplus for the first<br/>six months of 2001/02, $76 million below budget. After removing a one<br/>time pension gain of $1,406 million for joint trusteeship, the<br/>summary accounts would show a $617-million deficit.* The consolidated revenue fund shortfall was $89 million higher than<br/>planned. Revenues were $117 million below forecast primarily due to<br/>rapidly falling energy prices, while spending was $28 million below<br/>budget.(graph - Six-month Results (April-September)* Crown corporations and agency results were $113 million below plan,<br/>mainly due to unfavourable developments for BC Hydro and ICBC.* The estimated one-time pension accounting gain resulting from joint<br/>trusteeship increased by $126 million due to updated actuarial<br/>valuation information.* In total, provincial debt increased $1.645 million during the first<br/>six months of the year:- Taxpayer-supported debt increased $246 million.<br/>- Commercial Crown corporation debt increased $65 million.<br/>- Warehouse debt increased $1,334 million in anticipation of the<br/>province's cash requirements for the remainder of the year.MORE TO

they weren't very enthusiastic initially,\" Mr Downer said.</p><p>\"But as time went on clearly the situation remained bad, even got somewhat worse, and so they came back to us and said yes they would like some help.\"</p><p>Mr Downer said Indonesia had asked Australia to help about a week after assistance was first offered.</p><p>Earlier this week, Mr Downer hit back at US accusations of unfair trade practices by Australia and signalled Australia's intention to fight Washington on the issue.</p><p>The US accused Australia, South Korea, Japan, the EU and Canada of unfair trade practices, warning it could lead to economic sanctions.</p><p>Mr Downer denied that Australia was in breach of its World Trade Organisation obligations.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML9710042018533363</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIER-MAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4585-70H0-0197-F2PG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"510\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Courier Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 4, 1997, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>GROUP SYSTEMS COM\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNITED NATIONS \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0UNITED NATIONS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0EUROPEAN UNION \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>\u00a0EUROPEAN UNION\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>\u00a0UNITED NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>Antitrust &amp;

They're business cards for mums, to hand out to other parents, teachers and the like.</p><p>\"Jane Volvodriver, mother of Charlie and Hunter\", for instance. And why not? You could see mum cards as long-overdue recognition that motherhood is a serious business, requiring a degree of commitment well beyond a previous incarnation as deputy internal head of corporate affairs in the filing department.</p><p>So why do they generate that vaguely ick feeling usually brought on by too much fairy bread?</p><p>Considered on their own they might be handy. Should an emergency arise - young Banjo catches a glimpse of commercial television, for instance, or comes into contact with non-organic cotton - your emergency contact numbers are printed there on a colourful piece of laminated card.</p><p>But mum cards are like icebergs. There is a hell of a lot going on beneath the surface. Sure, they can be customised with smiley faces and replicas of your ankle-biter's artwork, but there's more than a whiff of anxiety about them.</p><p>As Judith Warner's book Perfect Madness: Motherhood in the Age of Anxiety neatly sums it up, modern motherhood is a \"widespread, choking cocktail of guilt and anxiety and resentment and regret\"; playing Beethoven to foetuses; hyper-managing the kids' schedules into a revolving door of dance (ballet, jazz and tap), soccer, Mandarin, mini-Rembrandt art classes and feng shui for nurseries.</p><p>This intense helicopter parenting is a long way from the days when kids were allowed out of the house without an analysis of the educational benefits of a play date with Jacques and a police background check of his parents.</p><p>And if we fail? \"Our children will fall prey to countless dangers - from insecure attachment to drugs to kidnapping to a third-rate college ...\" writes Warner. It's enough to have you reaching for the gin bottle at 3pm, although if anyone from the Department of Human Services is reading this, I swear it only happened once and it was at the end of a particularly trying week.</p><p>Dad cards? Don't make me laugh. Just as no bloke at the office is ever asked who is minding his kids, even the moistest, rom-com-loving snag is likely to draw the line at having a dad card in his man-bag.</p><p>No, mum cards are part of the toolbox of the supermum. They say the unsayable, albeit with a smiley face. Slap one of those babies down and you're saying: \"I'm organised and in control; my children learn Suzuki-method violin and know how to wash their hands before meal times, and if you let one morsel of genetically modified food pass Sophie's lips you'll be hearing from my lawyers.\"</p><p>Mums aren't simply allowed to be. The endless judgement-laden categorising starts with dividing them into stay-at-home mums (read: daytime TV-watching dolts), or working mums (self-centred career bitches). It quickly moves on to breastfeeding versus formula; disposable nappies versus cotton; Fisher-Price versus artisan wooden toys crafted by nomadic herdsmen from Lapland. And mum cards play their part in that, turning mothers' groups into power meetings; play dates into mergers and acquisitions.</p><p>Mums of Australia, it is important to resist this trend towards the corporatisation of day-to-day life, even if it means sticking to arrangements half-remembered through a haze of sleep deprivation and hazarding a guess whether a visiting child was allergic to peanuts or corn chips. Mum cards might be cute and all, but they aren't to be taken lightly. Their vague utilitarian benefits aside, it's only a short stumble to one of those Mum's Taxi signs. And as a mother, I think that's a path best avoided.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-5mi9qo10lqs1kj5t68o4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4TW0-9880-TXN5-V0HX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"726\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>November 8, 2008 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009JXS</classCode><className>ARTS &amp; HUMANITIES EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001291</classCode><className>PARENTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DNCG</classCode><className>FENG SHUI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N923130JC</classCode><className>SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000DA9G</classCode><className>BACKGROUND CHECKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

rages</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">BELGRADE - Serbian and Croatian leaders last night prepared to attend peace talks despite increased tension caused by fierce fighting and a Serbian move to grab federal power.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Serbia moved to consolidate its control over what remains of Yugoslavia on Thursday, announcing that it was taking over the near-defunct federal parliament.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A senior Western diplomat said the move effectively dissolved the eight-member federal presidency, which nominally controls the Serb-dominated Yugoslav army.</p><p>The Serbian decision was condemned by Macedonia which, like Croatia and Slovania, has declared its independence and Bosnia-Hercegovina, where Croats and Moslems live in growing tensions with Serbs.</p><p> The army, which launched a major assault against Croatia this week, bombarded areas around historic Dubrovnik, starting a raging forest fire, and closed in on the Croatian capital of Zagreb.</p><p>Croatian leaders say the attacks on the Adriatic, on the eastern Croatian region of Slavonia and in Banija, south of Zagreb, represent a bid by Serbia to define a \"Greater Serbia\" that would cover most of Yugoslavia.</p><p> The republic of Slovenia and what remained of Croatia would then be permitted to become independent.</p><p> In Belgrade, representatives of the federal presidency from Montenegro, Serbia and Serbia's two provinces decided to take over the federal parliament at a meeting that included the defence minister and army commanders.The presidency normally requires five votes for any decision, but its chairman, Stipe Mesic of Croatia, was not among those at the meeting.</p><p>Croatian President Franjo Tudjman and Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic were reported to be heading to The Hague, where peace talks sponsored by the European Community continued.</p><p> Serbs and Croats share a language and other cultural traits but have been rivals for centuries and enemies during World War II, when fascist Croats killed hundreds of thousands of Serbs and Serbs retaliated on a smaller scale.</p><p> Present Serb-Croat tensions hinge primarily on opposition by Croatia's Serb minority - 12.2 per cent of the republic's 4.75 million people - to living in an independent Croatia.</p><p> Zagreb television reported Croatian forces had been pushed back to within 12km of the republic's capital, after losing several villages to federal fighters.</p><p> Serb rebels and federal troops were advancing north along a wide front in the Banija region, encountering little resistance from retreating Croat troops, according to Belgrade Radio.</p><p> Meanwhile, Yugoslav navy warships closed off Dubrovnik, an international tourist attraction that has been without water, power or telephones for three days.</p><p> Other Croatian ports have been blockaded and the federal navy has warned maritime traffic to stay out of the area.</p><p>AP</p><p> END OF STORY</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source

Some argue that  there is: a \"debt jubilee\". Drawn from the Old Testament book of Deuteronomy (<url normalizedValue=\"http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/15-1.htm\">http://bible.cc/deuteronomy/15-1.htm</url>),  the concept derives from the biblical injunction for a  day of rest   one day out of every week, a \"sabbath\" day that reflects the teaching  the God rested on the seventh day after creating the world in six.There is another injunction for a sabbath year every seventh year, in  which people are to not work and on the year after the seventh of those  sabbatical years , i.e. the 50th, (one year after the 49th) there would  be a  jubilee year (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ewtn.com/Jubilee/history/OT2.htm\">http://www.ewtn.com/Jubilee/history/OT2.htm</url>) during which any slaves would be emancipated and everyone would return  to their land and family to live off of natural providence.  A clear  implication of this teaching is that all obligations, including debt  obligations, would be forgiven in the process.The jubilee year is a moral and religious issue concept, not an economic one, and was not practised in actual fact (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ewtn.com/Jubilee/history/OT3.htm\">http://www.ewtn.com/Jubilee/history/OT3.htm</url>). However, it has been an inspiration to the modern debt jubilee movement (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://moderndebtjubilee.blogspot.com/p/about.html\">http://moderndebtjubilee.blogspot.com/p/about.html</url>),  which drops the religious context but makes political and economic (and  to a degree moral) arguments for extinguishing all or at least some of  the debts the world is currently drowning in.The main economic justification for a modern debt jubilee is simple. </p><p>  With debts forgiven, governments, households and individuals could  spend the money currently devoted to interest and principal repayments  on consumption which would, in turn, increase economic demand and  encourage economic growth, and eventually take the world economy out of  constant crisis.This would also be an ethical policy, which lifts debts incurred  through financial manipulation (such as unscrupulous mortgage bankers)  and undue political influence (such as taxpayer bailouts of banks that  caused the crisis in the first place). It would be fairer than the  current arrangement, in which current debt largely burdens poor people  with repayments falling to rich and culpable individuals and  institutions.Two basic questions arise: is a debt jubilee really a new idea, and would it work?There is some precedent for debt relief as a solution to economic  crisis.  Perhaps the most famous example was the campaign launched by U2 rock star Bono to provide debt relief to developing countries (<url normalizedValue=\"http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1799103.stm\">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/1799103.stm</url>).  Bono was a major public face of a coalition called Jubilee 2000, which  managed to get the G8 group of major economies to commit to write off  $100 billion in developing country debts to developed nations.  The idea  has similar foundations to the current debt jubilee movement, except it  is much more narrow in focus.Private markets also deal regularly with situations where a debtor  can no longer repay debt, technically referred to as a default.  In  those cases, a debt workout (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5929\">http://stats.oecd.org/glossary/detail.asp?ID=5929</url>) may be instituted which may include a stretching out of payments,  forgiveness of parts or all of the debt by lenders, or even an outside  infusion of capital to the indebted party to help them keep current with  payments (the major way in which the European Union (EU) is dealing  with public debt crises in Greece, Ireland, Portugal and Spain).So private lenders often forgive debt but, unlike a jubilee, this is  not out of goodwill. The intent is to get as much of the loan repaid as  possible, even if this might be injurious to the borrower or the larger  economy.So there is a precedent for debt forgiveness. But would the  widespread and broad application of such forgiveness as called for by  the modern debt jubilee movement actually work?The experience of developing country debt forgiveness (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/jan-june05/debt_6-13.html\">http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/jan-june05/debt_6-13.html</url>) suggests that forgiveness there did have the desired effect of freeing  up resources in low-income countries which could then go to more  pressing development needs.  However, some resources thus freed up got  wasted anyway and an argument was also made that forgiving loans  frittered away by government merely encourages such recklessness in the  future.  This certainly could be a risk for a modern debt jubilee.Also, a blanket debt jubilee within the developed world would be much  bigger, touching the greater part of the world economic, financial and  monetary system.  Applied globally, a big issue is that one person's  debt is another person's asset. While a debt jubilee would cancel the  burden to the borrower, it also would eliminate the value of the debt as  source of wealth to the lender.Imagine if all Greek government debt was cancelled.  The Greek  economy would be better off, but all the banks who made the loans could  well be wiped out.This is the main reason why the EU is going to such great lengths to  bail out Greece, rather than eliminate or allow a debt default there.   There are ways to avoid this problem, especially if central banks  printed special money (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.zerohedge.com/news/modern-debt-jubilee\">http://www.zerohedge.com/news/modern-debt-jubilee</url>) to give to debtors specifically to pay back debt, a form of cancelling  the debt without actually eliminating it as an asset to the lender.  However, inflationary pressures and other monetary distortions would  certainly come along with that solution.It is also argued that defaults and bankruptcies, while painful, do  clear out unproductive actors in the economy, clearing the way for more  dynamic businesses to take their place, much in the way that a forest  fire destroys older trees to make way for new ones.  Japan's 'zombie economy' (      \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.economist.com/node/16847828?story_id=16847828\">http://www.economist.com/node/16847828?story_id=16847828</url>) is often pointed to as an example of how a debt jubilee could make the economy worse in the long run.While Japan never instituted an actual debt jubilee, it has had  almost zero interest rates for a long time, making debt repayment  obligations minimal and allowing inefficient \"zombie\" companies to drag  along, locking out more entrepreneurial potential (a concern, by the  way, being expressed about current central bank policies of very low  interest rates around the world).  It is indeed plausible that a  widespread debt jubilee might lead to the same sort of outcome on a  global scale.So is a debt jubilee the answer to our woes - a providential gift, so  to speak?  From an economic perspective, the answer is likely to be no -  at least for a full version of it.  However, there might be an argument  for targeted debt forgiveness or at least lenient and well-ordered  bankruptcies containing forgiveness in especially acute cases.And in many ways, a debt jubilee is said to be more ethical or moral  than current arrangements.  Which may very well be true, just not  necessarily always economically sound.Cameron Gordon is an Associate Professor of Economics at the University of Canberra and has an ongoing appointment as a Principal Investigator at the University Transportation Research Center (Region 2) in New York.

Rural Fire Services inspector Mr Bob Burke said the whole of Queensland was on a \"\"very high\" fire risk level with worsening conditions expected at the weekend. \"\"The forecast for Saturday is for 35 degrees throughout the state with strong north-west winds,\" he said. \"\"That spells even more trouble if the public do not play their part in not lighting fires.\" Queensland Forest Service teams were called in yesterday with their graders and bulldozers to help contain a huge fire burning out of control in 3000ha of state forest about 10km north of Gatton. Senior fire-fighters described the forest fire as \"\"spectacular\". Hundreds of fire-fighters were keeping a close watch on several major \"\"out of control\" fires in the Great Dividing Range, east of Warwick and Allora on the Darling Downs. The fires, most of which started last Saturday, have been classified as serious. At Builyan, north-west of Bundaberg, a number of fires are threatening grazing land and state forests. In the Eidsvold Shire, which has had a total fire ban since Tuesday, two major fires broke out but were contained last night after an extra 130 fire-fighters and eight brigades were called in from surrounding districts. The army fire-fighting unit at Enoggera was being kept informed on an hour-to-hour basis of the situation of the Gatton and Warwick region fires.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>In New South Wales at least 200,000 sheep and 140,000ha of grassland have been destroyed by fire during the past 24 hours. Two men also are recovering in Griffith Base Hospital after being burnt while fighting the season's first major fire, near Hay. Bushfire Council spokeswoman Ms Anne Gittins said Rod Scott, 16, had received second-degree burns to 20 percent of his body, and Paul Snyman, 31, had second-degree burns to 15 percent of his body. Both are now in a stable condition. She said the fire, which began 35km south-west of Hay about 10.30am yesterday, was under control. Ms Gittins said it was being contained within a perimeter of several hundred kilometres. More than 300 local townsfolk, farmers and fire-fighters from Sydney and surrounding districts worked through the night to bring the fire under control. Fire-fighters were helped last night when winds turned the fire back on itself, preventing it burning further east to Darlington Point, near Griffith, and Coleambally, near Wagga.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML9011232003P58441</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIER-MAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49MJ-T8G0-01S8-G3KP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"433\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>COURIER-MAIL</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1990 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"1990\"><dateText>November 23, 1990 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>XIAMEN ANNE CORP LTD \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0XIAMEN ANNE CORP LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>002235 (SZSE)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS322121 PAPER (EXCEPT NEWSPRINT) MILLS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>\u00a0SIC2621 PAPER MILLS \u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Pensions &amp;

And in echoes of the ancient past, the homes at greatest risk of burning in fires are those on the rim of the old craters.</p><p>These buildings face on to steep slopes covered with trees. When a hot wind drives a bushfire up the slopes, it gathers strength and speed, consuming almost anything in its path.</p><p>A Shire of Yarra Ranges spokesman, Mr Brian Littlechild, said this was basically what happened on Tuesday.</p><p>\"If you went three of four streets back from the edge of the ridges, you wouldn't know there had been a fire,\" he said.</p><p>In hot, dry conditions, the Dandenongs are a tinderbox. It is mainly highly flammable ash eucalypt forest and south-east Australia is one of the four most fire-prone regions in the world.</p><p>A blaze pushed by the weather dries everything in its path, creating its own fuel. Even cool fern gullies will dry out ahead of a forest fire and burn like straw.</p><p>Fires this year might be worsened by good wet seasons in the past two years, which have built up the leaves, bark, branches and other vegetation litter on the forest floor, Mr Littlechild said.</p><p>It was also evident that some home owners did things that fuelled the fire, such as keeping tall trees beside houses.</p><p>\"There is no law that says you cannot have trees a metre from your roof line, which is all very lovely, but it does make it hard in a fire,\" Mr Littlechild said.</p><p>The Department of Natural Resources and Environment, which looks after the forested public land, can back-burn and reduce the litter at the edges and along tracks.</p><p>\"But they can't burn off the whole forest, it's against the nature of this sort of forest,\" he said. \"People come here for the forest.\"</p><p>The chief fire officer for the department, Mr Gary Morgan, said his department had not cut back on fuel reduction burns or on slashing.</p><p>The biggest restriction from year to year was weather, not budgets, and the number of days suitable for fuel reduction burns.</p><p>Mr Littlechild said new residents quickly learnt about fire danger and what to do to minimise risks. Local laws insisted that they clear vegetation litter from their properties, and owners could be served council notices if they failed to comply.</p><p>After a big fire, the pattern was that residents who had lost property often moved. A new wave of people without experience of fires moved in and the cycle started again.</p><p>One resident who asked not be named said there was one way to live in the Dandenongs. \"Build a cheap house, insure it, take all the precautions but expect to be burnt out every 10 years.\"</p><p>HOTLINES:</p><p>For inquiries about road closures and access to fire areas: 03 1192</p><p>For inquiries about the safety of relatives: 03 9686-8333</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NRS0-TXN5-S1N1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yhus61x35k16g5gn5us</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1997</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"449\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>January 23, 1997 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Vic</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents And Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accidents And Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Prevention</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DN66</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DNBA</classCode><className>LITTERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The answers lie with choreographers Gideon Obarzanek and Lucy Guerin. Individually, they have produced an impressive body of work; but this time, as special guests of the Melbourne Fashion Festival, they have created works for each other. Both perform in solo pieces in a program that includes group performances by the hard-working team Chunky Move. All is revealed as audiences go indoor and hardcore at the CUB Malthouse, South Melbourne. Tonight at 8pm (also 22-27 February before touring regional centres). Tickets: $35/$18; bookings: 13 6166 or 9685 5111.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Performance</p><p>The familiar image of the \"mad\" woman in the attic extends beyond the pages of Victorian novels; in fact, there are all-too-real instances of women being incarcerated at Sunbury for reasons of \"criminal insanity\" (reasons now known as postnatal depression and menopause). Performer, director and teacher Karen Martin explores the history of the Sunbury Lunatic Asylum in a performance event which delves into the lives of the women forced to live there. The Women's Jail Project is on tonight at 8.15pm (plus 25-27 February) in the Women's Refractory (adjacent to Victoria University's Sunbury Campus,</p><p>The Avenue, Sunbury). Tickets $25/$20; bookings: 9744 2291. A free shuttle</p><p>bus runs between North Melbourne station and Sunbury, leaving at 7.30 pm.</p><p>Theatre</p><p>Go Wilde. The final in a trilogy of plays by David Hare focusing on English society and the nature of love explores the witty and wearying world of Oscar Wilde. The Judas Kiss (directed by Neil Armfield and featuring Bille Brown as Wilde) concentrates on two particularly traumatic moments in Wilde's life; the day he decides to stand trial for \"acts of gross indecency\" and the night his lover Bosie (Lord Alfred Douglas) betrays him. Opens tonight at 8.30pm (plus Monday 6.30pm, Tuesday-Friday 8pm, matinees Wednesday and Saturday at 4pm) until 20 March at the Victorian Arts Centre's Playhouse theatre. Tickets: $28.95-$46.95; bookings: 13 6166.</p><p>Fashion</p><p>Fashion gets a serious dressing down as kids take over the catwalk. Clarks Kids on Parade is a day of free family entertainment and parades by leading Australian children's designers - Chino Kids, Run Scotty Run, Oshkosh and more - revealing the autumn/winter look for cool kids. Part of the Woolmark 1999 Melbourne Fashion Festival, activities take place on the Eastern Lawn, Royal Botanic Gardens (enter Gate B or C) from 2.30pm. The festival continues today and tomorrow; telephone: 9826 9688; bookings: 13 6100 (or visit www.melbournefashionfestival.com.au).</p><p>Book</p><p>Bittersweet: Contemporary Black Women's Poetry, edited by Karen McCarthy (Allen &amp; Unwin, $24.95) is bursting with voices describing the experiences of black women poets from Britain, Asia, the Caribbean, Africa and Canada. From childbirth to adolescence, death and beyond, the earth becomes a spectacular backdrop to both small and large dramas. The poems are divided into chapters, including: Earth, Blood, Salt, Forest, Fire and Water. No matter what the topic, all the poems possess a certain charge and as a collection, it gives the reader a chance to discover new voices alongside more familiar names, such as Alice Walker, Grace Nichols and Maya Angelou. -- Frances Atkinson</p><p>* Compiled by Emma Walker (fax 9601 2587)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Five photos.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NS70-TXN5-S17T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yi2hzkoik4paow12o4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1999</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1999 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"1999\"><dateText>February 20, 1999 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CYZY</classCode><className>CHOREOGRAPHY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UGQ</classCode><className>THEATER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009UHU</classCode><className>VISUAL &amp; PERFORMING ARTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DRMC</classCode><className>FEMALE PRISONERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A4J3</classCode><className>JAIL SENTENCING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001111</classCode><className>MENOPAUSE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DIER</classCode><className>FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>STX002052</classCode><className>DEPRESSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>ST000DOB2</classCode><className>MATERNAL MENTAL HEALTH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000707</classCode><className>FESTIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009S4X</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N712130GM</classCode><className>BOTANICAL GARDENS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

YOU don't have to be Lord Stern to see how the costs of climate change are already compounding and spiralling out of control. Some costs are relatively benign - like the devaluation of certain high-priced waterfrontages as sea levels rise - a process starting in earnest whether estate agents like it or not. Other costs are terrible, like the conservative $4.4 billion put on last year's Black Saturday fires by the Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission, including insurance claims of $1.2 billion (property and vehicles), $1.1 billion spent by the Victorian Bushfires Reconstruction and Recover Authority, $658 million in destroyed timber, 173 lost lives worth $645 million according to established formulas (not counting injuries) and about $593 million spent on firefighting (not counting volunteers). Climate change features minimally in the commission's final report, handed down a fortnight ago. </p><p>That is interesting in itself, because when he announced the inquiry Premier John Brumby said everything would be on the table, including climate change. The commission's interim report last August was silent on climate change - many letter writers to The Age raised this glaring omission - but flagged the issue would be dealt with in the final report. In September 2009 the commission took expert evidence from CSIRO principal research scientist Kevin Hennessy. He was asked seven key questions, including whether climate change was a contributing factor to the extreme fire weather conditions on Black Saturday, and how often such catastrophic conditions might occur over the next 10-40 years. Except perhaps in the darkest sceptic circles, it is uncontentious that climate change contributed to the dangerous fire weather that day - although Hennessy pointed out that a forensic \"detection and attribution\" study, as was carried out after the 2003 European heatwave, would need to be done to determine the exact degree of contribution. The commission's final report notes it \"took limited evidence on the subject of climate change because it was persuaded by Mr Hennessy's conclusions [which] are consistent with the opinions of the Bureau of Meteorology and CSIRO, Australia's leading climate science agencies\". Dangerous fire weather is generally measured by the Forest Fire Danger Index, which takes in temperature, rainfall, humidity and wind speed. The 1939 Victorian bushfires that burnt 1 million acres were given an index score of 100, now called \"catastrophic\" conditions. In some locations on Black Saturday, the index reached 170 and higher. According to a 2007 study by the CSIRO, the Bureau of Meteorology and the Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre, by Chris Lucas and others including Hennessy, catastrophic days occurred at only 12 of 26 locations across south-east Australia (the triangle below a line from Brisbane to Adelaide) for which good records are available, back to 1973. At four places, the frequency was one occurrence in eight years or less. The study, which formed the basis of Hennessy's evidence to the royal commission, then looked at various global warming scenarios to 2020 and 2050, using low and high greenhouse gas emissions projections. On top of warming of 0.7 degrees to 1990, compared with pre-industrial levels, the \"low\" emissions projection assumed 0.4 degrees of warming by 2020 and 0.7 degrees by 2050, keeping total warming to 1.4 degrees. The \"high\" warming projection assumed 1 degree of additional warming by 2020 and 2.9 degrees by 2050, taking total warming to 3.6 degrees. \"Given that global warming over the last 15 years has been tracking the mid-to-high IPCC range, the projections for fire weather are more likely to be closer to the high global warming range than the low global warming range,\" Hennessy says. Cutting to the chase, the scariest numbers are these: by 2020, under the high warming scenario, catastrophic fire weather days will occur at 20 sites, and at seven of those the frequency will be every eight years or less. By 2050, catastrophic days will occur at 22 sites, and at 19 of those the frequency will jump to every eight years or less. So that's catastrophic fire weather occurring at almost double the sites. In Bourke, Ceduna, Laverton, Melbourne airport, Mildura, Wagga and Woomera, catastrophic fire days could occur every three years . . . or less, the expert witness report concludes. These figures predict an increase in frequency of catastrophic fire weather, not fire occurrence, which would be influenced by fuel load, land-clearing and ignition. But the risk is plain. For those who think we're going to hell in a handbasket, Hennessy's figures are a wake-up call. \"Low\" warming (beneath the so-called 2 degree guardrail) is much safer than \"high\" warming (3 or 4 degrees, which is where we are heading based on the world's post-Copenhagen pledges). And that's just bushfire risk. The Insurance Council of Australia puts bushfire claims by value at just 7 per cent of natural disaster claims over 1967-1999, smaller than flood (29 per cent) severe storm (26 per cent), cyclone (25 per cent) and earthquake (13 per cent). But those figures are based on a 2001 study, which Hennessy says do not include area burnt or lives lost. As the post-Copenhagen malaise over climate deepens, plenty of people have observed it's going to \"take another disaster\" - like Hurricane Katrina, say - to drive genuine public concern and action to beat global warming. At the going rate it looks like there'll be a smorgasbord of disasters, with heatwaves from New York to Tokyo, drought and bushfire in Russia and the floods overwhelming Pakistan. But in Australia, after Black Saturday, surely we've had enough disaster already?

He was a disinterested schoolboy when his father insisted that they pay a visit to the deposed leader's home in Dharamasala. What stayed with Iyer, then 17, was a vision of swirling mist rather than the Tibetan monk's conversations on emptiness and reality. That was in 1974, and ever since, Iyer has followed the Dalai Lama's passage \"down from the mountaintop\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Open Road is an account of this enduring friendship. As Iyer travels with Tenzin Gyatso, he explores how exile can bring opportunity. Even though the Dalai Lama still travels on the yellow identity card of a refugee, he views loss as transformative. For Iyer, who in 1990, lost all his possessions, including eight years' worth of books in a forest fire in Santa Barbara, this is deeply instructive.</p><p>Pico Iyer, essayist, journalist and accomplished travel writer, portrays the Dalai Lama from three angles - in public, private and in practice. On the international stage, Iyer watches how Westerners project their dreams on to him. In part, because Tibet wears \"the contours of a fairytale\"; in part, our need for the Dalai Lama to be \"an emissary from some other world that doesn't exist\".</p><p>Yet, the Nobel Peace Prize winner couldn't be more down to earth. He's not in the business of peddling the view that compassion falls from the heavens. It takes hard work. The Dalai Lama starts his meditation at 4.30am every day - and can do it while listening to the BBC World Service.</p><p>Iyer notices that the Dalai Lama is frequently dismissed when he speaks in English and is ignored when he talks philosophically. (Most people refer to his \"presence and warmth\".) He recounts how one Canadian journalist described the Tibetan leader, \"as not exactly the brightest bulb in the room\". Deliberately, Iyer believes, the Dalai Lama has spent the past two decades compressing millennia of Buddhist teaching into a modern doctrine of simple human ethics. But his \"everyday humanity\" comes at a cost. No one would dare ask the Pope if \"he has dreams of women\", yet the doctor of metaphysics is seen as fair game for any question.</p><p>So it's startling to be reminded that Tenzin Gyatso is still a student. In a telling detail Iyer recounts how, when the photographer Manual Bauer, who spent more than three years photographing the Dalai Lama - in meditation, weeping, watching TV bare-chested - showed him the photos to check none violated his privacy, his subject questioned only one picture. It seemed to show, because of the perspective, that he was sitting higher than one of his teachers.</p><p>Such vignettes give this intimate and insightful portrayal of one of the world's iconic leaders great warmth. Iyer succeeds in de-cloaking the Dalai Lama, showing his many faces, and as with his other travelogues, does so with an excellent eye for detail. His descriptions of Dharamasala, a \"wild globalised village\", where Tibetan boys \"roam around like packs of wild dogs\" preying on starry-eyed Western women, and Israeli backpackers seek hedonism and spiritual highs, are spot on.</p><p>It is there, among his own people, that Iyer records one of \"the most moving moments\". Witnessing the Tibetan leader with newly arrived refugees, Iyer describes how \"when the Dalai Lama came into the room, it was as if the whole place began to sob and shake\".</p><p>And this strikes at the core of the Dalai Lama's dilemma. Tenzin Gyatso \"serves two constituencies - his own people and the world\". The wider community wants him to be \"a wise man, sitting above all nation-states and offering global counsel\".</p><p>Meanwhile, his compatriots are desperate for a solution with China, as the latest wave of unrest in Tibet would indicate. As the exiled leader tries to follow the non-violent approach and still appease the younger generation of frustrated Tibetans, he's caught between a \"monk's vision and a guerilla's\".</p><p>Iyer has no answers. As much as he tries to be an objective journalist, he admits, \"Something changed in me each time I left his company, even as I was telling my friends, heatedly, that humans never really change\". In a sense, The Open Road tells us as much about the author, his subject, as it does about ourselves. So often in trying to fathom this simple Buddhist monk, people become caught up in the mist. Iyer brings us back into focus.</p><p>Claire Scobie is the author of Last Seen in Lhasa, published by Vintage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO PHOTOS: The venerated Tibetan monk Tenzin Gyatso, the Dalai Lama.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-5kerl3w43a81mfs809ep</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4SRM-KYN0-TXN5-S0PK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>June 14, 2008 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Religion/Religions/Buddhism</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFKZ</classCode><className>MEDITATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00099LO</classCode><className>BUDDHISTS &amp;

An extensive collection of historical works fills much of the main space. William Strutt's famed 1864 work Black Thursday, February 6th 1851 sprawls across one wall, vast, dramatic and tempestuous, but ultimately overbearing. The softened hues and atmosphere of Arthur Boyd's Burning Off (1958), J.W. Curtis's Breaking camp, forest fire (1893) and the searing forest landscape of John Longstaff's Gippsland, Sunday night, February 20th, 1898 make for far more evocative examples. </p><p>It's a dynamic echoed in many of the contemporary works created in the wake of the Black Saturday fires, which only just fell short of the museum site. While the more violent imagery goes some way to capture the power and brutality of the flames - the towering, billowing smoke of Petra Reece's All consuming and relentless (the beast) is perhaps the finest example - it's the quieter works that perhaps prove the most affecting. Camilla Tadich's compact oils are haunting and mute. They capture unusual perspectives of the devastating aftermath of the blazes that tore through her home town of St Andrews and she fought from her door. Her car headlights shed light on the burnt remnants of a house, car and water tank; daybreak reveals an ashen landscape, drained of movement, colour and life. Peter Wegner's tiny, gestural bronze sculptures - which render victims embracing or alone, in shock in the wake of the fires - are the most unassuming but also the most heart-rending of the collection. Tues to Sun 11am-5pm, until July 25. WHAT Saffron Newey: Serious Moonlight WHERE MARS Gallery, 418 Bay Street, Port Melbourne, 9681 8245, marsgallery.com.au THEORETICALLY, Saffron Newey's darkened, meticulously detailed oils might fit the genre of the landscape painting, but the Melbourne artist's work avoids a palpable sense of representation and place. Painting from her own night-time photography, these works possess an uncanny luminosity. Certain colours glow and shimmer while others are muted in the half-light. Shapes and shadows of the indefinite pervade. Newey's curious vantages - low to the ground, from behind shrubs, foliage and bushes - only add to the arcane atmosphere. Shafts of moonlight splay onto an empty track; the tips of leaves gently radiate against the darkest of blues. We're left with a clutch of starting points, with more questions than answers. From whose perspective are we surveying these scenes? Just where are we and why are we here? Newey feeds us hints and traces while we wander and wonder. Her paintings are evocative starting points to an undefined narrative. Tues to Sun 10am-5pm, until July 31. WHAT Wayne Viney: Radiance WHERE James Makin Gallery, 67 Cambridge Street, Collingwood, 9416 3966, jamesmakingallery.com RADIANCE seems the perfect title for Wayne Viney's latest series of monotype prints. Known for his stunningly blurred, vaporous landscapes, the Melbourne artist and printmaker has abstracted all but a trace of the lay of the land in this series. Rather, he plies these works with simple horizontal phases of light - the ambience, perhaps, of the sun's reflection and refraction from the earth - void of details and topographies. Viney's reductive, nonetheless beautiful prints exude a timbre or resonance rather than a representation. Hue, tone and texture are of the essence. Tues to Fri 10am-5.30pm, Sat 11am-5pm, until July 24. WHAT John Spiteri: Aquaria Humanistica WHERE Neon Parc, Level 1, 53 Bourke Street, city, 9663 0911, neonparc.com.au THERE'S an alluring duality to John Spiteri's mixed-media paintings, prints and assemblages. Though somewhat elusive in their orientation and detail, the works that comprise Aquaria Humanistica don't just present a multifaceted artistic outcome, but grant access to various cryptic stages and chapters in Spiteri's process. Muted grey and brown oil and enamel is rubbed, sanded, cut and drawn upon; figures emerge out of muddy backdrops; repetitions percolate from one work to the next. In many ways, these works feel like archaeological relics from another dimension or era. They are fragmented moments, figures and evidence - they allude to so much while explaining so very little. Wed to Sat noon-6pm, until July 31. WHAT Benjamin Armstrong: Walking backwards to the place I come from WHERE Tolarno Galleries, Level 4, 104 Exhibition Street, city, 9654 6000, tolarnogalleries.com DESPITE their delicacy and lightness of touch, Benjamin Armstrong's hand-blown glass sculptures invoke a kind of poetic sense of permanence; the irrevocable passing from one plane to the next. Taking the form of large, hollow glass orbs - or as he describes them, \"corrupted hourglasses\" - sitting one atop the other, they appear as if in the midst of funnelling matter from the top to the base chamber. Brown dust, a baguette, a golden fish and a human brain are towed and sucked towards the inescapable lower cylinder, like unwilling specimens. The stunning, large-scale Chinese ink and pigment drawings (below) that accompany the sculptures, however, suggest a different set of possibilities. Using the erupting volcano as a central motif, they seem to show the potential for regeneration and the cyclic. In Permian times a volcano spews forth clouds of smoke, though in Too little too much those clouds spill sparkling rain to the earth. Tues to Fri 10am-5pm, Sat 1pm-5pm, till August 14.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FIVE PHOTOS: Petra Reece's All consuming and relentless (the beast).</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">5vat1ch9y0o19me19bit</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7YYB-XC01-2RR2-D01M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2013-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"938\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>July 17, 2010 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UKP</classCode><className>PAINTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002143</classCode><className>SCULPTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UKP</classCode><className>PAINTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002143</classCode><className>SCULPTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Lack of roadside clearing meant access roads were \"wicks\" that brought the fires into towns and lack of clearing over decades increased the forest fire danger index to catastrophic levels.</p><p>SHELTERS</p><p>Local councils should be helped by the State Government to develop plans in high-risk communities for bushfire shelters and evacuation points. New municipal management plans for hospitals, schools and aged care homes and lists compiled of the most vulnerable residents.</p><p>COMMENT: This recommendation addresses a major safety gap for the vulnerable. Establishing a network of community bushfire shelters will be very expensive and the State Government may baulk at the cost and persist with its cheaper policy of \"safer neighbourhood places\" such as footy ovals.</p><p>RESETTLEMENT</p><p>The state develop a \"retreat and resettlement'' policy where householders in high-risk bushfire areas are bought out and resettled.</p><p>COMMENT: The most radical recommendation and potentially enormously costly. The commissioners were clearly troubled by the mountain of evidence of wooden homes built on ridges, homes abutting pine plantations and homes where the only escape route was by a single track dirt road.</p><p>EVACUATIONS</p><p>The state develop an evacuations policy, especially for vulnerable people and a policy for emergency evacuation.</p><p>COMMENT: One of the toughest policies to implement and it is fraught with problems in areas where there are dirt roads, dead ends and evacuation routes are along narrow tree-lined roads.</p><p>POWER LINES</p><p>Dangerous overhead power lines gradually replaced with underground and aerial bundled cable to reduce the risk of bushfire ignition on high wind days. A timetable of 10 years in the highest risk areas.</p><p>COMMENT: Five of the 11 major fires were caused by power lines, but it is estimated burying lines would add at least 20 per cent to power bills. Highly unlikely to be implemented in full, but there will be measures to upgrade power line inspection and replacement of aging cables.</p><p>LEADERSHIP</p><p>Remove the title of Co-ordinator in Chief of Emergency Management from the Police and Emergency Services Minister and transfer it to Chief Commissioner of Police.</p><p>COMMENT: This recommendation removes the political element from emergency management on days like Black Saturday. Police Minister Bob Cameron was savaged for failing to recommend to the Premier that a state of disaster be declared and there is a suggestion the decision was grounded in the politics of the situation.</p><p>FIRE SUPREMO</p><p>A new independent statutory office of Fire Commissioner to become the new fire supremo for the state. The new Fire Commissioner to report to the Police and Emergency Services Minister and be responsible for increasing the operating capacity of all the fire services, particularly on the highest risk days, and advising of the boundaries between metropolitan and rural firefighters.</p><p>COMMENT: A recommendation that might cause resentment in the fiercely independent CFA hierarchy but there was a strong feeling in the commission hearings that no single individual felt they held the responsibility to ensure the state was prepared for the worst fire day.</p><p>FIRE LEVY</p><p>An end to the fire services levy on insurance premiums. Replaced with a property-based levy with concessions for low-income earners.</p><p>COMMENT: For every $100 paid by policy holders, $40 is directed to government taxes, including the fire services levy. Removal would decrease premiums and make people who currently have no insurance pay their fair share.</p><p>ARSON</p><p>A much higher police focus on arson with a centralised approach to training, prevention, detection and, at a local level, a scaled response in police areas according to the risk of catastrophic fires.</p><p>COMMENT: Victoria Police already gives a high priority to bushfire arson but the report's recommendation would mean a more co-ordinated approach with priority given to intelligence gathering and research. And at a higher cost.</p><p>** These are the top 11 of 67 findings by the Royal Commission.

At this time of the year many farmers burn the rainforest to extend their ranches.</p><p>A ministry spokesman said in Brasilia he hoped the last of the victims would be rescued by today.</p><p>Eight passengers died as a belly landing was made by the pilot of the jetliner, a Varig Boeing 737, after the plane ran low on fuel, Brazilian Air Force Ministry officials said yesterday. No foreigners were reported to have been aboard the flight.</p><p>On Sunday night, in a final radio transmission, the pilot of the commercial flight said he was lost over the jungle, was flying at an altitude of 8,000 feet on one of the plane's two engines and would try to land guided by the light of a forest fire. After two days of growing anxiety in Brazil, news bulletins broke into television programming yesterday afternoon to report that a survivor, Mr Epaminondas Souza Chaves, had appeared at a ranch in the Alto Xingu region in the eastern Amazon.</p><p>Speaking to civil aviation authorities by amateur radio, Mr Chaves is reported to have said that he first walked to another ranch but that it had no contact with the outside world. It is not clear how far the ranches are from the crash site.</p><p>\"The passenger said that all the survivors are in good health and that the crew of six survived,\" an Aeronautics Ministry spokesman said in a telephone interview from Brasilia. The ministry later reported, without giving details, that several people on board had been injured.</p><p>By nightfall yesterday, four other survivors reached the ranch and a Brazil Air Force Hercules cargo plane dropped food, water and medicine to the remaining survivors at the crash site, the spokesman said.</p><p>With machete-wielding workers hacking a trail through the jungle, medical teams set out last night by foot to the crash site, about 1,780 kilometres north-west of Rio de Janeiro. Helicopters were due to fly to the site today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Map: Location of crashed aeroplane.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhnuu3297o1izhr8c08</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1989</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P7G-YNJ0-TXN5-R2H8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"400\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1989 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"1989\"><dateText>September 7, 1989 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0002J2F</classCode><className>BOEING CO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>CC0009B0V</classCode><className>GOL LINHAS AEREAS INTELIGENTES SA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>US AIR FORCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>NAICS336414 GUIDED MISSILE &amp;

And even if regulators do identify products that are considered risky, it is not entirely clear what they would do about it.</p><p>Still, the direction of the reforms that Obama and the Treasury Department have outlined are hard for most to quibble with, given the events of the past year, though exactly how far-reaching they will really be is a topic for debate.</p><p>It is at least noteworthy that despite assertions that Obama's reform agenda has been significantly watered down from its original lofty goals, they proved meaningful enough to attract a negative response from the banking industry when Treasury's 85-page White Paper was released on Wednesday.</p><p>Luckily for Wall Street, the legislative process is likely to be slow-moving and lead to many changes that could dampen the negative impact for banks.</p><p>Coincidentally, nine banks given bail-out cash last year paid it back on Wednesday and some, such as Goldman Sachs, have used that event to issue a public mea culpa and promise better behaviour.</p><p>That may also be a sign that banks are about to step up their PR efforts to mould the final reform legislation and make sure it doesn't crimp their profits as much as many fear.</p><p>What is striking is that many of the reforms outlined in the white paper already seem to have involved compromises to try to maintain a degree of regulatory status quo.</p><p>A blueprint for reform outlined more than a year ago by former Treasury secretary Henry Paulson (notably before the climactic events of September) focused on rationalising the number of overlapping regulators, but the new administration looks to have largely abandoned that idea.</p><p>For instance, some say the decision against merging the Securities and Exchange Commission and Commodities and Futures Trading Commission (the merger would have combined regulation of stocks and futures and other derivatives) was based on preserving the power of the separate congressional committees that oversee each body.</p><p>The regulators themselves have lobbied hard to protect their own turf and ensured much-needed rationalisation of the \"alphabet soup\" of regulators was kept to a minimum. In fact, the alphabet soup is expanding with the creation of a Financial Services Oversight Council (FSOC) and a National Bank Supervisor (NBS).</p><p>The FSOC is the body that, along with the Fed, will hopefully be able to identify systemic risks. But exactly how it will do this seems so vague that it calls into question what difference it will make.</p><p>The NBS brings together the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Office of Thrift Supervision. and will be the prudential regulator of federally chartered banks.</p><p>There are many state-chartered banks and the aim will be to harmonise regulation so banks can shop for the best regulatory environment. But it may prove difficult to get all states to co-operate.</p><p>Another element of the package is making sure issuers of asset-backed securities have a 5 per cent interest in the securities they issue.</p><p>This seems to imply that securitisation was also to blame for the crisis, yet securitisation was around long before the housing bubble emerged and proved an important means of expanding the availability of credit to the economy.</p><p>After all, it is hard to forget banks lost hundreds of billions in the past year from holding these securities on their balance sheet, so having a financial interest may not make such a big difference - and could actually add to risk in the sector.</p><p>As for implications for Australia, foreign banks in the US will face the same rules as local banks. It was already clear there would be tighter requirements globally on banks, as the red-faced Basel Committee looks at overhauling the way it assesses how much capital banks should hold to guard against losses.</p><p>Stressing the need for international reform also may put more pressure on politicians around the world to reflect on their own regulatory inadequacies.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-5ppyccfpvzkervi28c0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:55BV-3R11-F0J6-J072-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"831\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

There are Marzocchi upside-down forks, a Sachs remote reservoir shock, Magura hydraulic clutch, Brembo brakes and Polisport plastics.</p><p>The switch gear and alloy rims are, appropriately, Japanese.</p><p>Fitted with an alloy rear subframe, the TE is much slimmer than Husky's old twin-pipe four strokes. The tank is anorexic at just 7.7litres, fine for enduro competition but a bit light-on for extended rides in the Australian bush. The seat is narrow and almost dead flat, perfect for weighting the front end.</p><p>It comes off with a single quick-release fastener and then the battery, which powers a tiny starter motor, flips out of the way for air filter access.</p><p>The test bike was fitted with Aussie Barkbusters, which are well worth the bucks for bush riding.</p><p>The rest of the plastics already appeared a bit second-hand, although there was less than 1000km on the tiny digital speedo, with the rear mudguard looking as if it had been loved by someone's boot buckles.</p><p>But the Michelin Enduro Competition rubber was definitely brand new.</p><p>The Husqvarna TE510 is not a play bike, unless you like playing with fire.</p><p>It's a machine designed to be ridden hard in enduro competition and will pummel you if you don't keep up the pace.</p><p>The carburetion on our test machine was super clean, as crisp as fuel injection. With minimal flywheels the Husky lights up extremely quickly.</p><p>We spent a few hours on forest fire trails where the 510 could be opened up and there was a margin for error.</p><p>It could even have handled a smaller back sprocket.</p><p>Gear changes need to be made rapidly, as the Husky builds up speed thanks to the way it builds revs and the close transmission ratios.</p><p>The steering is quick and the handling is beautifully neutral -- lean forward to unload the back tyre and tighten your line, lean back to unload the front wheel over rocks.</p><p>A particularly gnarly downhill off-camber corner was no longer a worry on the TE510.</p><p>The Brembos stopped us taking out an echidna and several kangaroos doing the same to us.</p><p>On another tight and bumpy single forest track it wasn't near as much fun. Here it was stalling repeatedly, wishing for a lower first gear or better skills.</p><p>The self-retracting sidestand started to be a real pain.</p><p>Given a decent amount of throttle the Husky had no trouble climbing the snottiest hills. It also loved the wet, loamy soil and bermed corners.</p><p>At a motorbike park we decided the 510 must have been set up for a heavy bloke with small feet. How did we know? Well we missed a few shifts in the lower gears because the gear change lever needed to be a touch higher and the whoops on the expert circuit needed to be approached at speed to make the suspension work at its best.</p><p>We tried backing off the compression damping but the suspension was still very stiff.</p><p>This is a great bike for enduro \"special tests\" -- much firmer at both ends than the Yamaha WR450 we tested last year -- but most riders would probably prefer suspension that's more progressive.</p><p>HUSQVARNA TE510</p><p>Engine: 501cc DOHC four-valve four stroke</p><p>Transmission: Six-speed constant mesh</p><p>Price: $12,490</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML0410061C08470013</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIERMAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4DGC-Y5R0-015G-Y2JH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Courier Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>October 6, 2004 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>HUSQVARNA AB\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>\u00a0AGUSTA SPA\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>HUSQB (STO)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>NAICS333991 POWER-DRIVEN HANDTOOL MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0SIC3546 POWER-DRIVEN HANDTOOLS\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>\u00a0SIC3523 FARM MACHINERY &amp; EQUIPMENT\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>\u00a0NAICS336411 AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURING\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><className>\u00a0SIC3721 AIRCRAFT\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

With virtually unlimited terms of reference it was entrusted to get to the bottom of the Black Saturday catastrophe and help avoid a repeat episode. It has done neither.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead of examining a compound failure of complex systems, the inquiry led an evidentiary monologue aligned with its untested preconceptions formed at the outset. The inquiry's only departure from mediocrity was its relentless isolation and degradation of selected individuals in the absence of logic or natural justice.</p><p>The tedious humiliation of former Country Fire Authority chief Russell Rees went well beyond the need to establish the facts. The calculated mortification of former police chief Christine Nixon made Victorians cringe. The idea that a colossal systemic failure can be sheeted home to a couple of individuals is a dangerous fantasy.</p><p>The commission maintained a myopic focus on the events of Black Saturday, divorced from a long history of causality. The commissioners appeared to be little more than spectators observing the intellectual bravado and superficiality of counsel assisting. Ironically, given its findings, no one at the commission appeared to be in charge.</p><p>The commission needed at least to try to understand the complex systems that lie beneath big bushfire episodes. Apart from the cost to human life, large wildfires threaten Victoria's water supply and its electricity distribution network, hydro-power generation, communications trunks and transport infrastructure. And if Victoria's forest fire emissions last year had been subject to a carbon levy the bill might have reached $5 billion.</p><p>Indeed, when probability is added to the scale of destruction, uncontrolled bushfires pose a greater threat to national security than terrorism. The terror threat was met correctly with urgency and a big investment in world-class technology, training and practice. By comparison, Victoria's worst bushfire disaster has been greeted with a dog and pony show.</p><p>A savvy royal commission would have placed political and practical decision-making front and centre in its deliberations.</p><p>It would have called on experts in behavioural psychology, system dynamics and cognitive leadership. The inquiry could have uncovered the influences behind decisions that now can be seen as fatally flawed.</p><p>It could have resisted pointless adversarialism that has sent potentially productive insiders ducking for cover.</p><p>A successful inquiry would not have allowed fuel reduction levels to become an ideological dispute. It could have calculated the risk radius around settled areas and determined how much forest maintenance was required to keep those areas safe.</p><p>The commission focused on improving the maintenance of antiquated electricity distribution networks, which is simply putting lipstick on the same old pig. The cost of replacing obsolete technology could have been justified by an assessment of economic benefit to communities from a larger and more reliable energy supply.</p><p>The commission has insisted on portraying CFA volunteers as a homogenous and sacrosanct group of heroes. In fact, the quality of the volunteer base has been diluted by an influx of urban cowboys who cannot be allowed anywhere near a fire for their own sake and that of their communities. These volunteers would be far more productive and cost effective if their value were appraised realistically and their efforts directed to forest maintenance that reduced fire risk.</p><p>Decentralisation of authority is also required to allow communities to leverage their intimate local knowledge and experience. Internet technology could be used to enable locals to share intelligence and updates in real time and prevent the hopeless inundation of the triple 0 centres that occurred on Black Saturday.</p><p>Unfortunately, the commission glossed over the need for communities to accept greater responsibility for their own safety. While growing hordes of tree-changers enjoy the scenery, it comes with serious risk that is compounded by complacency. There are vast areas that are too riddled with risk to support safe habitation and that reality can no longer be ignored.</p><p>External organisations such as 774 ABC radio need to recover the editorial independence that waned under the mantle of ``emergency services broadcaster''. The publicly funded broadcaster must scrutinise government agencies, but it blurred the line between observer and participant.</p><p>If they had had the humility to seek a role model, the commissioners should have looked to the Stretton royal commission conducted after Victoria's 1939 bushfire disaster.</p><p>Justice Leonard Stretton completed his inquiry in just four months and provided a safety prescription that served Victoria for 40 years.</p><p>Instead, public agencies are being exhorted to deliver urgent and radical improvement while also being required to wait patiently for the royal commission to unfurl its ponderous conclusions. Equally worrying is the absence of any fitness test applying to the commission's recommendations, including flops such as the Code Red community warning system.</p><p>This same system had already been tried and had failed miserably in the US after 9/11, but the royal commission did not do its homework.</p><p>Tragically, the royal commission has wasted a generational opportunity to recalibrate the entire chain of responsibility involving an increasingly populated, highly forested urban interface.</p><p>It had the chance to reinvest communities with resilience, self-sufficiency and meaningful leadership opportunities.</p><p>It could have helped communities to create mechanisms to cope with heatwaves, floods, epidemics and other crises that are as certain as they are unpredictable.</p><p>The royal commission could have hallowed the fire grounds with a world-class model of social, environmental and economic innovation. Instead, the mountain laboured and delivered a mouse. Consequently, hundreds of lives lost or wrecked on Black Saturday have been devalued by pomposity and self-aggrandisement of truly catastrophic proportions.</p><p>______________________________</p><p>&gt;&gt;

Later this year firefighters and land managers will have the results of significant new research to assist them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> CSIRO senior principal research scientist Phil Cheney says researchers are working to understand how fires behave.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>\"We try to use that knowledge to devise prediction systems, assist firefighters in their training programs, and make recommendations to authorities on things like what distances are needed to set back from bushland and how to manage the fuels in bushland,\" Mr Cheney said.</p><p> Research in the past has concentrated on understanding low-intensity fires, such as those used for hazard reduction.</p><p> The CSIRO has been working with the WA Department of Conservation and Land Management for the past six years on Project Vesta, studying high-intensity fires like those that have raged in NSW since Christmas. And it has produced some surprises.</p><p> \"We are finding that there is an interrelationship between the amount of fuel and the wind speed which we didn't appreciate before,\" Mr Cheney said.</p><p> Vesta researchers have found that the Forest Fire Danger Meter, now used to estimate fire speed, can dramatically under-predict the potential rate of a fire's spread.</p><p> In forests where there is a shrub layer over one metre tall, fires can spread up to three times faster than predicted by the danger meter, while fires in forests with litter and a low shrub layer can spread two times faster.</p><p> In the past, fire researchers thought fire increased continually with wind speed, but research has shown there is a \"stepwise\" process.</p><p> \"There tends to be a threshold wind speed which has to be exceeded before a fire will develop to its full potential.\"</p><p> This means a slight jump of wind speed, to around 12 to 15 km/h, can result in a big jump in fire behaviour.</p><p> \"One of the really important findings of our last research was how fast a fire moves after a wind change, particularly on relatively small fires,\" he said.</p><p> The head of a fire burns in the shape of an ellipse, with narrow ends and broader sides. \"We hadn't appreciated that the width of the head fire is an important factor in determining the speed of the fire. It may be burning well below its potential rate of spread simply because it is narrow,\" Mr Cheney said.</p><p> \"This is a phenomenon which occurs in high winds. A fire may be a long, narrow tongue. Then when the wind changes it immediately spreads at its (faster) potential rate of spread (from the broader side).\"</p><p> A fire starting from a line 100 metres long will burn at its potential speed immediately.</p><p> This finding defied the old belief that a fire goes through a growth period, building up speed.</p><p> \"We found out that this was not so,\" he said. \"It moves immediately away at its potential rate of spread, and we believe this was a contributing factor to several of the entrapments over the last five years.\"</p><p> The results of project Vesta are still being analysed. They will result in new guidelines, the National Fire Behaviour Prediction System for dry eucalypt forests, later this year. The new guidelines will help land managers make better decisions about hazard- reduction fires.</p><p> \"When these severe conditions break out there is a tendency to say 'well, they are totally unpredictable',\" Mr Cheney said. \"We think that \u2026 when we have worked through this we will do a better job.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0201121C20210621</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44WJ-KGB0-015G-P52M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"566\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Weekend Australian</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>January 12, 2002, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001949</classCode><className>LAND USE &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XH6</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008WSA</classCode><className>NATURAL RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Instead, 50 firefighters were rushed in from Wollongong to aid the desperate house-to-house battle in 65kmh winds.</p><p>Last night, there were fears that the fire could turn again, and head toward Jervis Bay to the north.</p><p>The Rural Fire Service Commissioner, Phil Koperberg, said the fierce winds were largely responsible for the destruction, but reinforcements had also been held up by road closures caused by other fires to the south.</p><p>\"We have got reinforcements in from the north but they're experiencing firestorm conditions, the situation is very, very intense,\" he said. \"All of the 75 aircraft dedicated to the firefighting effort statewide were fully committed to protecting property elsewhere.\"</p><p>In another emergency evacuation, at least 26 people, including 11 children and 10 police officers, had to be airlifted out of Colo Heights, west of Wisemans Ferry, by three helicopters in the face of a fire which threatened to engulf the fire station.</p><p>Further south at Bowen Mountain, about 500 people were evacuated after the fire which threatened Kurrajong Heights on New Year's Day flared again in gusty conditions.</p><p>Elsewhere on the verge of Sydney, firefighters grappled with a limited water supply to contain a forest fire which began in the Holsworthy Military Reserve and jumped Heathcote Road into the Sandy Point and Pleasure Point residential areas, threatening dozens of homes. The fire burnt out five hectares before being brought under control.</p><p>Another fire in East Ryde's Field of Mars Cemetery was also brought under control.</p><p>Mr Koperberg nominated the Blue Mountains blaze as potentially the most serious confronting firefighters as 100 fires continued to burn around the state.</p><p>But despite the last-minute emergencies, fire authorities last night were confident that weather conditions were turning in their favour for the first time in more than a week, describing today's outlook as promising, but still critical.</p><p>While no rain is forecast, conditions for fire-fighting are expected to improve slightly as temperatures drop into the high 20s and winds ease and turn to the south-west.</p><p>In other developments:</p><p>*The Premier, Bob Carr, said juveniles caught lighting fires should be made to take part in justice programs, including facing their victims and paying compensation, rather than going to jail.</p><p>*The NSW Coroner, John Abernathy, launched an inquiry into the causes of the fires.</p><p>* Mr Carr and the Prime Minister, John Howard, announced they would consider buying up to four big firefighting helicopters, worth $15 million each.</p><p>* Community fire units in Sydney's north-west were praised for helping to save hundreds of homes threatened by fresh outbreaks in Pennant Hills Park.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>MAP: Princes Highway cut, 5000 people from Sussex Inlet and Cudmirrah evacuated onto beach.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yif680pouw1l53sxdjo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P6W-1CJ0-TXN5-R2KM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2002 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Early Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"01\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>January 3, 2002 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Nsw</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents And Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;

When Bruno Grollo faced charges in 1997 relating to a federal police inquiry into the company's tax affairs, for which he was later acquitted, Dina urged him to trust their sons Adam and Daniel with more of the day-to-day running of the firm, which has built some of Australia's most prominent buildings. These include the Rialto Tower, Melbourne's tallest building; the $500 million Eureka Towers apartment complex at Southgate; and the 53-level Bloomberg-Grollo tower in Brisbane.</p><p> \"She gave me a lot of encouragement and she was always by my side when there were problems,\" Bruno Grollo says. \"I always discussed business with her, it was a family thing. I don't think she liked the long hours but she put up with long hours for the sake of letting me satisfy my ego.\"</p><p> Dina Grollo's family, the Bettiols, came from Cusignana, the same township on the Treviso plain in Italy from where the Grollos came. Cusignana is an old agricultural community and many of its people emigrated. They took with them a capacity for honest hard work, an ambition to succeed and a strong co-operative ethos.</p><p> One of the Bettiols, Cesare, immigrated to Australia in the late 1920s and worked alongside Luigi Grollo, the father of Bruno and Rino, in the forests of Gippsland.</p><p> Like Luigi Grollo, Bettiol moved to Melbourne after the disastrous forest fire of 1939. He and his wife, Luigia Marchiori, settled in the suburb of Thornbury, where the Grollos later moved from Carlton in the '50s.</p><p> The Bettiols' daughter Dina first worked as a shop assistant at Woolworths before going to work in the office of the nascent Grollo building company as a young woman. She married Bruno Gordano Grollo in Melbourne on March 27, 1965.</p><p> As the family business grew from humble suburban concreting to the construction of skyscrapers, the wives of the Grollo men were closely associated with the work of the firm.</p><p> Dina Grollo was an accomplished homemaker, providing a loving and consistent family structure. The family regularly enjoyed camping, picnics and skiing, and Dina, whose passion was photography, lovingly documented the family's growth and development.</p><p> During the '90s the Grollo firm established itself as a leading builder in Sydney, taking its reputation for large-scale construction to the national stage. But tragedy struck when Bruno Grollo was charged with conspiracy. Dina was by his side in court every day.</p><p> She suffered a stroke during this ordeal, only to come back to the court a few months later in a wheelchair. On June 26, 1997, Bruno and his two co-accused were acquitted of conspiracy to pervert a federal police investigation into the company's tax affairs. The Grollo brothers won their final court case on November 28 last year, when an alleged $25 million tax fraud was dismissed.</p><p> Dina Grollo will be remembered as a kind and loyal person. She had a modesty and gentleness of spirit that was a great resource for those around her, especially her exuberant husband.</p><p> She is survived by Bruno; their daughter, Lee-Anna; sons Adam and Daniel; and six grandchildren.</p><p>Robert Pascoe, dean of arts at Victoria University, is the author of four books on the Grollo family</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0112261013023181</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44RY-J3M0-015G-P216-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"600\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>December 26, 2001, Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>CO-OPERATIVE BANK PLC \u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><className>NAICS522110 COMMERCIAL BANKING \u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp;

If we have the ongoing drought, that will be a very serious prognosis.\"</p><p> The fires were linked with climate change and had global consequences, with the carbon dioxide emissions estimated to be equivalent to the annual CO2 emissions from all of Europe, Topfer said.</p><p> \"I really believe this is a real catastrophe for the people,\" he said.</p><p> \"It is a disaster with regard to the economic consequences \u2026 and it is an environmental disaster.\"</p><p> The fires were one of a hit-list of problems facing Indonesia at the moment and, in conjunction with the UN Development Program (UNDP), the UNEP had come up with a proposal to combine efforts to tackle the food shortage - the food for work programs - with firefighting efforts.</p><p> If the program gained approval at a Geneva meeting of concerned agencies on April 21 and 22, and was successful, it might also be used to help with fire prevention, Topfer said.</p><p> The coordinated approach would have three priorities: halting the spread of the fires, fighting them and preventing their recurrence.</p><p> While working in conjunction with national efforts, the UNEP would seek enforcement of the law which bans lighting fires for land-clearing purposes.</p><p>Indonesian Environment Minister Juwono Sudarsono said 65 per cent of the land burned in the current spate of fires in East Kalimantan was on land held by timber companies which had intentionally lit fires as a cheap but illegal method of land clearing prior to planting oil palms or other crops.</p><p>Indonesian authorities last year regularly blamed plantation owners for the fires, even announcing the number of companies they believed responsible, but no legal proceedings have been concluded against them.</p><p> Many nations, including Australia, and international agencies have been involved in firefighting efforts in Indonesia but the fires have continued to burn.</p><p> Topfer said he did not believe putting out the fires was an impossible task and that it was no good sitting back in an armchair waiting for the rains to come.</p><p> \"We are not blue-eyed optimists; we are very realistic,\" he said.</p><p> (AAP)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1998</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"543\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 AAP Information Services Pty.

On Black Saturday the index was three times that amount but Victoria was blind to the implications.</p><p>JACK RUSH: The intensity of the potential fires would be such that it could not be imagined by our generation.</p><p>Not only the intensity of the fire, the heat of the fire, but its speed was phenomenal.</p><p>Fire spotted kilometres ahead, fireballs seemingly of atomic force came before the fire. The fire did not discriminate between buildings of brick, timber or other construction.</p><p>Such fires create their own weather and are beyond the most sophisticated attempts to control them.</p><p>The evidence will demonstrate people made decisions in relation to stay or go with an unrealistic optimism.</p><p>RACHAEL BROWN: Victoria's 'stay or go' policy will be the focus of the first block of hearings, which start next month.</p><p>Mr Rush QC said the Commission might find that, in some communities, 'stay' should never have been an option and that perhaps Victoria should devise evacuation policies like some parts of Europe and the US.</p><p>Just who warns those in the path of bushfires, and how the warning is conveyed, will be another focus.</p><p>It will be a very public affair, with cameras allowed to film proceedings. And a mammoth task for the commissioners, who've restricted oral submissions to those whose conduct will come under scrutiny.</p><p>Former Federal Court judge Bernard Teague, who's chairing the commission, explains the deadline pressures.</p><p>BERNARD TEAGUE: For an interim report it is 17th of August 2009, for our final report it is the 31st of July 2010. We plan to meet those deadlines. We can only do so by limiting the issues that we address and by dealing with the more critical issues first.</p><p>Many applicants have not been granted leave. If you are one of those we encourage you to focus in the short term on providing a detailed written submission.</p><p>There are other ways of permitting you to air facts and voice opinions than by having a formal right to appear at hearings.</p><p>RACHAEL BROWN: But many feel it's a slap in the face for bushfire survivors.</p><p>While their voices were heard at the 26 community consultations that have been held around the state, this did not count as formal evidence.</p><p>Mat Tinkler represents 30 individuals and groups who've all been denied leave to appear at the commission.</p><p>MAT TINKLER: We've assisted people who've lost family members; we've assisted people who were first on the scene at certain fire sites and providing emergency medical assistance; groups of people involved in the emergency response who might not necessarily agree with the views being put forward by the other bodies; people with expertise in relation to fire management, so a variety of views.</p><p>RACHAEL BROWN: Barrister Tim Tobin QC hopes to appear for those affected by fires thought to have been started by fallen or faulty power lines.</p><p>TIM TOBIN: We know that Coleraine and Horsham fires were fires where a conductor came off poles. The Weerite/Pomborneit fire was a fire were conductors clashed. The Mudgegonga fire, the Myrtleford fire was a fire where there was an insulator failure and wires clashing. The Kinglake was a failure of a conductor over a span of 1.125km.</p><p>RACHAEL BROWN: This issue's inclusion may be tricky, given the pending class action against SP AusNet over the allegation that one of its lines snapped, causing the Kilmore East blaze.</p><p>But Mr Tobin QC says it's important the commission considers the causes behind the fires, not just future warning systems.</p><p>TIM TOBIN: Because the major fires that have occurred over the last 35 years in Victoria, with life and asset destruction on private land, have been fires where they have had an involvement of power assets. And if you know how the fires are started, you then know how to prevent the fires from starting and make recommendations</p><p>RACHAEL BROWN: The commission will reconvene on the 11th of May.</p><p>LISA MILLAR: That report by Rachael Brown.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-2547812</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VH0-C6H1-2RG6-Y549-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"851\"/><timeReceived>6:22 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 20, 2009 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

The authorities gave us these,\" one said, proudly referring to a battered plastic water tank strapped to his back.</p><p>Until now, he explained, they had to beat flames out with tree branches.</p><p>This time, they walked about 3km from the nearest water hole to fill each 15-litre tank.</p><p>When they finish dousing this fire, they will walk back, refill and hike to another blaze, he said.</p><p>Wildfires that poured choking smoke across much of South-East Asia and threatened the health of an estimated 70 million people last year have returned to the jungles of Borneo island.</p><p>Indonesia's worried neighbours have demanded strong action. But bogged down in its worst economic crisis in three decades, Indonesia admits that without heavy rain it has almost no chance of preventing haze from spreading across the region again.</p><p>Most days, a heavy haze blankets the cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda, both about 1200km north of Jakarta. Here the sun burns orange in a grey sky. Smoke fills the nose, irritates the throat and stings the eyes. Doctors warn of a dramatic increase in respiratory infections and asthma if the haze persists.</p><p>\"We could face major health problems if it does not rain soon,\" said Dr Jusuf, the head of a hospital in Samarinda. The smoke is worst in two national parks that are home to rare species such as orangutan apes.</p><p>Scientists warn that together with drought, the haze could devastate harvests as it did last year when crops could not get enough sunshine to grow.</p><p>\"The smoke has ruined my crop. Fruit from my trees is too small to sell,\" complains Kondo, a farmer who lives on the edge of the burning forest.</p><p>As last year, officials have said many of the fires appear to have been set, a cheap way to clear land.</p><p>Officials using satellite imaging count between 400 and 600 hotspots a day in eastern Borneo and dozens more in central Sumatra island. Fires have also been spotted in the Malaysian-controlled northern part of Borneo.</p><p>At this time of year, these locales should be green, lush and wet. But meteorologists say El Nino has cut short the rainy season, leaving jungles, farmland and commercial forest areas tinder-dry.</p><p>The government says about 8900ha of land have been blackened in Borneo. But Grant Beebe, a forest fire expert from Boise, Idaho, said the damage could be in the hundreds of thousands of hectares.</p><p>Several hundred soldiers, firefighters and farmers are battling the fires with buckets or branches of trees, said Mr Beebe, who works for a German-funded aid project monitoring the problem.</p><p>They haven't had much success, he said, but \"it's an improvement on the past when people just let fires burn. At least now they know they should at least try to control them.\"</p><p>When the fires first started in Borneo costly water bombing planes were sent up for a few days - to little effect.</p><p>The government then began an operation in which a plane drops salt crystals into clouds to induce rain. But so far that also has failed.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illus: Villagers used branches against fires on Balikpapan, Borneo, last year.

In the 2007 California fires, which destroyed 3069 houses, nearly 1 million residents were evacuated from 350,000 homes, and only 10 people died, he said. In the Victorian fires,more than 2000 homes were destroyed and 173 people died.</p><p>The commission would examine whether an evacuation policy would be suitable in some places on extreme days,\" Mr Rush said.</p><p>\"Some particular areas of this state, as a consequence of habitat and topography ... are indefensible from a fire-fighting point of view,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Rush also said evidence would be presented demonstrating that on February 7 many people remained in their homes unaware of approaching fires until it was too late.</p><p>He said official \"leaving early\" advice from authorities suggested that residents make a decision by 10am. But by 10am and even by midday on February 7, there was little fire activity in Victoria.</p><p>\"There was no reported fire in Kilmore East, Horsham, Kinglake, Marysville, Strathewen, Callignee, Bendigo or Coleraine,\" he said. \"Why would a resident of any of the fire-affected regions implement the 'Go' part of the policy if they were not aware of any fire threat?\"</p><p>Mr Rush also said that while Victorians knew in advance that February 7 was a day of extreme risk, they did not understand there was a chance of \"a fire that could not be fought\".</p><p>He said a rating of 12 to 25 on the McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index was considered high and a rating over 50 extreme. \"The index on 7 February reached previously unrecorded levels ranging from 120 to 180.</p><p>The blazes probably reached an intensity of 100,000 kilowatts per square metre. \"The maximum intensity for control of forest fires is about 4000 kilowatts per metre,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Rush said the commission would hear evidence that communications failed to cope on February 7 and warnings fell behind the advancing fires and the way they developed after a wind change.</p><p>He said the commission would scrutinise the websites of fire-fighting organisations and assess \"the ability to track fires at all\". Warnings needed to be accurate and timely, he said.</p><p>\"Underpinning such warnings is the ability for agencies to rapidly analyse on-the-ground intelligence, to monitor risks as they emerge and develop, predict future impacts and point to the best course of action.\"</p><p>Mr Rush said emergency refuges had been set up after the 1983 Ash Wednesday fires and were maintained by local councils during the 1980s but over time had been decommissioned. \"Questions as to uniform standards, the legal liability of local councils who maintained them and the risk people may drive to refuges in dangerous circumstances have been raised as reasons for decommissioning,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Rush said a new national building standard, adopted soon after February 7, failed to cover important questions for fire-prone areas. The commission would look at issues including building maintenance, exit before and after fires, bunkers, water and power.</p><p>He said some houses built to the highest standards had burned to the ground, so the inquiry had commissioned analysis on a street-by-street basis to help make findings about building codes.</p><p>Mr Rush also raised concerns surrounding fuel reduction, saying it was constrained by complex rules.</p><p>\"Many municipalities in high-risk bushfire areas have a land management overlay, an environmental significance overlay, a vegetation protection overlay, a wildfire management overlay,\" he said. \"On their face, the planning provisions appear complex and bureaucratic.\"</p><p>Due to time constraints, the commission's eight-week block of hearings beginning on May 11 will examine only warnings and the stay-or-go policy.</p><p>Commission chairman Bernard Teague said the inquiry could meet its deadlines only if it limited the issues it addressed and looked at the more critical issues first, with a focus on saving lives.</p><p>Mr Rush said remaining questions, including causes of the fires, would be addressed after the interim report was delivered in August.

Locals watch a huge forest fire raging out of control on the outskirts of Athens The mercury rose to 40 degrees just as Europe hits the beaches for the long summer break.Record temperatures were recorded in Paris, where pollution also soared to alert levels, sparking warnings of a car ban.The heat in southern Spain has killed at least 12 people in the past week, most elderly.Temperatures have hovered above 40 degrees and reached 50 at times in the cities of Seville and Cordoba.Another 32 people were taken to hospital in the southern region of Andalusia.Three deaths were reported in France, all from heart attacks apparently brought on by searing temperatures.On the Mediterranean island of Corsica, a 27-year-old man had a heart attack while out walking, while a 67-yearold woman died of a heatinduced heart attack on on the Atlantic coast near La Rochelle, police said.Later in the day, a 58-year-old hiker died while out walking with his family in the Pyrenees. Rescuers tried to resuscitate him after he collapsed at 2,200 metres, but he suffered a heart attack through lack of oxygen and overheating.In other countries, employees were sent home because of the heat.In Greece, the traditional summer swelter in Athens has been somewhat alleviated by a ban on traffic in the city, but forest fires have hit a number of islands and areas around the capital.</p><p>In Italy, no specific heat-related deaths have been recorded, but authorities in Rome and Milan have joined cities like Paris in appealing to motorists to leave their cars at home to cut choking fumes in city centres.Further north, the French deaths sparked health fears in countries not used to such extremes of temperature.In Germany, not known for extremes of temperature, the mercury was expected to reach 37 today and at least one major office workers' union called on its members to go home if temperatures rose above 31 degrees.In Paris, pollution levels soared to alert level two - on a scale of three - for the second time in a month, sparking a renewed warning that car restrictions could be introduced. Mayor Jean Tiberi said public information campaigns might not be enough.\"If all those methods are not enough, I would not hesitate to call on the authorities to take measures to restrict traffic,\" he warned.Temperatures, meanwhile, soared to a record 36.2 degrees during the day, equivalent to levels recorded during the drought summer of 1976, authorities said.The heat wave was not all bad news.In Britain, temperatures 10 degrees above the seasonal average sparked unusual sights for visitors to the Kew Botanical Gardens.Keepers said an eightyear-old bread plant bore fruit for the first time, while a rare blossom from Niger came into flower for 30 minutes in response to the unaccustomed heat.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-DTM9507240020179657</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEDAILYTELEGRALTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49NR-WV20-01S8-B3JW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"479\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE DAILY TELEGRAPH MIRROR</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"07\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>July 24, 1995 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>ATLANTIC COAST CARTON\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

The small fishing port of Playa de Santiago, on the southern tip of the Canary Island of La Gomera, has never known such excitement. Chosen as a key shooting location for Ron Howard's forthcoming film In the Heart of the Sea (due for release next year), its quayside is abuzz with trailers and catering vans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Burly cameramen are lugging equipment on to speed boats. Runners with clipboards are rounding up a busload of enthusiastic extras for costume fittings. And a cluster of schoolgirls are star-spotting like mad, as Hollywood's finest, clad in 19th-century sailors' gear, make their way towards the banana-yellow shuttle boat that will whisk them out to film at sea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Based on the same true story that inspired Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Nathaniel Philbrick's award-winning novel In the Heart of the Sea (published in 2000) -recounts the tragedy of the whaling ship Essex, sunk by a sperm whale in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. A fantastic black-rigged replica of the ill-fated vessel (built in -England) bobs incongruously on the calm horizon, its masts bathed in a golden wash of Canarian sunshine.</p><p>At first sight, pint-sized La Gomera - sitting prettily in an island chain renowned for its equable climate - might seem a strange location to have settled on for a tale built around tempest-lashed heroics. Deadly waves are in short supply. The filmmakers had to construct a special infinity pool by the former tomato packaging warehouse on Tapahuga Beach to simulate the full-on -storm scenes.</p><p>But Howard and his scouts definitely knew what they were doing. As the second smallest of the Canary Islands, a one-hour ferry-ride from Tenerife and with no international airport, La Gomera is a world apart from the mass-tourism of its larger neighbours. With only a handful of low-key resorts, there was never going to be much risk of the Essex's hapless crew fetching up on a jarring parade of neon-signed shops peddling water-wings or advertising jet-skis for hire.</p><p>Instead, the island's starkly rugged coastline of awesome volcanic cliffs rippling down to the water's edge in stiff rocky folds, feels almost eerily enduring - and -(crucially for the film, of course) totally undateable. -Inland, the mountainous centre is cloaked in a dense, misty rainforest of ancient trees hung, Druid-like, with beards of moss and lichen. It's as timeless and unspoilt as you could hope for.</p><p>As a place to visit in springtime, La Gomera is a total delight. The tangled green groves of the rainforest are rippled with carpets of brilliant pink bicacaros, Canarian bell flowers. Mountain villages float in drifts of white broom and almond blossom. On the coast, fringed with date palms and banana trees, the sea sparkles peacefully in temperatures that seldom vary from around 20C. Don't expect the blazing heat or golden sands of Caribbean beaches. Most beaches are rocky. (There may even be a little rain.) But if you're searching for sun and serenity in a gentle, unspoilt island retreat steeped in tradition, look no further. And you can certainly be confident of a genuinely warm welcome from La Gomera's friendly locals, keen to share their homeland's special character with visitors. With the island still very much a novice in the tourism stakes, the whole ambience is refreshingly uncynical.</p><p>Such tourism as there is can be found mainly on the west coast. Valle Gran Rey has a stunning sprawl of wild and rocky black-sand beaches, backed by majestic ravines (Valle Gran Rey means \"Valley of the Kings\"). Otherwise, most visitors-in-the-know head south for -unpretentious Playa de Santiago, a friendly working fishing settlement with an endearingly scruffy town beach. This is La Gomera's sunniest spot and it's where I choose to stay (along, as it turns out, with the director and most of the cast and crew of In the Heart of the Sea).</p><p>We certainly aren't roughing it. The four-star Hotel Jardin Tecina, set on a clifftop above the town, is laid out like a traditional Canarian village in exuberant, flower-filled gardens. There are palm-fringed bars and terraces, and attentive waiters galore - giving plenty of scope for your own brand of silver-screen decadence as you lounge like a diva by the poolside. It's also a wonderfully tranquil spot. The vistas from the sea-view rooms are spectacular. You can while away hours on your balcony watching the colours of the water change from turquoise to indigo to lilac, like a roll of shot silk, as butterflies and exotic birds flit all around you.</p><p>On day four of my stay, I wander down towards the town and discover that my friendly local beach bar - the ramshackle La Chalana - has undergone a dramatic change of location. Its wonky tables and cane chairs are now spilling haphazardly on to the edge of an early 19th-century Polynesian village. A nearby stretch of banana plantation had been cleared for carpentry and set-building, and crew-members with blowtorches are busily distressing a fleet of rustic-looking canoes carved from hollowed-out tree-trunks. A mixture of real palm trees and bright green fakes have sprung up on the beach. Tangled branches and planks of driftwood have been choreographed artfully into a photogenic array of native huts. And a derelict warehouse has been transformed into a small chapel. A set dresser perches on a ladder with what looks like a huge brass church bell clutched in her free hand. It is obviously as light as a feather.</p><p>La Chalana's affable host, Eric - who, with his curly black hair and earring, looks rather like a film star himself - is having the time of his life serving up tapas and beer by the trayful. He is sure he recognises some of the transplanted palm trees, he tells me. They come from the schoolyard in San Sebastian, La Gomera's capital. He -remembers sitting under them at break-times to smoke illicit cigarettes.</p><p>Eric is not alone in his enthusiasm. Everyone I speak to is thrilled by the filming - not least since the star, Australian Chris Hemsworth, is married to Elsa Pataky, a popular Spanish actress who has accompanied him for the shoot. More pragmatically, In the Heart of the Sea brings a crucial source of additional revenue to enable the island to address the environmental damage caused by a disastrous forest fire in 2012 - as well as much-needed employment for locals, who are mucking in happily as caterers, security guards and prop-makers.</p><p>La Gomera is also looking to the future. Although the island has been recognised for some time as a paradise for walkers, its more mainstream attractions - uncommercialised beaches and picture-postcard mountain villages - have remained a well-kept secret. There's real excitement now among Gomeros that this major, -potentially worldwide, exposure will encourage new visitors to fall for their island's sleepy charms and living history. (After all, as everyone is keen to remind me, San Sebastian was the starting point for Christopher -Columbus's epic 1492 Atlantic crossing. And where else in the world will you find \"El Silbo\", an indigenous whistling language developed so that farmers could communicate with each other across jaw-droppingly steep terraces?) Towards the end of my visit, inspired by the filming, I decide to embrace the whale theme in earnest. I book a trip on board Jose Miguel's excursion boat Tina and take to the water. I am rewarded with an entrancing marine ballet, courtesy of a pod of pilot whales and an especially obliging school of dolphins who flip and dip in glorious silver arcs as they ride in and out of the bow wave from our boat as it heads out to sea.</p><p>I look back at the bulking headlands of La Gomera's proud cliffs, veined with blood-red bands of sandstone, and then ahead to the horizon, where the doughty ship Essex has magically split in two, while cameramen scud around in dinghies, capturing the moment of its doom.</p><p>I really am in the heart of the sea, I realise. And lovely La Gomera is well on its way to becoming a film star in its own right.

Some of the nitrogen and sulphur compounds are key components of smog, and can form acids that make up acid rain.</p><p>Dr Lawrence Radke, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Washington, says the source of the noxious compounds was motor vehicle exhausts emitted over decades.</p><p>The exhausts had drifted from nearby freeways to settle on plants and soil, then were liberated by the fire.</p><p>Environmental scientists in Sydney agree that the city has the basic elements necessary to be a candidate for a similar problem: 1.5 million cars, an encircling swath of forests, and regular summer bushfires.</p><p>Mr Len Ferrari, a principal air scientist with the State Pollution Control Commission, said yesterday that Los Angeles had worse air pollution and more sulphurous fuel than that used in Sydney.</p><p>But he conceded, along with Dr Frank Cattel, an environmental chemist at Macquarie University's centre for environmental and urban studies, that the Los Angeles finding could be quite relevant to Sydney.</p><p>\"I would expect similar but more muted effects here, and it's something well worth looking at,\" Dr Cattell said yesterday.</p><p>Dr Cattell's research group has recently identified another serious health hazard from bushfire smoke, in the form of polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs).</p><p>Those complex organic compounds result from incomplete combustion, and several have been shown to cause cancer.</p><p>Dr Cattel calculates that airborne PAHs released by car exhausts, bushfires, and backyard incinerators are probably responsible for about 30 of the 1,000 lung cancer deaths each year in Sydney.</p><p>New pollution control equipment on cars and bans on backyard burning would help to control the PAH problem, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhlljdni943i59q65q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1987</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P7G-YHW0-TXN5-R2G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"436\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1987 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"1987\"><dateText>October 14, 1987 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;

The downturn in the labour-intensive construction industry would force lay-offs and further labour unrest should be expected.</p><p>\"Those who will sacrifice the most will be the poorest. But the business groups with vested interests will continue to receive special rights to exploit the nation's national resources,\" Ms Hafild said of Indonesia's dominant corporate sector, with its powerful political connections.</p><p>WAHLI said it feared increasing violence in Indonesian society as the stresses of vast forest fires and the severe drought, combined with spending cutbacks, began to affect ordinary people, already suffering under unemployment rates of 38 per cent.</p><p>\"What we are worried about is that the usual climax of fires and long periods of drought is famine and crop failures. There could be a long period of unrest.\"</p><p>The IMF, the World Bank and officials of the Soeharto Government continued closed- door meetings in Jakarta yesterday. The rupiah, pushed to an all-time low last week ahead of the call for IMF assistance, held on to modest gains, but remained well below its previous value.</p><p>WAHLI said its own investigation into the forest fires which continue to burn across parts of Indonesia showed that more than 1.1 million hectares of forest have been lost, compared with the 400,000 hectares conceded by the Government.</p><p>Environment Ministry officials warned on Monday that the haze and fire problem was not over, after the number of fires sharply increased as a very hot, dry and windy weather pattern settled across Indonesia.</p><p>WAHLI said the Government had instructed local newspaper editors to stop blaming big timber and plantation companies and to instead blame the El Nin~o pattern.</p><p>Ms Hafild said the group was not confident that threats against big companies which started the fires as a means of cheap and quick land clearing would be prosecuted, nor that any fundamental changes would be made to prevent a repeat of this year's environmental disaster.</p><p>She said about 97 per cent of Indonesia's wood product exports were produced using virgin rainforest and that renewable timber plantations had not yet matured.</p><p>\"The haze and forest fire problem runs parallel to the financial crisis. The fundamentals of both are the distortion of the economy, monopolies and vested interests in the economy which have not been addressed.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhvq96ads820b9g7qz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P85-12R0-TXN5-R253-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"520\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 15, 1997 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Indonesia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents And Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Social Welfare</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000157</classCode><className>BAILOUTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DM8Y</classCode><className>BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp;

He is also a fire behaviour specialist and a senior lecturer in fire ecology and management at the University of Melbourne.</p><p>\"Using fuel (type), topography and weather conditions, we can look at the probability of a fire and its impact,\" Dr Tolhurst says. \"We are able to look at a few scenarios. We can look ahead to see the consequences of actions.</p><p>\"During the fires, I used the model to look at what would happen if the fire escaped from the control line - how far would it run? How could we fight the fire most effectively?</p><p>\"For example, once we know the worst places the fire can escape from, we can use aircraft early on at these critical points.\"</p><p>Phoenix can also be used to see how different fire management strategies will affect houses and infrastructure.</p><p>Simulation graphics from Phoenix can't be published yet as it may cause difficulties with the Royal Commission and the coronial inquiries.</p><p>Input to Phoenix includes the starting point of the fire, fuel type, wind, weather, topography (height and slope of the ground), and the effect of recent fires on fuel levels.</p><p>Spotting information is also critical to the model. Spotting is when spot fires are started by embers blown ahead of the main fire.</p><p>\"Spot fires can significantly increase the rate of spread of the main fire front across the landscape and enable the fire to cross barriers such as freeways and lakes,\" says Dr Tolhurst.</p><p>Phoenix models the occurrence and development of spot fires within about 10kilometres of the main fire front. It calculates the effect of the convective updraft caused by thousands of spot fires within 200metres of the fire front.</p><p>Weather information is also critical, says Dr Tolhurst.</p><p>\"We need to know the wind direction and speed,\" he says. \"But the weather conditions take the longest to input; it could take up to an hour to get the information. Rather than wait for the forecast, we are writing code to used gridded forecast weather, using a six-kilometre grid and generated every 12hours.</p><p>\"This will reduce the time waiting for weather input and increase the spatial accuracy of the weather data.\"</p><p>Phoenix uses a single stream of weather conditions for wind speed and direction, but will add a model from the US (called Wind Ninja) that uses topography to determine local wind speed and directions so wind movement over hilly terrain can be extrapolated. For example, fire moves faster up a hill as there is a smaller area the higher up it advances.</p><p>\"The thing that's special about Phoenix is that we include disruptions, such as roads or streams from a GIS (geographic information system),\" Dr Tolhurst says. \"We look at the fire characteristics and see if the fire can breach them or will be halted by them. We (also) incorporate the effect of fire suppression on fire spread in an interactive way. This is different to anything else in the world. We can then immediately deploy suppression action, that is, bulldozers, aircraft, water tankers.</p><p>\"Given the suppression resources, are they able to suppress fire at that point? This is important, as suppression is always a part of the fire, and impacts on its spread.\"</p><p>Phoenix uses three main fire models - CSIRO's bushfire and grassland models, and McArthur's forest fire behaviour model - and has significantly improved on these, says Dr Tolhurst.</p><p>\"For example, McArthur's model is used where there is one type of forest, and Phoenix accounts for different fuel type mixes,\" he says.</p><p>Phoenix was developed in Visual Basic (VB.NET) \"because it allows developers to annotate the code comprehensively,\" says Dr Tolhurst.</p><p>\"The US system runs on a mini-super-computer (16processors), but our plan is to get Phoenix on to a server so it can be accessed and run from one location.\"</p><p>Initially the Department of Sustainability and Environment's server will be used, then possibly the Geoscience Australia's server in Canberra.</p><p>Phoenix is not used in all fires as there are not enough skilled operators. In these cases a spreadsheet is used to run the models manually.</p><p>\"We need to train more people,\" Dr Tolhurst says. \"The results of the model are only as good as the operator, who needs experience and a depth of knowledge and understanding about the consequences of various inputs.</p><p>\"We need more resources. There are only 1.1people working on this. The Bushfire CRC (Co-operative Research Centres) funds one programmer and I work on it as support from the University of Melbourne.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO PHOTOS: Fire specialist Kevin Tolhurst.

You so won't want to think before you act, but it's advised that before expressing personal opinions this week you consider how you'd want the same thing said to you.</p><p>Capricorn Dec 22-Jan 20 This whirlwind weekend could shake free some energetic density from any static attitudes, fixed opinions, rigid relationships or stitched up deals you might currently be engaged in. Liberating, eh? This week is a loose cannon - chaotic, all over the place, definitely needing the firm hand of Capricornian organisation, but fighting it all the way. Good luck.</p><p>Aquarius Jan 21-Feb 19 Freedom's your primary requirement this week. If you're finding your lifestyle limited or relationships rigid, don't forget you need the balance of both stability and room to move to be truly happy ... Avoid this week's overheated arguments and you'll enjoy its compensations: exciting conversation, inspiring ideas and quite a flirtatious buzz.</p><p>Pisces Feb 20- Mar 20 Getting involved in the quagmire of other people's problems will be very tiring this weekend, so do something positive for yourself instead, such as revising your outlook on obligations. You'll have enough to deal with this week getting your own philosophical and practical, logical and fanciful selves working together rather than against one another.</p><p>Aries Mar 21-Apr 20 Today's airy full moon is guaranteed to fan your flames, so aim for a controlled burn rather than the full forest-fire effect; be a lover, not a fighter, and spend the weekend with people you care about. This stimulating week will be an exhausting one as well if you don't spend at least some of it relaxing and indulging yourself and those around you.</p><p>Taurus Apr 21-May 21 Today's mutable full moon could loosen up Taurean habit patterns for a lively, energetic social weekend schmoozing with a much more vivid variety of people than usual - and drumming up some extra biz along the way. This week's refusal to play by the rules will test your improvisation skills, but it's good to be stretched; it prevents attitudinal arthritis.</p><p>Gemini May 22-Jun 21 This weekend's annual Gemini full moon shines on family, relatives and close friends who won't be holding back on discussing, disputing and debating all manner of provoking topics. Personal growth and creative endeavours are high priorities this week, so a strictly financial approach won't be anywhere near as attractive as an enhanced lifestyle package.</p><p>Cancer Jun 22-Jul 23 Full moon affects Cancerians more than any other sign. If this weekend brings strained relations with family or friends, the good news is it's all likely to change again almost instantly. If others are going on about wanting their space, don't even think of feeling rejected - it's just that time of year. Don't make a fuss and they'll get over it.</p><p>Leo Jul 24-Aug 23 Restraint is advised during the weekend full moon, majesties. Scattered concentration could cause accidents so don't speed, or do anything at all if you're worked up - except cool down. It's one thing to blaze your own trail and another to be out on your own. If independence is costing you closeness with others this week, perhaps it's getting too expensive?</p><p>Virgo Aug 24-Sep 23 This week's people will flagrantly and shamelessly flaunt all rules of etiquette and decorum over anything they feel strongly about, which is almost everything. They'll be shockingly outspoken then, just when you're about to lose it, and crack you up with something outrageously funny. This is a gift, so enjoy it while it's going.</p><p>Libra Sep 24-Oct 23 The moon's full, Venus is in Libra and this is the perfect weekend for a romantic getaway, far from full-moon madness, social frictions, family spats and domestic obligations. This week is likely to challenge certain beliefs you considered unchangeable, so in the midst of seasonal busyness keep your mind open for what could be quite life-altering ideas.</p><p>Scorpio Oct 24-Nov 22 If powerful emotions get in the way of seeing things objectively this week, taking a break is your most sensible survival strategy - somewhere or with someone who provides enough peace and tranquillity to debrief. Resist the impulse to lash out and say something you might regret. And if that's too hard an ask, don't be slow to say sorry.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DRAWING: By Rocco Fazzari</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-5hjhkubilpg1atfo071m</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4R6B-J1D0-TXN5-S0GD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"784\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>November 24, 2007 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DNKD</classCode><className>SELF IMPROVEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp; LIFESTYLE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Forest fires are an annual problem in Indonesia but the delay in the arrival of monsoon rains, and particularly hot daytime temperatures, has greatly exacerbated the haze problem.</p><p>The Government says at least 20 million Indonesians are being exposed daily to dangerous levels of air pollution and Reuter reported from Kuala Lumpur that children were being sent to school in smoke masks as pollution readings topped 300, on a scale</p><p>which sets 100 as a maximum safe reading.</p><p>Indonesia this morning opened a pollution phone line to give people the direction the fires were moving and visibility conditions. Operators said they were referring callers to health clinics for advice on respiratory problems, dizzyness and sore and itchy eyes associated with the smoke.</p><p>Many of the fires have been deliberately started as a cheap method of land clearing in rice fields and plantations in preparations for the monsoon season, which was due to begin around August but may be another two months away.</p><p>Indonesia has no adequate fire fighting equipment and traditionally relies on heavy tropical rain to extinguish the fires.</p><p>In opening the ASEAN conference Mr Suharto said: \"To the communities of neighboring countries who have been disturbed by the fires in our territory, Indonesia offers its most sincere apologies.\"</p><p>The extent of the smoke haze and the severity of the drought has prompted the Suharto Government to take unprecedented action against logging companies, many of which are politically well connected.</p><p>Officials said 50 timber companies which are suspected of using fire to clear land had been given 15 days to prove their innocence or face the revoking of their timber permit.</p><p>The annual forest fire problem is closely to linked to rapid deforestation in Indonesia because land clearing allows sunlight to enter a tropical forest, encouraging the growth of flammable grasses and shrubs.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Two photos: Smoke alert: Schoolgirls in Malaysia's central Malacca state try to avoid inhaling smoky haze in the streets.

It is certain there are many animals burned and there are many fleeing.</p><p>\"Some people have already killed the orang-utans because they are large animals and they are perceived as a danger by villages. The orang-utans are fleeing the smoke, the fires and the drought.\"</p><p>At least 10 orphaned babies have been rescued by the WWF. It fears the killings of adults may lead to an increase in the illegal trade in babies of the species, which, with the Sumatran tiger and the elephant, is on a list of animals said to be on the brink of extinction.</p><p>Last week in Jambi, one of the worst-hit areas of Sumatra, where thick smoke has blocked out the sun for six weeks, a villager was killed and eaten by a tiger. It was the fifth fatal attack this month.</p><p>Only 500 Sumatran tigers are thought to now inhabit the shrinking forests of Sumatra. Elephants, too, are threatened by both the drought and the fires, their habitat reduced and food sources scarce, prompting raids on village gardens and retaliation by farmers.</p><p>Several stampedes by Sumatran elephants have been reported in recent weeks. One farmer has been killed and vast tracts of farmland destroyed.</p><p>Estimates of how much land has been damaged during the dry season's forest fire crisis range from 300,000 hectares (the Indonesian Government) to 800,000 hectares (the WWF).</p><p>Of more importance to Indonesia's threatened wildlife is what has happened to the country's protected forests, the last refuge from intensive forest clearing and plantation development.</p><p>The Forestry Ministry has estimated that 26,000 hectares of virgin, conservation forest have been lost. Under Indonesian land-use policies, large tracts of forests are allocated for clearing every year, forcing threatened species into smaller and smaller forests.</p><p>Government statistics show 7.3 million hectares of rainforest have been cleared since 1983, and clearing is averaging 500,000 hectares a year.</p><p>Indonesia's rarest animal is the rhinoceros, with only 47 remaining in Java and 250 in Sumatra.</p><p>Birds, too, have been hard hit by the shrinking forests and the commercial trade in rare species, with only 200 remaining maleos, a peacock-like bird, fewer than 200 rare starlings and about 500 Mollucan cockatoos.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhvq4c2t9gmwi2i7qz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P85-12R0-TXN5-R2NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"562\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 11, 1997 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"82\"><className>WORLD WILDLIFE FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>WORLD WIDE FUND FOR NATURE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Indonesia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Nature/Endangered Extinct Species</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accidents And Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Emergency Services Authority of Western Australia.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Bushfire Cooperative Research Centre warns of the potential for above-normal bushfire activity across the middle of Australia, with grass fires posing the biggest risk this season.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We need to be particularly vigilant this year because grass fires start very easily, particularly once the grass is what's termed cured,\" Bushfire CRC deputy CEO and research director Richard Thornton said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"They can start very easily, they travel very rapidly and are very difficult to warn about,\" Dr Thornton said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Bushfire expert and former CSIRO principal research scientist David Packham believes huge grass fires are almost a certainty in the centre of Australia, if not this year then next year.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The centre, as everybody knows, has had heaps of rain, there's heaps of growth and they are going to have heaps of fires,\" Mr Packham said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"I would expect massive fires in the centre.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Several fires have already broken out in central Australia, which doesn't have a fire season every year.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Central Australia is a slightly unusual event, this is probably a one-in-30-year event in central Australia,\" Bushfires Northern Territory director Steve Sutton said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Central Australia is likely to continue with fires right through until the autumn, and we will have fires for most of that time,\" Mr Sutton said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Central Australia's variable winds can fan fire fronts spread over as much as 70 kilometres, he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Grass fires can develop into quite significant fires in a matter of minutes, ACT Rural Fire Service chief officer Andrew Stark warned.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Days of low humidity and strong winds bring an increased risk of bad grass fires, bringing trees down on power lines.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"So many times right across Australia whenever you see one grass fire occurring in an area often you get a number of grass fires, and that'll be the challenge,\" Mr Stark said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Experts say the general trend is that if there's a serious grass season, it's usually a mild forest fire season.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But as Victoria knows only too well after the Black Saturday bushfires, the bush can be just as volatile.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"With the right weather conditions coming together - dry, hot, windy conditions - you're going to get a bushfire risk, you're going to get a grass fire risk under those conditions,\" NSW Rural Fire Brigade Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 In Western Australia, 80 per cent of the state faces the potential for above-average bushfire activity, much of it in grassland and pastoral areas in more isolated locations.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But Mr Arnol said a key issue remained the forested \"urban interface\" area in the south-west corner despite the forecast of normal bushfire activity there.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"A normal activity in our lower south-west still means that we will be facing the potential for significant fires - coastal, heathland and forest,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 While the soil is moist in forested areas, it will only take a run of very hot days to quickly dry out the forests.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"There's still a big risk,\" Dr Thornton said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"You should never be complacent of fire, particularly in Victoria or in NSW or any of those really hot places because forest fires are always a possibility.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"But this year particularly, grass fires will be a bigger issue than they have been in the past.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Dr Thornton says the Bushfire CRC's reports are not a prediction that there will be fires but that there is a greater likelihood of fires.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 There are no crystal balls to say how the season will actually pan out, South Australian Country Fire Service manager operations services Rob Sandford said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 And no-one can control the weather.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"If we get hot, really dry, windy weather, that will increase the risk because of the fuel loads right across the state and right across the nation,\" Mr Sandford said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Outback station owners, who've already been through tough times with the drought, will be in the frontline if there are major fires across the centre, Mr Packham said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But he said many were probably \"on their knees\" and not in a position to buy graders and to have sufficient people around to deal with the fires.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The fires are fast-moving. These people know how to deal with them, it's just that they haven't got the resources,\" Mr Packham said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"They need government assistance ... to have sufficient resources to be able to deal with them.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Fire authorities have been talking about the risks this fire season, but the concern is that memories have faded since the last bad grass fire season, and for some reason the community thinks a grass fire isn't as bad as a bushfire.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"A lot of people say it's only a grass fire. It can travel very very rapidly, it can change direction very rapidly and can catch people by surprise,\" Dr Thornton said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Sandford said everyone needed a bushfire action plan even if they think they don't live in a bushfire-prone area, saying people who live in the suburbs around Australia will at some stage drive through a fire zone.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"People that live there need one, but everyone needs one to ensure their best chances of survival,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"History shows that bushfires are a huge threat in the community and tragically people do die when these events occur.\"</pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:53X9-M2N1-DYG0-91B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1101\"/><timeReceived>11:02 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Australian Associated Press Pty.

Victor Korin, 22, was questioned by Sunshine Coast Juvenile Aid Bureau chief detective Sen Sgt Chris Lill near Bega in New South Wales on Thursday and extradited on Friday. The toddler, Paul Robert Homer, died in a Brisbane hospital's intensive care unit. Crash injures two THE driver and a passenger of a car were treated in Royal Brisbane Hospital yesterday for injuries received when their vehicle ran out of control and crashed into a house on Kedron Brook Road, Wilston, about 12.45am. The injuries and damage to the property were not thought to be serious. Cyclone alert THE remote West Australian town of Derby has been warned to brace itself for winds of 110km/h or higher after tropical cyclone Chloe crossed the coast in the far north-east of Western Australia yesterday. The Weather Bureau said Chloe was moving inland in a general southerly direction and, and on its present course, would pass about 80km north-east of Derby. Wind gusts could reach 190km/h at the cyclone's centre, but the area the cyclone is passing through is reported to be uninhabited. Population rise THE Tweed Shire covering the New South Wales/Queensland border has increased its population by about 2000 _ making it one of the fastest-growing regions in NSW. The population grew from 55,440 to 57,190 from June 1992 to June 1993, according to recent figures from the Statistics Bureau. Curfew debate A BRISBANE University lecturer has entered the vexed Sunshine Coast nightclub curfew debate claiming earlier closure would not solve booze related problems such as street crime and vandalism. Mooloolaba and Noosa, two of the coast's biggest nightclub players, close their doors at 3am and the squeeze is on from locals for a midnight shutdown. Blitz on thefts SUNSHINE Coast police have launched a blitz on thefts from cars after statistics showed 261 were broken into on the coast last month, including well organised hit-and-run raids by motorbike riders lying in wait for tourists at National Parks and in beach car parks. Police appealed to visitors not to leave valuables in their vehicles. 29 children die A FOREST fire whipped by fierce winds has killed 29 primary-school children on an excursion in northern China, local officials said yesterday. The children died on April 6 when the fire erupted on a mountain in Huairen county in northern Shanxi province, an official said. Test lab to open A HEAVY structures testing laboratory capable of testing full-size bridge girders, will be opened at Griffith University's Gold Coast campus. The opening comes after increased demand for university staff who have previously tested heavy construction objects for the Gold Coast City Council. Fashion awards UP and coming creative talent will be celebrated this week when the 1995 Gold Coast Fashion Designer Awards are handed out. The awards, held at Conrad Jupiters Casino, are organised by the Gold Coast Welfare Committee, with all proceeds going to charity.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-NEWSMMGLSTRY000131989104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML1995</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F7D-FNM3-RSSD-R3PS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"521\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1995 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>4 - GOLD COAST</edition><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>April 9, 1995 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001182</classCode><className>MURDER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001763</classCode><className>TROPICAL STORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp;
