As a form of punishment and/or therapy, she's assigned to stay in a remote observation tower that commands jaw-dropping views of sweeping wilderness, to keep watch for tell-tale smoke plumes.</p><p>Heading her way along a winding forest road is forensic accountant Owen Casserly (Jake Weber) and his 12-year-old son Connor (Finn Little). Owen fears for his life having exposed the financial misdeeds of some powerful people, and hot on his trail are ruthless father-and-son assassins Jack (Aidan Gillen) and Patrick (Nicholas Hoult).</p><p>The film is a cracker, but some may find it strikes too close to home. Sheridan likes to put kids in peril to raise the stakes, and here, that extends to a character who is six months pregnant. When one of the villains deliberately lights a forest fire and pauses to observe his handiwork with obvious pleasure, it's stomach-churning stuff.</p><p>Sheridan's previous film, Wind River, was a thriller set among the icy wastes of a Native American reservation, in which the dangers of extreme cold drove the storyline - roughly the opposite of the infernal situation here.</p><p>He essentially makes modern-day westerns, with epic showdowns in savage, frontier-like environments. Here he's adapting a novel by prolific thriller writer Michael Koryta, and it's not quite as rich an experience as the one offered in his own original screenplays (including the two Sicario movies and Oscar nominee Hell or High Water).</p><p>We never learn very much about what sparked all this chaos, so there are no deeper themes at play than a fight for survival.</p><p>The characters aren't especially deep but they're well played: standouts are Jon Bernthal as a brave local sheriff and Medina Senghore his even more valiant wife.</p><p>Brisbane-born Little, who starred in 2018's Storm Boy, is a sympathetic young fugitive, and Weber is touching as the father caught in an impossibly stressful situation.</p><p>Those Who Wish Me Dead is now showing in cinemas Vicky Roach is on leave</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-HeraldSun20210516HeraldSunTV14000444953008</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62P3-1CR1-F0JP-W4DK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"443\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSunTV Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 16, 2021 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009V8J</classCode><className>MYSTERY &amp;

By crow, the Wolgan Valley is less than 100km from the outskirts of Sydney, yet it is now one of the most isolated places in Australia. In November last year, the Lithgow council closed the Wolgan Gap Rd because of landslides. It has been closed ever since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Businesses have folded, livelihoods have been ruined, cattle are stranded, farms and houses are unsellable and Australia's most expensive hotel, the $160m Emirates One&amp;Only Wolgan Valley resort has closed its doors and 90 staff have been made redundant. It could be years before a new road is open to cars and trucks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Late in 2019, the region was terrorised by the Gosper's Mountain fire. More than a million hectares were engulfed in Australia's biggest forest fire and dozens of houses were destroyed. Then came the rains, like never before. Across a rolling 12-month period, the area had 21/2 times as much rain as they'd had since records began in the 1800s.</p><p>The mountain gave way. On November 9 last year, the Wolgan Gap Rd was closed. Massive tension cracks had developed - 40m in length, 2m deep and 600mm wide - which could give way at any time. If that happened, tens of thousands of tonnes of soil and rock would cascade down the mountain. It's now closed forever because of the likelihood of \"catastrophic collapse\".</p><p>The Wolgan Valley Association has been told it may have to hand back a million-dollar federal grant (to be matched by $1m from the NSW government) to build a new community fire shelter. They are unlikely to be able to spend the money in the allotted period because, of course, the road is closed and they can't get supplies and equipment in.</p><p>The disaster in the Wolgan Valley raises questions about the viability of living in certain parts of Australia. With the onset of more extreme weather, will some areas of the country simply become too expensive, or too dangerous, for human habitation?</p><p>Naturally rugged To get to the grandeur of the Wolgan Valley, you take a right at the old Wallerawang Power Station, north of Lithgow, where two towering chimneys once loomed. Before they were felled a couple of years ago, these chimneys belched six million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year for 60-odd years.</p><p>It was not far from here that a brilliant young Englishman first pencilled an idea that would lead to a revolution in human thought. In 1836, after sailing into Sydney Harbour on the HMS Beagle, 26-year-old Charles Darwin saddled-up for an 11-day adventure into the Blue Mountains.</p><p>After a few days of rugged riding the young scientist bunked at the homestead at Wallerawang (pastoral) Station and on the morning of January 19, he was taken down into the magnificent Wolgan Valley by an affable Scot called Andrew Browne. Hemmed in by dramatic sandstone cliffs, the Wolgan Valley had a Jurassic feel to it, like a secret, primeval kingdom. It was somewhere to the north of this valley that the Wollemi pine would be discovered.</p><p>The creatures Darwin encountered in the Wolgan that day in 1836 were equally wondrous and foreign to him. After riding up and out of the valley in the afternoon, he chanced upon a paddle of platypuses \"diving and playing\" in the Cox's River. Browne shot one of the strange creatures so Darwin could examine it. \"Certainly it is the most extraordinary animal,\" Darwin wrote.</p><p>He noted that platypus occupied the same ecological niche as the European water vole, but that it was a vastly different creature. \"Earlier in the evening I had been lying on a sunny bank &amp; was reflecting on the strange character of the Animals of this country as compared to the rest of the World,\" Darwin penned in his journal. \"A Disbeliever in everything beyond his own reason, might exclaim, 'Surely two distinct Creators must have been (at) work'; their object however has been the same &amp; certainly in each case the end is complete.\" Why would a supreme being create vastly different species on different continents to essentially fulfil the same ecological function, Darwin pondered?</p><p>\"It was here that Charles Darwin questioned Creationism for the first time,\" Chris Darwin, a descendant of the great thinker, who now lives in the Blue Mountains, told Smithsonian Magazine. \"He came out of the closet, basically.\" He sees it as a moment akin to Isaac Newton observing an apple fall from a tree.</p><p>Professor Frank Nicholas, co-author of Charles Darwin in Australia, says that while it was an important moment in the evolution of natural history, it was not the Eureka moment some make it out to be. \"It was the first time he put to paper these thoughts,\" Nicholas tells me. \"But it was just one early step along a very long path that, more than 20 years later, resulted in his book (The Origin of Species).\" Still, his descent into the Wolgan Valley, and his jottings that afternoon, were incredibly significant.</p><p>Darwin also made observations about the rugged terrain. \"These valleys, which so long presented an insuperable barrier to the attempts of the most enterprising of the colonists to reach the interior, are most remarkable,\" he wrote of the sheer sandstone cliffs that rise like prison walls around the valley.</p><p>\"When cattle are driven into the valley of the Wolgan by a path (which I descended), partly natural and partly made by the owner of the land, they cannot escape; for this valley is in every other part surrounded by perpendicular cliffs, and eight miles lower down, it contracts from an average width of half a mile, to a mere chasm, impassable to man or beast.\" And now, 187 years later, the Wolgan Valley is again insuperable and virtually impassable to man or beast. The natural contour that Darwin likely followed down into the valley, the Wolgan Gap Rd, has been closed for a year. The 30-odd landholders in the 25km-long valley are victims of what Darwin's scientific successors say are extreme weather events brought about by those smoke stacks at Wallerawang, and elsewhere.</p><p>End of a dream \"The whole thing has just worn us down and for us not to want to be here any more,\" says Darren Denmead, sitting on a couch in his living room with those enormous cliffs looming out through the window. \"This has always been our dream place to live and all of a sudden it's not.\" When the council closed the Wolgan Gap Rd last November the only access into the valley was via a precarious old fire trail called the Old Coach Rd, which was built early last century during the construction of a now disused railway line and tunnel.</p><p>The rail line serviced the old shale oil refinery at Newnes in the Wolgan Valley and the tunnel is now the Glow Worm Tunnel.</p><p>A council four-wheel-drive would lead a convoy of four other vehicles in and out, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, up the Old Coach Rd.

She had been running a successful tourism business, taking small groups on walking tours around the Wolgan. Her business was decimated by the fires and then, when the rains came and the road collapsed, it became impossible to continue. \"It was heartbreaking,\" she says. \"I am incredibly passionate about what I do, being able to share this incredible part of the world with other people.\" She says that with climate change there are only going to be more extreme weather events and governments need to adapt. She cites the fact that the community could lose its $2m grant for a community centre/fire shelter because they don't fit into the right box. \"It's ludicrous,\" she says. \"It was a recommendation from all those inquiries (into the bushfires) that communities be more prepared \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 we were doing that, and now we may lose our funding to build a fire shelter.\"</p><p>A road too far The general manager of Lithgow City Council, Craig Butler, says: \"There's no quick and easy solution.\" Butler is proud of what the council has achieved with the construction of the Donkey Steps. \"We got that approved and (constructed) in a record time,\" he says. It's a small council with only 230 staff servicing 22,000 residents over an enormous area.</p><p>\"We can't build the road back where it was originally built - it's too dangerous - and so we have to build a whole new road through the most wondrous country and there is only one throat through which you can logically create a road,\" he says.</p><p>Even though the council is responsible for the road, it simply doesn't have the resources, the equipment or the expertise, which is why consultants from Sydney have been called in to design a new route. They are now looking at different designs and costs. \"The guesstimate is above $30m but we don't know how far above $30m.\" Assurances have been given by the state and commonwealth governments that it will be funded.</p><p>As to how long it will take: \"We are at a point where we can't be specific, but it is certainly a multi-year project.\" The council told residents it had identified three possible routes. They were not told how long it would be before they could drive on it.</p><p>Butler says that with increasingly severe weather events there needs to be a different model to allow councils to cope with the catastrophic outcomes. \"One wonders about the model, going forward,\" he says. \"I'm not sure that the various forms of government have enough fast twitch muscles for the effects of climate change.\" The federal Minister for Emergency Management, Murray Watt, recently announced that Andrew Colvin, who led the recovery efforts after the Black Summer Bushfires, would conduct an independent review into more effective funding arrangements \"in the face of increasingly frequent and more severe natural disasters\".</p><p>\"We know communities are best placed to tell us what is and isn't working from within the disaster management funding,\" Watt says. \"Those impacted by disasters \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 will be encouraged to have their say through an extensive consultation process.\" If they are looking for a case study, Colvin should brave the Donkey Steps and head down into the Wolgan. It is Watt's department that has been threatening to withdraw the funding from the Wolgan Valley Association to build its new fire shelter.</p><p>Holding on to hope Thomas Ebersoll has loved the Wolgan from the moment he stepped into the valley back in 1998, on a bushwalking and camping trip. On that trip there was a sign outside the old, dilapidated Newnes Hotel on a steel picket which read \"For sale, inquire within\". He couldn't resist.</p><p>The hotel, which was closed then and is now Ebersoll's house, had been the drinking hole for the workers at the Newnes shale oil refinery - a massive industrial complex built in the early part of last century. The ruins are in the forest, a few kilometres down the river from the hotel.</p><p>In those 25 years he has built four simple but beautiful cabins, which he rents out, along with camping spaces along the river. The sign out the front says: \"Everything money can't buy.\" His business has been decimated by the road closure. People can still get in, by four wheel drive, but he has to let in every guest, and accompany them down the Donkey Steps. It's a 50km trip, there and back, for every guest.</p><p>\"I've lost about 80 per cent of my cabin business,\" he says. \"It's picking up a bit because people appreciate the quiet and the seclusion.\" He's lost virtually all his camping business.</p><p>Ebersoll is in his late 60s and all the cleaning, the maintenance, the mowing and the chopping of wood was getting too much. He was exhausted and ready to sell. \"I had made inquiries with the local real estate agent and he was about to set up a 'worldwide' campaign to market it,\" he says.</p><p>And then the road closed. In the early part of last century a tunnel was cut through the mountain, he says, and 52km of rail track laid, by hand, to service the shale oil refinery and mine, just down the river from the hotel. Back then, it took 16 months and it opened in 1907. \"I'm 68,\" Ebersoll says. \"It's a good time to move on, but it'll probably be five to 10 years before we have a new road. I hope I can hold out till then.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-f5047ef6790e11ee872f990ee5d13f68a0c1a573e88e0d405f6f986779dc56c7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69JD-D1P1-F0JP-W075-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2987\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 4, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000512</classCode><className>DISMISSALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp; ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000313</classCode><className>CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000813</classCode><className>GRANTS &amp; GIFTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N721110MM</classCode><className>RESORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000851</classCode><className>HIGHWAYS &amp; STREETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A3C5</classCode><className>GREAT DIVIDING RANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GS005</classCode><className>NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

By crow, the Wolgan Valley is less than 100km from the outskirts of Sydney, yet it is now one of the most isolated places in Australia. In November last year, the Lithgow council closed the Wolgan Gap Rd because of landslides. It has been closed ever since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Businesses have folded, livelihoods have been ruined, cattle are stranded, farms and houses are unsellable and Australia's most expensive hotel, the $160m Emirates<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/travel/oneonly-resorts-to-open-new-property-in-montenegro/news-story/ab05c690c99268bf738ee07dcb04b3d8\">One&amp;Only</url> Wolgan Valley resort has closed its doors and 90 staff have been made redundant.

More than a million hectares were engulfed in Australia's biggest forest fire and dozens of houses were destroyed. Then came the rains, like never before. Across a rolling 12-month period, the area had 2\u00bd times as much rain as they'd had since records began in the 1800s. </p><p>The mountain gave way. On November 9 last year, the Wolgan Gap Rd was closed. Massive tension cracks had developed - 40m in length, 2m deep and 600mm wide - which could give way at any time. If that happened, tens of thousands of tonnes of soil and rock would cascade down the mountain. It's now closed forever because of the likelihood of \"catastrophic collapse\". </p><p>The Wolgan Valley Association has been told it may have to hand back a million-dollar federal grant (to be matched by $1m from the NSW government) to build a new community fire shelter. They are unlikely to be able to spend the money in the allotted period because, of course, the road is closed and they can't get supplies and equipment in. </p><p>The disaster in the Wolgan Valley raises questions about the viability of living in certain parts of Australia. With the onset of more extreme weather, will some areas of the country simply become too expensive, or too dangerous, for human habitation?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Naturally rugged</emphasis></p><p>To get to the grandeur of the Wolgan Valley, you take a right at the old Wallerawang Power Station, north of Lithgow, where two towering chimneys once loomed. Before they were felled a couple of years ago, these chimneys belched six million tonnes of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year for 60-odd years. </p><p>It was not far from here that a brilliant young Englishman first pencilled an idea that would lead to a revolution in human thought. In 1836, after sailing into Sydney Harbour on the HMS Beagle, 26-year-old Charles Darwin saddled up for an 11-day adventure into the Blue Mountains.</p><p>After a few days' rugged riding, the young scientist bunked at the homestead at Wallerawang (pastoral) Station and on the morning of January 19, he was taken down into the magnificent Wolgan Valley by an affable Scot called Andrew Browne. Hemmed in by dramatic sandstone cliffs, the Wolgan Valley had a Jurassic feel to it, like a secret, primeval kingdom. It was somewhere to the north of this valley that the Wollemi pine would be discovered. </p><p>The creatures Darwin encountered in the Wolgan that day in 1836 were equally wondrous and foreign to him. After riding up and out of the valley in the afternoon, he chanced upon a paddle of platypuses \"diving and playing\" in the Cox's River. Browne shot one of the strange creatures so Darwin could examine it. </p><p>\"Certainly it is the most extraordinary animal,\" Darwin wrote.</p><p>He noted that platypus occupied the same ecological niche as the European water vole, but that it was a vastly different creature. \"Earlier in the evening I had been lying on a sunny bank &amp; was reflecting on the strange character of the Animals of this country as compared to the rest of the World,\" Darwin penned in his journal. \"A Disbeliever in everything beyond his own reason, might exclaim, 'Surely two distinct Creators must have been (at) work'; their object however has been the same &amp; certainly in each case the end is complete.\" </p><p>Why would a supreme being create vastly different species on different continents to essentially fulfil the same ecological function, Darwin pondered?</p><p>\"It was here that Charles Darwin questioned Creationism for the first time,\" Chris Darwin, a descendant of the great thinker, who now lives in the Blue Mountains, told Smithsonian Magazine. \"He came out of the closet, basically.\" He sees it as a moment akin to Isaac Newton observing an apple fall from a tree.</p><p>Professor Frank Nicholas, co-author of Charles Darwin in Australia, says that while it was an important moment in the evolution of natural history, it was not the Eureka moment some make it out to be. \"It was the first time he put to paper these thoughts,\" Nicholas tells me. \"But it was just one early step along a very long path that, more than 20 years later, resulted in his book (The Origin of Species).\" Still, his descent into the Wolgan Valley, and his jottings that afternoon, were incredibly significant.</p><p>Darwin also made observations about the rugged terrain. \"These valleys, which so long presented an insuperable barrier to the attempts of the most enterprising of the colonists to reach the interior, are most remarkable,\" he wrote of the sheer sandstone cliffs that rise like prison walls around the valley. </p><p>\"When cattle are driven into the valley of the Wolgan by a path (which I descended), partly natural and partly made by the owner of the land, they cannot escape; for this valley is in every other part surrounded by perpendicular cliffs, and eight miles lower down, it contracts from an average width of half a mile, to a mere chasm, impassable to man or beast.\"</p><p>And now, 187 years later, the Wolgan Valley is again insuperable and virtually impassable to man or beast. The natural contour that Darwin likely followed down into the valley, the Wolgan Gap Rd, has been closed for a year. The 30-odd landholders in the 25km-long valley are victims of what Darwin's scientific successors say are extreme weather events brought about by those smoke stacks at Wallerawang, and elsewhere.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">End of a dream</emphasis></p><p>\"The whole thing has just worn us down and for us not to want to be here any more,\" says Darren Denmead, sitting on a couch in his living room with those enormous cliffs looming out through the window. \"This has always been our dream place to live and all of a sudden it's not.\" </p><p>When the council closed the Wolgan Gap Rd last November the only access into the valley was via a precarious old fire trail called the Old Coach Rd, which was built early last century during the construction of a now disused railway line and tunnel. The rail line serviced the old shale oil refinery at Newnes in the Wolgan Valley and the tunnel is now the Glow Worm Tunnel.</p><p>A council four-wheel-drive would lead a convoy of four other vehicles in and out, once in the morning and once in the afternoon, up the Old Coach Rd. For those lucky enough to be in the convoy, it turned a 45-minute trip into Lithgow into a 1\u00be-hour slog. </p><p>Meanwhile, a new, temporary road - the Donkey Steps - was hastily built down a steep section, on the opposite side of the valley to where the Wolgan Gap Rd descends. It opened in March this year. The road, just a few degrees off being one of the steepest public roads in the world, is closed to all vehicles apart from four-wheel drives. It's too steep for trucks. It's locked and any visitors have to be let in and accompanied by a resident.</p><p>It became such a hassle for Denmead, who was the principal of a primary school in Bathurst, that he relinquished his role at the beginning of term two and went on long service leave. His wife, Sarah, has had a long association with the valley. Her great-grandfather was a Cobb and Co coach driver who braved the Wolgan Gap early last century. Her family has owned this farm, the Corn Paddock, since the 1940s. </p><p>They've not been able to run stock on their farm because the fences were destroyed by the fires. Darren Denmead has been slashing his fallow paddocks in an attempt to mitigate the fire risk as they now face another ominous fire season.</p><p>His big fear is that the Emirates resort will simply shut up shop, for good. \"If they go we've got no voice at all,\" he says. \"The importance of (the resort's) clout, politically, has probably kept us in the game.\" </p><p>Denmead says the government response to their plight - local, state and federal - has been woeful, and they keep getting bounced between various agencies, with none taking responsibility.</p><p>Living through the bushfires was terrifying for all of them. \"Thinking you were going to die was pretty ordinary, I can tell you,\" he says.</p><p>Then came the rains.

She cites the fact that the community could lose its $2m grant for a community centre/fire shelter because they don't fit into the right box. \"It's ludicrous,\" she says. \"It was a recommendation from all those inquiries (into the bushfires) that communities be more prepared ... we were doing that, and now we may lose our funding to build a fire shelter.\"</p><p>A road too far</p><p>The general manager of Lithgow City Council, Craig Butler, says: \"There's no quick and easy solution.\" Butler is proud of what the council has achieved with the construction of the Donkey Steps. \"We got that approved and (constructed) in a record time,\" he says. It's a small council with only 230 staff servicing 22,000 residents over an enormous area.</p><p>\"We can't build the road back where it was originally built - it's too dangerous - and so we have to build a whole new road through the most wondrous country and there is only one throat through which you can logically create a road,\" he says. </p><p>Even though the council is responsible for the road, it simply doesn't have the resources, the equipment or the expertise, which is why consultants from Sydney have been called in to design a new route. They are now looking at different designs and costs. \"The guesstimate is above $30m but we don't know how far above $30m.\" Assurances have been given by the state and commonwealth governments that it will be funded. </p><p>As to how long it will take: \"We are at a point where we can't be specific, but it is certainly a multi-year project.\"</p><p>The council told residents it had identified three possible routes. They were not told how long it would be before they could drive on it.</p><p>Butler says that with increasingly severe weather events there needs to be a different model to allow councils to cope with the catastrophic outcomes. \"One wonders about the model, going forward,\" he says. \"I'm not sure that the various forms of government have enough fast twitch muscles for the effects of climate change.\"</p><p>Federal Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt recently announced that Andrew Colvin, who led the recovery efforts after the Black Summer Bushfires, would conduct an independent review into more effective funding arrangements \"in the face of increasingly frequent and more severe natural disasters\".</p><p>\"We know communities are best placed to tell us what is and isn't working from within the disaster management funding,\" Watt says. \"Those impacted by disasters ... will be encouraged to have their say through an extensive consultation process.\"</p><p>If they are looking for a case study, Colvin should brave the Donkey Steps and head down into the Wolgan. It is Watt's department that has been threatening to withdraw the funding from the Wolgan Valley Association to build its new fire shelter. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holding on to hope</emphasis></p><p>Thomas Ebersoll has loved the Wolgan from the moment he stepped into the valley back in 1998, on a bushwalking and camping trip. On that trip there was a sign outside the old, dilapidated Newnes Hotel on a steel picket which read \"For sale, inquire within\". He couldn't resist.</p><p>The hotel, which was closed then and is now Ebersoll's house, had been the drinking hole for the workers at the Newnes shale oil refinery - a massive industrial complex built in the early part of last century. The ruins are in the forest, a few kilometres down the river from the hotel.</p><p>In those 25 years he has built four simple but beautiful cabins, which he rents out, along with camping spaces along the river. The sign out the front says: \"Everything money can't buy.\"</p><p>His business has been decimated by the road closure. People can still get in, by four wheel drive, but he has to let in every guest, and accompany them down the Donkey Steps. It's a 50km trip, there and back, for every guest.</p><p> \"I've lost about 80 per cent of my cabin business,\" he says. \"It's picking up a bit because people appreciate the quiet and the seclusion.\" He's lost virtually all his camping business.</p><p>Ebersoll is in his late 60s and all the cleaning, the maintenance, the mowing and the chopping of wood was getting too much. He was exhausted and ready to sell. \"I had made inquiries with the local real estate agent and he was about to set up a 'worldwide' campaign to market it,\" he says.</p><p>And then the road closed.</p><p>In the early part of last century a tunnel was cut through the mountain, he says, and 52km of rail track laid, by hand, to service the shale oil refinery and mine, just down the river from the hotel. Back then, it took 16 months and it opened in 1907. </p><p>\"I'm 68,\" Ebersoll says. \"It's a good time to move on, but it'll probably be five to 10 years before we have a new road. Ihope I can hold out till then.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

As of yesterday, Dartmouth Dam, in the state's north-east, was at 99 per cent capacity, while Lake Glenmaggie, in Gippsland, was at 91 per cent.</p><p>Country Fire Authority chief officer Jason Heffernan said the wet weather might delay the start of bushfire season but warned people against becoming complacent, noting grass fires would be a threat, particularly in the state's west through the harvest and grain belt areas.</p><p>\"You need to prepare for fires, but you also need to prepare for floods and storm events,\" he said. \"It won't be uncommon, I would suspect, throughout this high-risk weather season to see fires burning in some parts of the state, and floods occurring in others.\"</p><p>The new, simplified fire danger rating system was devised using improved scientific knowledge on fuel types and weather conditions, and is expected to provide more accurate fire forecasts in summer.</p><p>A new fire behaviour index, published by the Bureau of Meteorology, will provide a 100-point scale of potential fire behaviour based on fuel and weather conditions. When the risk is not categorised as either moderate, high, extreme, or catastrophic, a \"no rating\" basis will apply, meaning no safety action is necessary.</p><p>The danger categories will require residents in affected areas to take the corresponding course of action, from preparing a fire plan during moderate conditions, to acting to protect their life and property when conditions are rated catastrophic.</p><p>Unlike the old system, which made its predictions by considering only two fuel types, the new ratings will account for eight different Australian vegetation fuel types: forest, grassland, savanna, spinifex, shrubland, mallee heath, button grass and pine. All types, except spinifex and button grass, are found in Victoria.</p><p>The system will also provide longer-term outlooks for emergency services about what fire behaviour might be like months ahead of time and will be used to inform decisions such as fire bans or burn-offs.</p><p>The changes were recommended following the 2019-20 bushfire season and come into effect Australia-wide on September 1.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said, as one of the most bushfire-prone areas in the world, Victoria would benefit from the new system.</p><p>Heffernan said research showed the old system was confusing for people, who \"didn't quite know how to connect the fire danger rating to what action they should be taking on the ground\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7mj3aa7ci4110trsrpw</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:668K-3XM1-F0J6-J4TD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"580\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Using improved scientific knowledge on fuel types and weather conditions, it will provide more accurate fire forecasts in summer.</p><p>A new fire behaviour index, published by the Bureau of Meteorology, will provide a 100-point scale of potential fire behaviour based on fuel and weather conditions. It will categorise the risk as either moderate, high, extreme, or catastrophic. At all other times, it will operate on a \"no rating\" basis, meaning people won't be required to take any action to protect their safety.</p><p>Each category will require residents in affected areas to take a different course of action, from preparing a fire plan during moderate conditions, to acting to protect their life and property in the event of a catastrophic blaze.</p><p>Unlike the old system, which based predictions on only two fuel types, the new ratings will be based on eight different Australian vegetation fuel types: forest, grassland, savanna, spinifex, shrubland, mallee heath, button grass and pine. All vegetation types, except spinifex and button grass, are found in Victoria.</p><p>The system will also provide longer-term outlooks for emergency services about what fire behaviour might be like months ahead of time and will be used to inform decisions such as fire bans or burn-offs.</p><p>The changes were informed by the experience of the 2019-20 bushfire season. They will come into effect Australia-wide on September 1, providing a single warning system across all states and territories.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said Victoria was among the most bushfire-prone areas in the world and would benefit from the new system.</p><p>\"It provides government and industry with better decision-making tools and builds a truly national system,\" Hardman said. \"Fires do not respect boundaries. The establishment of this national system will make a really significant improvement to how we communicate what the particular risks are at any given time to the community.\"</p><p>CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said social research nationwide showed the old system was confusing for people, who \"didn't quite know how to connect the fire danger rating to what action they should be taking on the ground\".</p><p>He said the new system came with a clear call to action, so the community would know what to do, not only during an emergency but also to prepare in the lead-up to bushfire season.</p><p>The old signs will be gradually replaced with the new four-tier system leading into the summer months, starting with bushfire-prone areas.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Get to the heart of what's happening with climate change and the environment.

compared\u00a0to the same time a year ago,\u00a0meteorologists said, warning of a stormy weekend that could add to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-06-30/heatwave-kills-dozens-in-canada-us/100255480\">a worsening situation</url>in the western part of the nation.</p><p>More than 710,000 lightning strikes were recorded in British Columbia and western Alberta between 3:00pm on Wednesday and 6:00am on Thursday.</p><p>This is up from an average 8,300 from the same period over the past five years, said meteorologist Chris Vagasky.</p><p>The Pacific province of British Columbia has been recovering from the grip of an unprecedented heatwave.</p><p>It has caused 719 confirmed deaths, three times more than what would normally occur in the same time period, according to the province's\u00a0coroner.</p><p>During the heatwave, the town of Lytton broke a Canadian temperature record that had stood for more than 80 years, with 49.6 degrees Celsius.</p><p>A forest fire that started on Wednesday razed Lytton to the ground, causing two deaths.\u00a0</p><p>British Columbia usually accounts for about 5 per cent\u00a0of Canada's total lighting strikes each year, but had\u00a0reported its annual number in less than 48 hours, Mr Vagasky said.</p><p>\"It's comparable to what you would typically see on some of the bigger lightning days in really lightning-prone regions of the United States, like Texas or Oklahoma,\" Mr Vagasky said.</p><p>He added that it was unheard of for a region like British Columbia.</p><p>The high number of lightning strikes was caused, in part, by the heatwave,\u00a0said Jonathan Bau, a meteorologist with Environment and Climate Change Canada.</p><p>He explained that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2021-07-01/canada-us-northwest-brace-for-wildfires-heatwave/100258250\">the higher temperatures</url>\u00a0created high levels of moisture in the atmosphere in the form of melting snow and evaporation of water from vegetation, fuelling\u00a0unusually fierce thunderstorms.</p><p>\u00a0\"We're not in the middle of summer where everything's dried out,\" Mr Bau said, adding that more lightning was forecast for the weekend.</p><p>The strikes caused several forest fires across central British Columbia, with 136 fires burning as of Friday afternoon, officials said at a briefing.</p><p>The fires are expected to burn through 100,000 hectares\u00a0by the end of the weekend, officials said, a significantly higher figure than by this point in previous years.</p><p>British Columbia does not usually see its forest fire season ramp up until late July.</p><p>More than 1,300 households\u00a0have been ordered to evacuate, and it is not known how many people are missing.</p><p>The Red Cross is running a phone line for family reunions, officials said.</p><p>Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau pledged that the federal government

Col was known as a \"true bushman\" and dedicated member of Belowra RFS for 40-years.</p><p>In the neighbouring bush village of Nerrigundah, another tragic story of an unsuccessful escape was heard.</p><p>John Smith, 71, left his Batemans Bay home to prepare his property at Nerrigundah the day before his fate.</p><p>The court heard on September 9 that John's car crashed into a tree, and that he attempted to escape on foot but couldn't outrun the fire on December 31.</p><p>His burnt-out car was discovered three days later. At that stage, his remains were not yet found and a search began with RFS and Police.</p><p>It wasn't until 7am on January 6, that a friend of John's found his remains in a gully about 50 metres from his car.</p><p>As the Badja Forest Fire escalated into the morning of December 31, the country town of Cobargo was directly its path.</p><p>Earlier during the inquiry, on September 7, a submission from a Cobargo RFS member spoke of 15-20 metre flame heights through grassland as fire fronts approached Cobargo from the west.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard the deaths of a well-known father and son of Cobargo.</p><p>Robert, 63, and Patrick, 29, Salway died in their paddock while defending their farm on the morning of December 31, 2019.</p><p>The pair were battling spot fires before, what experts described as \"a ferocious firestorm\" trailing the main fire front, took their lives.</p><p>Cobargo's Ross Rixon, 84, was also attempting to battle the blaze that completely destroyed his Cobargo property on December 31.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard Ross died one week later. He died of a heart attack after suffering burns to his face. He was remembered as \"a real Aussie bushy and strong as an ox\".</p><p>The fire continued a path of destruction, headed for the small rural suburb of Coolagolite, near Cobargo, where Richard \"Rick\" Steele perished in his granny flat.</p><p>On September 9, Coroner O'Sullivan heard the 56-year-old agreed on a plan to stay and fight the fire with his neighbour who owned the property.</p><p>Their plan was to pump water from a nearby dam to fight the fire, however the power was cut off in the early hours of December 31 and the pump no longer worked. They both went into their homes to pack their belongings and leave the property.</p><p>Rick's neighbour told the court his driveway was on fire as he fled in his car. He said there was no sign of Rick's headlights behind him.</p><p>The next day, Rick's remains were found inside the granny flat.</p><p>The Badja Forest Fire fire burned steady for some weeks before a change in weather caused a sudden and severe turn on Thursday, January 23, the day Michael 'Mick' Clarke died.</p><p>Mick lived alone on a property nestled in bushland at Bumbo, near Bodalla.</p><p>The court was told on September 8 that in the months prior to the fire, Mick had not been well. He discharged himself from hospital and returned to his property the day before the fire hit.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard Mick's brother was unable to reach Mick in time to help at the property as conditions got too dangerous.</p><p>Hours later, a neighbour found Mick's remains among rubble of his home.

Col was known as a \"true bushman\" and dedicated member of Belowra RFS for 40-years.</p><p>In the neighbouring bush village of Nerrigundah, another tragic story of an unsuccessful escape was heard.</p><p>John Smith, 71, left his Batemans Bay home to prepare his property at Nerrigundah the day before his fate.</p><p>The court heard on September 9 that John's car crashed into a tree, and that he attempted to escape on foot but couldn't outrun the fire on December 31.</p><p>His burnt-out car was discovered three days later. At that stage, his remains were not yet found and a search began with RFS and Police.</p><p>It wasn't until 7am on January 6, that a friend of John's found his remains in a gully about 50 metres from his car.</p><p>As the Badja Forest Fire escalated into the morning of December 31, the country town of Cobargo was directly its path.</p><p>Earlier during the inquiry, on September 7, a submission from a Cobargo RFS member spoke of 15-20 metre flame heights through grassland as fire fronts approached Cobargo from the west.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard the deaths of a well-known father and son of Cobargo.</p><p>Robert, 63, and Patrick, 29, Salway died in their paddock while defending their farm on the morning of December 31, 2019.</p><p>The pair were battling spot fires before, what experts described as \"a ferocious firestorm\" trailing the main fire front, took their lives.</p><p>Cobargo's Ross Rixon, 84, was also attempting to battle the blaze that completely destroyed his Cobargo property on December 31.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard Ross died one week later. He died of a heart attack after suffering burns to his face. He was remembered as \"a real Aussie bushy and strong as an ox\".</p><p>The fire continued a path of destruction, headed for the small rural suburb of Coolagolite, near Cobargo, where Richard \"Rick\" Steele perished in his granny flat.</p><p>On September 9, Coroner O'Sullivan heard the 56-year-old agreed on a plan to stay and fight the fire with his neighbour who owned the property.</p><p>Their plan was to pump water from a nearby dam to fight the fire, however the power was cut off in the early hours of December 31 and the pump no longer worked. They both went into their homes to pack their belongings and leave the property.</p><p>Rick's neighbour told the court his driveway was on fire as he fled in his car. He said there was no sign of Rick's headlights behind him.</p><p>The next day, Rick's remains were found inside the granny flat.</p><p>The Badja Forest Fire fire burned steady for some weeks before a change in weather caused a sudden and severe turn on Thursday, January 23, the day Michael 'Mick' Clarke died.</p><p>Mick lived alone on a property nestled in bushland at Bumbo, near Bodalla.</p><p>The court was told on September 8 that in the months prior to the fire, Mick had not been well.

As a form of punishment and/or therapy, she's assigned to stay in a remote observation tower that commands jaw-dropping views of sweeping wilderness to keep watch for telltale smoke plumes.</p><p>Heading her way along a winding forest road is forensic accountant Owen Casserly (Jake Weber) and his 12-year-old son Connor (Finn Little). Owen fears for his life having exposed the financial misdeeds of some powerful people, and hot on his trail are ruthless father-and-son assassins Jack (Aidan Gillen) and Patrick (Nicholas Hoult).</p><p>The film is a cracker, but some may find it strikes too close to home. Sheridan is a filmmaker who likes to put kids in peril to raise the stakes, and here that extends to a character who is six months pregnant.</p><p>When one of the villains deliberately lights a forest fire and pauses to observe his handiwork with obvious pleasure, it's stomach-churning stuff.</p><p>Sheridan's previous film, Wind River, was a thriller set among the icy wastes of a Native American reservation, in which the dangers of extreme cold drove the storyline - roughly the opposite of the infernal situation here.</p><p>He essentially makes modern-day Westerns, with epic showdowns in savage, frontier-like environments. Here he's adapting a novel by prolific thriller writer Michael Koryta, and it's not quite as rich an experience as the one offered in his own original screenplays (including the two Sicario movies and the Oscar-nominated Hell or High Water).</p><p>We never learn very much about what sparked all this chaos, so there are no deeper themes at play than a fight for survival.</p><p>The characters aren't especially deep but they're well played: standouts are Jon Bernthal as a brave local sheriff and Medina Senghore his even more valiant wife.</p><p>Brisbane-born Finn Little, who starred in 2018's Storm Boy, is a sympathetic young fugitive, and Weber (best known for TV's Medium) is touching as the father caught in an impossibly stressful situation.

other Australian states and territories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Code Red', a danger level <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/cfa-struggles-with-new-ratings/news-story/20817fa55f5ac287585c4e349d55980b\">implemented</url> after the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/green-shoots-sprout-from-black-saturday-ashes/news-story/b4ac5fc616afd648b4d77f0d665a9621\">Black Saturday fires </url>which claimed 173 lives, will disappear. </p><p>Instead, 'Catastrophic' will become the highest risk category on signs around the state. </p><p>The changes will see the state's current six-tier fire danger rating system streamlined to four risk levels with clearer actions for communities to follow when an alert is issued.</p><p>The implementation of the Australian Fire Danger Rating System (AFDRS) will create a \"more scientifically accurate and nationally consistent system\" to enable improved decision making by communities, agencies and industries, the Country Fire Authority's Deputy Chief Officer Alen Slijepcevic says.</p><p>He told Leader there were several reasons the system was changing, including that the current system was outdated.</p><p>While there have been some improvements over time, the current McArthur system was designed in the 1960s and does not take scientific advances or knowledge gained in the last six decades into account.</p><p>Based on two fire behaviour models - forest and grass - it uses the Forest Fire Index (FFI) and Grass Fire Index (GFI) to form a Fire Danger Rating.</p><p>Though inclusive of only two vegetation types, it does not represent all of the country's diverse ecosystems or current fuel states.</p><p>The new system, AFDRS, comprises better data, updated science and the latest fire behaviour prediction models for eight different vegetation types.</p><p>It has also been built so it can be continuously updated with the most up-to-date scientific information.</p><p>While danger ratings were amended after Black Saturday, the new system will simplify the ratings to moderate, high, extreme and catastrophic, with the latter to be reserved for days like Ash Wednesday or Black Saturday.</p><p>Specific actions will be attached to each rating, including 'plan and prepare', 'prepare to act', 'take actions to protect life and property' and 'leave for survival'.</p><p>An overall clearer and nationally consistent system, Deputy Chief Officer Slijepcevic said it would mean Australians would know what to do no matter where they were.</p><p>The system will begin rolling out in Victoria from September 1, with all current signage and educational materials to be replaced.</p><p>It's not clear how much it will cost to replace all the signage. </p><p>With above-average rainfall expected in spring and an average fire season expected for 2022-2023, it is hoped authorities will be able to transition smoothly.</p><p>But Deputy Chief Officer Slijepcevic stressed that it only took one day for a fire season to become catastrophic, even in an average or below average fire season, so having fire plans in place was crucial.</p><p>Building on the new system, the NSW Rural Fire Service and the Bureau of Meteorology are also researching new ways to support fire danger prediction.</p><p>This includes the likelihood of a fire starting, the ability to suppress a fire if it does start and the impact of fire if it spreads beyond suppressibility. </p><p>The latter will look at the scale of damage - from human life and property to critical infrastructure, biodiversity, water yield and quality to secondary and tertiary impacts such as the impact of smoke on community health and longer-term impacts to certain industries.</p><p>\"Over time we will collectively build a very sophisticated system,\" he said.

But he's eradicated those gains since.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not playing any role in said deterioration was VC-backed Australian start-up MilkRun, which isn't in Frazis' investible universe. And thank Christ for that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In December 2021, Frazis told his Twitter followers that perhaps 95 per cent of his grocery spend was now through the then-15-minute grocery delivery service. He enthused about the experience being well worth the (small) mark-up, and assessed that the app would take \"serious market share - and perhaps even more so of industry gross margin\".</p><p>\"Woolworths has a problem, unsure if they know it yet,\" he added.</p><p>MilkRun CEO Dany Milham told staff yesterday the company was folding at the end of this week, bringing an end to its ambitious business model and some $86 million of VC investment. Turns out sustainably undercutting the grocery giants with 15-minute deliveries of reasonably priced groceries delivered by salaried drivers in at-best medium-density suburbs is easier said than done. Woolworths must be relieved.</p><p>Miners' secret weapon in NSW planning approval</p><p>Given the deprecated state of rugby union in this country, the game's administrators are in no position to be hyperselective or high-minded about their choice of commercial sponsors.</p><p>Although Tennis Australia had the luxury of tearing up its lucrative partnership with Santos in January last year just 12 months into a multi-year deal, the oil and gas giant faces zero risk of being treated so cavalierly by the top brass at Rugby Australia.</p><p>The Santos logo now adorns the Wallabies jersey in international Tests and the shirts of both the NSW Waratahs and Queensland Reds in the Super Rugby.</p><p>This sponsorship has been thoughtfully executed by Santos, as the potential alignment is unmistakable. Companies since the Melbourne Rebels' founding partner, tractor manufacturer Massey Ferguson, have sought out rugby's agricultural constituency, and now Santos needs to cultivate farmers in the arc of its major projects.</p><p>That certainly explains the Santos Festival of Rugby in Narrabri, where the Waratahs and Reds face off in a pre-season game each February, and also the company's sponsorship of local team the Narrabri Blue Boars.</p><p>Santos has been accumulating approvals for its $3.6 billion Narrabri gas project for nine long years. Indeed, Eastern Star Gas (which Santos acquired in 2011) started exploring for coal seam gas in the Pilliga State Forest in the late 1990s. The NSW Independent Planning Commission (IPC) approved the project in 2020 after receiving more than 20,000 submissions against it.</p><p>Other extraction-industry PR machines easing their projects through the NSW planning process have clearly taken note.</p><p>The proposed open-cut silver, zinc and lead mine outside the Central West NSW tourist town of Mudgee was granted approval by the IPC last week.</p><p>Bowdens Silver already sponsors the Mudgee Local Netball Association, the Mudgee Chamber of Commerce, the Mudgee Show, three local public schools and, self-evidently, is backing Mudgee's bid for the 2040 Olympics.</p><p>Bowdens Silver also sponsors the local rugby club, the Mudgee Wombats. The club took the extraordinary step on February 4 of emailing its members - even parents of junior players - to encourage them to make a submission in support of the project.</p><p>They needn't have bothered. Spotted in the Bowdens camp at the IPC hearings at Mudgee Showground on February 15, 16 and 17 was communications consultant Sam Deans, an associate partner at public affairs firm Newgate. In keeping with today's rugby theme, Deans is the son of former Wallabies coach Robbie Deans.</p><p>Bowdens Silver is owned by ASX-listed Silver Mines, put together by chief executive Anthony McClure and his former lieutenant, Andrew Bray, the son of broadcaster Gordon Bray, known as \"the voice of rugby\". In 2021, Bray became CEO of Strickland Metals, where McClure is chairman.</p><p>Furthermore, Taurus Funds Management, purveyor of \"bespoke financing solutions for global mid-tier and junior mining companies\", boasts as its director former Wallabies captain Nick Farr-Jones, who has been seeking to project finance the Bowdens mine.</p><p>Even though The Australian Financial Review's publisher, Nine, is these days Rugby Australia's official broadcaster, I am not receiving any promotional retainer or being remunerated per gratuitous mention of the game they play in heaven.</p><p>Greens housing spokesman opposes 1300 new homes</p><p>The Greens are prepared to vote down Anthony Albanese's signature $10 billion social housing fund. This is partly because building a mere 30,000 affordable homes over five years is the equivalent of \"taking a bucket of water to a forest fire\". Or so reckoned Greens housing spokesman Max Chandler-Mather on a recent Guardian podcast.</p><p>It follows that Chandler-Mather's attempts to stymie the development of some 1300 new homes in his own electorate is like adding a handful of dry kindling to an adjacent inferno.</p><p>Chandler-Mather's seat of Griffith, home to some of Brisbane's wealthiest residents, should be the perfect candidate for higher-density housing, given it is serviced by ferries, trains, buses and major road networks, just south of the CBD.</p><p>Alas, NIMBYism is as strong there as it is in most of the country's more desirable locales.</p><p>Residents have a willing advocate in their newly elected Green MP, his housing and homelessness portfolio and oft-avowed concern for renters grappling with a 1 per cent vacancy rate notwithstanding. Plans to redevelop an old barracks and an industrial site into \"luxury\" units and apartments have in both cases met with Chandler-Mather's fierce opposition. At Tugulawa Park, his website details in glowing terms the installation of a new yet instantly \"much-loved\" community garden where an access road is planned for 855 new low- to medium-density riverfront homes.</p><p>\"I'm spending a lot of my time right now pushing the federal government to invest in public and affordable housing,\" Chandler-Mather states, before outlining his many objections to this specific proposal, which include concerns about flooding and traffic, as well as over that new road.</p><p>He wants the entire site purchased by the federal government for public parkland, community facilities and \"a small portion of affordable housing\".</p><p>Meanwhile, on the other side of his electorate, plans for the construction of two 26-storey towers on what is currently an industrial site have also met with opposition, despite the 470 new homes contained therein. The plan, the Greens MP states, will create \"further congestion\" and \"misses a fantastic opportunity\" to use the site to instead expand the neighbouring park. Seriously. And Chandler-Mather insists it is Labor that doesn't get the scale of the housing emergency.</p><p>Like many an inner-city MP before him, Chandler-Mather claims he isn't opposed to development, just bad development made without compensating investment in supporting infrastructure.</p><p>Being a Green, Chandler-Mather is also iffy on commercial property developers and their creation of homes for the wealthy or middle-class.</p><p>The fact Greens voters in inner-city suburbs are usually wealthy or middle-class is no electoral issue at all because those with property portfolios can reason this through. Inner-city suburbs with fewer homes but ever more community gardens are only getting pricier.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AFREVW-doc7pq5nwdy63m1gcb0f2vo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AFREVW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6811-J831-F0J6-J3MW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390780</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1268\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It delivered scientific evidence singling out changes in weather due to global warming as the driving factor behind the boom in Australia's bushfires.</p><p>Lead author and CSIRO chief climate research scientist Pep Canadell said the study established the correlation between the Forest Fire Danger Index - which measures weather-related vegetation dryness, air temperature, wind speed and humidity - and the rise in area of forest burnt since the 1930s.</p><p>\"It's so tight, it's so strong that clearly when we have these big fire events, they're run by the climate and the weather,\" Dr Canadell said.</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison went to the COP26 climate talks in Glasgow to commit Australia to reach net zero emissions by 2050, and to upgrade his expectations for Australia's 2030 carbon cuts, but he defied a global push to commit to phasing out fossil fuel use. Instead, the Coalition government is backing an expansion of the gas industry.</p><p>The CSIRO report found other factors have an impact on the extent of bushfires such as vegetation or fuel load in a forest, the time since the last fire, and hazard reduction burning. But Dr Canadell said the study showed the link between weather and climate conditions and the size of bushfires was so tight it was clear these factors far outweighed other fire drivers.</p><p>REPORT Page 1</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7ikp9bvs8nb14x5u5acs</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:645H-1K21-JD34-V05B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"275\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

He's been a firefighter for 45 years, but this is one of the worst grass loads the state has had in 20 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There has been so much rain. I don't know if it has stopped yet, but in a way I am hoping it doesn't and there is a bit more moisture to come. Otherwise, this is going to be a worrying year,\" he says.</p><p>The wet weather cycle that deluged the east coast is breaking down but by next summer, there's a 50-50 chance the east coast will get either balmy weather or the dreaded El Nino cycle that brings heat, drought and bushfires.</p><p>El Nino brings colder water to the east coast of Australia, which means lower evaporation, less cloud cover and drier conditions.</p><p>What makes grass fires so dangerous is how quickly they can spread - at times travelling more than 25km/h.</p><p>\"You can't outrun a grass fire,\" NSW RFS Commissioner Rob Rogers says. \"One difference to bushfires is that they are not something that tends to go for weeks; once the heat of the day disappears and the wind drops, grass fires tend to calm down, whereas bushfires keep burning.\"</p><p>Grass fires start from a variety of similar causes to bushfires, such as lightning or someone throwing a cigarette out of a window, but agricultural practices - including welding fences or sparks from machinery - can also ignite a blaze.</p><p>Authorities are turning their attention to increasing fire risks this year. Above-normal fire potential is expected in parts of Western Australia, southern Queensland and inland NSW because of increased fuel loads, a report by the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council found.</p><p>Meanwhile, other parts of NSW, Victoria and the ACT face below-normal fire potential because of the amount of moisture in the landscape, continued wet outlook and reduced fuel loads after the 2019-20 bushfires.</p><p>The Sydney Morning Herald's chief photographer, Nick Moir, who has spent years documenting natural disasters, says the current weather systems aren't producing strong enough westerly wind.</p><p>\"In 2016, we had a lot of grass growth, but it wasn't until 2017 that we started seeing grass fires because the winds weren't there,\" Moir says. \"Not all the ingredients are there yet. The fuel is there, the temperatures, but the dryness and the winds aren't.\"</p><p>For emergency services, the past three years have had floods rather than fires during the warming months. But this has delayed fire-mitigation efforts.</p><p>In NSW, the RFS has conducted hazard-reduction burns on only 8764 hectares since July. The agency's target for this financial year is 318,891 hectares.</p><p>In 2021-22, the agency treated 40,123 hectares, while in</p><p>2020-21 about 176,499 hectares were treated.</p><p>The heavy rain has fuelled strong grass growth across much of western NSW.</p><p>Rogers says the state is facing its most significant grass fire threat in more than 20 years, particularly for western parts of NSW. He adds that, while the amount of water in the tableland would elevate grass-fire risk for years to come, areas that had burnt during the 2019-20 bushfire season were regenerating faster than expected.</p><p>According to the fuel accumulation curve, a model used by fire authorities, the affected landscape should take eight to nine years before it becomes a concern. But heavy rains over the past three years mean these areas could burn again in five years.</p><p>Maps from the NSW RFS show heavy grass fuel loads over huge parts of the state, stretching</p><p>from western NSW to many coastal areas.</p><p>In December last year, NSW had 850 grass fires. Since the start of this year, it has had 90.</p><p>Rogers says the bushfire threat will increase towards March. He adds the best thing people can do to prepare for the increased risk is to keep their lawns as short as possible, clean out gutters, make sure there are limited combustible items around the house and have an evacuation plan.</p><p>For Victorians, the risk of grass fires remains normal, says Victoria's Country Fire Authority deputy chief officer for bushfire management, Alen Slijepcevic.</p><p>Maps from the state fire agency show the amount of grassland curing - a measure of the amount of dead grassland in the landscape that has dried out or died - remains higher in the north of the state.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman says that despite wetter conditions this year, the agency, which conducts mitigation efforts on public land, has continued with that work.</p><p>\"We've also increased our use of mowing, slashing and mulching and expanded our network of strategic fuel breaks to better protect against bushfires,\" Hardman says.</p><p>\"These strips of land are in the highest-priority locations - close to towns, water catchments and sensitive environments.</p><p>\"Although we don't expect many long-running or large forest fires this summer, areas across the north and west of Victoria may see increasing fire potential from mid-summer, especially in areas of high grass growth.</p><p>\"Drier forests, woodlands and heathlands are also at risk of fires with the onset of hot and dry weather conditions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7odtk4hppgkzctqvhc1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6789-54G1-JD34-V4HT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-01-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Otherwise, this is going to be a worrying year,\" he said.</p><p>The wet weather cycle that has deluged the east coast is breaking down but, by next summer, there's a 50-50 chance the east coast will get either balmy weather or the dreaded El Nino cycle.</p><p>El Nino brings colder water to the east coast of Australia, which means lower evaporation, less cloud cover and drier conditions, increasing the risk of drought, heatwaves and bushfires.</p><p>Grass fire or bushfire?</p><p>What makes grass fires so dangerous is how quickly they can spread - at times travelling more than 25km/h.</p><p>\"You can't outrun a grass fire,\" NSW RFS Commissioner Rob Rogers said. \"One difference to bushfires is that they are not something that tends to go for weeks. Once the heat of the day disappears and the wind drops, grass fires tend to calm down, whereas bushfires keep burning.\"</p><p>Grass fires are started in similar ways to bushfires, such as through lightning or by someone throwing a cigarette out a window, while agricultural practices - including welding fences and sparks from machinery - can also ignite blazes.</p><p>What's in store?</p><p>Authorities are turning their attention to increasing fire risks this year. Above-normal fire potential is expected in parts of Western Australia, southern Queensland and inland NSW because of increased fuel loads, a report by the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council found.</p><p>Meanwhile, other parts of NSW, Victoria and the ACT face below-normal fire potential because of the amount of moisture in the landscape, continued wet outlook and reduced fuel loads after the 2019-20 bushfires.</p><p>The Herald's chief photographer, Nick Moir, who has spent years documenting natural disasters, said current weather systems aren't producing strong enough westerly winds.</p><p>\"In 2016, we had a lot of grass growth, but it wasn't until 2017 that we started seeing grass fires because the winds weren't there,\" Moir said.</p><p>\"Not all the ingredients are there yet. The fuel is there, the temperatures, but the dryness and the winds aren't.\"</p><p>For emergency services, the past three years have brought floods rather than fires during the warming months. Unfortunately, this has delayed fire mitigation efforts.</p><p>In NSW, the RFS has conducted hazard reduction burns on only 8764 hectares since July. The agency's target for this financial year is 318,891 hectares. In 2021-22, the agency treated 40,123 hectares, while in 2020-21 about 176,499 hectares were treated</p><p>The heavy rain has fuelled strong grass growth, and Rogers said the state was facing its most significant grass fire threat in more than 20 years, particularly for western parts of NSW.</p><p>While the amount of water in the tableland would elevate grass fire risk for years to come, Rogers said areas that had burnt during the 2019-20 bushfire season were regenerating faster than expected.</p><p>According to the fuel accumulation curve, a model used by fire authorities, the affected landscape should take eight to nine years before it becomes a concern. But heavy rains over the past three years mean these areas could burn again in five years' time. Maps from the NSW RFS show heavy grass fuel loads over huge parts of the state, stretching from western NSW to many coastal areas.</p><p>In December last year, the state had 850 grass fires. Since the start of this year, there have been 90.</p><p>Rogers said the bushfire threat would increase towards March. He added the best thing people could do to prepare for the increased risk was to keep their lawns as short as possible, clean out gutters, make sure there are limited combustible items around the house and have an evacuation plan.</p><p>Risk in Victoria</p><p>For Victorians, the risk of grass fires remains normal, said Victoria's Country Fire Authority deputy chief officer of bushfire management, Alen Slijepcevic.</p><p>Maps by the state fire agency show the amount of grassland curing - a measure of the amount of dead grassland that has dried out or died - remains higher in the north.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said that, despite wetter conditions this year, the agency had continued with its mitigation efforts on public land.</p><p>\"We've also increased our use of mowing, slashing and mulching and expanded our network of strategic fuel breaks to better protect against bushfires. These strips of land are in the highest priority locations - close to towns, water catchments and sensitive environments,\" Hardman said.</p><p>\"Although we don't expect many long-running or large forest fires this summer, areas across the north and west of Victoria may see increasing fire potential from mid-summer, especially in areas of high grass growth.</p><p>\"Drier forests, woodlands and heathlands are also at risk of fires with the onset of hot and dry weather conditions.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7odbhl4297k161ov7hc1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6783-86Y1-F0J6-J0DS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"858\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;
