The ordeal was made even more excruciating by the fact the close-knit family was split between the two properties when the firefront hit and were unaware of each other's fate until nearly 24 hours later.</p><p>Calm before the storm Alan and Chris had spent Christmas week in the Illawarra but returned home on December 30, with three of their six grandchildren for the annual extended Pauling family holiday.</p><p>The Badja Forest fire, the closest to the Bega Valley, was still tens of kilometres away and the family had gone to painstaking lengths to ensure their property was as fire-fit as possible.</p><p>\"We thought we were prepared, we thought our place was safe,\" Chris said somberly, sitting at the kitchen table in her daughter's rented Warilla townhouse on Friday.</p><p>\"But this wasn't just a fire, it wasn't just a bushfire....it was a war zone. We feel like refugees in our own country.\"</p><p>Family's incredible escape from inferno</p><p>Alan's story Alan and Chris were almost home on Monday when a frantic Troy rang them to say he feared his property was in danger.</p><p>Alan set Chris with pumps and water-filled buckets when they got home before driving to Yowrie to help Troy. Meanwhile, Troy's wife and two of their three children (the eldest was with friends in Narooma) fled to their in-laws place at Quaama.</p><p>Alan estimated the fire was about 15km from his son's house when he arrived but was upon them just hours later in the wake of strong, erratic winds.</p><p>Alan said three spot fires turned into a raging inferno in an instant: \"all I saw was this fireball come at me. It was like someone dropped a bomb.\"</p><p>Alan, Troy, and Troy's friend Matt Rumble, barricaded themselves in the house but it began to burn down around them.</p><p>Matt managed to escape to a clearing but Alan and Troy were forced to hide behind a brick barbecue at the rear of the house and use a fridge to shield themselves from the flames.</p><p>\"I didn't realise Troy was badly burned until he started shaking,\" Alan said.</p><p>\"I put a big rug over us and poured water on him. He said 'please don't let me die, Dad'. And I said I wouldn't. I cuddled him and cuddled him.\"</p><p>The fire front eventually passed, leaving a smoldering wreck where the house once stood.</p><p>Alan can't remember how many times he phoned triple-zero but said no one came to their aid for hours, despite his repeated pleas for assistance.</p><p>He and Matt carried Troy for much of the 7km trek towards town before police eventually picked them up.</p><p>Both Troy and Alan were admitted to Bega Hospital suffering burns. Alan was released later that day but Troy was flown to the burns unit at Sydney's Royal North Shore Hospital.</p><p>Chris's story Twenty-five kilometres away, Chris had no idea what was unfolding at her son's property. Anyway, she had her own inferno to worry about.</p><p>\"We were told we had 48 hours to make a decision about leaving; four hours later it was all gone,\" she said, estimating the fire was about 40km away when they arrived home.</p><p>Chris and her daughter-in-law Jess had five children inside the home when the fire came at them out of nowhere, having crossed a seemingly impossible distance in such a short time.</p><p>\"When it started to roll down the hill we called Batemans Bay police and asked them the best way to get out. They said everything around us was on fire and we had to stay put,\" she said.</p><p>\"One minute the fire was a mile away and the next minute it was on our door.\"</p><p>As the house began to burn down around them, Chris heard a man yelling out to them.</p><p>A stranger, who she later learned was RFS volunteer firefighter Nathan Barnden, heard of the family's desperate plight across the RFS radio and had driven through the blaze to rescue them.</p><p>\"One by one he took the kids out over the end of the verandah to his 4WD,\" she said.</p><p>\"He had to get seven of us out and he didn't stop, he counted every one of us.\"</p><p>She later discovered Nathan had learned of the deaths of family members Robert and Patrick Salway in the fire at Cobargo while he was with the Paulings but had continued to see them to safety.</p><p>Despite their relief at escaping the flames, Chris, Jess and the kids remained worried sick about Alan and Troy, whom they had not heard from ion hours.</p><p>Aftermath Alan and Chris were reunited on Tuesday evening, about 24 hours after they'd last seen each other.</p><p>Both were unaware of the harrowing ordeal the other had been through, but explanations would have to wait.</p><p>They were given emergency accommodation at a hotel in Bega but were forced to leave a few days later because there were prior bookings.</p><p>With nowhere else to go, the extended Pauling family is now living in a three bedroom townhouse at Warilla with Alan and Chris's daughter Tara and her three children.</p><p>They have one simple message for others anywhere in the fire zone.</p><p>\"Get out, don't wait.

We used Rega knapsacks and wet hessian beaters on handles.\"</p><p>Mr Jenkins says the way Victoria has dealt with the crisis is a great credit to the lesson learned from the 2009 fires.</p><p>READ MORE: Australian bushfire latest - LIVE BLOG</p><p>READ MORE: 'A community looking after its own': How Cobargo pulled together after a firestorm on two fronts</p><p>\"The system has been there since then and the way they've handled this, strike team-wise, they have done really well. I was talking to some of the boys at Sebastopol and their pumper is is up there somewhere - in the back of nowhere - doing asset protection.</p><p>\"We we were one of the first strike teams to ever go out of our area when we were formed. They weren't called strike teams then, I can't recall exactly what we were called.\"</p><p>Mr Jenkins refers to a map of the fire he fought in 1980 that he has kept. It shows the fire and firefighting lines near the tiny town of Wangarabell, north-east of Mallacoota near the NSW-Victoria border.</p><p>\"They sent us up the Cann Valley Highway to burn firebreaks. This was in August 1980.</p><p>Mr Jenkins says the firefighting tactics of today had its origins in the work of CSIRO scientist A.G. McArthur , who invented the Forest Fire Danger Meter in 1967.</p><p>Still used by CSIRO, the meter 'brought together the results of over 800 experimental fires and wildfire observations into an easy-to-use system to determine the fire danger in forested areas of Australia.'</p><p>\"You'd dial in the humidity and the wind and the rest of it, and it would tell you how much the fire was going to spread. It was the greatest thing in its day. Now of course we have computers and such, but then we used the McArthur fire meter. Everybody had them in their fire trucks.\"</p><p>Starting as a volunteer at Sebastopol, Paul Jenkins became a lieutenant and then a captain with the brigade, which has over 150 years of service in Ballarat. He also represented the area on the regional council of the CFA and served on the CFA board.</p><p>\"Oh it was fairly basic back then,\" Mr Jenkins says.</p><p>\"There was an assistant chief officer named Arthur McFann, and he said you'd better get some trucks together and see if you can go over. So there was a heap of trucks form districts 15 and 16 - Ballarat and Colac now - and they all assembled.</p><p>\"When the changeover came through, we all flew over there in the Hercules aircraft, which was completely new; it had never been done with a strike team before. That was October 1980, and the start of strike teams.\"</p><p>As it remains today, the premier at the time of the 1980 fires, Rupert Hamer, made a request to the federal government for the use of the RAAF as am adjunct to the state's firefighting efforts.</p><p>\"After that they got the RAAF to come down there with their helicopters and they were choppering crews up and back because the roads there... well the Cann Valley Highway was only a gravel road. In fact one night the crew staying at the Cann River pub decided they wanted some oysters. So they choppered them over to Eden.</p><p>\"So we learned a lot from those experiences, even the catering. Back then it was done in an old army kitchen the Forestry Commission was using, and old army cook was there cooking us steaks with the ladies from the CWA. We slept on the wooden floor of the little school. Talk about basic!\"</p><p>The CFA was established in April 1945 as a result of the outcome of the Royal Commission in the Black Friday bushfires of 1939, combining many country and rural fire brigades into one body.</p><p>Many years later, Paul Jenkins recalls the firefighters were still using World War II surplus gear, including radios.</p><p>\"I was an apprentice electrician in the early 50s and I put in some power points into the regional officer's office - he had converted his laundry into his office. His name was Harry Olburn and - I can still see them - he had two big old army wireless sets. That was his contact. They were just starting to get some of that old army stuff.</p><p>\"Out at Lake Bolac and the Westmere group of brigades, they were the first ones to use radio. And they were pooh-poohed by head office - 'Oh radio's no good, you won't need that.' They were using old field telephones too: they'd clip a wire on the fenceline and put a stake in the ground, wind her up and the blokes in the next group along could talk to you.\"</p><p>One of the last changes to come from the 1980s was the recognition of the value of aircraft in firefighting. Paul Jenkins says the CFA budget at the time for aircraft was around $7 million, which was spent on about 10 or 12 cropdusters around the state. He went and observed the use of firefighting aircraft in the US, and returned with plans to introduce bombers and similar fixed-wing and helicopter strategies.</p><p>But, says Paul Jenkins, the Americans had a lot to learn from us, too.</p><p>\"They had all the equipment, planes flying over dropping retardant and all the local prisoners go out with their guards and lay hose, all of that. And I said 'Two cockies in an Austin tanker would put this out.' I mean, they never had tankers over there; they just used pumpers and plumbers and hoselayers, and use milk tankers to bring water up.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWCAST-doc78rd7kb871s1fv4qmjke</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NWCAST2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XXV-9D31-JD34-V46B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390612</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"972\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It's the first time since overlapping records began that Australia experienced both its lowest rainfall and highest temperatures in the same year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The national rainfall total was 37mm, or 11.7%, below the 314.5\u00a0mm recorded in the previous driest year in 1902. The national average temperature was nearly 0.2\u00b0C above the previous warmest year in 2013. </p><p>Globally, 2019 is likely to be the second-warmest year, with global temperatures about 0.8\u00a0\u00b0C above the 1961-1990 average. It has been the warmest year without the influence of El Ni\u00f1o.</p><p>Across the year, Australia experienced many extreme events including flooding in Queensland and large hail in New South Wales. However, due to prolonged heat and drought, the year began and ended with fires burning across the Australian landscape.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: 'This crisis has been unfolding for years': 4 photos of Australia from space, before and after the bushfires</emphasis></p><h>The effect of the long dry</h><p>Bushfire activity for the 2018-19 season began in late November 2018, when fires burned along a 600km stretch of the central Queensland coast. Widespread fires later followed across Victoria and Tasmania throughout the summer.</p><p>Persistent drought and record temperatures were a major driver of the fire activity, and the context for 2019 lies in the past three years of drought.</p><p>The dry conditions steadily worsened over 2019, resulting in Australia's driest year on record, with area-average rainfall of just 277.6mm (the 1961-1990 average is 465.2 mm). </p><p>Almost the entire continent experienced rainfall in the lowest 10th percentile over the year.</p><p>Record low rainfall affected the central and southern inland regions of the continent and the north-eastern Murray-Darling Basin straddling the NSW and Queensland border. Many weather stations over central parts of Australia received less than 30mm of rainfall for the year.</p><p>Every capital city recorded below average annual rainfall. For the first time, national rainfall was below average in every month.</p><h>Record heat dominates the nation</h><p>2019 was Australia's warmest year on record, with the annual mean temperature 1.52\u00b0C above the 1961-1990 average, surpassing the previous record of 1.33\u00b0C above average in 2013.</p><p>January, February, March, April, July, October, November, and December were all amongst the ten warmest on record for Australian mean temperature for their respective months, with January and December exceeding their previous records by 0.98\u00b0C and 1.08\u00b0C respectively.</p><p>Maximum temperatures recorded an even larger departure from average of +2.09\u00b0C for the year. This is the first time the nation has seen an anomaly of more than 2\u00a0\u00b0C, and about half a degree warmer than the previous record in 2013.</p><p>The year brought the nation's six hottest days on record peaking at 41.9\u00b0C (December 18), the hottest week 40.5\u00a0\u00b0C (week ending December 24), hottest month 38.6\u00a0\u00b0C (December 2019), and hottest season 36.9\u00a0\u00b0C (summer 2018-19).</p><p>The highest temperature for the year was 49.9\u00a0\u00b0C at Nullarbor (a new national December record) on December 19 and the coldest temperature was -12.0\u00b0C at Perisher Valley on June 20.</p><p>Keith West in southeast South Australia recorded a maximum 49.2\u00b0C on December 20, while Dover in far southern Tasmania saw 40.1\u00b0C on March 2, the furthest south such high temperatures have been observed in Australia.</p><h>Accumulating fire danger over 2019</h><p>The combination of prolonged record heat and drought led to record fire weather over large areas throughout the year, with destructive bushfires affecting all states, and multiple states at once in the final week of the year.</p><p>Many fires were difficult to contain in regions where drought has been severe, such as northern NSW and southeast Queensland, or where below average rainfall has been persistent, such as southeast Australia.</p><p>The Forest Fire Danger Index, a measure of fire weather severity, accumulated over the month of December was the highest on record for that month, and the highest for any month when averaged over the whole of Australia.</p><p>Record-high daily index values for December were recorded at the very end of December around Adelaide and the Yorke Peninsula in South Australia, East Gippsland in Victoria and the Monaro in NSW. These regions which experienced significant fire activity.</p><h>Don't forget the floods</h><p>Amidst the dry, 2019 also included significant flooding across Queensland and the eastern Top End. </p><p>Heavy rain fell from January into early February, with damaging floods around Townsville and parts of the western Peninsula and Gulf Country.</p><p>Tropical cyclone Trevor brought further heavy rainfall in April in the eastern Northern Territory and Queensland. Floodwaters eventually reached Lake Eyre/Kati Thanda which, amidst severe local rainfall deficiencies in South Australia, experienced its most significant filling since 2010-11.</p><p>There was a notable absence of rainfall on Australia's snow fields during winter and spring which meant less snow melt. Snow cover was generous, particularly at higher elevations.</p><h>What role did climate change play in 2019?</h><p>The climate each year reflects random variations in weather, slowly evolving natural climate drivers such as El Ni\u00f1o, and long-term trends through the influence of climate change.</p><p>A strong and long-lived positive Indian Ocean Dipole - another natural climate driver - affected Australia from May until the end of the year, and played a major role in suppressing rainfall and raising temperatures for much of the year.</p><p>Spring brought an unusual breakdown of the southern polar vortex which allowed westerly winds to affect mainland Australia. This reduced rainfall, raising temperature and contributing to the increased fire risk.</p><p>Climate change continues to cause long-term changes to Australia's climate. Conditions in 2019 were consistent with trends of declining rainfall in parts of the south, worsening fire seasons and rising temperatures.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Australia can expect far more fire catastrophes.

It's going to be a holiday season like no other and one of the best antidotes to months of being cooped up is to go bush.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"You can't beat setting up camp somewhere on the banks of the Goulburn River,\" says Jayco ambassador Dan Hawkins. \"Cooking over the embers of river red gum, the kookaburras laughing at you while you burn things, for me, the Goulburn River is home.\" Executive chef of The Prince Hotel and Mitchelton Winery, Hawkins says Victoria is blessed with amazing camping opportunities from bush to beach and nominates the Cumberland River along the Great Ocean Road as another favourite.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"There is a great campsite there and the fishing and wild seacoast foraging is abundant. Driftwood for the fire, sand in your toes, life is pretty good down there.\" These days there's more hi-tech kit available than a simple swag or two-man tent, but whether you're camping or caravanning one of the highlights of getting away from it all is a campfire cook out.</p><p>Rob Elder from Tatlocks Gourmet produce in the Grampians says cooking over fire is a great way to bring people together. \"I come from a long line of camp oven cookers and cannot remember a time when we weren't cooking outside over coals for special occasions,\" Elder says.</p><p>\"I love to gather friends and family and sit around the campfire chatting while we wait for our food to cook. It has a real good community feel and as a family we love to cook out in the open air.\" For Hawkins, it's the elemental nature of cooking over coals that appeals. \"I feel a lot more connected to the food when cooking with fire. You need to touch it, move it, watch it, smell it, constantly. The smoke, the aroma, the way fire transforms food, it gives layers of flavours that can only be achieved by cooking over fire and coals.\" Down in Lakes Entrance, when Melinda Whadcoat isn't tending to the vines or making wine at her Wyanga Park vineyard, she heads off with a group of friends for a weekend of camping - and campfire cooking.</p><p>\"It's good to sit around the fire, have a couple of drinks and throw some food on,\" Whadcoat says. \"You can't sit around a slow-cooker (in the kitchen) and wait for it to cook and tell stories.\" For the first-time camper, cooking with and over coals can seem daunting, but Hawkins says with a keen eye on heat control everyone can whip up a family feast with ease.</p><p>\"My hot tip to successfully cooking on a campfire would have to be heat control. Your food can go from cooking perfectly one moment to blackened and unrecognisable the next. Heat control could be as simple as moving your food closer or further away from the heat source as required or as complex as having separate fires providing different temperature coals at different times,\" he says.</p><p>Start your fire at least 30 minutes before you want to begin cooking as creating a hot coal bed to cook on is one of the most important steps, Hawkins says.</p><p>You'll need a cast iron camp or Dutch oven, and a shovel for the coals. Hawkins advises to look for a lid with a high lip, as this will stop ash getting into the food when you place coals on top. A grill or wire rack is also good to cook food on so it takes on the smoke flavours from the fire.</p><p>And importantly: \"a decent pair of tongs\".</p><p>\"The tongs literally become an extension of your arm. A good set of tongs often gets overlooked but is just as important as the equipment you will be cooking in or on,\" Hawkins says.</p><p>Before long you, too, will be cooking like these pros. \"The most elaborate camp fire meal was last Christmas when we did a whole suckling pig with a full spread for 15 of our family and friends,\" Elder says.</p><p>Whadcoat cooked a chocolate birthday cake for her son in the camp oven over coals - \"only time I've cooked a cake out there. It tasted good\" - while Hawkins recently cooked a whole leg of wild venison over coals over six hours. \"It was a real feast\".</p><p>And for the breakfast the next morning? Elder says \"toad in the hole\" - fried bread with an egg inside - is \"the best way to start the day\".</p><p>CAMPFIRE RULES \" Keep a 3m air and ground perimeter around your campfire. Use a designated fireplace where provided.</p><p>\" Campfire must be 1sq m or less in size and in a trench/hole more than 30cm deep and/or lined with rocks.</p><p>\" Do not leave campfire unattended.</p><p>\" Fully extinguish campfire with water, not soil, with no hot embers.

We had a plan to airlift another 300 out today. Sadly smoke means that is not possible,\" Premier Daniel Andrews said on Monday.</p><p>\"Whilst the smoke is good for fire in terms of keeping some of the temperatures down, it makes access by the air much more challenging.\"</p><p>Those stranded in Mallacoota have been offered a place on HMAS Choules, which has returned to the town with supplies and equipment.</p><p>It is unclear when flights can resume.</p><p>Four people missing on Sunday have now been accounted for, the premier confirmed.</p><p>He also announced a new permanent government agency, Bushfire Recovery Victoria, to be headed by former police chief commissioner Ken Lay.</p><p>It will respond to the fires, with an initial $50 million in funding.</p><p>\"This is not a time-limited or an authority that's about clean-up and recovery just for these bushfires,\" Mr Andrews said.</p><p>\"Because we're going to see longer fire seasons and we're going to see ... more and more fires, more and more damage as each fire season comes.\"</p><p>About 200 homes have been lost, with the number expected to rise to 300 once smoke clears and aerial assessments can be carried out, the premier confirmed.</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville lifted evacuation orders for East Gippsland and the northeast, allowing some 67,000 people who have left their homes a \"short reprieve\".</p><p>\"But please be aware, very aware, that it is very likely that later this week that such an order will be issued again, depending on the forecast,\" she said.</p><p>\"At this stage Thursday, Friday do look like fire spike days.

Seal the doors. Now would be a good time to do that because this is going to persist for the rest of the day,\" Dr Henwood told reporters.</p><p>Chief Health Officer Brett Sutton advised people with lung or heart conditions, the young and old, and pregnant women to stay indoors.</p><p>He said healthy people may also experience symptoms including eye, nose and throat irritation, coughing, sneezing and congestion.</p><p>There are 31 fires burning across Victoria as of Monday morning, with 18 in eastern Gippsland and six in the northeast.</p><p>One million hectares has been burnt across Victoria.</p><p>Rain has started to fall, but not across all fire-affected areas and not enough to douse the fires, and is creating new difficulties.</p><p>A Forest Fire Management vehicle flipped on a greasy road on Sunday because rain had not fallen in the area for so long, Mr Andrews said.</p><p>No one in the vehicle was seriously injured.</p><p>The deadly fires have killed Buchan man Mick Roberts and Maramingo Creek man Fred Becker.</p><p>The cooler weather has allowed military helicopters to deliver supplies to isolated communities and help with evacuations, reaching 13 communities on Sunday.</p><p>They also rescued 406 people from Mallacoota but attempts to fly out another 300 on Monday were stalled because of the smoke.

We used Rega knapsacks and wet hessian beaters on handles.\"</p><p>Mr Jenkins says the way Victoria has dealt with the crisis is a great credit to the lesson learned from the 2009 fires.</p><p>\"The system has been there since then and the way they've handled this, strike team-wise, they have done really well. I was talking to some of the boys at Sebastopol and their pumper is is up there somewhere - in the back of nowhere - doing asset protection.</p><p>\"We we were one of the first strike teams to ever go out of our area when we were formed. They weren't called strike teams then, I can't recall exactly what we were called.\"</p><p>Mr Jenkins refers to a map of the fire he fought in 1980 that he has kept. It shows the fire and firefighting lines near the tiny town of Wangarabell, north-east of Mallacoota near the NSW-Victoria border.</p><p>\"They sent us up the Cann Valley Highway to burn firebreaks. This was in August 1980.</p><p>Mr Jenkins says the firefighting tactics of today had its origins in the work of CSIRO scientist A.G. McArthur , who invented the Forest Fire Danger Meter in 1967.</p><p>Still used by CSIRO, the meter 'brought together the results of over 800 experimental fires and wildfire observations into an easy-to-use system to determine the fire danger in forested areas of Australia.'</p><p>\"You'd dial in the humidity and the wind and the rest of it, and it would tell you how much the fire was going to spread. It was the greatest thing in its day. Now of course we have computers and such, but then we used the McArthur fire meter. Everybody had them in their fire trucks.\"</p><p>Starting as a volunteer at Sebastopol, Paul Jenkins became a lieutenant and then a captain with the brigade, which has over 150 years of service in Ballarat. He also represented the area on the regional council of the CFA and served on the CFA board.</p><p>\"Oh it was fairly basic back then,\" Mr Jenkins says.</p><p>\"There was an assistant chief officer named Arthur McFann, and he said you'd better get some trucks together and see if you can go over. So there was a heap of trucks form districts 15 and 16 - Ballarat and Colac now - and they all assembled.</p><p>\"When the changeover came through, we all flew over there in the Hercules aircraft, which was completely new; it had never been done with a strike team before. That was October 1980, and the start of strike teams.\"</p><p>As it remains today, the premier at the time of the 1980 fires, Rupert Hamer, made a request to the federal government for the use of the RAAF as am adjunct to the state's firefighting efforts.</p><p>\"After that they got the RAAF to come down there with their helicopters and they were choppering crews up and back because the roads there... well the Cann Valley Highway was only a gravel road. In fact one night the crew staying at the Cann River pub decided they wanted some oysters. So they choppered them over to Eden.</p><p>\"So we learned a lot from those experiences, even the catering. Back then it was done in an old army kitchen the Forestry Commission was using, and old army cook was there cooking us steaks with the ladies from the CWA. We slept on the wooden floor of the little school. Talk about basic!\"</p><p>The CFA was established in April 1945 as a result of the outcome of the Royal Commission in the Black Friday bushfires of 1939, combining many country and rural fire brigades into one body.</p><p>Many years later, Paul Jenkins recalls the firefighters were still using World War II surplus gear, including radios.</p><p>\"I was an apprentice electrician in the early 50s and I put in some power points into the regional officer's office - he had converted his laundry into his office. His name was Harry Olburn and - I can still see them - he had two big old army wireless sets. That was his contact. They were just starting to get some of that old army stuff.</p><p>\"Out at Lake Bolac and the Westmere group of brigades, they were the first ones to use radio. And they were pooh-poohed by head office - 'Oh radio's no good, you won't need that.' They were using old field telephones too: they'd clip a wire on the fenceline and put a stake in the ground, wind her up and the blokes in the next group along could talk to you.\"</p><p>One of the last changes to come from the 1980s was the recognition of the value of aircraft in firefighting. Paul Jenkins says the CFA budget at the time for aircraft was around $7 million, which was spent on about 10 or 12 cropdusters around the state. He went and observed the use of firefighting aircraft in the US, and returned with plans to introduce bombers and similar fixed-wing and helicopter strategies.</p><p>But, says Paul Jenkins, the Americans had a lot to learn from us too.</p><p>\"They had all the equipment, planes flying over dropping retardant and all the local prisoners go out with their guards and lay hose, all of that. And I said 'Two cockies in an Austin tanker would put this out.' I mean, they never had tankers over there; they just used pumpers and plumbers and hoselayers, and use milk tankers to bring water up.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc78v5krcm2x4lmuqtiws</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y5T-5F01-F0J6-J2PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"946\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 8, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Soldier</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921100JQ</classCode><className>MAYORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DFRN</classCode><className>EMERGENCY VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And there's no one but yourselves there to figure out that: what's next?</p><p>You've got no power now; your phones have gone down. How do you even call for help? How do you find out if the person that's left at your home trying to defend it is okay?</p><p>It was - the first day was the really hard, hardest day, when you've also got people with tremendous loss, so many houses lost, and homes and animals and friends.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: Two members of your community, of course, died defending their home.</p><p>RONNIE AYLIFFE: When you say members of the community, you're basically talking family, yeah.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: When you use that term family, you are suggesting that this is a community, 600, 700 people, that has some resource and some familiarity with each other in terms of getting organised. How quickly did that happen?</p><p>RONNIE AYLIFFE: Pretty much immediately. Even in a serious state of shock, people take on roles that they can.</p><p>You'll have somebody who finds a gas stove and just makes a cuppa and puts their arm around someone and gives them a cuppa, and realises that this person has just staggered in here and has nothing with them, just their lives.</p><p>You know, they couldn't even get a car, they couldn't get their car out. They've run for their life. It took a while for ambulances to even start to come because it's too dangerous for them.</p><p>But after you come through the immediate emergency, there's a dawning realisation that nobody is coming to actually turn on the lights.</p><p>(Laughs)</p><p>You've got no power, you've got no telecommunication, you've got fires all around you. Your sewer is actually hooked up to the power, so that means you've got no sewer. You've got no way of getting food. There is no fuel.</p><p>How do you feed all the animals here, and how long is this going to go on for?</p><p>And when nobody appears, I think that's when the leaders in your community sort of emerge, and I don't want anybody to think that I'm one of those leaders.</p><p>I watched as those leaders emerged, and it's really incredible to see a community just display the most magnificent qualities that, if you had brought in an army, they couldn't have done the job that this community did for itself.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: I mean, you did have the choice to leave. In one of the videos you've posted over the last few days on Facebook you said, you know, some of us chose to stay, even when the police came to tell us it was better to go.</p><p>Was it the right decision or the wrong decision in retrospect?</p><p>RONNIE AYLIFFE: Well, I think probably if anyone has heard me, there are two people in our community, and they both happened to be my immediate family members, who hold a lot of respect, and those are my father, who was the group north fire captain, he is now retired, and my brother, who is the present captain of the Bargo Rural Fire Service.</p><p>And both of them actually said quietly to the community, \"This is the safest place in the valley to be right now. We're on burnt ground. This is the safest place to be.\" And people listened and went, \"They're right.\"</p><p>This thing ripped through in the middle of the night, you know, like when you're asleep in your beds, without - with no warning.</p><p>By the time they're actually sending out an SMS warning - if you get it anyway; who gets something like that middle of the night? - it's on you.</p><p>LINDA MOTTRAM: Now, there's been a lot of anger in Cobargo. The Prime Minister, of course, now world-famously visited the town and got a very salty and angry reception last week.</p><p>Since then the Government has been rallying all sorts of resources, defence resources and so forth, and just today the Prime Minister announced $2 billion for a two-year national bush fire recovery agency.</p><p>Do you feel like your town had a voice in that, that you were heard?</p><p>RONNIE AYLIFFE: What I do know is this: if you come into a town when they're in a state of shock and grief, you'd best come with something that can alleviate that.</p><p>And if you don't, then you're not going to have that sort of...

Especially seeing as it's summertime in Australia?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Look, it's easy to make fun of those who state the bleeding obvious when it comes to temperatures topping out, but why do so many remain oblivious when it comes to the reason behind it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Heatwave headlines might seem superfluous when that's literally what this season was made for ... but the truth is there is something truly newsworthy behind the sensationalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Climate change.</p><p/><p>Yes, it's summer ... but not as we once knew it.</p><p>Almost 60 towns and cities across Australia recorded their hottest November day since records began last month, new data has revealed.</p><p>A further 40 locations saw their hottest ever November night, leading weather watcher Professor David Holmes from Monash University to observe that \"climate change is happening while we sleep\".</p><p>Further, Prof Holmes says La Nina, which was declared in October and usually brings cooler weather, may have been 'overwhelmed' by global warming.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology has already confirmed that, overall, last month was the hottest November on record in Australia, and there are indications that it could also be soon declared the hottest November worldwide following unseasonal warmth in the continental US and parts of Latin America and Europe as well as Australia.</p><p>Climate deniers may insist it's all a hoax, but why then are industries from finance to insurance to development and town planning banking on it being a part of the future?</p><p>Speaking to the Planning Institute of Australia's Queensland state manager Matt Collins, he said climate change was one of the biggest factors for planners to consider for the future.</p><p>And, unfortunately, the Gold Coast is especially vulnerable to this danger.</p><p>Rising sea levels and increased risk of bushfires in our Hinterland mean that almost every suburb could be at risk.</p><p/><p>Data compiled by the company XDI for the firm Climate Risk suggests one in six Gold Coast properties could become uninsurable due to an increased frequency of natural disasters</p><p>It projects that more than half of the current addresses in the suburbs of Palm Beach, Broadbeach Waters, and Bundall may face unaffordable insurance premiums by 2100, with potential increases of up to 55.5 per cent by 2050.</p><p>\"The Gold Coast is an extremely desirable place to live but it's that desirability that's actually the source of some of its weakness,\" chief executive of XDI Cross Dependency Initiative Rohan Hamden told the ABC late last year.</p><p>\"It's relatively low-lying land that's exposed to both sea level rise and riverine flooding to a significant degree.</p><p>\"You've got that hinterland running along the back where there's the interaction of that urban fringe with the potential for forest fire.\"</p><p>Let's be brutally honest. Dealing with the prospect of climate change is a pain in the arse.</p><p>But it's a pain worth going through for a huge gain. </p><p>Building more sustainable, less wasteful industries is surely something we should be investing in, regardless of whether or not the world is on fire.</p><p/><p>To me, it seems a no-brainer to simply conduct ourselves as though climate change is real (which it is), whether you believe it or not.</p><p>Certainly that's what some of our biggest business players are already doing.</p><p>Just recently, ANZ announced it would halt lending to its largest customers unless the businesses could prove carbon transition plans by next year.</p><p>ANZ's new emissions policies aim to support efforts to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050, with significant steps to be taken by the 2021 financial year to shape the bank's operations until 2030. </p><p>The bank will also \"only finance the construction of new large-scale office buildings if they are highly energy efficient\", and by next year, will disclose \"more robust and credible metrics\" so the impact of its lending to the power generation and commercial property industries is clearer.</p><p>ANZ's policies were sharply criticised by the Nationals, who said the moves would cripple farmers. But the question has to be asked: which hurts more - climate change policies or climate change itself?</p><p>Between a rock and a hard place, surely it's better to opt for the short-term pain that may at least give farmers land to farm in the future.</p><p>And even for a suburban parent like myself, it's clear that it's time to take action. As someone who struggles to remember to recycle, the sad fact is that my heart is willing but too often my hands are just too damn lazy.</p><p/><p>But I'm not too damn stupid to realise that this is a real problem and we all need to be part of the solution.</p><p>And if that means I need to pay more for products or be taxed more heavily, fine. Ultimately, it's an investment in my children's future. </p><p>Surely that should be bleedingly obvious to all.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LAST WEEK: </emphasis></p><p>WHERE is the line between community activism and vigilantism?</p><p>Because down in Miami, it seems it's becoming dangerously blurred.</p><p>There is no doubt that crime is an issue across the Coast, just as with any other growing city, but is it really out of control?</p><p>I live on the border of Miami and Mermaid and while there have been isolated incidents of crime in our street and in our neighbourhood, perhaps even an increase, I still feel safe.</p><p>But judging by posts on a local residents social media page, apparently I'm lucky to still be alive, let alone to remain in possession of my vehicle and home contents.</p><p>Look, I truly salute community members who care enough about their neighbourhood to devote their name, reputation and time into raising awareness on issues they care about.</p><p>And yes, that even includes my favourite anti-light rail activist Karen Rowles. We may not agree on much, but she has put her heart and soul into something she believes in and I can't argue with that. Besides, I'm quite flattered that someone made a meme out of me.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/truecrimeaustralia/police-courts/man-taken-into-custody-delays-expected-after-suspected-road-rage-incident-after-m1-crash/news-story/df70573726d2bab1acb70edfa3356df7\">IDENTITY OF MAN CHARGED OVER ROAD RAGE INCIDENT REVEALED </url></p><p/><p/><p>But the Miami Residents Group page, which began as a means to engage local politicians in acknowledging criminal activity in the area and pushing for more police, is morphing into something slightly uncomfortable.</p><p>Just one week ago this was posted by an administrator:</p><p>\"It feels that this weekend has been the last straw for many residents: car and property theft, robberies and teenage street scum attacking people on the way home from a night out, using our streets as their personal dodgem cars area, it's out of control!</p><p>\"I have been contacted by many residents wanting to start their own community based safety team. To patrol the streets at night to chase off the teenage goons causing so much trouble. </p><p>\"I warned the Premier and Police Minister this would happen if they didn't step in, I still haven't received an answer to the numerous emails I have sent them on your behalf.</p><p>\"Before neighbours start taking matters into their own hands, there is a neighbourhood watch meeting at the Nobby Beach Surf Club.

With similar populations, the state electorates of Bonney and Southport have almost double the number of assaults than the electorate of Mermaid Beach.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.goldcoastbulletin.com.au/news/gold-coast/gold-coast-crime-byron-bay-police-break-up-400person-illegal-doof-part-on-bird-sanctuary-land/news-story/9a52028b7e5f66f9db3326f1afc5980e\">BIRD SANCTUARY DAMAGED BY 400 PERSON BUSH DOOF</url></p><p/><p>And while many members of the Miami page remain dedicated to the idea of patrolling their own streets, just as many have had enough of the over-the-top approach.</p><p>\"I'm terribly sorry but this page has gotten WAY out of control,\" reads one comment. </p><p>\"Try living in any other city or Gold Coast suburb where they really have a problem with crime - this is nothing. Sadly this is what social media has made people become. A kneejerk society that can't handle anything anymore. </p><p>\"I love Miami. I feel safe in Miami. It has amazing residents and these \"crime\" posts are becoming embarrassing to say the least. </p><p>\"This isn't a utopia, it's just life. You have people stabbed and murdered in places like London just for looking at them, and people are posting about a bloody stolen fairy house. This is a VERY peaceful, normal beachside suburb. And don't forget, Miami and Palm Beach were both the absolute s***holes of the Gold Coast 15 years ago. A million times better than it was. So just chill the hell out.\"</p><p>The problem is that these social media pages - and Miami is just one example - create a skewed version of reality. By dedicating themselves to the reporting of criminal activity large and small, they manufacture the perspective that this is, in fact, the only activity occurring.</p><p>And while the members may not ever actually storm the streets with cricket bats, the inference that this could and would be a necessary undertaking only encourages others to take similar measures.</p><p>As a parent of two teen-ish children, I don't want to live in a community that seems them as the enemy. </p><p>While I can safely say that I want my neighbours to be engaged ... I do not want them enraged.

Meet the Brisbane schoolboy about to make it big in Hollywood</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Brisbane schoolboy Finn Little is about to undertake a team bonding activity with Hollywood superstar Angelina Jolie and he's more than a little starstruck.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such is the unusual and exciting life of the 14-year-old Brisbane actor. He is about to start shooting the film of his career, alongside Jolie, when she suggests they go air-softing (skirmish with plastic projectiles) to get to know each other better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I thought, 'Wow, that's amazing, I'd love to go air-softing', and then she rocked up in full black and a tactical vest and just the biggest gun,\" Little says, smiling as he mimics the Lara Croft actor's intimidating arrival.</p><p>\"She was so ready. I feel like she was too prepared to shoot me.\" Back in Brisbane two years later, Little is a quiet, unassuming schoolboy begrudgingly waiting to start the second term of Year 10, clinging onto his final days of holidays by adventuring outside or walking his golden retriever, Chef.</p><p>Unlike most restless teenagers at his inner-city high school, his reluctance to return to the classroom comes from an insatiable desire to be back on a film set, escaping into another world rather than sitting in lessons.</p><p>Little has become relatively well-known as an actor since he filmed the title role in Storm Boy in 2017 when he was 11.</p><p>But life is about to change.</p><p>Next week, Hollywood survival thriller Those Who Wish Me Dead, in which he co-stars with Jolie, will be released in Australia and the United States. Little is a relative newcomer to US audiences, and this is expected to be the breakthrough role to put his name up in lights.</p><p>Two years ago, shortly before his thirteenth birthday, Little was arriving at the pre-production office for the Warner Bros. film to be shot in New Mexico, where his co-star, Jolie, asked if he would like to shoot airsoft guns with her at the weekend.</p><p>\"It's like paint ball, just for bonding, so we got to know each other better,\" Little recalls of his second meeting with one of Hollywood's biggest names.</p><p>Little spent three months filming the blockbuster, his first role in the US, in mid-2019, following stints filming Storm Boy, Sony Pictures' miniseries Reckoning, which is airing now on Channel 7, and movie Angel of Mine alongside another haul of big-name stars including Noomi Rapace and Luke Evans.</p><p>It's an unusual life, and Little's peers have -become accustomed to his chair at school being inexplicably empty for a week or two as he's away working on another secret project. He remains diligent with his schoolwork and ensures his -assignments drop punctually into his teachers' inboxes.</p><p>When he spoke to Qweekend at the end of his school holidays, he was busy promoting Those Who Wish Me Dead before it hits cinemas this Thursday while preparing to jet off again soon for another role he can't yet discuss.</p><p>\"It was definitely something, to come back from hanging out with Angelina Jolie to school. But I always get ribbed for never being there,\" Little says.</p><p>\"Sometimes people come up to me and ask, 'Where have you been?' and I just go 'What are you talking about? I've been here the whole time'.</p><p>\"I try not to talk about it because if I do that's all I'll talk about. It's just a normal life, and then I go overseas and have awesome experiences, so I'm really just waiting to go back.</p><p>\"I think I learn more on set than I do in maths class.\" Little lives on Brisbane's northside with his mother Catherine Kidd and his older sister Mackenzie, 16. The siblings did local eisteddfods together when they were young, an activity their mother hoped would build their confidence.</p><p>When we meet, Little is softly spoken and -polite. During the Qweekend photoshoot Little admits he's never quite gotten used to the feeling of offering up different poses for a photographer, despite the long list of credits he's racked up.</p><p>He says he still vividly remembers the trepidation of his first promotional shoot for Storm Boy down to the colour of his shirt - light blue.</p><p>Kidd whispers to us behind the camera that Little's favourite music always brings him to life and when Eminem's Lose Yourself fills the studio, he smiles and instantly relaxes.</p><p>Asked if he's grown more confident since his first film, his eyes widen and he nods emphatically, settling into the photoshoot.</p><p>\"It's still a little weird. The first time I did it I was wondering what everyone thought, but I don't care anymore,\" he says.</p><p>Little's life in Brisbane is foreign to most teenagers. His agents in both Australia and the US send through auditions and Kidd helps him -record his self-tapes after school or at weekends - \"or if we're a little cheeky, it's before school\", Little says with a laugh to his mother.</p><p>His brother, Coby, 18, who lives out of home, is constantly trying to guess the next project because his little brother keeps him in the dark \"just to mess with him\".</p><p>He's away too often to do many organised -activities, so he spends his spare time climbing trees, playing basketball in the park, going fishing, walking Chef or hanging with a friend - anything outdoors.</p><p>\"It was a big excitement for Storm Boy, but it's become normal now for me to be away,\" Little says.</p><p>\"There are times when I wish I had a normal kind of life, but my life is still pretty normal right now. I'm sort of just a kid from Brisbane. But I don't think I will ever really regret it because I'm happy with what I do, because of where I go and who I meet. It's definitely interesting.</p><p>\"I don't want to have a normal life. I want to do something that helps someone.\" After Little showed promise in eisteddfods, his mother signed him and his sister to an acting agency and he began picking up roles on TV commercials and short films from age five.</p><p>At 10 he won the acting lottery, landing the titular role in Storm Boy, Shawn Seet's acclaimed adaptation of the Colin Thiele novel, which saw him filming alongside Jai Courtney and Geoffrey Rush in South Australia.</p><p>\"I was just sitting on the couch, it was a week before my birthday, and I got a call and my old agent said, 'You got Storm Boy'. It was like, 'What? This can't be happening to me'. I just got off the phone and started dancing,\" he says.</p><p>His performance set up a stream of roles for Little. Seet brought him onto his miniseries Reckoning in Sydney. His Storm Boy role also caught the eye of -director Kim Farrant, who cast him for a part on psychological thriller Angel of Mine (2019), which he filmed alongside Rapace, Evans and Australia's Yvonne Strahovski in Melbourne. When Strahovski's US management, Paradigm, saw the film, they immediately asked to represent Little in the States, as well as sending him three auditions, one of which was for Those Who Wish Me Dead.</p><p>After a phone call and three emails, Little was flying to Los Angeles with his mother in May, 2019, to do a callback audition with Jolie in a back room of Bron Studios.</p><p>\"That's Maleficent,\" Little recalls thinking, referencing Jolie's Disney character, when the megastar walked out to introduce herself to him and the two other hopeful actors.</p><p>\"It was a very emotional scene between me and her, and I was actually really nervous. I was thinking 'I want this so bad' and I just kept going over it and over it. Then I finally got in there and I thought, 'I'm just going to sort of go for it'.\" The following day, Little was in Paradigm's LA office when he got a call from the casting agent to offer him the role.</p><p>\"Everyone was just jumping around,\" he says. \"It was awesome; it was a great feeling to get my first proper international role.\" After a painful three weeks of waiting while attending school back in Brisbane, googling photos of New Mexico on his home computer at night and working on his character, Little was in the US living with his mother in their new temporary home on Route 66 in Albuquerque.</p><p>In the film he stars as teenage murder witness Connor Casserly, who finds himself pursued by twin assassins in the Montana wilderness with a survival expert, Hannah Faber (Jolie), tasked with protecting him, and a forest fire threatening them all. It's directed by Taylor Sheridan, writer of Sicario, and also stars Nicholas Hoult, Jon Bernthal and Tyler Perry.</p><p>Little met Jolie again at the pre-production office in New Mexico and, following their surprisingly intense air-softing battle, the pair formed a close bond on set, with Jolie telling the teenager she had loved Australia when she visited, having directed Unbroken in Queensland in 2014.</p><p>He particularly remembers a stunt that involved them jumping together about 3m from a cliff into a heated lake as the fake forest burned around them.</p><p>\"We were joking around beforehand and they would call action, we'd be holding hands and we'd jump off this cliff together into heated water, and that was awesome,\" he says.</p><p>\"The first time I met her I was very starstruck \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 Yes, she's Maleficent and she's Lara Croft Tomb Raider, but she's also just a really nice, down-to-earth person and she's fun to work with.</p><p>\"We sort of bounced off each other and I think there was a good connection between the two of us. She was a nice, calming but fun presence on set.\" For three months Little's days were consumed by hair and makeup, rehearsals and filming, squeezing in US accent coaching once a week via Zoom and at least two hours of daily -tutoring - either on set or in a pop-up tent on -location in the wilderness, from where he would email his teachers in Brisbane.</p><p>The high altitude in New Mexico meant the air was thin as he ran through the forest during night shoots, special pipes shooting ash and smoke into the air to replicate the forest burning.</p><p>\"We were running through that and it was super hard to breathe sometimes,\" Little says. \"They had these cans of oxygen just for anyone who needed it.</p><p>\"I don't think it was too intimidating for me. I knew my job and I knew what I needed to do. I believed in myself to do the best I could.</p><p>\"Everyone was working really hard on set all the time. I think it really paid off because the movie looks awesome.\" Now back home in Brisbane, Little is looking to transition to home schooling as he continues to juggle his blossoming acting career with the demands of the final years of high school.</p><p>He admits he often finds himself talking to teachers rather than his classmates - he's -become more accustomed to adult company in all his years' on sets.</p><p>\"That (home schooling) is how I'm hoping to finish off and then Year 12 comes and I'm a free man,\" he says with a laugh.</p><p>\"I've just been hanging out with adults on set. I haven't really done movies or TV shows with other kids and if I have they are usually older than me, so I'm usually talking to the adults or going to the library.</p><p>\"It's easy to focus (in class) but sometimes I just wish I was away on set.\" Kidd is saving her son's income in an account he won't have access to until he's at least 18, setting him up for a future that he is unsurprisingly resolute will be in acting.</p><p>She doesn't have many rules to keep him grounded; she doesn't need to. Her job is simply to be with him along the way - on set every day, on every phone call with his manager and agents, helping him understand his character and reading through his scripts and running his -Instagram account.</p><p>\"Mum helps me out a lot. You've got to put that in,\" Little says warmly, looking towards her.</p><p>\"She is awesome at helping me and super pretty.\" Kidd laughs broadly at her son's playfulness and humbly gestures with her hand in a way to stop him singing her praises.</p><p>\"I don't have to (monitor him) because he's a super-grounded kid. He's not a big noter,\" she says.</p><p>\"He's just a normal kid. He's been super lucky, he's met awesome people and it's a team effort. It doesn't change who he is and I'm proud of him.</p><p>\"That is the magic of movies. There are stunts and fires and movie stars and amazing directors. Every day is an adventure, there's something so good in every day. He's had amazing life experiences and he has an amazing life ahead of him, which is so exciting.\" Little is content that the money he's earned is being put away for him; \"I don't really need anything,\" he says.</p><p>For the teenager, who turns 15 next month, the past three years since Storm Boy have fostered such a love for acting that he can't imagine doing anything else, even though he is his own harshest critic watching his movies on the big screen.</p><p>\"I find it horrible (watching myself). I hate everything I do,\" he laughs. \"Whenever I watch Storm Boy all I can focus on is my voice and how high it is. I love the movie and I always will love it because it was my start, but I'm excited for what else is to come.</p><p>\"I want to be an actor when I'm older.

I feel like she was too prepared to shoot me.\" </p><p>Back in Brisbane two years later, Little is a quiet, unassuming schoolboy begrudgingly waiting to start the second term of grade 10, clinging onto his final days of holidays by adventuring outside or walking his golden retriever, Chef. </p><p>Unlike most restless teenagers at his inner-city high school, his reluctance to return to school comes from an insatiable desire to be back on a film set, escaping into another world rather than sitting in a class room.</p><p>Little is a relatively well-known actor since he filmed the title role in Storm Boy in 2017 when he was 11. </p><p>But life is about to change for the now 14 year old. Next week Hollywood survival thriller Those Who Wish Me Dead, in which he co-stars with Jolie, is released in Australia and the United States. A relative newcomer to US audiences the breakthrough role is about to put his name in lights. </p><p>It was this time two years ago, shortly before his thirteenth birthday, he was arriving at the pre-production office for the Warner Bros. film shot in New Mexico, where his co-star, Jolie, asked if he would shoot airsoft guns with her on the weekend.</p><p>\"It's like paint ball, just for bonding so we got to know each other better,\" Little recalls of his second meeting with one of Hollywood's biggest names. </p><p>Little spent three months filming the blockbuster, his first role in the US, in New Mexico in mid-2019, following stints filming Storm Boy, Sony Pictures' miniseries Reckoning, which is airing now on Channel 7, and movie Angel of Mine alongside another haul of big-name stars including Noomi Rapace and Luke Evans. </p><p>It's an unusual life, and Little's peers have become accustomed to his chair at school being inexplicably empty for a week or two as he's away working on another secret project. He remains diligent with his schoolwork and ensures his assignments drop punctually into his teachers' inboxes. </p><p>When he spoke to Qweekend at the end of his school holidays, he was busy promoting Those Who Wish Me Dead before it hits cinemas on May 13 while preparing to jet off again soon for another role he can't yet discuss. </p><p>\"It was definitely something, to come back from hanging out with Angelina Jolie to school. But I always get ribbed on for never being there,\" Little says. </p><p>\"Sometimes people come up to me and ask, 'Where have you been?' and I just go 'What are you talking about? I've been here the whole time'. </p><p>\"I try not to talk about it because if I do that's all I'll talk about. It's just a normal life, and then I go overseas and have awesome experiences, so I'm really just waiting to go back.\"</p><p>\"I think I learn more on set than I do in maths class.\"</p><p>Little lives on Brisbane's northside with his mother Catherine Kidd and his older sister Mackenzie, 16. The siblings did small local eisteddfods together when they were young, an activity their mother hoped would build their confidence. </p><p>When we meet Little is softly spoken and polite. During the Qweekend photoshoot Little admits he's never quite gotten used to the feeling of offering up different poses for a photographer, despite the long list of credits he's racked up since then. He says he still vividly remembers the trepidation of his first promotional shoot for Storm Boy down to the colour of his shirt - light blue. </p><p>Kidd whispers to us behind the camera that Little's favourite music always brings him to life and when Eminem's Lose Yourself fills the studio, he smiles and instantly relaxes. Asked if he's grown more confident since his first film, his eyes widen and he nods emphatically, settling into the photoshoot.</p><p>\"It's still a little weird. The first time I did it I was wondering what everyone thought, but I don't care anymore,\" he says.</p><p>Little's life in Brisbane is foreign to most teenagers. His agents in both Australia and the US send through auditions and Kidd helps him record his self-tapes after school or on weekends - \"or if we're a little cheeky, it's before school\" Little laughs to his mother. </p><p>His brother Coby, 18, who lives out of home, is constantly trying to guess the next project because his little brother keeps him in the dark \"just to mess with him\".</p><p>He's away too often to do many organised activities, so he spends his spare time climbing trees, playing basketball in the park, going fishing, walking Chef or hanging with a friend - anything outdoors. </p><p>\"It was a big excitement for Storm Boy, but it's become normal now for me to be away,\" Little says.</p><p>\"There are times when I wish I had a normal kind of life, but my life is still pretty normal right now. I'm sort of just a kid from Brisbane. But I don't think I will ever really regret it because I'm happy with what I do, because of where I go and who I meet. It's definitely interesting. I don't want to have a normal life. I want to do something that helps someone.\" </p><p>After showing promise in his eisteddfods, Little's mother signed him and his sister to an acting agency and he began picking up roles on TV commercials and short films from the age of five. </p><p>At 10 he won the acting lottery, landing the titular role in Storm Boy, Shawn Seet's acclaimed adaptation of the Colin Theile novel, which saw him filming alongside Jai Courtney and Geoffrey Rush in South Australia.</p><p>\"I was just sitting on the couch, it was a week before my birthday and I got a call and my old agent said, 'You got Storm Boy'. It was like, 'What? This can't be happening to me'. I just got off the phone and started dancing,\" he smiles.</p><p>The performance set up a stream of roles for Little. Seet brought him onto his miniseries Reckoning in Sydney and it caught the eye of director Kim Farrant for a role on psychological thriller Angel of Mine (2019), which he filmed alongside Rapace, Evans and Australia's Yvonne Strahovski in Melbourne.</p><p>When Strahovski's US management, Paradigm, saw the film, they immediately reached out and asked to represent Little in the States, as well as sending him three auditions, one of which was for Those Who Wish Me Dead.</p><p>After just one phone call and three emails, Little was flying to Los Angeles with his mother in May, 2019, to do a call back audition with Jolie in a back room of Bron Studios.</p><p>\"That's Maleficent,\" Little recalls thinking, referencing Jolie's Disney character, when the megastar walked out to introduce herself to him and the two other hopeful actors. </p><p>\"It was a very emotional scene between me and her, and I was actually really nervous. I was thinking 'I want this so bad' and I just kept going over it and over it. Then I finally got in there and I thought, 'I'm just going to sort of go for it'.\"</p><p>The following day, Little was in Paradigm's LA office when he got a call from the casting agent to offer him the role.</p><p>\"Everyone was just jumping around,\" he smiles. \"It was awesome; It was a great feeling to get my first proper international role.\"</p><p>After a painful three weeks of waiting while attending school back in Brisbane, Googling photos of New Mexico on his home computer at night and working on his character, Little was in the US living with his mother in their new temporary home on Route 66 in Albuquerque.</p><p>In the film he stars as teenage murder witness Connor Casserly, who finds himself pursued by twin assassins in the Montana wilderness with a survival expert, Hannah Faber (Jolie), tasked with protecting him, and a forest fire threatening them all. It's directed by Taylor Sheridan, writer of Sicario, and also stars Nicholas Hoult, Jon Bernthal and Tyler Perry. </p><p>Little met Jolie again at the pre-production office in New Mexico and, following their surprisingly intense air-softing battle, the pair formed a close bond on set, with Jolie telling the teenager she loved Australia when she visited, having directed Unbroken in Queensland in 2014. </p><p>He particularly remembers a stunt which involved them jumping together about ten feet from a cliff into a heated lake as the fake forest burned around them.</p><p>\"We were joking around beforehand and they would call action, we'd be holding hands and we'd jump off this cliff together into heated water, and that was awesome,\" he says.</p><p>\"The first time I met her I was very starstruck... Yes, she's Maleficent and she's Lara Croft Tomb Raider, but she's also just a really nice, down to earth person and she's fun to work with. </p><p>\"We sort of bounced off each other and I think there was a good connection between the two of us. She was a nice, calming but fun presence on set.\"</p><p>For three months Little's days were consumed by hair and makeup, rehearsals and filming, squeezing in US accent coaching once a week via Zoom and at least two hours of daily tutoring -either on set or in a pop-up tent on location in the wilderness, from where he would email his teachers back in Brisbane.</p><p>The high altitude in New Mexico meant the air was thin as he ran through the burning forest during night shoots, special pipes shooting ash and smoke into the air to replicate the forest burning.</p><p>\"We were running through that and it was super hard to breathe sometimes,\" Little says. \"They had these cans of oxygen just for anyone who needed it.\"</p><p>\"I don't think it was too intimidating for me. I knew my job and I knew what I needed to do. I believed in myself to do the best job I could.\"</p><p>\"Everyone was working really hard on set all the time. I think it really paid off because the movie looks awesome.\"</p><p>Now back home in Brisbane, Little is looking to transition to home schooling as he continues to juggle his blossoming acting career with the demands of the final years of high school, where he admits he finds himself talking to teachers rather than his classmates - he admits he's become more accustomed to adult company in all his years' on sets.</p><p>\"That (home schooling) is how I'm hoping to finish off and then year 12 comes and I'm a free man,\" he laughs, glancing upwards.</p><p>\"I've just been hanging out with adults on set. I haven't really done movies or TV shows with other kids and if I have they are usually older than me, so I'm usually talking to the adults or going to the library.\" </p><p>\"It's easy to focus (in class) but sometimes I just wish I was away on set.\"</p><p>Kidd is saving her son's income in an account he won't have access to until he's at least 18, setting him up for a future that he is unsurprisingly resolute will be in acting. </p><p>She doesn't have many rules to keep him grounded; she doesn't need to. Her job is simply to be with him along the way - on set every day, on every phone call with his manager and agents, helping him understand his character and read through his scripts and running his Instagram account.</p><p>\"Mum helps me out a lot. You've got to put that in,\" Little says warmly, looking towards her. \"She is awesome at helping me and super pretty.\"</p><p>Kidd laughs broadly at her son's playfulness and humbly gestures with her hand in a way to stop him singing her praises.</p><p>\"I don't have to (monitor him) because he's a super grounded kid. He's not a big noter,\" she says.</p><p>\"He's just a normal kid. He's been super lucky, he's met awesome people and it's a team effort. It doesn't change who he is and I'm proud of him.</p><p>\"That is the magic of movies. There's stunts and fires and movie stars and amazing directors. Every day is an adventure, there's something so good in every day.\"</p><p>\"He's had amazing life experiences and he has an amazing life ahead of him, which is so exciting.\"</p><p>Little is content that the money he's earned is being put away for him; \"I don't really need anything,\" he says.</p><p>For the teenager, who turns 15 next month, the past three years since Storm Boy have fostered such a love for acting that he can't imagine doing anything else, even though he is his own harshest critic watching his movies back on the big screen. </p><p>\"I find it horrible (watching myself). I hate everything I do,\" he laughs.</p><p>\"Whenever I watch Storm Boy all I can focus on is my voice and how high it is. I love the movie and I always will love it because it was my start, but I'm excited for what else is to come. \"</p><p>\"I want to be an actor when I'm older. I like travelling and I just like acting because it's a way to express myself and be in someone else's shoes. It's sort of an escape. I feel like I can escape from the real world a bit.\"</p><p>Little and his mother admit they will be off again soon, in and out, in the transient life they've accepted as normality, but Brisbane will always be home.</p><p>While trying to get a hint, however, about whether he's lined up another Hollywood blockbuster, Little offers up the same steel trap treatment he gives his classmates. </p><p>\"Maybe,\" he smirks, happily. </p><p>Those Who Wish Me Dead hits cinemas from May 13. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

army, firefighters, paramedics, police and even triple-0 responders.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mr Sellars was among the 1200-strong crowd who walked around St. Patrick's College on Saturday to raise awareness of mental illness at the fourth annual Walking Off The War Within event.</p><p>Hundreds of emergency service personnel - many dressed in uniform - including police, firefighters and paramedics, defence force personnel and members of the public walked alongside each other in memory of returned soldier, firefighter and mental health advocate Nathan Shanahan who lost his battle at the end of 2016.</p><p>Others were there in tribute to other servicemen, women and loved ones who have taken their lives due to a struggle with post traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression and other mental health issues.</p><p>It is a particularly important event in Ballarat, a city that has been rocked by suicide.</p><p>Recent tragedies - including high-profile football identity Danny Frawley - and statistics that show Ballarat has one of the highest male suicide rates in Victoria show the urgent need for conversation about the often not-talked-about condition of mental health.</p><p>The event comes just weeks after Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced a national commissioner for defence and veteran suicide prevention who will look into curbing the suicide rate and report back yearly.</p><p>Mr Sellars has lost a number of friends to suicide and knows many others who are still in need of mental health support.</p><p>He said seeing so many people walking in Ballarat to raise awareness and to show those suffering that they were not alone was very impactful.</p><p>He served in Darwin as part of the 1st armoured regiment with Mr Shanahan and the two were close friends, serving together for four years.</p><p>\"It's a great way for me to remember him as a soldier and what he meant to me as a mate,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Sellars said Mr Shanahan was one of the most honourable and well-respected soldiers he served with, and everyone was mates with him.</p><p>\"He always did absolutely everything he could to help you,\" he said. \"I think about Nathan every single day.\"</p><p>While he left the army 12 years ago and said at that time mental health was not widely spoken about or recognised as an illness, he hopes the red tape has been removed for people now seeking support so that it is more accessible for those who so desperately require it.</p><p>According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Mr Shanahan was among 2866 people who took their lives in 2016.</p><p>The number of suicides has increased since, with 3046 people dying by suicide in 2018 - that is 8.34 people dying by suicide each day.</p><p>For firefighter and ex-serviceman Josh Madden - who travelled from Mildura with his support golden labrador Milly - it was an emotional event given that he is struggling mentally at the moment.</p><p>Tackling the 20-kilometre challenge while carrying a 20-kilogram bag to symbolise the burden mental illness can have on a sufferer, he walked alongside mate Stuart Radley - another firefighter who knew Mr Shanahan well.</p><p>Mr Madden, who left the army three years ago, has overcome the often difficult step to seek help.</p><p>\"It was certainly tough asking for help initially but now that I've crossed that hurdle, it's easier,\" he said.</p><p>He began working as a firefighter almost immediately after departing the army, which assisted with his assimilation back into society.</p><p>Tearing up, he said the past 12 months had been particularly difficult as he was missing the military and some of his mates who have died.</p><p>Mr Madden believes the event is a good way to raise awareness of the mental health issues so many people face.</p><p>\"I think that's really all you can do - to encourage people to reach out and spread the word that it's 'okay not to be okay' and to ask for help.\"</p><p>It was also an emotional day for dozens of Forest Fire Management Victoria employees from across Victoria.</p><p>Chief Fire Officer Chris Hardman said the event was a powerful display of the camaraderie between the men and women of all services, who were united in a common desire to raise awareness of an issue that sees many of their own take their lives.</p><p>Articulating that he had always been motivated to attend the event, he said this year was particularly significant given the effect the fire season has had on so many people.</p><p>In this fire season alone, FFMV lost three friends and colleagues - David Moresi, Mat Kavanagh and Bill Slade.</p><p>\"We lost three fine human beings and to me as the chief, that was particularly difficult, but it pales in comparison to the loss felt by their friends and family,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>\"Things like this do contribute to PTSD and mental illness (for others).\"</p><p>While FFMV employs measures to ensure there is a focus on employees' well-being on the job, he said staff worked in dynamic, high-risk environments that do come with stress and often anxiety and fear which has an impact.</p><p>Explaining that he too has suffered from mental illness, though in a mild way, he said he understood what it felt like to feel hopeless but that he asked for help.</p><p>\"People still don't talk enough about mental illness. There shouldn't be a stigma associated with it.</p><p>\"It is just like any other illness - it's an illness and you can be treated for it so let's open up, let's talk, let's share our stories and talk to our mates when we're feeling they're a bit down and let's reach out to people.</p><p>\"And get professional help when needed because, like any other illness, sometimes we need a doctor.\"</p><p>For Mr Shanahan's dad John, seeing so many attend was \"wonderful\".</p><p>The event had more of a family focus this year, with a disco and children's activities.</p><p>\"It's just wonderful to see so many people and families come out and say that it is okay to speak about mental health, it is okay to talk about suicide,\" he said. \"We're all human beings and we've all been touched by it. So, let's get rid of the stigma.\"</p><p>In order for society to really tackle the issue, he said everybody from community to schools, employers and government needed to work together.</p><p>\"It's a fact of society now. And it's something that's not going to go away, unless we all work together to stamp this out,\" he said.</p><p>Lifeline on 13 11 14</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc79ilfq9x54o16hrxhtz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YB4-VDR1-JD34-V4D2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1086\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 2, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Soldier</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Suicide</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Psychological illnesses</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N624230GM</classCode><className>EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D05Y</classCode><className>MENTAL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001647</classCode><className>SUICIDE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001543</classCode><className>WALKING &amp;

He tells Roy Eccleston why we're obsessed with our houses</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What was it like growing up in England in the '60s?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My Dad was a rocket scientist and Mum worked with numbers as what was then known as a comptometrist. I guess you could have called them both a little nerdy - both interested in the ideas behind things.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dad was a huge inspiration for all three of us boys and introduced us to model-making, engineering and rudimentary car mechanics all by the age of five.</p><p>We all thought we'd be spacemen or pilots of the white arrow-like Vulcan bombers that flew over our garden at 30,000 feet - though we weren't aware of their deadly nuclear payload. There was no money to go around; we ate a diet that had evolved out of Second World War ration food (liver, ox heart, evaporated canned milk and the occasional banana). Mum knitted or sewed all our clothes for most of my childhood. But they did between them save for us all to go on holiday once a year by car (with a tent on the roof) round Europe. Those trips were inspirational.</p><p>How did you come to study opera - in Florence!</p><p>Singing is a remarkable experience: it's guttural and profound to feel your body reverberate to a noise you're making and it's meant to be very good for you, if not your neighbours. I sang at school from an early age and have always loved music. It seems to make up a missing piece of me. But singing isn't necessarily a great way to make a living.</p><p>Besides, a great mentor of mine, a musician called Ivor Davies, came to see me in Italy when I was studying there in 1977 and told me I should not accept the offer of a further course at the conservatory but go to Cambridge, where I had a place. My Dad wrote a letter (the only one I remember him ever writing) also sternly pointing out the waywardness of a musical career. They kept a place for me in Florence but I didn't go back.</p><p>What made you switch to theatre design?</p><p>I had a meandering path through university, following interests as diverse as architecture, design, languages, theatre and graphics. I've always been a do-er - active and pragmatic - and in a way the academic path was harder for me. Theatre design was an opportunity to retrain, combine the things I liked and meet interesting actressy-type girls.</p><p>Was there an audition for Grand Designs, and how were you qualified? Haha! \"There was \"no\" audition. I was asked if I'd do a pilot series, having done a few slots for the BBC here and there. My semi-academic, semi-design background (that's posh for jack-of-all-trades) seemed to fit the television need. In a way, I'm an ideal piece of telly fluff.</p><p>You've flitted about a bit career wise. What made you stick with the show for 20 years?</p><p>Don't be rude about my career path. Only I'm allowed to criticise it. And, anyway, the road less travelled is a longer route covering many more miles in a lifetime. Worth following, in my view. I've had the privilege of filming in extraordinary places and meeting wild and wonderful people.</p><p>I've laid on the floor of the Pantheon in Rome at dawn, climbed glaciers, hung off cathedral spires and spent weeks living in jungles and slums - all powerful and unusual experiences in a television career that has sprung from the success of Grand Designs, which I still enjoy doing! It is quite simply one of the best jobs in the world so why would I stop?</p><p>What's the secret to its popularity?</p><p>Proper storytelling where every narrative is fresh. Proper filmmaking where the story is made in the edit and not predetermined or pre-scripted as so much television now is. Proper production values. And the setting out of the last great adventure that we all imagine we could go on: building our own home.</p><p>How do you choose the projects?</p><p>We have to work hard to find them. We email architects and surveyors. We refuse to tell the same story twice and look for originality. We demand a lot of information for our due diligence and scrutinise the viability of each project. That's a continual process running alongside the filming. At any one time we'll have 20 to 25 projects running concurrently alongside four to five in development. That makes it sound like a factory, doesn't it? In truth our team consists of 11 people, some of whom I've worked with for 20 years.</p><p>Building is stressful. Has anyone got really angry with you? I'm sorry, I wasn't concentrating on the question - I'm nursing this black eye.</p><p>Have there been any cases of \"this isn't going to work\" and abandoning them? No. We see things through; it's just too expensive to abandon projects once we've started filming. We do \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 weed out the duff ones. And of course a few do fall by the wayside. Maybe one a year.</p><p>So why are we obsessed with our homes?</p><p>Place attachment. A powerful psychological connection to our surroundings that we reinforce daily by endorsement with those around us. It almost defines what a community is, how our public and private relationships work and how we express collective fear of change and threat to where we live - be that a wolf at the door of the cave, a forest fire that might engulf our paradise or the big piece of infrastructure (road, bypass, dam, wind turbine) that is going to get \"done\" to us. We express place attachment in our cushions and knick-knacks, our gardens and our decorations.</p><p>What's your definition of \"good design\"for a home?</p><p>Good organisation; zero-energy buildings; sensitivity to place, to light and sun; plenty of storage; connection to the sky and to landscape when it's there; intelligent and energy-efficient construction; height; compression and release; drama; intelligent layouts; firmness, commodity and delight - see Vitruvius (a Roman architect and engineer). It's certainly not size. Size does not equal space. Space doesn't even equal space because what matters is a sense of space and connection to it. Even a small attic room can have a skylight which offers a view of the stars, sun, moon and clouds and connects you, literally, to infinity.</p><p>What's an example of your favourite piece of architecture and why? Any small, beautifully laid out and crafted home. And the Pantheon in Rome.</p><p>What is the biggest change in home design you'd like to see but have not? Sustainable design, construction and furnishings. Universal adoption of low-to-zero-energy homes and buildings that generate their own needs.</p><p>The World According to Kevin McCloud is at the Festival Theatre, February 15.Tickets kevinmccloudlive.com.au</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-688a423e486c11ea91d06be3148349e9ab5d4606126f70d14c11b1a35093ed2e</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVSUN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y6K-SBC1-F0JP-W3JX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>SAWeekend Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 15, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>ST0009UGQ</classCode><className>THEATER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0008X8V</classCode><className>MENTORS &amp; ROLE MODELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N236100CC</classCode><className>RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GX018</classCode><className>ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC628</classCode><className>ENGLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

All the other deputy captains in the Glen Alice brigade are pretty much farmers as well,\" he said.</p><p>\"We were dealing with drought before any of these fires started and then last winter was the busiest winter we've had. We were called out nearly every weekend through winter as well. So we knew it was going to be bad.\"</p><p>Tim has lived down in Glen Alice for around 24 years and has been part of the RFS for just as long but had never seen a fire like Gospers Mountain before.</p><p>\"We've had big fires out in the Wollemi National Park, it's not the first time the Wollemi's burnt since I've been here, but it was definitely the biggest and went on for the longest,\" he said.</p><p>READ MORE: 'Made in Lithgow': There's nothing quite like a Nanna's Touch</p><p>\"It encircled us and went right round the back of us down into Glen Davis and then back up towards Capertee, then it came round the other side and headed towards Rylstone as well.\"</p><p>Tim said the whole situation was \"crazy come normal\".</p><p>\"I think that was what a lot of us thought about it all, I think it affected a lot of us,\" he said.</p><p>\"Especially when it ended the way it did you know, it rained and put it out and it ended, it didn't take a long time to end, it just sort of went on for a long time, then it rained and it was over.\"</p><p>But just because the fire was over, didn't mean it was over for those who fought so hard to protect the community.</p><p>\"It was really hard for a while...it is really hard to explain, and I know a lot of the other guys who worked just as hard did as well, I think many of us had trouble after the fire was over, just because it stopped,\" he said.</p><p>READ MORE: A small celebration for a big milestone; Rydal Station celebrate 150 years</p><p>The longest Tim had spent on a fire was on Fathers Day in 2019, spending the whole day fighting but at the end of the day he could come home and it would be over, but this fire took not only physical but mental strength to fight.</p><p>\"Once this started and we were called to go up and start having a look at it up on top of the cliff face and give them national parks guys a hand I don't think any of us had any idea what we were in for,\" he said.</p><p>\"We were juggling farming, my senior deputy runs about 1000 head of cattle on the farm that he manages and spending around $30,000 a week feeding their cattle before this fire started.</p><p>\"So it gives you some ideas of the sort of we were struggling with.</p><p>Tim and his crew would come home around three or four in the morning and then head back out around 7 or 8am and do it all over again.</p><p>They did that for nearly three months.</p><p>\"It was something like I've never experienced, no one told us what it was gonna be like,\" he said.</p><p>\"We melted trucks, it got that hot in some places, we had helicopters dump water on us, we melted trucks with the rear vision mirrors, the lights, the front grills.</p><p>\"Some pretty intense moments as well, but we're still here.\"</p><p>Glen Alice didn't lose one house and no one had any injuries bar a couple of minor scratches.</p><p>\"So we did well those whole three months and I think that is pretty amazing,\" he said.</p><p>Once the fire was over, the town basically went into lockdown with COVID-19 restrictions. This meant the brigade couldn't have their annual general meeting or even just come together once the fire was over.</p><p>\"It was something we were all looking forward to and it hasn't happened,\" Tim said.</p><p>\"I think a lot of people have been left and we've been sort of left out and still have this sort of empty feeling.</p><p>\"We just haven't been able to talk about it and some people have got some amazing stories.\"</p><p>READ MORE: La Salle students dress up to raise money for Caritas Australia</p><p>Tim said they are looking forward to finally hosting their AGM because a lot of people donated money to them to be able to hold a party.</p><p>\"It will be a crazy night but it's just something we need to do I think,\" he said.</p><p>\"It definitely affected me and I'm not the only one. I don't know. I'm not the only one, even members of other crews have been affected because we haven't been able to sit down and talk with everybody about it.</p><p>Tim said it has been hard because of how close everyone in the community is.</p><p>\"My captain is also my neighbour, the guys I'm fighting with are also my friends,\" he said.</p><p>Tim said that Glen Alice was a very hard but very beautiful place to live and to see it thriving now after such a traumatic event was \"pretty cool\".</p><p>READ MORE: Hot pink mullet?

We must not forget.\"</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is impossible to weep.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I cannot weep because this is only the beginning. Logs smoulder on our ridges, a tide of injured wildlife is sweeping down into our refuge. I have been living out of a suitcase for most of the past six weeks, evacuated twice, sleeping in many different places and accepting generosity too great to count. I need to clean the pink sludge from the fridge (hint: remove watermelon from fridge before evacuating), keep putting out food and water stations, cope as desperately injured wildlife emerges from the flames, and help others in every possible way I can.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Focus on what you can do. Don't cry for what you can't.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I also cannot weep because I dare not even imagine yet all that we've lost. Friends have lost their houses and towns, entire communities have been displaced, the social links that make us who we are, as social beings, turned to smoke. Tourist towns have no tourists - or the heritage buildings that made them tourist towns. Businesses are bankrupt. Evacuees like me have lost months of paid work, with more lost months to come. I am OK. Many are not.</p><p>The carefully planted local Indigenous \"food larder\" landscape I have loved and depended upon most of my life, and that has survived 200 years of colonisation, cannot survive fires like these. Farms and vast areas of bush already teetered on a knife-edge in the worst drought in history. Now they are ash. The Araluen Valley, south-east of Braidwood in New South Wales' Southern Tablelands, has lost much of its remaining peach orchards. Will the orchardists replant? We don't know.</p><p>I do know our community will support them. And that I have never been prouder of my nation.</p><p>Leaderless, leaders emerged; the magnificent firies, but also those who defended their houses and others with nothing but hoses and determination. Our neighbour, Robyn, singlehandedly waited to defend her farm while checking on the properties of those who had evacuated, knowing that with age or injury we would now be a hindrance, not a help, on the fire front.</p><p>Friends in their 70s and 80s, who would not want to be called old men, have been out for days or nights for three months with the tankers. I have seen a man, dying in great pain, still struggle towards the flames to give his wisdom on where the fire might go; <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">I have seen wombats share their holes with snakes, quolls, possums and a nervous swamp wallaby</emphasis>; a fridge on the highway kept constantly stocked with cold drinks for those defending us; six firies leaning against the hospital wall, too exhausted to stagger inside for first aid. The next day they went out again.</p><p>Last term, a local school was asked how many of their students were suffering bushfire trauma. Their answer? All of them. Every child had either watched fire rage and flicker round their house or has a best friend who is still white-faced and silent. The teachers spent the final weeks of the school year creating joy: a school rain dance, a book give-away, an ???Academy Awards' ceremony far more hilarious than any real one. When kids look back in 20 years, I hope they will remember community fun and kindness, not the terror.</p><p>Bryan and I have been offered rooms, clothes, help with tending the wildlife, cups of tea, smiles. And the smiles meant a lot. I'm part of a daily network asking by text and email: are you OK? Do you need help? How is Carol? Have you heard from Harry?</p><p>Peter Marshall, who lent us the evacuation room where I began this article, has faced the flames every night for the past week, as well as for months before that. He described how the \"fire came screaming at us out of Monga Forest like 10,000 B29s on full throttle\". Eucalypts exploded in the heat. And then the fire reached his farm, and stopped. For 30 years he slowly created a landscape that stops fire. Yes, it can be done, just as we can - and must - now build homes that are fire, flood and windproof. This is just the beginning.</p><p>What do we need?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DO NOT FORGET.</emphasis> This is most Australians' first taste of climate change. But we are the descendants of those who have faced Ice Ages, plagues, wars, famine. Most humans died. Our ancestors did not. When times are hardest, humans are capable of the greatest kindness and innovation. The best way to survive the decades to come is by forging strong community links, because when disaster strikes, those links will stand strong.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DO NOT FORGET.</emphasis> Because those who make vast sums of money from businesses that, as a side effect, destroy our planet, put vast sums into PR or political campaigns so that laws are never made to hinder their actions. The politicians who denied climate change, the need for disaster planning and firefighting equipment, and who cut fire budgets by 30-40 per cent this year alone - despite warnings from their own experts that we faced catastrophes this year - will use political spin ... let's just call it lying ??? to try to make you forget before the next election.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DO NOT FORGET.</emphasis> Because the federal fire aid has only been offered now because of the rage of \"quiet Australians\". You and I and every Australian who expressed contempt has achieved this. We must keep demanding what is needed. Unless we keep up the rage, the passion and compassion, our children and our children's children will die in more climatic disasters, from winds to cyclones, floods, tornadoes, bushfires and storm surges: the \"new normal' of the Anthropocene.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DO NOT FORGET.</emphasis> Because long after these flames are doused, there will be traumatised kids, fireys who collapse when the adrenalin seeps away, businesses destroyed, half a billion wildlife killed, with just as many injured, starving, needing food and water stations if their species is to survive.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DO NOT FORGET.</emphasis> How we have worked together, fighting disaster without political leadership, leaders emerging in their own communities, from those who fought the flames to those who offered rooms, diverted traffic amidst red smoke, raised funds or simply offered all the smiles they could find. Do not forget that when we acted together we achieved miracles.</p><p>This is the comfort we must give our children: in the past weeks, Australia has been a truly great nation. We must remain one.</p><p>We must not forget.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jackie French was the 2015 Senior Australian of the Year and the 2014-2015 Children's Laureate.

He said seeing so many people walking to raise awareness and to show those suffering that they were not alone was very impactful.</p><p>But he also said real action needed to be taken to further support service personnel going forward.</p><p>\"Something really needs to be done to support service personnel - army, firefighters, paramedics, police and even 000 responders.</p><p>\"If something isn't done, too many more lives will be lost.\"</p><p>While he left the army 12 years ago and said at that time mental health was not widely spoken about or recognised as an illness, he hopes the red tape has been removed for people now seeking support so that it is more accessible for those who so desperately require it.</p><p>According to data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Nathan was among 2866 people who took their lives in 2016.</p><p>The number of suicides has increased since, with 3046 people dying by suicide in 2018 - that is 8.34 people dying by suicide each day.</p><p>Josh Madden travelled from Mildura to attend the event, supported by his service dog Milly - a golden labrador who provides him with emotional support.</p><p>A firefighter and an ex serviceman too, attending the event was emotional given that he is struggling mentally at the moment.</p><p>Tackling the 20-kilometre challenge while carrying a 20-kilogram bag to symbolise the burden mental illness can have on a sufferer, he walked alongside his mate Stuart Radley - another firefighter who knew Nathan well.</p><p>While Mr Madden, who left the army three years ago, is struggling at the moment, he has overcome the often difficult step to seek help and now has strong support from those around him.</p><p>\"It was certainly tough asking for help initially but now that I've crossed that hurdle, it's easier,\" he said.</p><p>He began working as a firefighter almost immediately after departing the army, which assisted with his assimilation back into society.</p><p>\"It's quite similar to military life and I have that team environment where everyone's got your back,\" he said.</p><p>Tearing up, he said the past 12 months had been particularly difficult, however, as he was missing the military and some of his mates who have died.</p><p>Mr Madden believes the event is a good way to raise awareness of the mental health issues so many people face.</p><p>\"Events like this are fantastic and there's a lot of very important people here, raising awareness and asking people to speak out about their struggles,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think that's really all you can do - to encourage people to reach out and spread the word that it's okay not to be okay and to ask for help.\"</p><p>It was also an emotional day for many, including many Forest Fire Management Victoria employees.</p><p>Dozens attended from all over Victoria.</p><p>Chief Fire Officer Chris Hardman said the event was a powerful display of the camaraderie between the men and women of all services, who were united in a common desire to raise awareness of an issue that sees many of their own take their lives.</p><p>Articulating that he had always been motivated to attend the event, he said this year was particularly significant given the effect the fire season has had on so many people.</p><p>In this fire season alone, FFMV lost three friends and colleagues - David Moresi, Mat Kavanagh and Bill Slade.</p><p>\"We lost three fine human beings and to me as the chief, that was particularly difficult, but it pales in comparison to the loss felt by their friends and family.</p><p>\"Things like this do contribute to PTSD and mental illness [for others],\" he said.</p><p>While FFMV employs measures to ensure there is a focus on employees' well-being on the job, he said staff worked in dynamic, high risk environments that do come with stress and often anxiety and fear which has an impact.</p><p>Explaining that he too has suffered from mental illness, though in a mild way, he said he understands what it feels like to feel hopeless but that he asked for help.</p><p>\"People still don't talk enough about mental illness. There shouldn't be a stigma associated with it.</p><p>\"It is just like any other illness - it's an illness and you can be treated for it so let's open up, let's talk, let's share our stories and talk to our mates when we're feeling they're a bit down and let's reach out to people.</p><p>\"And get professional help when needed because, like any other illness, sometimes we need a doctor.\"</p><p>Nathan started the Walking Off The War Within in April 2015, when he walked more than 400-kilometres from Mildura to Adelaide carrying a 20-kilogram pack to raise awareness and funds for PTSD and depression.</p><p>But sadly, he lost his battle in December 2016.</p><p>The following April, a Walking Off The War Within event was hosted and attended by more than 1000 people, continuing the legacy that he started.</p><p>There are now a number of events hosted in cities across Australia each year.</p><p>For his dad, John Shanahan, seeing so many attend was \"wonderful\".</p><p>The event had more of a family focus this year, with a disco and children's activities - and Mr Shanahan said this was incredibly important.</p><p>\"It's just wonderful to see so many people and families come out and say that it is okay to speak about mental health, it is okay to talk about suicide.</p><p>\"We're all human beings and we've all been touched by it. So, let's get rid of the stigma,\" he said.</p><p>\"Events like this are really great for people to show that there are people that care for them.\"</p><p>The family reflected on the third anniversary of Nathan's death in December but Mr Shanahan said it was distressing to see the number of annual suicides increasing.</p><p>In order for society to really tackle the issue, he said everybody from community to schools, employers and government needed to work together.</p><p>\"It's a fact of society now. And it's something that's not going to go away, unless we all work together to stamp this out,\" he said.</p><p>If you or someone you know is in need of crisis support, phone Lifeline on 13 11 14.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc79i2t9j45tc1623nrhtz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y9X-W7B1-F0J6-J47Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1256\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Internet Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 1, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Psychological illnesses</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Suicide</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cause of death</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D05Y</classCode><className>MENTAL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001113</classCode><className>MENTAL ILLNESS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

While temperatures soared, the sun did not shine. The usually blue skies turned red, quiet suburban streets were blanketed in thick black smoke only broken up by red and blue lights and the roaring sounds of flames and sirens. </p><p>It seemed the worst of the fire just kept coming. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/illawarra-star/nsw-bushfires-kiola-and-north-durras-residents-told-to-seek-shelter/news-story/3496cab8609b72ab7353f590000bbeaa\">First it ripped through Bawley Point and Termeil on December 5</url>, bringing a sense of relief to many when it finally subsided. But the heat, coupled with months of zero rainfall fanned the fire, which erupted again on New Year's Eve, engulfing Conjola Park, where it decimated 89 homes.</p><p/><p/><p>The famous beaches became a place of sanctuary and safety, as holiday makers and locals were left stranded, waiting for the flames to pass. </p><p>In early December, it seemed unbelievable that things could get worse, but the monster continued to grow, stretching north to the town of Kangaroo Valley and as far south as Brogo, near Bega.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/illawarra-star/some-of-the-most-incredible-photos-captured-at-the-currowan-bushfire/news-story/721b99a9221e32c5ab60f2ef92b6e478\">Through December and January, communities were faced with immediate and terrifying danger</url>, with everyday people forced to make horrific decisions, some that separated them from their families, some that saw them lose, or save, their homes, and some that tragically claimed their lives. </p><p>While this December has been mild with plenty of rain, it can't be forgotten that entire communities are still living through the impacts of last year's black summer, there are residents who have just barely started to pick up the pieces and rebuild their lives, and more who won't for some time yet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">THE SOUTH COAST'S NEW YEAR'S EVE HORROR</emphasis></p><p>On New Year's Eve, the Badja Forest fire reached the far south coast, burning through 315,512ha over more than a month, destroying more than 400 homes and claiming four lives, including <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/cobargo-bushfires-family-of-father-and-son-killed-in-bushfires-suffer-another-tragic-loss/news-story/f852547cb936c122ecb2163c5ae503cc\">62-year-old Robert Salway and his son, 29-year-old Patrick Salway at Wandella.</url></p><p>On the far south coast, the small community of Cobargo was the hardest hit, with 70 homes lost, five facilities destroyed, 168 outbuildings lost and a further 33 homes damaged by fire.</p><p>It was followed by the largest evacuation of people in the nation's history, with tourists from Nowra to the Victorian border ordered to go home by the NSW Rural Fire Service.</p><p/><p/><p>Cobargo dairy farmer and Bega Valley councillor Tony Allen was a close friend of the Salways, and said he, unlike many others, was lucky not to lose all his stock and family homes.</p><p>\"Our cows sought shelter in gullies, and we were lucky the wind changed and took the fire south,\" he said.</p><p>\"Embers were landing all around the property and all the paddocks around us were lit with fire. Just the fury of it was immense, and as one person told me, the fire had hate written all through it.</p><p>\"It rolled through paddocks like a tidal wave. The pace and heat of it was unforgettable.\"</p><p>Mr Allen said so unique was the scale of the fires, the local Djiringanj people have stories of floods and sea level rise but not fire.</p><p/><p>He said residents who stayed to protect homes succeeded in doing so but say they will never do it again.</p><p>\"It was an awful fight. It's different to fear. Once you've made your decision to stay, you have to do what you can do to survive,\" Mr Allen said.</p><p>He said the loss of lives \"will be felt for a long time\", and the town was lucky hundreds of people miraculously escaped through flames.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS</emphasis></p><p>Mr Allen said mental health in the region is still the biggest concern, and a doorknocking of every home and a needs-based analysis of every resident should've been completed as soon as possible.</p><p>\"When I'm out there talking to people it is an issue,\" he said.</p><p>\"There are some very sad cases of broken marriages and people made destitute.</p><p>\"You don't realise how bad it is unless you've been in it.</p><p/><p>\"We should've gone house to house to make sure everyone was accounted for and professional councillors brought in to help people.</p><p>\"Everyone is doing their best, but there is a lot of sadness out there.</p><p>\"There's adults living in caravans who've worked hard their whole lives and suddenly everything is gone. It's an awful shock.\"</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">REBUILDING AND RECOVERY</emphasis></p><p>Mr Allen said just one in five destroyed homes have been approved to rebuild, and the difficulty in getting builders and tradespeople means some residents are looking at another 12 months before rebuilding.</p><p>In the first nine months of 2020, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/thesouthcoastnews/south-coast-bushfires-residents-say-planning-crisis-is-stopping-them-rebuild/news-story/145e3009540a1895a6a5a808afa6337f\">there have been 447 DAs</url> - including 142 new dwellings - lodged in Bega Valley Shire Council alone with a combined total of almost $176 million.</p><p>\"It's an enormous process to go through. A lot of people have run out of insurance claims that were subsidising rent for 12 months and a lot of people were uninsured,\" Mr Allen said.</p><p>He said a memorial Cobargo Resilience Centre is being planned for the refurbished town centre at Cobargo, fitted with a theatre, cafe, ice creamery, garden, museum and a reflection centre.</p><p/><p>Danielle Murphy and Chris Walters, who help run the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/crazy-five-months-and-billions-of-dollars-on-from-bushfire-cobargo-remains-in-ruins/news-story/773bee550ede34465c49e769556bbc30\">Cobargo Recovery Centre </url>four days a week, said letters of support and gifts sent from across the country have helped keep many residents from hitting rock bottom.</p><p>The centre will be open for 24 hours on New Year's Eve, in case residents need support through the anniversary of the deadly blaze.</p><p>Ms Walters said many residents are looking for some form of \"hope to hold on to\".</p><p>\"What we're seeing is people are pretty exhausted,\" Ms Walters said.</p><p>\"They've been battling red tape, and are now almost at Christmas and the anniversary of the fires. People are pretty low.</p><p>\"Some days people are chirpy, but the next day they'll fall in a heap. There are very mixed feelings.\"</p><p>Ms Walters said residents are \"not looking too far into the future\" and focused on the \"day-to-day struggle\" of recovery.</p><p/><p>Ms Murphy, who helped evacuate three homes on New Year's Eve and famously confronted Scott Morrison at the evacuation centre, said for some residents the trauma of the devastating fires is only just sinking in.</p><p>\"People who have been stoic are now crying for the first time,\" she said.</p><p>\"As we're approaching the anniversary the media is showing images of the fires, and bringing it back up for people. I kind of forgot it was that big. It's overwhelming to see it on that scale.\"</p><p>Ms Murphy said many residents are suffering from \"form fatigue\", and are seeking help they didn't need six months ago to fill out grant applications.</p><p>\"It's becoming way too much for people,\" she said.</p><p>Numbugga resident Janet Reynolds has faced three bushfires since 2018 when she tragically lost her home.</p><p>The 75-year-old is yet to rebuild and has been living between Bega and a caravan on her property since evacuating from the Black Summer fires on New Year's Eve. </p><p>Her home became an unofficial evacuation centre for many older residents, and says she worries for future generations if fires become more common.</p><p/><p>Many of her friends have created elaborate sprinkler systems in anticipation of future fires.</p><p>\"The fires at the beginning of this year were very disturbing and distressing for our community,\" she said.</p><p>\"There is resilience and also a quiet acceptance that the future is uncertain. There is a lot of anger at the inaction of our government in the area of climate action.\"</p><p>She said through the tragedy, she has seen \"the best of human nature\" with communities coming together and strangers lending a hand.</p><p>\"I try not to become anxious, and take one day at a time,\" she said.</p><p>\"My days are running out but I want to leave a beautiful legacy and create a haven for birds and native animals before I go.\"</p><p>In the Eurobodalla, around 80 per cent of the shire, or more than 271,000 hectares, was burnt, around 500 homes were destroyed, a further 280 damaged and more than 1230 additional facilities and outbuildings lost or damaged. Three lives were lost.</p><p>In the Shoalhaven, council received a total of 111 development applications for bush fire impacted properties, most south of Sussex Inlet, at a value of almost $45 million, while in the Eurobodalla 282 applications were received.</p><p>At the time of the fires, NSW recovery co-ordinator, Dick Adams, described the recovery process as the largest operations in Australia's history.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, ONE YEAR ON</emphasis></p><p>The morning of January 4 in the small community of Kangaroo Valley started out like many other days in the weeks leading up to it - smoky, hot and windy. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/battle-to-defend-historic-kangaroo-valley-in-southern-highlands/news-story/ae0941bed18bae620d59b6a1b665e7c0\">But by 1.30pm that afternoon, it became clear the valley was not going to be spared by the huge blaze that had already engulfed so much of the south coast. </url></p><p>Alison Baker, who raised her now-adult children in the Valley with her husband Paul Williams, remembers that it was precisely at that time when she realised staying and defending her property was no longer an option. </p><p/><p>\"I got visuals from Tallowa (nearby) and what I saw made me realise there was no option to stay and defend our home,\" she said. </p><p>Ms Baker and Mr Williams have lived and worked in Kangaroo Valley for years, running holiday cottage accommodation on their Radiata Road property. </p><p>After doing all they could to ready their home, Ms Baker and Mr Williams got a call at 6.30pm, telling them they had 45 minutes to get off the property as southerly winds approached, pushing the fire toward their home. </p><p>The couple sheltered at their neighbour's concrete home, thinking they'd be there for 30 minutes as the fire passed through. </p><p>\"But that wasn't the fire that descended upon our house,\" Ms Baker said. \"We got back at 10.30pm that Saturday night to find what we did\". </p><p/><p>Their timber home of 25 years was now a pile of rubble on the ground, and two of their accommodation cottages had burned down. </p><p>\"(When we) got back, the timber uprights on the other cottages were burning, but because we had 20 litre tubs of water at each door we were able to put out the fires,\" she said. </p><p>\"Had we not have been able to get back (to our property) the fires could have taken them too.\"</p><p>Ms Baker said it was surreal coming back to her home and finding the green landscape black and charred. </p><p>\"For myself I don't really remember the emotion of the night, it's happily in some box where it will stay,\" she said. </p><p>\"But coming back two hours later there was nothing green, not a plant, tree bush, not a stick of greenery.\" </p><p>The fire that night destroyed dozens of homes in Kangaroo Valley. While it ruined cars, homes and years of memories, the blaze did nothing to bring down the Valley's community spirit. </p><p>And it's that sense of community that led Ms Baker and her husband to rebuild in the Valley, despite the horrific fire they endured. </p><p/><p>\"Throughout January so many people turned up to help out with trailers, tools, mulch to help us get a good start, and tradespeople bent over backwards to help us,\" she said. </p><p>Almost all of the past year has centred on getting the business back up and running - which means the rebuild on their home is yet to start. </p><p>\"We've still got a lot to do here around the build of home, and we're hoping to get things underway in the new year,\" she said. \"In terms of council, they've been very supportive, probably because Shoalhaven was affected all the way down.\" </p><p>As the one-year anniversary of the tragic fire draws closer, Ms Baker said she and her family were looking forward to a new pace in 2020, as well as welcoming people back to their cottages for the busy Christmas season.</p><p>\"I think we are looking forward to getting away a bit more, not being here 24/7,\" she said. </p><p>\"Being here and being able to get up every morning is fabulous, but in the same token you've got to get up and you pick your job and you put your head down and do it.</p><p>\"We have our own special story but I think everybody is hoping the new norm is easier to digest in 2020.\"</p><p>While January 4 is set to bring up some tough memories for the community of Kangaroo Valley, Ms Baker said it was comforting to be in a community that's drawn together through crisis. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

If the community wanted A, but we couldn't deliver A, we work with them on what the alternative looks like to get to that outcome.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Working in a pandemic<br/>Working closely with local communities has of course been made difficult by the pandemic. <br/><br/>Key strategies around improving resilience and cohesion by \"bringing communities together through events\", including town hall-style engagement efforts, have had to be rethought. <br/><br/>Plans for community recovery hubs offering face-to-face meetings for financial or planning support have had to be tweaked to turn them into \"digital kiosks\". <br/><br/>This has required tech support, as many people living in bush communities have poor technology skills and internet connectivity. But there's also been an unexpected upside to helping people overcome these barriers, too. <br/><br/>\"If they were finishing talking to a legal adviser or insurance company, they had the capacity to then, as an example, Skype the grandkids in Sydney, when they might not have been able to connect with them before,\" says Miezis. <br/><br/>It's also been \"fascinating\" setting up a new agency in a pandemic, he adds. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"Some people who are working for the organisation we haven't actually met in person, so the challenge of building an organisation, of forming a culture, of making sure we're able to support our staff through quite traumatic subject matter, it's been a real challenge.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Measures such as daily check-ins and all-staff conferences have helped ensure staff stay connected. <br/><br/>Miezis has even had to recruit an entire senior team over video conferencing. <br/><br/>\"I tend to be a person who goes with a bit of gut instinct and likes to be able to sit in a room with someone and was unable to do that,\" he says. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"So we had to pivot and had to rely a lot more on psychometric testing than I probably have in the past, and that proved invaluable to get good insights into people, and particularly the mix of people we were bringing in.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Has the experience made him rethink recruitment? <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"I don't think it's necessarily changed what I look for and how I recruit, in particular thinking about the collective and how the team work together and complement one another, complement my skills, complement what I'm not as strong at. But I was reliant on different tools and systems to get those insights, instead of gut and instinct and reacting to someone when you're sitting in a room with them.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>It's a rare opportunity to build a new team from scratch, so Miezis has tried to make the best of the situation despite the challenges. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"It's been interesting. I don't think I'll ever have another opportunity -- hopefully I don't -- to build an organisation that has continued to work remotely for 75% of its existence.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>From the bush to the corner office<br/>Although he doesn't get much chance to go into the bush these days, it was what started Miezis on his career path. <br/><br/>\"I went into forestry because I loved the bush and being outside,\" he says. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"I never thought I'd end up working out of a major city, to be honest, let alone as CEO of Bushfire Recovery Victoria.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Nevertheless, the new job fits perfectly. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"I've been driven by three things in my career.

A couple of days later it awarded contracts for the clean up process. Teams were quickly set up in northeast Victoria and east Gippsland to start working in local communities. <br/><br/>\"It's what I would call a crowdsourced model, where we reached out to all the other departments and built ourselves through secondments,\" says CEO Lee Miezis, who moved across from his role as deputy secretary for forest, fire and regions at the Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. <br/><br/>The agency's fundamental role is working in partnership with local communities to ensure the specific needs of each are met through the recovery, he tells\u00a0<emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Mandarin --</emphasis> communities contending not only with fire damage and loss of life, but the evaporation of tourism dollars and the effects of years of drought leading up to the fires. <br/><br/>\"The mantra of the organisation is really: the local community know best what the local challenges are, what the local opportunities are, and can tell us how we can best support them in their long-term recovery,\" says Miezis. <br/><br/>Bushfire Recovery Victoria's mission is built on five pillars. The first four are standard elements of a disaster recovery plan: buildings and infrastructure, economic recovery, people and wellbeing, and biodiversity and environment. <br/><br/>The last, Aboriginal culture and healing, is a newer area of focus for this kind of effort. There's an Aboriginal reference group, and the agency recently appointed Charles O'Leary program director for Aboriginal culture and healing. The aim is to build in principles of self-determination, giving Indigenous communities \"a direct voice in program design and program delivery\". <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"That was really to make sure there is an appropriate and culturally sensitive focus on Aboriginal people, given the large population of Aboriginal people in the fire-affected areas, and the particular impact these fires had on country.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Bushfire Recovery Victoria will also be a permanent agency, unlike the earlier Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority, which spent two years leading rebuilding after Black Saturday. <br/><br/>This is to reflect \"the long-term nature of recovery\", says Miezis -- as well as the increasing frequency of catastrophic fires. <br/><br/>He also hopes it will help preserve knowledge and experience in one place. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"Knowing we have a library and a guidebook we can pull off the shelf and tailor to a particular event, I think we'll be able to respond quicker. In the absence of that sort of dedicated agency, we find we're almost building the plane and flying it as the same time.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>The exact work to be done will depend on where in the recovery process those communities are. Initially there was a focus on emergency accommodation and relief; at the moment it's cleaning up. Community recovery committees have been formed and hubs created, which will allow locals to inform the priorities in future. <br/><br/>Even the establishment of the committees has reflected the individual circumstances of different towns: whereas Mallacoota \"went through a very formal electoral commission-supported nomination voting process\", Sarsfield built its committee \"through an existing community committee\". <br/><br/>Adapting to community needs, rather than taking a top-down approach, inevitably brings challenges. <br/><br/>\"In some cases we've had requests that we just haven't been able to meet,\" he says. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"But the key thing for us has been to not create expectations or make commitments we can't live up to.

The aim is to build in principles of self-determination, giving Indigenous communities \"a direct voice in program design and program delivery\". <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"That was really to make sure there is an appropriate and culturally sensitive focus on Aboriginal people, given the large population of Aboriginal people in the fire-affected areas, and the particular impact these fires had on country.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Bushfire Recovery Victoria will also be a permanent agency, unlike the earlier Victorian Bushfire Reconstruction and Recovery Authority, which spent two years leading rebuilding after Black Saturday. <br/><br/>This is to reflect \"the long-term nature of recovery\", says Miezis -- as well as the increasing frequency of catastrophic fires. <br/><br/>He also hopes it will help preserve knowledge and experience in one place. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"Knowing we have a library and a guidebook we can pull off the shelf and tailor to a particular event, I think we'll be able to respond quicker. In the absence of that sort of dedicated agency, we find we're almost building the plane and flying it as the same time.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>The exact work to be done will depend on where in the recovery process those communities are. Initially there was a focus on emergency accommodation and relief; at the moment it's cleaning up. Community recovery committees have been formed and hubs created, which will allow locals to inform the priorities in future. <br/><br/>Even the establishment of the committees has reflected the individual circumstances of different towns: whereas Mallacoota \"went through a very formal electoral commission-supported nomination voting process\", Sarsfield built its committee \"through an existing community committee\". <br/><br/>Adapting to community needs, rather than taking a top-down approach, inevitably brings challenges. <br/><br/>\"In some cases we've had requests that we just haven't been able to meet,\" he says. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"But the key thing for us has been to not create expectations or make commitments we can't live up to. Being honest and transparent with those communities, but being as responsive as we can, and really taking an approach that's about problem solving. If the community wanted A, but we couldn't deliver A, we work with them on what the alternative looks like to get to that outcome.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Working in a pandemic<br/>Working closely with local communities has of course been made difficult by the pandemic. <br/><br/>Key strategies around improving resilience and cohesion by \"bringing communities together through events\", including town hall-style engagement efforts, have had to be rethought. <br/><br/>Plans for community recovery hubs offering face-to-face meetings for financial or planning support have had to be tweaked to turn them into \"digital kiosks\". <br/><br/>This has required tech support, as many people living in bush communities have poor technology skills and internet connectivity. But there's also been an unexpected upside to helping people overcome these barriers, too. <br/><br/>\"If they were finishing talking to a legal adviser or insurance company, they had the capacity to then, as an example, Skype the grandkids in Sydney, when they might not have been able to connect with them before,\" says Miezis. <br/><br/>It's also been \"fascinating\" setting up a new agency in a pandemic, he adds. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"Some people who are working for the organisation we haven't actually met in person, so the challenge of building an organisation, of forming a culture, of making sure we're able to support our staff through quite traumatic subject matter, it's been a real challenge.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Measures such as daily check-ins and all-staff conferences have helped ensure staff stay connected. <br/><br/>Miezis has even had to recruit an entire senior team over video conferencing. <br/><br/>\"I tend to be a person who goes with a bit of gut instinct and likes to be able to sit in a room with someone and was unable to do that,\" he says. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"So we had to pivot and had to rely a lot more on psychometric testing than I probably have in the past, and that proved invaluable to get good insights into people, and particularly the mix of people we were bringing in.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Has the experience made him rethink recruitment? <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"I don't think it's necessarily changed what I look for and how I recruit, in particular thinking about the collective and how the team work together and complement one another, complement my skills, complement what I'm not as strong at. But I was reliant on different tools and systems to get those insights, instead of gut and instinct and reacting to someone when you're sitting in a room with them.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>It's a rare opportunity to build a new team from scratch, so Miezis has tried to make the best of the situation despite the challenges. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"It's been interesting. I don't think I'll ever have another opportunity -- hopefully I don't -- to build an organisation that has continued to work remotely for 75% of its existence.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>From the bush to the corner office<br/>Although he doesn't get much chance to go into the bush these days, it was what started Miezis on his career path. <br/><br/>\"I went into forestry because I loved the bush and being outside,\" he says. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"I never thought I'd end up working out of a major city, to be honest, let alone as CEO of Bushfire Recovery Victoria.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Nevertheless, the new job fits perfectly. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"I've been driven by three things in my career. One is that strong sense of public purpose. Second is the need to be challenged in the work I do. Third is feeling I can contribute and add value to what I'm being asked to focus on.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>One of his formative roles was as \"a very young forester, not long graduated\" in Narrandera, NSW. <br/><br/>He worked closely with Aboriginal communities on training and developing the skills of young people, \"of really understanding the contribution they can make and the knowledge Aboriginal people bring to land management practices\", he explains. <br/><br/>Narrandera is a long way from Sydney. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"You really get to see how those decisions play out locally, and that's something I've carried with me throughout my career.  \"It probably mirrors the approach to recovery here ... I think local decisions are often the best decisions. Staff at DELWP would often hear me say, as I do here, that no-one understands those local communities and the local environment than our people who live and work in those communities on a day to day basis. I think that early role really grounded me in that.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>Forestry and fire management also have their fair share of polarisation, with stakeholders and staff bringing their own views to the subject. <br/><br/>How does he manage that as a leader? <br/><br/>\"The key for me is firstly not to pretend there aren't different views out there and that you're always going to be able to please everyone in the advice or decisions you need to make as a public servant,\" Miezis says. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"For me it's been a process of listening to understand those different perspectives, to draw on the best information I can get, whether that's science or people who've been there before and worked through similar challenges. Then being clear on the decisions you make and why.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>The change in planned burning regimes while he was at DELWP was one such example, with Victoria's shift from a hectare target recommended by the royal commission to a more risk-based approach. <br/></p><excerpt><bodyText><p>\"We listened to all the different perspectives, we took on the best science, and what we put in place is the best system, and a good approach to planned burning.\"</p></bodyText></excerpt><p><br/>This article is curated from <url normalizedValue=\"https://apolitical.co/en/solution_article/games-may-be-the-killer-weapon-to-fight-off-disinformation\">Apolitical</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MANDRN-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MANDRN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:607R-B7B1-JD6R-T40T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">435685</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1590\"/><timeReceived>8:31 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Mandarin</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"06\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>June 25, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000971D</classCode><className>POPULATION SIZE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Sadly, they are united in a misguided belief that racism is not really a problem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australians need to take responsibility for this sad state of affairs. For too long, our complacency and outright denials have allowed successive governments to take very little action to further the cause of our First Nations people. The plight of our Indigenous population should be a constant source of shame.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We hear that the Prime Minister has an opportunity to make real progress to provide Indigenous Australians with full rights and inclusion in our constitution. If he keeps telling Australians how good they are, that opportunity will be completely missed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In order to effect real change, more Australians have to stand up and denounce racism and demand justice, equality and fairness for all, especially our First Nations people.</p><p>Perhaps then, and only then, will our politicians sit up and take notice.</p><p>Irene Goldwasser, St Kilda</p><p>They should already know</p><p>Clearly, a large number of people decided last Saturday that the potential gain of demonstrating and protesting exceeded the health risk.</p><p>They had the advice, they heard the messages, they each came to a personal decision, and turned out in tens of thousands. No one forced them to do what they did. They still all took the risk, which makes the message they send all the more powerful.</p><p>Black lives matter, and everyone is entitled to justice and to fair and humane treatment. It should not need tens of thousands of people to turn out in the middle of a pandemic to explain that simple fact to politicians and law enforcement agencies. They should already know.</p><p>Tim Shirley, Benalla</p><p>Mandatory reading</p><p>Jamie Kirkpatrick and others outline concisely the science that shows logging makes forest more flammable (\"Logging has a clear link to bushfires\", Comment, 8/6).</p><p>Although the article does not mention the human and animal suffering that bushfires cause, it should be mandatory reading for members of Parliament who shed crocodile tears after catastrophic bushfires but then allow logging to continue.</p><p>Jan Kendall, Mount Martha</p><p>Refute this falsehood</p><p>In April, the Chinese ambassador to Australia warned Australia that if we persisted in spearheading the move to establish an independent inquiry into the origins of COVID-19, the Chinese people may not look kindly on Australia and may choose not to visit or study here.</p><p>It should not come as a surprise that the Chinese Ministry of Culture and Tourism has issued a statement to discourage her citizens from visiting Australia on the false assertion Australia is a racist country especially targeting Chinese and other Asians. By implication this would also mean our tertiary education services would be affected.</p><p>This is typical of the Chinese government's bullying behaviour and it is imperative Australia immediately starts to diversify our markets for our agricultural produce and education services.</p><p>My wife, children, and I are proud Australian citizens of Chinese Malaysian origin. Of course there is a racist minuscule section of Australian society, but that did not discourage me from migrating here 31 years ago.</p><p>Australia is still the most generous, multicultural and welcoming migrant country in the world. I would encourage all Chinese Australians to tell their friends and relatives to refute this Chinese government falsehood and to continue to holiday or study in Australia.</p><p>James Tan, Vermont South</p><p>There were other ways</p><p>So now we wait and see if the actions of a group will affect the majority. The front liners, students, prisoners, elderly and the unwell will not sleep easily.</p><p>Hopefully, the actions of those, who seem to have forgotten what so many people have recently given up will not cause any further grief.</p><p>Yes, it was an important protest but yes, there were other times and other ways to do it.</p><p>Sharyn Bhalla, Ferntree Gully</p><p>It isn't over</p><p>John Barry's 2004 book The Great Influenza: The Epic Story of the Greatest Plague in History is a riveting analysis of the 1918 flu pandemic; a striking work of research and social history.</p><p>It ought to be mandatory reading for anyone interested in our current dilemma, not least for those of us in Australia who are starting to look a bit too complacent as curves flatten and fewer people find themselves in intensive care units.</p><p>For, as Barry noted when case numbers of influenza reduced across Europe, \"the virus had not disappeared, it had only gone underground, like a forest fire burning in the roots, swarming and mutating, adapting, honing itself, watching and waiting, waiting to burst into flames\".</p><p>I am not suggesting the situation today is the same as 1918 but I am suggesting we best not think it's all over because we can now sit down in our favourite venue (if it's still there) for a beer and a macchiato.</p><p>Christine Spratt, Point Cook</p><p>'It's not theirs to give'</p><p>My husband and I were discussing the Rio Tinto incident over breakfast.</p><p>Our 13-year-old son walked in and wanted to know what we were talking about. I said that Rio had blown up a sensitive Aboriginal site so it could be mined. I explained further that although the site was identified as culturally important, Rio Tinto had been given government permission to mine the site.</p><p>Without hesitation he said \"but it's not theirs to give\".</p><p>Kirsten Vincent Newham</p><p>More, please</p><p>Another excellent article from Peter Hartcher (\"We can emerge stronger together\", Comment, 6/6).</p><p>He has improved my vocabulary with two new words, vetocracy, meaning a political system where industry/interest groups can veto political proposals, such as the US and maybe Australia, and kakistocracy, which is the worst type of government, or a \" s--t government\".</p><p>What we need now is good leadership and finally to recognise that \"America, once Australia's greatest role model, is now an object lesson in what to avoid\".</p><p>I look forward to more of his wonderful contributions.</p><p>Michael Cleaver, Southbank</p><p>This is why we protested</p><p>Finance Minister Mathias Cormann has labelled me selfish and self-indulgent for attending the Black Lives Matter rally, citing families unable to visit relatives in nursing homes or attend funerals.</p><p>And my heart goes out to those people separated from loved ones at this time. As it goes out to the family of Tanya Day, who have been separated from her since her death in custody. As it goes out to the other 400-plus families who have lost loved ones following Indigenous deaths in custody.</p><p>In the same week that Black Lives Matter organisers are asked to show restraint and not gather, an Indigenous youth is roughly handled and one official response is to excuse the police officer for having \"a bad day\". And they wonder why people like me are fed up and willing to breach COVID restrictions.</p><p>Joanne Jennings, Blackburn</p><p>Now is the time for a treaty</p><p>With the massive support so evident for Black Lives Matter and Aboriginal people, now is the time to institute a campaign for a national treaty. A treaty can be legislated at any time by the Federal Parliament. No referendum is required.</p><p>The treaty should return all vacant Crown lands to a national Aboriginal body, established by the treaty itself. That new national body would be authorised to identify the traditional owners and pass the land to them. In addition, six seats out of the existing 76 should be set aside for Aboriginal people in the Senate, giving the Aboriginal population of each state one Aboriginal senator.</p><p>The treaty could establish a compensation fund by setting aside 3 per cent of gross domestic product each year and deliver the funds to Aboriginal people through the treaty-established national body.</p><p>There is no constitutional impediment to any of these elements of a treaty, the Commonwealth has clear power to pass laws for Aborigines and amend the electoral laws.</p><p>Michael Mansell, Launceston, Tas</p><p>Funding disparities</p><p>I was interested to read last week that Newbury Primary School in Craigieburn, which was closed for deep cleaning, has 83 per cent of its students from non-English-speaking backgrounds (NESB) and receives about $10,000 per student from the public. Its neighbour, Oscar Romero Catholic Primary School has 80 per cent NESB students but receives a massive $21,000 per student from the public.</p><p>The Federal Schooling Resource Standard for primary schools for 2020 is $11,747 for primary schools. Another Craigieburn Catholic primary school, Mother Teresa School, with only 45 per cent NESB students receives almost $12,500 per student.</p><p>How can this be fair? There must be something very wrong with the way our public schools are being funded.David Zyngier, School of Education, Southern Cross University</p><p>Just do your job</p><p>Even after the event, federal ministers are still advising protesters on how to protest. How about they did their job and worked on eliminating the reasons people are protesting?</p><p>Imagine if the government had last week announced a credible plan to address black deaths in custody, reduce the astronomical levels of Indigenous incarceration and combat racist policing.</p><p>That would really have taken the wind out of the protest organisers' sails.</p><p>Alan Walker, Fitzroy North</p><p>History will not be kind</p><p>Tony Abbott thinks history will treat him kindly when considering his 2014 budget. The truth is that election campaign was based on a farrago of lies, with its centrepiece \"no cuts\". After the election, his first budget delivered some of most savage and inequitable cuts seen by any Australian government.</p><p>History will see him as one our most divisive leaders: even after losing the leadership, his only aim was to destabilise the Turnbull government that followed.</p><p>We are well rid of him</p><p>Hans Pieterse, Narre Warren North</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7axbsy0j65x1imt7soa8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6036-TFF1-F0J6-J018-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1623\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

He says his frustration has grown as he has watched one of the most devastating fire seasons on record unfold - with months still to go.</p><p>\"This goes back to March when we first raised the issue. Now we are playing catch-up,\" he said. \"I keep telling people that the fires are just a symptom of a disease called climate change. Federal government has to take leadership here.\"</p><p>His words were echoed by Mr Waller, who said: \"What I am looking for is national leadership, and to be bold and far-sighted... looking 20, 30 years out to how we are going to adapt and adjust to this new climate regime.</p><p>\"I'm not seeing any signs of that and that's disappointing. It's testing the quality of our leadership.</p><p>\"If you look at some of the good governments, like Hawke's and Howard's ...they worked within the electoral cycle but they also were statesmanlike and looked far and did some profound things.</p><p>\"That's what I am looking for out of this - our leaders stand up and say it is a real challenge and rally us. The time is ripe for that. It will take some guts to do it.\"</p><p>TECHNOLOGY AND PREVENTION While both emphasise leadership, their focus is on separate aspects of fire-fighting and prevention.</p><p>Mr Bibby stresses how innovation should be part of the key to tackling blazes. He gives the example of helicopters with infrared equipment to pinpoint hotspots after lightning strikes.</p><p>\"We need helicopters up there immediately, not two days later,\" he said. \"The days of waiting for a fire to come to you have gone, you have got to be in there and first attack and nip those fires in the bud.\"</p><p>He also welcomed the investment in the National Aerial Firefighting Centre. \"They do a heck of a lot with the dollars they are given,\" he said. \"They've just been given an injection of additional dollars for this year - that needs to be ongoing.\"</p><p>Mr Waller, meanwhile, raises the topic of fuel and land management, a subject he acknowledges is \"politically fraught\" - much to his personal frustration.</p><p>\"Good bush management is the only tool we've got really on the broad area,\" he said.</p><p>\"If we're saying [as] was said recently by senior fire people and the government that it's not going to be picked up, we're virtually walking away from the bush and saying 'the bush is going to get cooked regularly every five to 10 years' and we're going to put up with that'. That's completely unacceptable.</p><p>\"To say it's too difficult, to me it's un-Australian. It's got to be resourced [and] well planned. It's got to happen.\"</p><p>For him, the issue is very pertinent to Ballarat. \"I worry about the outskirts around Ballarat, places like Creswick, they are quite vulnerable, particularly the small hobby farms,\" he said.</p><p>\"Fire can get in there and move quickly and do a lot of damage. We've got too much of the season to go. We've got three months of difficult times [ahead].\"</p><p>READ THE LETTER FROM EMERGENCY LEADERS (FROM LAST AUTUMN)</p><p>RESOURCES Both, unsurprisingly, emphasise the need for more 'boots on the ground'. Mr Bibby feels the burden on the CFA volunteers is becoming too heavy.</p><p>\"What the nation has to come to grips with is that it can't ride on the back of volunteers for the next... decades.</p><p>\"We have to look at how we manage and support volunteers so they can properly assist us but they can also have a life in their own right and earn some money at the jobs they're paid for,\" he said.</p><p>He pointed to the many Victorian volunteers who had gone to Queensland earlier in the season. \"You can't run an organisation on volunteers that are already exhausted from what they have been doing in other states before they get to their own state.\"</p><p>Even spreading resources within the state was likely to become problematic, he suggested, pointing at the many Ballarat-based volunteers involved in the fire-fighting in East Gippsland.</p><p>\"Some hard decisions have to be made about keeping people at home in case something occurs,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Waller also raised the pressure on resources. \"Land management, the resourcing of the bush, it's been cut and cut and cut... Now we've got offices with nobody in them.</p><p>He gave the example of Corryong being under-staffed and called for more \"middle managers and scientists\" in the field.</p><p>\"They need more people living in those communities, understanding what is happening in those communities, understanding the bush,\" he said.</p><p>A DEFINING MOMENT? Both hope the damage done - economically, environmentally and on a human level - will inspire a more coordinated approach.</p><p>Mr Bibby wants a national workshop after the fire season is over to consider how we are going to manage the fire danger in the future.</p><p>He also advocates a national climate change framework akin to that in place at a state level in Victoria.</p><p>\"It acknowledges that it is a problem, as opposed to [putting] your head in the sand and [saying] it's not a problem,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is a climate change event. When I first started in the fire industry 46 years ago, major fires like the ones we are confronting now were every 10 years, then they moved to every six years, then every three years and now it's almost every year.\"</p><p>Mr Waller meanwhile describes this season's fires as a \"third fundamental disturbance\" into how we treat the bush. First he cites the dismissal of First Nations' management of the bush by early European arrivals; the second was the introduction of agriculture; now the fires of the 2019/20 season.</p><p>\"It has to reshape how we manage the bush. It's questioning a lot of how we approach protection and conservation values,\" he said.</p><p>He is also candid about his reservations on whether a bipartisan approach is likely at federal level.</p><p>\"I am doubtful, it's not the style of government, particularly not the style of this government, [to have] a joint approach to things,\" said Mr Waller.</p><p>Whether it leads to a co-ordinated approach or not, both former fire chiefs hope the unprecedented blazes could be a pivotal moment in the nation's history. \"I hope it is. I think it will be,\" Mr Waller said.</p><p>Mr Bibby's response to the question is pithier still: \"If it isn't, we're stuffed.\"</p><p>RELATED STORIES Ballarat's 'clear and present danger': Former CFA boss urges action on climate emergency 'They've worked the big hours': Brave CFA volunteers from Ballarat region return from Gippsland blazes Have you signed up to The Courier's daily newsletter and breaking news emails?

I now reside in Nome. Working in logging, farming, bulldozers etc as my father did and his grandfather. Before Kosciuzczko National Park was a park we used to lease it for drought-proof grazing. Never once did we have a \"super fire\" as we have now. Speaking to family and friends still down south today, they confirmed that a lot of areas haven't been back burnt for 35yrs! What do the Greens think is going to happen? Peace, love and happily ever after? No! Believe me, being in a dozer in the middle of the night with vision around to 30ft is not very fun. But heaven forbid that a corroboree frog or a wallaby gets burnt. When a pine forest fire comes into a natural forest it shears 5ft thick gum trees off at the butt in one big bag sending shards of timber hundreds of metres. 30 plus years of fuel on the ground, food for thought. Matt, Nome, 4816.</p><p>Fair enough, there's some heart-wrenching end-of-life stories (Letters 6/1) but euthanasia laws are a bad idea. Palliative care mechanisms already provide for peaceful passing. But bring in euthanasia laws and soon great-gran will be feeling the pressure to pop off voluntarily so her assets can be sold. Then she'll become depressed and sick and opt for euthanasia to end the pain initiated by the euthanasia laws. So, sorry, no. Just no. Miner, Kelso Re Queens Rd Roundabout trees, they don't need more water, get watered every morning around 4.30, they have been decimated by flying foxes! JT 4810 R/RE. How can we single out one person for Australian of the Year? Every firie and volunteer who has done so much good in this year's devastations. Fires, droughts, floods, hayrunners feeding cattle ... the list goes on. Why should one individual get it? Fedup 4814 To all the people who are going on about stopping Adani, get off the bandwagon. It's been going since April last year. You lost get over it and move on. BJ 4814 How excellent to read about the new coking coal mine near Moranbah (TB 6/1). Steel can't be made without coking coal, which is melted into the iron ore mix to strip out excess oxygen atoms to make pure iron. Without coal, civilisation grinds to a halt. Misty, HP Reb Kelso, the only thing the PM hasn't been accused of is arson. TJ. 4854 Sco-Mo has responded to all the flak he's received, for just being alive, with grace and dignity. If anyone had spoken to, or about, Paul Keating in that way, he would have told them where to go, and what to do when they got there. The PM didn't cause climate change, didn't start the fires, and should not be abused for turning up to offer sympathy. He'd be called out for being a heartless b-----d if he didn't! Aussies never used to be such rude people. Ags Hermit Pk Albo spent the day at the cricket yesterday. Di Natale is on leave. Yet everyone is ripping apart the PM. The man who literally has the hardest job in the country. Get off his back and remember that if it was PM Shorten, the country would have no money to pay for the relief that will be coming once this is over. Ted, Bohle Plains 4817 The bushfire crisis has drawn world attention to the character of Australians, it has brought out the best in many &amp; worst in some. When the going gets tough this minority need a scapegoat &amp; vent their political allegiance so it's let's get ScoMo time. Some journalists can't resist the temptation as well. I learnt long ago to read between the lines &amp; ignore blatant political bias on TV, do this &amp; u can throw away the blood pressure medication. WW. C/jong.</p><p>It's very disappointing that during this terrible time in our country that politics and the petty point scoring cannot be put on hold while they all work together towards happier times. Ron Kelso.</p><p>Pedro, Cranbrook. Yes I do agree that our 3 wise people's lives have been remiss in their attitude towards crime here in Townsville, but do you honestly believe the other side will do any better. Platitudes and speeches come easily. In other words they talk the talk but will they walk the walk. I don't think so. Ted, Condon Enough is enough! This anarchy on our roads must be stopped! Why can't the negligent parents be charged alongside their recidivist criminal children? Fine the parents and issue them with a cashless welfare card less the payment installments for their fines. Anyone harbouring these recidivist criminals should also be charged and fined. Chroming also must be banned. L.B. 4812.</p><p>Red tape delays, arrests for another crime spree, recidivists still enjoying their games and the public are still waiting for results. Well this time you can change it, it's your choice later in the year. Choose wisely. M J Reynolds Mt Louisa MS 4820 - we don't need foreign aid, we're a wealthy country. Better to save the money for developing nations. We are getting practical support though. Steve, Belgian Gardens What has happened to 4TO since it became triple m. Couldn't listen to it over the Xmas break. Where are Pricey, Chookie and Minty? Mg 4814 The letter by Viv Forbes Washpool Qld to end forest failures should be the catalyst for defining our future. Our 25 million can't cope with disasters on this scale as we have the equivalent in land mass to the USA of 330 million. Forest management is imperative, the Greenies have a lot to answer for. Carl. Pimlico.</p><p>Seems the highly protected black throated finch may be our new animal emblem after Greens/Labor/climate worriers' influence on hazard reduction bore fruit. Mass destruction of habitat and wildlife should haunt them for millenia. Bazza Mt Low.</p><p>While serving in New Guinea and East Timor you see the locals collect all their firewood and burn the forests. They say it clears the deadfall and helps with nature, i.e. regrowth. They still have fires caused by lightning, but there is never villages burnt to the ground. This used to happen in Australia years ago. Aren't we going to learn? Jim, Kirwan The arguments around the calendar are not relevant because it is human invention and not all that accurate. Every leap year we have to add an extra day but every century we have to skip it. In the Chinese calendar it is currently the year 4717. What is relevant is that this year has a 20 in it and there will be 10 of them. James Cranbrook I think our mayor of Townsville needs to start looking at how to water the people of Townsville for the near future. Ross Dam is at 59% and with climate change here looks like we are not going to see any rain this year. C.A.S 4814 Tony Fontes - It's great to suggest we jump on board the green bandwagon, but what exactly does that mean for Australia? We contribute very little by way of carbon emissions and yet inflict this save the planet mentality onto ourselves. In the bigger scheme of things if Australia ceased to exist the climate would continue to change. Yes we can stop mining coal, or even burning our own, but the alternatives to sustain our own population with power, let alone other nations, will not happen in the short term. In that short term there should be particular emphasis on disposing of any green land management policies which have ironically caused the current avoidable catastrophe, which merely served to make our nation look quite ridiculous as wannabe leaders of climate change action. Whitty 4811</p><p>TOP TXTA car has been parked on the side of the road Riverway Drive since the New Year. It has no number plates and has a police aware sticker attached.

Where high voltage lines have been deenergised, firefighting will occur on the easement if this is part of the strategy and tactics being employed.</p><p>Firefighting aircraft can and do operate around high-voltage transmission lines where that is part of the strategy. The pilot is responsible for maintaining separation just like they would with any other vertical hazard ie communications tower, masts, wind turbine etc. The fire at Bunyip state park in March 2019 is an example of when firebombing helicopters worked in close proximity to the transmission lines containing fire prior to ground crew arrival.</p><p>Powerline easements may reduce overall bushfire risk on some properties due to the modification and maintenance of fuel conditions, depending on the conditions on the day of a fire.</p><p>As staying and defending a property during a bushfire is very dangerous, CFA recommends residents that leaving early is the best option when living in a high-risk bushfire area. If residents leave early it will also be safe for them to pass under transmission lines.</p><p>Leaving when a bushfire is already threatening the property or adjacent infrastructure is extremely dangerous regardless of whether the infrastructure includes transmission lines or pylons. Travelling in smoky conditions when visibility of other traffic including responding emergency services is low is not safe.</p><p>READ THE FULL RESPONSE FROM AUSNET BELOW:</p><p>- what measures are in the initial plans for the project to mitigate bushfire risk?</p><p>We are undertaking a rigorous and transparent assessment of bushfire risk and ensuring that any risk is minimised and managed is a key priority for the project.</p><p>As part of this, we are currently preparing an Environment Effect Statement (EES) which will consider the environmental impacts of the project, including bushfire risk.</p><p>As part of this process we must complete a large number of technical investigations and reports for submission to government.</p><p>Community input is a key part of the process and the company is dedicated to working with stakeholders, all key risks and benefits are adequately assessed and appropriate mitigation measures implemented.</p><p>Our findings and resulting plans will be reviewed by the relevant government agencies as part of the EES process.</p><p>The bushfire risk mitigation strategies we propose to use include the following:</p><p>The transmission line easements will be managed to protect the towers and lines from fire. Easements are wide enough that if a tall tree outside the easement were to fall it would not reach the towers or the lines. A rigorous vegetation management program will be implemented to eliminate vegetation fuel loads in easements. A state-of-the-art protection system will detect faults and shut off the power in milliseconds. Fires are actively monitored from our control room. We work closely with Emergency Management Victoria (ESV) in the case of an emergency. Easements can offer important protections by acting as firebreaks. You can also head to the project website to access the fact sheet on bushfires. - how are transmission lines different to distribution lines when it comes to fire risk?</p><p>The project is proposing to build transmission lines between Sydenham and Bulgana. The following factors differentiate transmission lines from distribution lines with regard to fire risk.</p><p>Transmission lines are bound by regulations to maintain a controlled easement that doesn't permit vegetation to build up fuel load and requires line of fall trees to be cleared or cut back so no tree can contact the line if it failed at the root base. That means transmission lines require larger easements and clearance than distribution lines.</p><p>When it comes to conductor clearance above ground, transmission lines are two to three times higher than distribution, which significantly eliminates the risk of contact from vehicles.</p><p>The spacing of conductors on Victorian transmission lines are far apart enough to prevent even the largest bird, including eagles, or animals to bridge between the phases or phase to earth structure. This is not the case with distribution lines.</p><p>Transmission lines also run aerial earth wires above the conductors which protect from lightning strike, which distribution lines do not have.</p><p>Transmission protection, which interrupts the power in cases of a fault, operates within milliseconds and is an order of magnitude more efficient than the distribution protection system.</p><p>- in an emergency, how close can people get to towers?</p><p>Transmission easements have been used to slow or stop fire fronts.</p><p>We work closely with State and Local Government, Emergency Management Victoria (EMV) and the Country Fire Association (CFA) in an emergency.</p><p>The easements can allow more concentrated fire-fighting efforts due to the lower fuel load, thereby assisting with containment.</p><p>This was clearly demonstrated in the 2019 Bunyip State Forest fire.</p><p>- could residents flee a bushfire by escaping underneath powerlines?</p><p>Communities should always adhere to official emergency services advice in the case of a fire.</p><p>- is there risk of shocks or 'flashovers' in a bushfire situation?</p><p>The transmission lines are designed to automatically disconnect by control systems at both ends of the line to protect the line and surroundings from damage.</p><p>Vegetation control in and around an easement ensures there is not enough fuel to enable a flame to reach a conductor.</p><p>Smoke density if large enough can trip a circuit.</p><p>For this to occur a severe wildfire must have reached the edge of the easement.</p><p>- would more land be required in forested/bushland areas to create a firebreak?</p><p>No, the easement distances are the same and Line of fall trees in all cases are managed so they cannot contact the line.</p><p>Assessments of vegetation and fuel load will be undertaken during the EES studies.</p><p>This is one of the reasons we will be requesting access to properties that are within the area of interest to assess on the ground conditions in detail, to feed into the final project design.</p><p>- how will aerial firefighting units work around the towers?</p><p>As is already the case in other areas, we will continue to work with EMV and the CFA to ensure aerial firefighting can operate safely in the vicinity of the high-voltage transmission lines.</p><p>The transmission towers are well defined on aeronautical maps.</p><p>Recent incidents in the Latrobe Valley saw firebombing helicopters work near transmission lines to contain a fire before the CFA ground crew arrived.</p><p>- my understanding is the collapse of the Cressy towers in February was because of a once in a century weather event acting on older infrastructure - how will this risk be mitigated for the new pylons? How often are they inspected on the ground?</p><p>The towers in Cressy that were brought to the ground earlier in the year were the victim of very rare, extreme and destructive weather conditions, involving a convective downdraft.</p><p>In addition, in comparison to the planned WVTNP towers, the towers that were brought down in Cressy were designed and built over 35 years ago.</p><p>The towers for this project are being designed to comply to the current Australian Standard which include significant updates over historical standards.</p><p>The design of these towers will also involve the use of sophisticated, contemporary computer modelling which enables the analysis of complex load cases.</p><p>Have you signed up to The Courier's variety of news emails?

And if it was a particularly bad day with many fires burning across the state, resources could well stretched.</p><p>Related coverage: Encouraging female leadership in the CFA</p><p>Related coverage: They came within metres of disaster but still consider themselves lucky</p><p>CFA District 15 Commander Luke Kneebone said that during the Hepburn fire in 2019, conditions had worked in authorities' favour: there were no other major fires burning and so authorities received all resources they asked for, including air support, and a wind change late in the day had pushed the fire away from the township.</p><p>Despite this good result - with there not being any injuries or property losses as a result of the blaze - he said authorities did not want this to create a sense of complacency within the community.</p><p>\"We want people to understand that may not always be the case. There are lots of factors that can influence our response, including weather. If the weather is really bad, we may not be able to get aircraft up in the air and if there are other incidents, we may not be able to get as many resources as quickly,\" he said.</p><p>Watch the video here:</p><p>Commander Kneebone said authorities wanted the community to remain vigilant so that their fire plans could be put in place, if need be.</p><p>\"We want people who live in the Daylesford and Hepburn area to stay alert,\" he said. \"So knowing the fire danger rating on a particular day, keeping an eye on the weather conditions and VicEmergency app and then applying all that information to your plan.\"</p><p>Facing engagement challenges With its reputation as 'Spa Country' meaning there are always large groups of tourists wandering around the town and its various attractions, authorities are also trying to engage tourism and accommodation providers, to try to spread the message to visitors.</p><p>This includes leaving a fire-affected area if safe to do so, as dangerous curiosity was a problem for authorities at the 2019 fire, when a number of people travelled along small tracks to access back areas that had already been evacuated in order to watch the fire and aircraft from a higher vantage point.</p><p>Related coverage: How authorities work behind the scenes on a high fire danger day</p><p>Related coverage: Stickybeaks cause frustration for firefighters</p><p>Sergeant Matt Flood from Daylesford Police Station is the shire's Municipal Emergency Response Coordinator.</p><p>A Municipal Emergency Management Plan is required for every local government area and encourages familiarisation and planning across agencies for a number of different incidents that may occur in a particular area - from flooding to fire, road trauma, missing people and even though not an incident, major events.</p><p>Sergeant Flood said emergency services were working with the community in regards to fire preparedness but faced some challenges such as a lack of phone reception in certain areas and informing visitors to the area of the messaging.</p><p>If an incident such as fire were to occur on a weekend, when traffic in the towns always increases, it would be a lot more problematic for authorities.</p><p>Importance of fire plans The policing role at a fire is to keep the area safe for the control agency - either the CFA and FFMV - and to manage an evacuation process if need be, to door knock houses and to set up traffic management points and road blocks to ensure emergency vehicles can access the impacted area.</p><p>Both Commander Kneebone and Sergeant Flood urged the community to ensure they have fire plans in place, and if it includes leaving early, to know the trigger point for leaving and not to wait for authorities to knock at the door.</p><p>Planning where to travel to, such as to a family or friend's house or to a bigger regional centre such as Ballarat until the fire risk has reduced should also be part of the plan.</p><p>With both residents and tourists trying to escape the area if a fire were approaching, too many people on the roads in a panic would cause congestion around the townships, with people trying to flee as emergency services try to gain access to fight the fire.</p><p>While Sergeant Flood acknowledged that there would always be people in a situation in which they would need to access relief centres, if most people have planned and monitored a situation, they should be out of the area.</p><p>Relief centres - or places of last resort - are determined based on the situation and where the threat is, meaning emergency services are fluid and flexible in determining a location.</p><p>The towns are too small to cater to thousands of people crowded in the streets or at a relief centre - or places of last resort - so both residents and tourists are encouraged to leave an area before the risk is heightened.</p><p>Commander Kneebone said people needed to be aware of the risk, including that with dry conditions, it is possible fires could engulf a town.</p><p>\"Plans need to be individualised and that's why we want people to engage with this, so that they understand the environment they live, work in or are travelling to and think about what the plan is for a number of different possible scenarios,\" he said.</p><p>\"You need to be engaged, have a plan, a back up plan and to practice that plan.\"</p><p>Another part of fire, though insidious but which carries a big risk, is heat health. Sergeant Flood said the community could always improve in the ways in which it looks after each other.</p><p>\"More people died as a result of the extremely high temperatures leading up to and during the Black Saturday event,\" he said. \"It is something, particularly with an older community, that people need to be mindful of looking after older neighbours, friends and family.</p><p>\"With climate change, it is something that will become more prevalent - it will be hot for days at a time.\"</p><p>Stay up to date with Daylesford police on the Moorabool Eyewatch page.

Even the kangaroos couldn't escape. I just felt totally powerless.\"</p><p>It was the start of the biggest outbreak of firestorms ever recorded. The smoke plumes from the Black Summer reached into space, as high as a nuclear blast. On the ground, a fire tornado or a large \"fire whirl\" flipped an eight-tonne tanker and killed a firefighter.</p><p>Bushfires aren't just getting bigger and more frequent in Australia. They're getting stranger. Moving faster, flaring unpredictably, changing the weather. While once \"good fire\" helped rejuvenate the landscape under the careful watch of its First Nations, today global warming is fanning flames too big to live with.</p><p>During Australia's deadliest bushfire disaster, Black Saturday, nightmarish weather conditions came together in Victoria one February day in 2009. The fires moved fast, trapping people in cars and homes, and burning with the power of 1500 atomic bombs. By the time the 2019-20 Black Summer arrived, drought had turned much of the country into a tinderbox, and the flames didn't seem to end. A recent royal commission warned \"what was unprecedented is now our future\".</p><p>We are not alone. Fire seasons around the world are stretching out, overlapping, intensifying. Places that have never burnt before, such as the Arctic circle and parts of the Amazon, are going up.</p><p>Even during a wetter La Nina season this year for Australia, Perth and Fraser Island have burnt.</p><p>How are fire seasons changing?</p><p>Rachael Cavanagh knows what good fire is. Her people - the Minyungbal and Yugambeh nations - have been wielding it and watching it change and rejuvenate the landscape for millennia.</p><p>But, as a career firefighter in northern NSW, Cavanagh was also on the front line of the Black Summer. In Coffs Harbour, crews were exhausted from a long winter of fires by the time cities were being engulfed by smoke. \"We knew it would be bad but it just didn't stop,\" she says.</p><p>\"Forest would burn and two weeks later we'd be in there again fighting another fire. It was strange, surreal.\"</p><p>More than 9.7 million hectares, an area bigger than England, burnt across Australia. Thirty-three people were killed and hundreds died from complications linked to smoke inhalation.</p><p>For wildlife, it was the single biggest catastrophe in recorded history - 3 billion creatures killed or displaced, and their ecosystems decimated.</p><p>At the Bushfire and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre, which is now working to update Australia's existing McArthur forest fire danger index, chief executive Richard Thornton says the sheer size and duration of the fires left few places for animals to seek refuge.</p><p>Despite fake news about an \"arson emergency\", almost all of the fires were started by lightning.</p><p>As the climate warms, more violent storms and drier and hotter conditions are coming together to make bigger bushfires. Australia's driest and hottest year on record was 2019. The Bureau of Meteorology even had to introduce a new colour code to capture some of the extreme temperatures. When the season began, some towns had already run out of water to drink, let alone fight fires. And the deadly Black Saturday still holds the record for Melbourne's hottest day at 46.4 degrees.</p><p>Tom Beer was the world's first scientist to link climate change to increased bushfires, in 1988 - he was considering scenarios far into the future, when the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere might be double what it was then. While emissions have ramped up faster than predicted, Australia is only halfway (1.4 degrees) into the 3 degrees of warming Beer was modelling. But the fires are burning as if we are already there.</p><p>\"In fact, they're even worse,\" Beer says. \"Back then, we thought every year's danger would be as bad as Ash Wednesday [in 1983]. We couldn't really imagine anything worse. Now they're bigger, they're more dangerous, and the time between these horrors is shrinking down, from decades to years.\"</p><p>Twenty years later, in 2008, Ross Garnaut built on the work of Beer and the CSIRO when he made the haunting prediction that hellish fire seasons would be \"directly observable by 2020\".</p><p>Mullins says the seasons are getting more expensive and more exhausting, running so long the window is narrowing for agencies to safely burn off vegetation. \"You don't even need a [warm] El Nino event to get a bad season now.\"</p><p>How is fire behaviour changing?</p><p>Leading fire historian Stephen Pyne likens fire to a driverless car. \"At some point, there'll be a sharp curve called climate change or a tricky intersection where town and country come together, or a lot of hazards left over from land clearing,\" he says.</p><p>Most homes are lost in ember attacks, sparks spitting ahead of a bushfire that come in like a locust storm, he says. Such spot fires were once common a few hundred metres ahead of a fire. Mullins says: \"Now we're recording them 12 kilometres ahead.</p><p>\"During Black Saturday too, people saw a smoke column about 20, 30 kilometres away. The next minute their house was on fire.\"</p><p>For all the recent focus on fuel loads in Australia, fire scientist Jason Sharples says it makes little difference in extreme conditions. \"That's when usual fire behaviour goes out the window and it's being driven by mass spotting. Hazard reduction isn't going to stop that,\" he says.</p><p>During the Black Summer, one of the biggest shocks came at night when the fires seemed to burn just as ferociously as they did during the heat of the day.</p><p>Mullins recalls battling 30 metre-tall flames at 1am. \"A strong wind kept roaring through the bush ... Nothing human beings can do to stop a fire like that.\"</p><p>Are firestorms increasing?</p><p>Twenty years ago, when meteorologist Mike Fromm was called in to investigate mysterious clouds showing up on satellite feeds over the US, he saw in the data what firefighters had long called \"the monster\". These clouds were coming from forest fires.</p><p>\"It kind of broke the rules of what a thunderstorm should be able to do,\" Fromm says now of his discovery, that \"fire-breathing dragon\" known as the pyrocumulus firestorm. \"[They] act in many ways like a volcano, injecting stuff that comes off the fire into the stratosphere.\"</p><p>Before the Black Summer, there had been only about 60 firestorms confirmed or suspected in Australia. Then, in just one season, that number nearly doubled. Some even started, unusually, after sunset, Fromm says.</p><p>The winds inside firestorms can reach cyclone speeds. \"These [storms] can exhibit the worst behaviours,\" Fromm says. \"Thunder, hail, lightning ... tornados. They're the least predictable, the most dangerous [for] firefighters. But it's odd. Typically, the bigger the thunderstorm the heavier the rain. With pyrostorms, it's the opposite. They have a bigger boost to their updrafts but produce almost no rain. Just a lot of smoke.\"</p><p>So, how big does a fire need to be to create its own weather? Fromm says there's no clear-cut size or temperature but it needs to cover \"a very large piece of real estate\" and burn \"as hot as a fire can be so it generates that thermal bubble that starts the storm\".</p><p>It's likely scientists are detecting more firestorms now because they know what to look for, but fires are also burning bigger because of climate change.</p><p>Filming in the eye of a pyrostorm, that swirling vortex of smoke and ice crystals and forest debris, is still the \"holy grail\" for Fromm and other firestorm chasers. \"We don't quite do a Twister thing where we get a hunch and throw something into the storm,\" Fromm says. But he has been on planes flown by NASA and his own agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, through suspected pyrostorm plumes. \"You could smell the smoke flooding the cockpit at 34,000 feet. It's like a big chimney.\"</p><p>After the atomic bomb was dropped on Hiroshima at the end of World War II, scientists think the mushroom cloud that formed was caused by firestorms from the infernos it ignited, rather than the initial bomb blast itself.</p><p>How do we live with fires of the future?</p><p>The Black Summer didn't have to happen, at least not the way it did, says Cavanagh. \"When our old people used to walk country and swim and do all the care they do, they put fire in as they went, the right fire at the right time to clear out grasses ... or help [echidnas] forage ... [We've] been fighting since colonisation to manage country again. So when fire comes in, it's not the big one that rages because nothing's burnt in 30 years.\"</p><p>Unlike the walls of flame put in during a hazard reduction burn, Indigenous burns are lit in spiral, mosaic patterns, with room for animals to escape. They don't roar into the treetops, they are not set when birds are nesting or bees are pollinating, when the winds are too strong. \"You can walk in behind that fire and you should be able to brush the ash off the top of the soil and it will still be cool,\" Cavanagh says. \"Only the outer bark of the trees will burn.\"</p><p>Unlocking the ecological puzzle of how Aboriginal people managed such a flammable landscape for so long could be key to Australia's future in a more fire-prone world. While more training and investment is needed, Cavanagh stresses the knowledge is not lost. \"Often our women hold the fire lore and the medicine and they teach it to the children. My eight-year-old can read Country. She knows when to burn.\"</p><p>Up north, where Aboriginal communities have more land rights, cultural burns have been integrated into the forestry service for some time. Down south, it's more fragmented. Crucial windows to burn often get missed under the slow grind of bureaucracy, Cavanagh says. Some agencies won't pay local nations for their work and, while the Black Summer has sparked serious talk of scaling up the practice, Indigenous leaders stress burns must be led by local Aboriginal people, not merely tacked on to existing regimes.</p><p>After the \"Big Blowup\" inferno of 1910 that burnt across the west of the US, some experts there advocated for reintroducing the traditional, cool burns of Native American tribes. Instead, agencies pivoted to a hardline \"suppression\" approach, the way fires are put out in cities.</p><p>Jason Sharples, a Bundajlung man, says traditional burning might itself need to adapt to a warming climate and evolved terrain. But, if done right, he says it could be Australia's best chance against worsening fire seasons. \"These fires can be put out years before they actually start. Of course, it's not all we have to do.\"</p><p>Bushfire season is often followed by inquiry season, by soul-searching and reflection but usually, experts say, little practical action. The exception, Pyne says, was Black Saturday, which seemed to hit the Australian psyche \"almost like a terrorist attack\" and prompted an overhaul of community warnings. \"Now [the Black] Summer is the same.\"</p><p>Prime Minister Scott Morrison spoke of adapting to worsening conditions, but the 2020 royal commission directly named the elephant in the room that needed policy attention: climate change.</p><p>Mullins heads a group of retired, senior-ranking firefighters calling on Australia to lead a rapid shift to a zero emissions economy. \"We can say what the current [emergency services agency] commissioners can't,\" he says.</p><p>\"COVID has shown the government knows how to listen to scientists. Well, this is an emergency, too, and we can stop it getting worse.\" More bushfires also mean more carbon released into the atmosphere, a wicked feedback loop. If the Black Summer fires were their own country, they would have been one of the world's top emitters.</p><p>Despite the US experience, Pyne says some remote fires may still need to be put out fast - that's where drones and other technologies can help spot them early. The Morrison government says it will work to improve information sharing, including from satellites, but has largely ignored calls from firefighters - and now the royal commission - for more investment in large water-bombing aircraft.</p><p>\"Under extreme conditions, if we leave fires burning far out and they get legs, an ember storm can blow them in anyway,\" Sharples says.</p><p>David Bowman, an ecologist pioneering the new field of pyrogeography at the University of Tasmania, says communities must be better prepared for when fires do come close. \"It should be like living with cyclones and earthquakes. We've got too much [urban sprawl] pushing into forest. We've got the wrong houses in the wrong places,\" he says.</p><p>Ninety-nine per cent of the homes lost in the Black Summer were within 500 metres of fire-prone land, according to the Insurance Council of Australia.</p><p>Experts agree we need to get smarter about clearing close to properties. But Mullins warns against kneejerk reactions - NSW's new plan to allow landowners to clear bush within 25 metres of their fence line without environmental approvals was not recommended by a recent state inquiry and has raised concerns for koala populations.</p><p>Deforestation has largely got the world into this mess, Mullins says. \"We've changed rainfall patterns by chopping down rainforest and with so many species in trouble [after the fires], we have to be more careful than ever.\"</p><p>Building to fire codes is also expensive, often a big ask for communities already hit hard by fires. According to Sharples, even Australia's fire standard is designed to deal with the usual predictable blaze and not the fire of extremes. \"There's a little about embers but it's mostly measured by radiant heat near the house.\"</p><p>Bowman likens the change needed in Australia to the incremental road safety reforms under which everything from seatbelts to mandatory insurance became standard. \"We need everyone on board, private industry as well as government - only this has to be taken at a sprint. We've pressed the climate-change stopwatch now.\"</p><p>The heroes in the story may well be local councils, he says, rallying and educating their communities. Or the change may be driven by the insurance industry: soaring premiums have begun to price people out of wildfire-prone areas in the US. \"No one has [solved] this problem yet. We can't look to a Sweden. But we are so much on the front line. Australia could be driving this.\"</p><p>In the chaos of 2020, Pyne began thinking more and more of fire as a virus - not living itself but feeding on what is. \"Protecting our homes, clearing out defensible space then becomes like social distancing. Building fire-resistant homes is like wearing a mask; lighting good fires to stave off bad ones is building up herd immunity in the landscape. But there's no vaccine for bushfires,\" he says.</p><p>At best, Bowman says: \"It's a negotiated truce.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7ecmk2jlp1gn2rfwizu</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61XC-N031-JD34-V0YG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; First Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 4, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001196</classCode><className>NATIVE AMERICANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001226</classCode><className>NUCLEAR WEAPONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DL6S</classCode><className>EXPLOSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX000195</classCode><className>BOMBS &amp; EXPLOSIVE DEVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001226</classCode><className>NUCLEAR WEAPONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000796</classCode><className>GLOBAL WARMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX017</classCode><className>PERTH, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009WRP</classCode><className>ARCTIC</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

On November 30, it crossed the Clyde and began its destructive march towards Bawley Point and Lake Tabourie.</p><p>Urgent community meetings were called. Residents were told to activate their Bushfire Survival Plans. Many had not given them a thought beforehand, despite the repeated urgings of the Rural Fire Service.</p><p>Hundreds gathered in Ulladulla on the afternoon of December 13 to hear dire warnings from Currowan Fire incident controller Superintendent Mark Williams, who presented a worst case scenario:</p><p>\"This fire has the potential to get as far as Nerriga Road to the north and Moruya to the south,\" he told the crowd. He also warned not to expect a firetruck at every property - there were simply not enough of them.</p><p>Ten days after this meeting, Nerriga itself had been overrun by flames, its residents hunkering down in the pub as RFS tankers surrounded the building and hosed it down.</p><p>By January 4, Supt Williams' worst case scenario had been surpassed many times over.</p><p>The Currowan fire had spread so far, it now had to be divided into four: the Currowan 2 fire, the Morton fire in the Southern Highlands, the Charleys Forest Fire to the west and the Clyde Mountain Fire to the south.</p><p>To get from one end of the fireground to the other involves a three-and-a-half hour drive. One would need an entire day to drive its perimeter - that's how big it has grown. And it's still on the move.</p><p>On Friday, January 31 the original Currowan blaze had started merging with the Badja Forest Rd, Countengany Fire to the south.</p><p>As journalists covering the story, we have also become part of it. Many of us have had to evacuate, some several times over.</p><p>There have been many days when we have left for work in the morning, not knowing whether we would have a home to return to at the end of the day.</p><p>We've endured the same terror as our readers. We've cried along with them, not at our predicament but at the tribulations of others, who have seen their homes and livelihoods burn, their little patches of paradise reduced to ash.</p><p>We've cried for our beautiful forests and for the wildlife we have lost.</p><p>We've cried with gratitude for the firefighters who have battling flames for what seems like an eternity.</p><p>We've cried because we've been frightened.</p><p>Unless you have been there, watching the sky turn from cobalt blue to orange, to red and then to pitch black at 3pm, it is impossible to fathom the fear.</p><p>Unless you have received the text message telling you it is too late to leave, you cannot get a true sense of the danger.</p><p>And unless you drive through the burnt zone, you cannot appreciate the ferocity of the fire and the destruction it has wrought.</p><p>For many city people, the impact of the fire emergency has been serious but indirect - dystopian skies filled with smoke, cancelled holidays, inconvenience. Their reaction, when they see for the first time what you have been experiencing for weeks, is revealing on a couple of levels.</p><p>First, their shock at the sheer destructive power of the flames. We stopped in the burnt zone along Nerriga Road with Illawarra Mercury photographer Sylvia Liber on December 30 in a landscape which appeared to have been nuked. Trees were blackened, everything but their trunks consumed. There was deadly silence - no insects, no birdsong. And there was heat. Not from the sky above but from the ground below. As we took photos, we remarked on the almost spectral beauty of the destruction. It was otherworldly.</p><p>Second, for us who live with the fire, the dreadful realisation we have started to adapt to the so-called \"new normal\", becoming accustomed to our destroyed world, which is anything but normal.</p><p>Read more: The Shoalhaven town where the ground still burns</p><p>We put fresh eyes on the fire again this week when photographer Robert Peet accompanied us to Budgong at the back of Kangaroo Valley, where the Currowan Fire leapt up into the Southern Highlands on January 4.</p><p>A recent lick of rain had turned the valley emerald green but a few kilometres over Mt Scanzi, everything was black. The all-too familiar aftermath left Robert momentarily speechless.</p><p>\"I've seen plenty of fires but nothing on this scale,\" he said finally, visibly shaken.</p><p>We followed what has become a routine work pattern in the burnt zone, pulling up when we saw people and talking to them about their experiences.</p><p>Out where the apocalypse has been, people are happy to share their experiences. It's a cathartic way of processing the unimaginable.</p><p>We've found this all over the fire ground, from Runnyford west of Batemans Bay to Lake Conjola, from Budgong out to Nerriga.</p><p>The fire emergency may have destroyed homes, infrastructure and forests but it has strengthened community. Neighbours who were strangers now talk to each other at every opportunity. Old differences have been set aside as people turn to each other for support.</p><p>Now the adrenaline of the emergency is abating, people who have been through hell will need to talk and people who haven't should listen.</p><p>If there is one lesson from this emergency, it is that nowhere is safe.</p><p>Seasoned firefighters will tell you not to turn your back on these fires, that they still have the potential to run across the high ground, into the escarpment and all the way into Sutherland.</p><p>Those residents who either lost homes or successfully fought off the flames will tell you the speed at which the fire moves in adverse conditions is unlike anything they have ever imagined. The faces of people who had close calls with death at the height of the emergency still look haunted.</p><p>That's why everyone in the burnt zone is still on edge. Even places which burned weeks ago have reignited. Danger lurks everywhere, with trees falling or dropping limbs and underground fires still burning.</p><p>After weeks living in and traversing this strange new world, returning to any sense of normality will take a very long time.</p><p>The whole experience will never be forgotten.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>It has been Australia's lost summer.

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

He also warned not to expect a firetruck at every property - there were simply not enough of them.</p><p>Ten days after this meeting, Nerriga itself had been overrun by flames, its residents hunkering down in the pub as RFS tankers surrounded the building and hosed it down.</p><p>By January 4, Supt Williams' worst case scenario had been surpassed many times over.</p><p>The Currowan fire had spread so far, it now had to be divided into four: the Currowan 2 fire, the Morton fire in the Southern Highlands, the Charleys Forest Fire to the west and the Clyde Mountain Fire to the south.</p><p>To get from one end of the fireground to the other involves a three-and-a-half hour drive. One would need an entire day to drive its perimeter - that's how big it has grown. And it's still on the move.</p><p>On Friday, January 31 the original Currowan blaze had started merging with the Badja Forest Rd, Countengany Fire to the south.</p><p>As journalists covering the story, we have also become part of it. Many of us have had to evacuate, some several times over.</p><p>There have been many days when we have left for work in the morning, not knowing whether we would have a home to return to at the end of the day.</p><p>We've endured the same terror as our readers. We've cried along with them, not at our predicament but at the tribulations of others, who have seen their homes and livelihoods burn, their little patches of paradise reduced to ash.</p><p>We've cried for our beautiful forests and for the wildlife we have lost.</p><p>We've cried with gratitude for the firefighters who have battling flames for what seems like an eternity.</p><p>We've cried because we've been frightened.</p><p>Unless you have been there, watching the sky turn from cobalt blue to orange, to red and then to pitch black at 3pm, it is impossible to fathom the fear.</p><p>Unless you have received the text message telling you it is too late to leave, you cannot get a true sense of the danger.</p><p>And unless you drive through the burnt zone, you cannot appreciate the ferocity of the fire and the destruction it has wrought.</p><p>For many city people, the impact of the fire emergency has been serious but indirect - dystopian skies filled with smoke, cancelled holidays, inconvenience. Their reaction, when they see for the first time what you have been experiencing for weeks, is revealing on a couple of levels.</p><p>First, their shock at the sheer destructive power of the flames. We stopped in the burnt zone along Nerriga Road with Illawarra Mercury photographer Sylvia Liber on December 30 in a landscape which appeared to have been nuked. Trees were blackened, everything but their trunks consumed. There was deadly silence - no insects, no birdsong. And there was heat. Not from the sky above but from the ground below. As we took photos, we remarked on the almost spectral beauty of the destruction. It was otherworldly.</p><p>Second, for us who live with the fire, the dreadful realisation we have started to adapt to the so-called \"new normal\", becoming accustomed to our destroyed world, which is anything but normal.</p><p>Read more: The Shoalhaven town where the ground still burns</p><p>We put fresh eyes on the fire again this week when photographer Robert Peet accompanied us to Budgong at the back of Kangaroo Valley, where the Currowan Fire leapt up into the Southern Highlands on January 4.</p><p>A recent lick of rain had turned the valley emerald green but a few kilometres over Mt Scanzi, everything was black. The all-too familiar aftermath left Robert momentarily speechless.</p><p>\"I've seen plenty of fires but nothing on this scale,\" he said finally, visibly shaken.</p><p>We followed what has become a routine work pattern in the burnt zone, pulling up when we saw people and talking to them about their experiences.</p><p>Out where the apocalypse has been, people are happy to share their experiences. It's a cathartic way of processing the unimaginable.</p><p>We've found this all over the fire ground, from Runnyford west of Batemans Bay to Lake Conjola, from Budgong out to Nerriga.</p><p>The fire emergency may have destroyed homes, infrastructure and forests but it has strengthened community. Neighbours who were strangers now talk to each other at every opportunity. Old differences have been set aside as people turn to each other for support.</p><p>Now the adrenaline of the emergency is abating, people who have been through hell will need to talk and people who haven't should listen.</p><p>If there is one lesson from this emergency, it is that nowhere is safe.</p><p>Seasoned firefighters will tell you not to turn your back on these fires, that they still have the potential to run across the high ground, into the escarpment and all the way into Sutherland.</p><p>Those residents who either lost homes or successfully fought off the flames will tell you the speed at which the fire moves in adverse conditions is unlike anything they have ever imagined. The faces of people who had close calls with death at the height of the emergency still look haunted.</p><p>That's why everyone in the burnt zone is still on edge. Even places which burned weeks ago have reignited. Danger lurks everywhere, with trees falling or dropping limbs and underground fires still burning.</p><p>After weeks living in and traversing this strange new world, returning to any sense of normality will take a very long time.</p><p>The whole experience will never be forgotten.</p><p>___________________________</p><p>It has been Australia's lost summer.

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation.

He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume.

Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney.

In this extract, he tells the story of David Tener, whose wife Alison died in the 2003 Canberra fires.</emphasis> David Tener lost his wife Alison in the Canberra bushfires of 2003. The couple were renting a Defence home in Duffy, a dormitory suburb in the city's south-west. He worked in maintenance for the Air Force, and she had been a stay-at-home mum to their three boys until she started a new job at Air Services.   They'd met when they were young, on a Contiki tour of America in the mid-'80s. Both were travelling with mates, and he'd gone up to her -- a total stranger -- and sat in her lap when they were on the bus. Alison thought David was a bit forward, but they hit it off and got married in 1987. When he proposed, David told her in all seriousness: \"You've got to understand, I married the Air Force first\". Both knew there would be sacrifices.   They moved around the country as he was rotated through bases at Fairbairn, Williamstown and then Richmond, north-west of Sydney. By late 2002 David was facing a possible deployment to Iraq, returning to the base after Christmas, and he suggested to Alison on a whim that maybe she would like a couple of weeks to herself, offering to take the boys to stay with her parents in Coffs Harbour. Alison agreed, having never had a break as a full-time mum.   So she was home alone on Saturday, January 18 as an unprecedented firestorm threatened Canberra.\u00a0  The Teners' home in Duffy was a two-storey weatherboard on Burrendong Street, just one block back from enormous, thick pine plantations at the south-western edge of the ACT. David distinctly remembers being in the upstairs rumpus room one day with Alison.   \"She was looking out the window at all the birds singing and the trees and whatever, and she said, 'Oh, it's just so beautiful here, I love it. It's so wonderful'. You know, I still remember saying to her, 'Yeah', I said, 'but if a fire ever gets into that forest they'll never stop it, it'll be like a nuke going off'.\"  The 2003 bushfires had started on January 8, when dry lightning strikes set off more than 100 wildfires in the Australian Alps that would take out almost 2 million hectares of high country across the ACT, NSW and Victoria.  \"What stood out about 2003 is that it was all lightning,\" says Phil Zylstra, a researcher with the Bushfires and Natural Hazards Co-operative Research Centre at the University of Wollongong, \"and there's no indication that that has happened since colonisation of Australia. They were an order of magnitude larger than the worst we'd had for half a century before then.\"   Four large fires threatened Canberra: one at McIntyres Hut in the Brindabella National Park in NSW, and three in the ACT's Namadgi National Park -- at Mount Gingera, Bendora and Stockyard Spur. Firefighters initially believed all four could be brought under control, but the predicted fire weather was worse than Ash Wednesday and the Territory was tinder-dry as the Millennium Drought set in: river flows had dropped, grass cured, fuel loads were heavy, and all dead-and-down timber was flammable.   Gradually the main fires converged, and after a feared north-westerly wind shift on the Saturday morning a \"fire tornado\" whipped up between the Bendora and McIntyres Hut fires -- the first time such a phenomenon had been observed anywhere in the world.   Firefighters were stunned: the fire front moved at 20km an hour, later described as the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere. It had become unstoppable, and the ACT's fire chiefs knew that day the firestorm would burn through the pine plantations and into Canberra.\u00a0  Canberra, January 19, 2003. The suburbs of Chapman and Duffy following a bush fire that raged through the ACT western suburbs (Image: AAP /Alan Porritt/courtesy ABC)  None of this was communicated to Canberra residents, who from 2pm were growing increasingly alarmed at the approaching thick, black smoke and falling ash and embers.   At last a state of emergency was declared at around 2.45 pm, which was broadcast to the public by ABC Radio via an official warning some minutes later. Even then, the broadcast suggested there were no fires in the suburbs and no evacuations, and Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, who came on air directly afterwards, said the declaration was administrative and people should not be unduly alarmed.   The substance of the warning, when it finally came, was that residents should return to their homes and prepare to defend them from embers by clearing gutters, connecting hoses and wetting down the exterior, removing flammable items near the house, and so on. Residents were also told to fill their bathtubs and buckets and dampen towels -- although, as the coroner later noted, the somewhat cryptic message did not explain why.  Alison admitted to a neighbour she was frightened, yet she kept calm. According to neighbours who survived, Alison seemed unsure whether to stay or go. She was seen closing the curtains, and had packed photos and a few other precious things into the car, which was in the carport ready and waiting. Her neighbours did leave, but at some point Alison must have gone back into the house -- possibly, David thinks, to get their cat -- and found herself trapped inside by a firestorm that approached like a freight train.   She climbed into the bathtub, apparently misunderstanding the point of the emergency warning, which was to use the water to put out any spot fires inside the home. Alison died in the bathtub of smoke inhalation. The car in the carport survived.  Up in Richmond, David had no idea that bushfires were threatening Canberra's suburbs. He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;

He was rostered off and relaxing at a mate's house-warming when he got a phone call from a friend in Canberra offering to put Alison up if she needed accommodation. David turned on the television, saw that the firestorm had swept through Duffy and then recognised his street.   \"I remember looking at it and going, 'Oh crap, oh crap, oh crap, that looks like my house',\" David recalls. He hadn't spoken to Alison since the day before, so he called her but could not get through on her mobile or the landline. Panicky, David jumped in the car and sped down the Hume. When he got there that night, the police had his entire suburb cordoned off. He said seeing his suburb levelled was surreal.   \"The best way to describe it was as if a nuclear weapon had been detonated, and yet it picked and chose which houses to destroy, and which not to. Basically you had, for example, the house beside us on the left, totally intact, untouched. Our house, vaporised to the ground level. And the next house gone, and then a house standing, and then another house gone, and then two houses standing, and then, like, four houses gone. It was utterly random.\"  In her powerful report on the four deaths that occurred that day, coroner Maria Doogan could not be certain whether Alison had heard the confusing radio warning, but singled out her case as a tragic example of the incompetence of ACT authorities and their failure to alert the public.   \"I don't even want to think about what was going on in her head at that moment,\" says David now. \"Had she not gone to the house itself, she would have lived,\" says David, ruing that he had not been at home to get her out. \"Not being there for her will forever haunt me. The guilt is unbearable.\"  Of the 470 homes lost that day, 219 were in Duffy, with fires spreading house to house. \"In hindsight,\" says David, \"when you consider that about 500 homes were destroyed, and when you consider how ferocious and strong and powerful the fire storm was ... and when you consider that the warnings were to stay in place, or to return to your home, the fact that only four died is unbelievable.\"  David was now put in a terrible situation. \"I don't know what was worse,\" he recalls. \"Realising that my wife had died, or having to get on the phone and tell the kids before they saw it on the TV. To this day, the most chilling thing in my heart that I can ever remember is hearing them screaming over the phone: 'Mummy, Mummy, Mummy, no, no, no'.\"  Even after more than a decade, David says it's only in the last few years he's been able to talk about Alison's death. He commenced a class action against the ACT government for failing to manage the fires and failing to warn the public. The case ran for some years until he reached an out-of-court settlement.  \"They reported it as if we backed out, but we didn't,\" David says. \"I can't disclose an amount or anything like that but I will say that it was quite pathetic. If you knew what we received, you'd be quite shocked, people have been compensated more for slipping over in the supermarket.\" David Tener at this wife Alison's memorial (Image: Paddy Manning) One positive for David is that in the 2019-20 fire season, the ACT Emergency Services hierarchy displayed a far more professional approach, with thorough and timely public warnings.   \"To this end hopefully Alison and three others did not die in vain,\" he says.\u00a0  David describes himself as \"strictly a layman\" when it comes to climate science. He has no doubt the planet is warming but believes it's at least partly to do with natural cycles. \"So basically I believe the planet is headed for one of its hot spells, and man is speeding it up. Like I said, I believe it's naturally occurring, but we are -- ironically, if you want to use a saying -- throwing fuel on the fire.\"  David has no doubt that dry lightning is igniting more fires, and that it's directly related to drought and climate change. \"Because you're having less moisture in the soil, you're having more loose soil getting into the air, you're getting these dust storms ... and they are going to create static and they do have to discharge somewhere, hence the dry lightning.\"  Asked directly if he counts himself and Alison as victims of climate change, David pauses to reflect. \"That's a hard one to answer, to be quite honest with you ... Australia has always had bushfires, and we always will. But I do believe we have entered a new age of bushfires, where the manner in which they are being started is new and different. And yes, that could well be put down to climate change.\"  Later in our conversation, David circles back to answer the question again later: \"If it can be shown, categorically, that the Canberra fires were started by dry lightning, then yes, I guess we could say we were a victim.\"  Alison Tener was perhaps one of the first climate casualties in Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Postscript: At a May </emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/fire-season-extends-by-almost-four-months-in-parts-of-australia-20200525-p54w28.html\">hearing</url><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"> of the Bushfires Royal Commission, the Bureau of Meteorology's Dr Karl Braganza said the first two decades of the century stood out as warmer than any previous period, increasing the odds of extreme weather, including more severe bushfires. </emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">\"Really since the Canberra 2003 fires every jurisdiction in Australia has seen this,\" he said. \"[We] have seen some really significant fire events that have challenged what we do to respond to them, and have really challenged what we thought fire weather looked like preceding this period.\"</emphasis><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This is an extract from <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.simonandschuster.com.au/p/body-count-paddy-manning\">Body Count by Paddy Manning</url>, published by Simon &amp;
