Thousands of firefighters are suffering from PTSD after Black Summer, which was made then worse by the COVID-19 lockdowns preventing \"vital debriefing and counselling\".   Also, Australia was battling an ageing workforce among firefighters as younger would-be volunteers who lived through the torrid wall-to-wall coverage of Black Summer were not putting their hand up like generations before them.   All of this was made worse by the longer burning and more widespread fires in both countries. During Black Summer in Australia, \"every state and territory burned at the same time\", Mullins said, preventing firefighters from going interstate. It was the same in Canada this year -- every one of the 10 provinces and three territories battled infernos.   It's not just the number of boots on the ground, Mullins said. Also compromised were \"major firefighting assets such as large water-bombing helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, all but two of which in Australia are leased from Canada and the USA\".   Amanda Lamont agrees. She's a volunteer firefighter and the former head of the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience during Black Summer and told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crikey</emphasis> the emergency management sector was already working on ways to respond to \"overlapping and cascading disasters\" while helping our overseas counterparts. But it was getting harder: \"There is a saying in firefighting that says you fight the fire you've got, not the one you might get.   \"I see this sentiment changing. Where once resources may more readily have been deployed interstate or overseas, [they] are now potentially being held back because the risk of mega bushfires locally is growing and creating a more risk-averse approach.  \"It comes at a time when the need for people to support each other and respond to extreme and overlapping disasters either informally through civic duty, or through formal emergency management arrangements, is growing.\"  Lamont is also co-founder of the Australasian Women in Emergencies Network volunteer firefighters, and said it was now \"beyond doubt\" in the emergency management sector that climate change was accelerating more extreme, more frequent and overlapping disasters in Australia and around the world: \"We no longer need to speak rhetoric on this topic -- we just need to look out the window.\"   Mullins warned there was no immediate fix to Australia's firefighting shortage: \"Australia cannot afford to replace volunteer firefighters with paid firefighters -- there are about 300,000 emergency service volunteers in Australia and about 30,000 paid professionals.\"   But he said the Albanese government must urgently fund more paid personnel in the short term, and nearly double the emissions reduction target to 75% in the longer term.

Thousands of firefighters are suffering from PTSD after Black Summer, which was made then worse by the COVID-19 lockdowns preventing \"vital debriefing and counselling\".   Also, Australia was battling an ageing workforce among firefighters as younger would-be volunteers who lived through the torrid wall-to-wall coverage of Black Summer were not putting their hand up like generations before them.   All of this was made worse by the longer burning and more widespread fires in both countries. During Black Summer in Australia, \"every state and territory burned at the same time\", Mullins said, preventing firefighters from going interstate. It was the same in Canada this year -- every one of the 10 provinces and three territories battled infernos.   It's not just the number of boots on the ground, Mullins said. Also compromised were \"major firefighting assets such as large water-bombing helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, all but two of which in Australia are leased from Canada and the USA\".   Amanda Lamont agrees. She's a volunteer firefighter and the former head of the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience during Black Summer and told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crikey</emphasis> the emergency management sector was already working on ways to respond to \"overlapping and cascading disasters\" while helping our overseas counterparts. But it was getting harder: \"There is a saying in firefighting that says you fight the fire you've got, not the one you might get.   \"I see this sentiment changing. Where once resources may more readily have been deployed interstate or overseas, [they] are now potentially being held back because the risk of mega bushfires locally is growing and creating a more risk-averse approach.  \"It comes at a time when the need for people to support each other and respond to extreme and overlapping disasters either informally through civic duty, or through formal emergency management arrangements, is growing.\"  Lamont is also co-founder of the Australasian Women in Emergencies Network volunteer firefighters, and said it was now \"beyond doubt\" in the emergency management sector that climate change was accelerating more extreme, more frequent and overlapping disasters in Australia and around the world: \"We no longer need to speak rhetoric on this topic -- we just need to look out the window.\"   Mullins warned there was no immediate fix to Australia's firefighting shortage: \"Australia cannot afford to replace volunteer firefighters with paid firefighters -- there are about 300,000 emergency service volunteers in Australia and about 30,000 paid professionals.\"   But he said the Albanese government must urgently fund more paid personnel in the short term, and nearly double the emissions reduction target to 75% in the longer term.

Thousands of firefighters are suffering from PTSD after Black Summer, which was made then worse by the COVID-19 lockdowns preventing \"vital debriefing and counselling\".   Also, Australia was battling an ageing workforce among firefighters as younger would-be volunteers who lived through the torrid wall-to-wall coverage of Black Summer were not putting their hand up like generations before them.   All of this was made worse by the longer burning and more widespread fires in both countries. During Black Summer in Australia, \"every state and territory burned at the same time\", Mullins said, preventing firefighters from going interstate. It was the same in Canada this year -- every one of the 10 provinces and three territories battled infernos.   It's not just the number of boots on the ground, Mullins said. Also compromised were \"major firefighting assets such as large water-bombing helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, all but two of which in Australia are leased from Canada and the USA\".   Amanda Lamont agrees. She's a volunteer firefighter and the former head of the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience during Black Summer and told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crikey</emphasis> the emergency management sector was already working on ways to respond to \"overlapping and cascading disasters\" while helping our overseas counterparts. But it was getting harder: \"There is a saying in firefighting that says you fight the fire you've got, not the one you might get.   \"I see this sentiment changing. Where once resources may more readily have been deployed interstate or overseas, [they] are now potentially being held back because the risk of mega bushfires locally is growing and creating a more risk-averse approach.  \"It comes at a time when the need for people to support each other and respond to extreme and overlapping disasters either informally through civic duty, or through formal emergency management arrangements, is growing.\"  Lamont is also co-founder of the Australasian Women in Emergencies Network volunteer firefighters, and said it was now \"beyond doubt\" in the emergency management sector that climate change was accelerating more extreme, more frequent and overlapping disasters in Australia and around the world: \"We no longer need to speak rhetoric on this topic -- we just need to look out the window.\"   Mullins warned there was no immediate fix to Australia's firefighting shortage: \"Australia cannot afford to replace volunteer firefighters with paid firefighters -- there are about 300,000 emergency service volunteers in Australia and about 30,000 paid professionals.\"   But he said the Albanese government must urgently fund more paid personnel in the short term, and nearly double the emissions reduction target to 75% in the longer term.

Thousands of firefighters are suffering from PTSD after Black Summer, which was made then worse by the COVID-19 lockdowns preventing \"vital debriefing and counselling\".   Also, Australia was battling an ageing workforce among firefighters as younger would-be volunteers who lived through the torrid wall-to-wall coverage of Black Summer were not putting their hand up like generations before them.   All of this was made worse by the longer burning and more widespread fires in both countries. During Black Summer in Australia, \"every state and territory burned at the same time\", Mullins said, preventing firefighters from going interstate. It was the same in Canada this year -- every one of the 10 provinces and three territories battled infernos.   It's not just the number of boots on the ground, Mullins said. Also compromised were \"major firefighting assets such as large water-bombing helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, all but two of which in Australia are leased from Canada and the USA\".   Amanda Lamont agrees. She's a volunteer firefighter and the former head of the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience during Black Summer and told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crikey</emphasis> the emergency management sector was already working on ways to respond to \"overlapping and cascading disasters\" while helping our overseas counterparts. But it was getting harder: \"There is a saying in firefighting that says you fight the fire you've got, not the one you might get.   \"I see this sentiment changing. Where once resources may more readily have been deployed interstate or overseas, [they] are now potentially being held back because the risk of mega bushfires locally is growing and creating a more risk-averse approach.  \"It comes at a time when the need for people to support each other and respond to extreme and overlapping disasters either informally through civic duty, or through formal emergency management arrangements, is growing.\"  Lamont is also co-founder of the Australasian Women in Emergencies Network volunteer firefighters, and said it was now \"beyond doubt\" in the emergency management sector that climate change was accelerating more extreme, more frequent and overlapping disasters in Australia and around the world: \"We no longer need to speak rhetoric on this topic -- we just need to look out the window.\"   Mullins warned there was no immediate fix to Australia's firefighting shortage: \"Australia cannot afford to replace volunteer firefighters with paid firefighters -- there are about 300,000 emergency service volunteers in Australia and about 30,000 paid professionals.\"   But he said the Albanese government must urgently fund more paid personnel in the short term, and nearly double the emissions reduction target to 75% in the longer term.

Canadian Interagency Forest Fire Centre (CIFFC) chief executive Kim Connors told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crikey</emphasis> the government-owned corporation was in \"continuous communication\" with the Australasian Fire and Emergency Service Authorities Council about the \"evolving bushfire situation\" and would \"consider\" any requests.  But he said Canadian personnel were suffering from \"seasonal fatigue and [deteriorating] physical and mental health\" after <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.crikey.com.au/2023/06/02/canada-bushfires-australia-summer/\">18.5 million hectares went up in flames</url> this year amid some 6,500 wildfires. It's three times the country's record inferno of 1995, and it led to the deaths of two Canadian firefighters.   Emergency sharing between the two allied nations has been taking place since the turn of the century, though the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience confirmed none had been requested since 2020, when nearly 100 Canadian fire experts were sent to help in Black Summer. This year, 627 Australian firefighters went to Canada (alongside volunteers from the US, Mexico and New Zealand).   International reticence is bad news for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-18/bushfire-risk-high-lack-of-volunteers-places-pressure-on-rfs/102866798\">short-staffed firefighting brigades</url> across Australia as <url normalizedValue=\"https://ca.news.yahoo.com/residents-rural-australia-urged-evacuate-041117303.html\">thousands of besieged rural residents</url> have already been evacuated from fires -- more than a month out from the first day of summer. In September, Disaster Relief Australia issued an urgent callout for volunteers to address a shortfall of 3,000 or so members -- including a shortage of\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.news.com.au/travel/travel-updates/health-safety/critical-unions-fears-over-shortage-of-aviation-firefighters-at-airports-across-australia/news-story/907d322c0a85ea5d476ce1bfc75626a0\">aviation\u00a0firefighters</url> and in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/victoria/fire-rescue-victoria-battling-staff-shortage-as-vaccine-mandate-low-morale-hits-staff/news-story/dc95ed5e479aa80487cf806afa1a5865\">fire crews in Victoria</url>.\u00a0  A few things are causing declining numbers in emergency services, former Fire and Rescue NSW commissioner Greg Mullins told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crikey</emphasis>. Thousands of firefighters are suffering from PTSD after Black Summer, which was made then worse by the COVID-19 lockdowns preventing \"vital debriefing and counselling\".   Also, Australia was battling an ageing workforce among firefighters as younger would-be volunteers who lived through the torrid wall-to-wall coverage of Black Summer were not putting their hand up like generations before them.   All of this was made worse by the longer burning and more widespread fires in both countries. During Black Summer in Australia, \"every state and territory burned at the same time\", Mullins said, preventing firefighters from going interstate. It was the same in Canada this year -- every one of the 10 provinces and three territories battled infernos.   It's not just the number of boots on the ground, Mullins said. Also compromised were \"major firefighting assets such as large water-bombing helicopters and fixed-wing aircraft, all but two of which in Australia are leased from Canada and the USA\".   Amanda Lamont agrees. She's a volunteer firefighter and the former head of the Australian Institute for Disaster Resilience during Black Summer and told <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Crikey</emphasis> the emergency management sector was already working on ways to respond to \"overlapping and cascading disasters\" while helping our overseas counterparts. But it was getting harder: \"There is a saying in firefighting that says you fight the fire you've got, not the one you might get.   \"I see this sentiment changing. Where once resources may more readily have been deployed interstate or overseas, [they] are now potentially being held back because the risk of mega bushfires locally is growing and creating a more risk-averse approach.  \"It comes at a time when the need for people to support each other and respond to extreme and overlapping disasters either informally through civic duty, or through formal emergency management arrangements, is growing.\"  Lamont is also co-founder of the Australasian Women in Emergencies Network volunteer firefighters, and said it was now \"beyond doubt\" in the emergency management sector that climate change was accelerating more extreme, more frequent and overlapping disasters in Australia and around the world: \"We no longer need to speak rhetoric on this topic -- we just need to look out the window.\"   Mullins warned there was no immediate fix to Australia's firefighting shortage: \"Australia cannot afford to replace volunteer firefighters with paid firefighters -- there are about 300,000 emergency service volunteers in Australia and about 30,000 paid professionals.\"   But he said the Albanese government must urgently fund more paid personnel in the short term, and nearly double the emissions reduction target to 75% in the longer term. (Prime Minister Anthony Albanese said yesterday he would announce <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/politics/anthony-albanese-gets-down-for-island-fling-over-climate-but-declines-treaty-of-rarotonga-tango/news-story/b701b3f5a7c2f07df350904f7367e065\">an \"achievable\" new target \"at an appropriate time\"</url>.)  \"We need to face the fact that right now we are living with the consequences of decades of climate inaction,\" Mullins said. \"We have a moral duty to do everything we can to ensure that we are not dooming future generations to much worse than we\u2019re already experiencing.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69P1-SFW1-JD6R-T024-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"851\"/><timeReceived>10:46:10 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 10, 2023 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

You should leave using the Ararat Halls Gap Road and head towards Ararat. When you leave remember to take your pets, medications, mobile phone and charger. In the car:</p><p>If you are travelling, do not enter the area. Make a u-turn and travel to safety. Slow down and turn on your headlights. Smoke will make it difficult to see. If you are unable to leave you should shelter indoors:</p><p>Close all exterior doors, windows and vents. Turn off cooling systems. You must take shelter before the fire arrives. The extreme heat is likely to kill you well before the flames reach you. Shelter in a room that has two exits, such as a door or window including one directly to the outside. It is important to be able to see outside so you know what is happening with the fire. If your home catches on fire and the conditions inside become unbearable, you need to get out and go to an area that has already been burnt. If you cannot get indoors, other last resort options include:</p><p>Shelter in the middle of a large open area like a ploughed paddock, football oval or sporting reserve. Get into a large body of water like a dam, lake, river, the ocean or inground pool. Try to protect yourself from the fire's heat. If you are caught in fire in your car:</p><p>Park behind a solid structure to block the fire's heat or pull over to cleared area. Try to position the car towards the approaching fire. Turn on your hazard lights and headlights. Close all windows. Turn off the air-conditioning and shut all the air vents. Turn your car engine off. Get down as low as possible below window level and cover up with a pure woollen blanket. Impacts in your area:</p><p>Trees can be extremely hazardous during a bushfire or high winds. Avoid standing, parking or travelling in areas of fire affected trees. Bushfires can generate extreme heat. Heat will kill you before the fire reaches you. EARLIER: Halls Gap, Pomonal residents have been told to leave as crews battle the new Bellfield blaze.</p><p>The bushfire is travelling in a southerly direction from the Terraces Fire Line.</p><p>A wind change is expected around 2pm, which may cause the fire to change directions towards Pomonal and surrounding communities.</p><p>\"Don't wait, leaving now is the safest option - conditions may change and get worse very quickly,\" the statement said.</p><p>\"Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay.\"</p><p>Update (1.05pm):</p><p>The State Emergency Service has issued a warning for the state, advising severe thunderstorms are likely to occur on Tuesday, February 13.</p><p>\"Damaging winds, heavy rainfall and large hail is possible with the storms in severely affected areas,\" the statement read.</p><p>To stay safe:</p><p>Never attempt to drive through floodwater Avoid camping under trees Adjust your driving to the weather conditions and remain alert for fallen trees and branches Update (12.55pm): The Bellfield fire is now marked under control.</p><p>Three CFA units have moved another fire south east of the blaze.</p><p>The Kellalac sighting has been removed from the list of warnings for the Wimmera.</p><p>Earlier (12.40pm): Emergency services are battling several blazes across the Wimmera and Grampians regions.</p><p>Five CFA crews are working to bring a bushfire under control on Mt Zero Road in Laharum, while another is working on a small fire on the Grampians Peak Trail about nine kilometres west of Dadswells Bridge.</p><p>Two crews are responding to a spotfire on Terraces firelane in Bellfield outside of Halls Gap.</p><p>Further north, a column of smoke was spotted in Kellalac near Warracknabeal.</p><p>Authorities issued advice for Dadswells Bridge, Laharum, Wartook, Halls Gap and Pomonal</p><p>\"There is currently no threat to communities, but you should continue to stay informed and monitor conditions,\" it read.</p><p>Tuesday, February 13, is a Total Fire Ban for the Wimmera, Mallee and Northern Country fire weather districts; the Wimmera is rated as Catastrophic.</p><p>A Catastrophic Fire Danger Rating means conditions will be the most dangerous for a fire under the new Australian Fire Danger Rating System.</p><p>What you should do:</p><p>Monitor weather conditions and warnings. Review your fire survival plan. If you do not have a plan, decide what you will do if the situation changes. Keep the roads clear so emergency services can respond. If you have time, check your neighbours to see if they are monitoring conditions. Impacts in your area:</p><p>Firefighters are responding to this fire. Smoke may visible from nearby communities and roads.

You should leave using the Ararat Halls Gap Road and head towards Ararat. When you leave remember to take your pets, medications, mobile phone and charger. In the car:</p><p>If you are travelling, do not enter the area. Make a u-turn and travel to safety. Slow down and turn on your headlights. Smoke will make it difficult to see. If you are unable to leave you should shelter indoors:</p><p>Close all exterior doors, windows and vents. Turn off cooling systems. You must take shelter before the fire arrives. The extreme heat is likely to kill you well before the flames reach you. Shelter in a room that has two exits, such as a door or window including one directly to the outside. It is important to be able to see outside so you know what is happening with the fire. If your home catches on fire and the conditions inside become unbearable, you need to get out and go to an area that has already been burnt. If you cannot get indoors, other last resort options include:</p><p>Shelter in the middle of a large open area like a ploughed paddock, football oval or sporting reserve. Get into a large body of water like a dam, lake, river, the ocean or inground pool. Try to protect yourself from the fire's heat. If you are caught in fire in your car:</p><p>Park behind a solid structure to block the fire's heat or pull over to cleared area. Try to position the car towards the approaching fire. Turn on your hazard lights and headlights. Close all windows. Turn off the air-conditioning and shut all the air vents. Turn your car engine off. Get down as low as possible below window level and cover up with a pure woollen blanket. Impacts in your area:</p><p>Trees can be extremely hazardous during a bushfire or high winds. Avoid standing, parking or travelling in areas of fire affected trees. Bushfires can generate extreme heat. Heat will kill you before the fire reaches you. EARLIER: Halls Gap, Pomonal residents have been told to leave as crews battle the new Bellfield blaze.</p><p>The bushfire is travelling in a southerly direction from the Terraces Fire Line.</p><p>A wind change is expected around 2pm, which may cause the fire to change directions towards Pomonal and surrounding communities.</p><p>\"Don't wait, leaving now is the safest option - conditions may change and get worse very quickly,\" the statement said.</p><p>\"Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay.\"</p><p>Update (1.05pm):</p><p>The State Emergency Service has issued a warning for the state, advising severe thunderstorms are likely to occur on Tuesday, February 13.</p><p>\"Damaging winds, heavy rainfall and large hail is possible with the storms in severely affected areas,\" the statement read.</p><p>To stay safe:</p><p>Never attempt to drive through floodwater Avoid camping under trees Adjust your driving to the weather conditions and remain alert for fallen trees and branches Update (12.55pm): The Bellfield fire is now marked under control.</p><p>Three CFA units have moved another fire south east of the blaze.</p><p>The Kellalac sighting has been removed from the list of warnings for the Wimmera.</p><p>Earlier (12.40pm): Emergency services are battling several blazes across the Wimmera and Grampians regions.</p><p>Five CFA crews are working to bring a bushfire under control on Mt Zero Road in Laharum, while another is working on a small fire on the Grampians Peak Trail about nine kilometres west of Dadswells Bridge.</p><p>Two crews are responding to a spotfire on Terraces firelane in Bellfield outside of Halls Gap.</p><p>Further north, a column of smoke was spotted in Kellalac near Warracknabeal.</p><p>Authorities issued advice for Dadswells Bridge, Laharum, Wartook, Halls Gap and Pomonal</p><p>\"There is currently no threat to communities, but you should continue to stay informed and monitor conditions,\" it read.</p><p>Tuesday, February 13, is a Total Fire Ban for the Wimmera, Mallee and Northern Country fire weather districts; the Wimmera is rated as Catastrophic.</p><p>A Catastrophic Fire Danger Rating means conditions will be the most dangerous for a fire under the new Australian Fire Danger Rating System.</p><p>What you should do:</p><p>Monitor weather conditions and warnings. Review your fire survival plan. If you do not have a plan, decide what you will do if the situation changes. Keep the roads clear so emergency services can respond. If you have time, check your neighbours to see if they are monitoring conditions. Impacts in your area:</p><p>Firefighters are responding to this fire.

containment lines in wild weather.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Country Fire Service (CFS) on Thursday night said the blaze, which was burning near Lucindale in South Australia's south-east, could threaten people's safety.</p><p>The Coles, Elad Road bushfire was burning uncontrolled in a bluegum forest and on a westerly path toward\u00a0Callendale Road.</p><p>Authorities said people needed to prepare to leave, check the path is clear and go to a safer place.</p><p>The blaze was downgraded from an emergency warning late on Thursday night.</p><p>The CFS said the fire had broken containment lines and multiple spotfires had started to the west of the fireground.</p><p>Emergency messages were sent to locals at risk and ground crews were working to get to affected properties on Thursday night.</p><p>The CFS's Brett Loughlin said\u00a0firefighters had a successful day before one spotfire sparked the blaze again.</p><p>\"That spot occurred in one unburnt section of bluegum timber plantation and the fire has escalated dramatically under those conditions that we've been battling all day,\" Mr Loughlin told ABC Radio Adelaide.</p><p>\"We now have a very dangerous, very dynamic fire situation.</p><p>\"This fire is being driven and generated by these fuel loads and dynamic conditions, and we have reports that the fire is spotting up to 10 kilometres\u00a0ahead of the head of the fire, which is making it very difficult.\"</p><p>The fire was burning in an area between Naracoorte and Mount Gambier and was not posing a threat to Lucindale on Thursday evening.</p><p>\"We are advised from the Bureau of Meteorology\u00a0that this evening (Thursday night) we could see a change in wind direction from the south-east, so we are busily trying to prepare for what impacts that may have on the fire,\" Mr Loughlin said.</p><p>More than 100 firefighters battled the blaze throughout Thursday amid <url

The wildfires are believed to have burnt a record-breaking more than nine hectares of land and displaced more than 150,000 Canadians.</p><p>\"Alberta has been (in) a state of emergency since May 6 and by late May there were over 100 fires going in the province,\" Ms Hall said. \"Canada is currently experiencing a record-shattering fire season with the end being months away, hence why Sam and I put our hands up to help: we are experienced, professional and 'fit' and Canada needed our help.\"</p><p>Ms Hall said it was a once-in-a-lifetime experience.</p><p>\"I enjoyed every second of the deployment even though it was hot, hard, dirty work fighting the wildfires,\" she said.</p><p>She said the team undertook a range of tasks including mopping up, hazard tree assessments and back-burning by foot, working alongside air crafts and bulldozers.</p><p>Ms Hall said one of the things she learnt about was a type of vegetation they had never dealt with called muskeg.</p><p>\"It's basically boggy swamp land and we don't really have those conditions here in Australia,\" she said.</p><p>Mr Bell said the muskeg made it challenging to access the fire line.</p><p>\"Essentially we were transported in helicopters and all these really different machines and transport vehicles (with tracks instead of wheels) we've never seen before,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Bell said the biggest lesson he learnt was the different contexts and approaches to firefighting between the two countries.</p><p>\"Some of the more technical skills around pumps and hoses and work in helicopters will be really valuable to bring back,\" he said.</p><p>He said the team worked 12 to 14 hours a day starting with breakfast at 7am, a team meeting at 8am and a 40-minute drive to the fire line. When not fighting fires, the crew and incident management staff were set up at a mobile camp with more than 100 people, sleeping in tents.</p><p>The pair said a highlight was spotting wildlife including black bears, moose, beavers, coyotes and Canadian lynx.</p><p>IN OTHER NEWS</p><p>Macey's Bistro in Warrnambool sells to PubCo Group</p><p>Woman shaken after sex offender refused to leave home</p><p>Warrnambool's Reid Oval to host AFLW match</p><p>Hammer-wielding man back in jail over $20 drug debt</p><p>City foodshare sees increase in demand but decrease in donations</p><p>Our journalists work hard to provide local, up-to-date news to the community.

Victoria's west are enduring another anxious day, with an out-of-control fire bearing down on dozens of communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blaze\u00a0burning near the town of Beaufort, west of Ballarat, was sparked about 10am Thursday and steadily grew in intensity throughout the day.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Two emergency warnings remain in place for the\u00a0blaze, urging residents in more than 30 communities to leave.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is also a watch and act for communities to the north-east of the fire.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/\">A full list of the towns affected are on Vic Emergency website</url>.</p><p>\"We're getting early reports, unfortunately, of some home losses and as well as multiple sheds,\" the Country Fire Authority's (CFA) chief officer Jason Heffernan said.</p><p>\"We do expect to see significant shed loss, stock loss and fencing.\"</p><p>Premier Jacinta Allan said it had been a tough night for communities around the Buangor region.</p><p>She said the fire was \"extremely active\" and switched direction with the cool change.</p><p>\"Given the active nature of the fire and the difficult terrain in the area, it's going to take some time to assess the full extent of the damage,\" Ms Allan said.</p><p>\"Also, too, they need to be able to go in to areas that are made safe.\"</p><p>The fires come after 40 homes were destroyed by bushfires last week at Pomonal and Dadswells Bridge, also in the state's west, and a further 37 by storm damage on the same day in the state's east.</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Rick Nugent said it had been an incredibly busy 24 hours on the back of a difficult 10 days.</p><p>Mr Nugent said 1,000 firefighters were on the ground overnight trying to save properties and livestock.</p><p>He said 59 aircraft were supporting firefighting efforts.</p><p>\"I have been advised last night by the air attack supervisor that aerial support has potentially saved up to 50 properties in that fire ground, so those efforts are extraordinary in support of the efforts on the ground,\" he said.</p><p>He said at least one home had been destroyed, and many other structures were likely to have burnt down.</p><p>The cause of the fire was still under investigation.\u00a0</p><p>The Western Highway remained closed in both directions between Ballarat-Maryborough Road in Ballarat and the Henty Highway in Horsham because of the fire.</p><p>Authorities have urged drivers to obey the closures to allow fire trucks and emergency crews to travel quickly and safely to the fire ground.</p><p>Train services were also suspended between Ballarat and Ararat, and a number of local schools were closed.</p><h>Volatile fire conditions forecast to continue</h><p>Mr Heffernan said\u00a0conditions that were meant to give firefighters a reprieve overnight did not eventuate and the fire continued to burn towards the town of Elmhurst.</p><p>\"We are expecting some cooler temperatures today, around 18 degrees, however there will be very brisk winds to 30 to 40 kilometres an hour from the south which will further fan that fire in a northerly direction,\" Mr Heffernan said.</p><p>\"I do expect that fire conditions will remain reasonably volatile today.\"</p><p>He said strike teams from the CFA, Forest Fire Management Victoria and Fire Rescue Victoria were being sent from across the state to try to get on top of the fire before fire conditions worsen on Wednesday.</p><p>\"Crews are going to be, over the next couple of days, working really hard to put solid containment lines around the fire where it's come out into the open country and then trying to suppress the fire in the timbered areas,\" he said.</p><p>\"They'll be supported by water bombing aircraft, including the large air tankers.</p><p>\"We're really throwing everything we can at it to try and contain that fire in the lead up to next Wednesday's predicted fire weather day.\"</p><p>Incident controller Richard Burke said the fire moved at about 1 kilometre an hour during the night and spotfires had broken out just south of Elmhurst, particularly around Pipeline Road.</p><p>\"It's still burning in the majority of the forested area. I wouldn't call it contained,\" he said.</p><p>\"There will be times where it will come out into the farmland.\"</p><p>He said phone services were down in the Elmhurst area, which is now in the firing line of the blaze.</p><p>Luke Heagerty from the State Control Centre said areas that were not threatened by the fire yesterday were now under an emergency warning.</p><p>\"That's areas around Amphitheatre, Glenpatrick, Glenlofty and Ben Nevis,\" he said.</p><p>\"We've now got a pretty large area from Beaufort through into the Pyrenees Ranges and back to around where the fire started yesterday around Mount Cole.\"</p><p>He said the property losses were likely to be around Beaufort.</p><p>\"We could see yesterday that with the spot fires that were starting in some of those pockets of grass around Beaufort, and certainly the area where the main fires burned through, there will be some damage,\" Mr Heagerty said.</p><p>\"Until we can get in and do the assessments, it's often hard to assess from the air or at dark whether we're looking at a house, or whether we're looking at a shed, whether we're looking at out buildings so getting that right and being able to provide that information to landowners in the broader community is important for us today and it's one of the top priorities.\"</p><h>Victorians spend night in emergency shelter</h><p>Last night, about 100 residents and their pets from the Victorian towns of Beaufort and Raglan area spent the evening at the relief centre in Ballarat, where the Salvation Army was providing meals.</p><p>Pyrenees Shire Mayor Robert Vance told ABC Radio Melbourne the mood at the relief centre was tense.</p><p>\"People are sitting here, still unknown as to what the outcomes are,\" he said.</p><p>Cr Vance said he was working in the shearing shed on his farm yesterday morning when he first saw the smoke and realised he needed to go.</p><p>\"As time went on I could see that things were getting extremely dangerous, so we cut the power to the shearing shed and ventured off to Ballarat,\" he said.</p><p>Beaufort resident Rob Pelletier said he believed the vast majority of his 56-hectare property had burnt.</p><p>He described the scenes on Thursday night as \"unreal\".</p><p>\"There's trees burning, trees falling over \u2026 it's really quite otherworldly,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Pelletier said his property was a victim of a wind change in the mid-afternoon, as spot fires began to appear around Beaufort.</p><p>He said he knew of many residents who had evacuated to Ballarat.</p><p>\"They're smart not to [stay], if you're not prepared,\" he said.</p><p>Karrina White initially stayed in Raglan while the local CFA crew was on hand to protect the town.</p><p>But when the firefighters were called away, she evacuated to the Wendouree relief centre with her mother, daughter, four chickens, four rabbits and their cat.</p><p>\"We were at the base of Mount Cole and we could just see it coming up over the mountain lake,\" she said.</p><p>\"It was pretty hectic.\"</p><p>Ms White said she had heard from people who stayed behind that her house was intact.</p><p>She said she was worried she wouldn\u2019t make it to the evacuation centre after discovering her car\u2019s fuel tank was on empty.</p><p>\"The [fuel station] was just closing because apparently they had embers coming in the foyer of the petrol station.\"</p><p>The family was planning to head to a local charity store today because they had only packed clothing suitable for yesterday\u2019s extreme heat and were feeling

CEO Emma Little said about 17 people spent the night at the Maryborough relief centre but more locals were arriving from surrounding communities as the emergency warning expanded.</p><p>She said

Listen to those who know and have made a lifetime study such as Associate Professor Kevin Tolhurst, and local CFA firefighters.</p><p>Like always, it will be a case of can't see the trees (what's left of them) for the smoke!</p><p>Darryl Wells, Werribee CFA member and former captain</p><p>Timber is on the ground Regarding the article on the Wombat Forest court case, Justice Melinda Richards stated that the timber was still in the coupe but was standing.</p><p>The only problem is the timber is on the ground - and the lawyers for Vic Forests should have been smart enough to pick her up on this.</p><p>The big difference, Justice Richards, is the timber has been lying on the ground for several years and drying out, whereas it was green while standing. Most of the head material would be very dry now, which makes a huge difference if there is a fire.</p><p>Justice Richards seems to have disregarded the evidence of Kevin Tolhurst, who would be the most respected fire expert in the country.</p><p>In my opinion, Justice Richards has shown what side of the fence she is on. Also Justice Richards, when one prepares a fire in the wood heater at home all the timber is laid down bunched up and crossed over so as to help with ignition. It's the same situation as the Wombat Forest only on a much larger scale.</p><p>Jim O'Dowd, Colac</p><p>Fires a sign of what's to come The past few days have reinforced CFA's messaging about the importance of preparing for fire, with significant outbreaks across East and South Gippsland impacting dozens of communities.</p><p>These early fires are a signal of what's to come this summer and it's important that households are ready and have a fire plan in place.</p><p>Last week, The Weekly Times editorial questioned the fire danger warnings issued in Victoria on a day when a different fire danger warning was in place in NSW.</p><p>There is a difference between the fuel type, fuel load and conditions on either side of the Victoria/NSW border in East Gippsland. The southern parts of NSW has large area of grassland and little to no grassland on the other side of the border in Victoria.</p><p>This is why fire danger ratings can vary between the two states, regardless of the weather conditions.</p><p>Victorians can be assured that our fire danger ratings are based on detailed and expert observations of the local conditions and specific landscape and fuel conditions and type in each municipality across the state.</p><p>As the hundreds of volunteers who have been out on the fireground over the past few days would attest, CFA brigades are well prepared to respond when called on to support their communities.</p><p>Jason Heffernan, CFA Chief Officer</p><p>Prepare for a double whammy Since 1961, when records first reported the influence of the Indian Ocean Dipole on the Australian climate, there's been nine positive (dry) events ('Double whammy brings on the heat', TWT, Sept 27).</p><p>Four have been double-whammies, with two of them in 1994 and 1997 during the crippling Millennium Drought.</p><p>The most recent, in 2015, coincided with a particularly severe El Nino. And while the 2019 El Nino may have been weak, it has the Black Summer's notch on its pistol grip. What these two have in store for us this time around is anybody's guess.</p><p>John Mosig, Kew</p><p>New Premier has previous form Victorians may have sighed in relief at the resignation of Daniel Andrews, but the track record of our new Premier is deeply concerning.</p><p>Some Victorians talk about Jacinta Allan being handed a poisoned chalice, but the reality is her fingerprints are all over it.</p><p>Just last year, she and Andrews promised a Commonwealth Games in regional Victoria. With Allan as Minister for Commonwealth Games Delivery, it was then axed, with more than $600m wasted.</p><p>She failed to champion regional Victoria then and there's little hope she will now.

and October, according to the Victorian Conservation Regulator.\u00a0</p><p>Nangeela State Forest is located near the South West town of Casterton.</p><p>Within the forest, there are concealed cameras set up with the intention of stopping illegal firewood operations.</p><p>After being captured on the cameras monitored by the\u00a0regulator, the three men admitted to cutting down red gums and taking 4 cubic metres of wood.</p><p>The men were all fined under the Forests Act 1958, and two of the offenders were given additional infringements for illegal off-road driving in breach of\u00a0Land Conservation (Vehicle Control) Regulations 2013.\u00a0</p><p>Collectively, the men will be forced to pay $4,810 in fines.\u00a0</p><p>In Victoria, there are strict rules around firewood collection for domestic use.</p><p>Collection from public land is only available in designated areas listed on the Conservation Regulator website\u00a0during the autumn and spring firewood collection seasons.</p><p>During this time there's a limit of 2 cubic metres per person, per day, with no more than 16 cubic metres to be collected per household within a financial year.</p><p>Only fallen timber without hollows can be taken.\u00a0</p><h>Warning as winter approaches</h><p>In a statement, Forest and Wildlife officer for the Barwon South West region\u00a0Simon Donald said the fines should serve

said.\u00a0</p><p>\"Anyone illegally taking timber from public land is destroying wildlife habitat and putting our threatened native species at risk.\"</p><p>The warning\u00a0comes as the Conservation

Now they are as likely to be known for extreme weather of the kind that led to 70,000 Burning Man attendees being trapped on site for days last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since 2013, about 41 Australian music festivals have been disrupted by bushfires, floods, lightning storms, wind or extreme heat.</p><p>Most of these disruptions occurred in the past three years, with more than 20 festivals being relocated, postponed or cancelled due to dangerous weather fuelled by climate change. The biggest of these was Splendour in the Grass in 2022, which had its first day cancelled following heavy rain and floods.</p><p>The music industry has been forced to confront vital questions: If the level of disruption continues at this rate, how much longer can outdoor music festivals continue, and what do they need to change to survive?</p><p>Though weather has always been a consideration when planning large outdoor events, Tara Medina, co-founder of Strawberry Fields - a music festival in Tocumwal, NSW that was cancelled because of La Nina-related flooding last year - says climate change has made extreme weather more frequent, severe and unpredictable.</p><p>\"The weather for our first four or five events was reasonably consistent,\" Medina says. \"The variance was: you're either going to get 20mm of rain, and it'll be colder, or it's going to be 35 degrees and hot. The extremes for us now are: it's going to be 42 degrees and a catastrophic bushfire day, or it's going to be seven metres underwater. The sweet spots are getting more and more rare.\"</p><p>Other popular festivals such as Yours and Owls in Wollongong, The Grass is Greener in Canberra and Geelong and Splendour In The Grass in the Northern Rivers were either partially or entirely cancelled shortly before the events were due to begin last year - a period that was supposed to mark the festival circuit's glorious comeback after its COVID-induced hiatus.</p><p>Splendour In The Grass became \"Splendour In The Mud\" after its first day of acts were axed following non-stop rain along the NSW coast. Now, the festival - usually the biggest in the country - is struggling to sell out and major international acts are cancelling their appearances.</p><p>This could be catastrophic for local artists who depend on festivals for exposure, as well as the Australian music scene at large, says Catherine Strong, an associate professor at RMIT who has researched the impact of climate change on music festivals.</p><p>\"We're used to having this period where overseas bands come to play the festivals and then play other venues as well,\" Strong says. \"These disruptions could threaten Australia's viability as a touring stock on a worldwide level.\"</p><p>It's not just Australian festivals that are facing these threats. Croatia's Fresh Island Festival was temporarily evacuated because of a forest fire in 2019 and, more recently, about 70,000 people became trapped at Nevada's Black Rock Desert after this year's Burning Man festival became a quagmire after a deluge of rain.</p><p>These kinds of worst-case scenarios not only deter festival-goers from buying tickets in advance (or from going entirely), they also contribute to already skyrocketing insurance premiums for the organisers.</p><p>So, if music festivals cannot continue as is, what could the more climate-friendly festivals of the future look like?</p><p>Green says organisers may turn to smaller-scale localised events that require less travel and create less waste, such as festivals sprawled throughout city streets and more indoor shows.</p><p>But beyond government and industry, Medina says festivals above all need audiences to commit to buying tickets early. \"If we don't know whether the crowds are going to show up, then what are we fighting for? Without their trust, we don't have the confidence to invest in the future.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7rvr05u6f2gxjtvi1hf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:694J-5VM1-JD34-V3P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"649\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;
