One example of excitable media is the dry trees and dry litter in a forest. This particular theory of excitable media describes how a forest fire starts, and then spreads.</p><p>Another example of excitable media is the set of muscles that make up your heart tissue. When they are given a little jolt of electricity, the muscles in your heart will contract.</p><p>It turns out that there are quite a few electrical abnormalities of the heart that involve problems with the excitability of the heart tissue - either it's too excitable, or it's not excitable enough. In fact, the theory of excitable media can also predict that some people will have extra heartbeats.</p><p>But it was a bit of a surprise to find that this theory of excitable media could deal with something as complicated as human behaviour - but then again, we are talking about a sports event.</p><p>You can think of a person as being an excitable unit - and that's not so unusual. This simply means that a person can be prompted into action by some sort of external stimulus. In general, the closer and more powerful the stimulus is, the more the human being, as an excitable unit, will respond.</p><p>So to explain how a Mexican wave can get started and keep rolling, each person needs only three internal rules that they obey, one after the other. First, they wait in their resting state, ready to be excited by the right stimulus. Second, when stimulated, they go through the active phase where they stand up and wave their arms. Third, they progress to the refractory phase, which is what you and I would call \"sitting down again\".</p><p>You now might say that this research is incredibly useless. But it is important with regard to crowd control. When you have 100,000 people at a sports event, simply moving them in and out of the stadium can be dangerous if it's not done wisely.</p><p> *\u00a0 Edited insight from Dr Karl Kruszelnicki's latest book, Bumbreath, Botox and Bubbles,\u00a0 published by HarperCollins.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV0401231055355918</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEADVERTISERLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4BHK-17S0-015G-X54B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"346\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Advertiser</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>January 23, 2004 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001089</classCode><className>MATHEMATICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001154</classCode><className>MODELING &amp; SIMULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001154</classCode><className>MODELING &amp; SIMULATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The bad news is that it doesn't mean the greenhouse effect will reduce.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology says the signs are that El Nino will peak around January and February, and after that will weaken.</p><p>National Climate Centre head Michael Coughlan says that once the El Nino peaks, its effects fade fairly quickly over Australia. Of course there are no guarantees, but indicators include the Southern Oscillation Index, which is negative during an El Nino event, has moved back to positive.</p><p>However, former head of CSIRO's climate modelling program Barrie Hunt warns that a return to normal rainfall does not mean that the greenhouse effect is lessening.</p><p>And a joint study by CSIRO and the Bureau of Meteorology into the climate change impact on fire weather revealed that Canberra could expect a marked increase in the annual average of very high or extreme fire danger days by 2050.</p><p>The study found the danger was likely to increase from the current 23.1 days to an annual average of 27.9-38.3 days by 2050. The new report, intended to help south-east Australian communities prepare for any increased risk of fire which may result from climate change, found that nationally the combined frequencies of days with very high and extreme Forest Fire Danger Index ratings were likely to increase by 15 to 70 per cent by 2050.</p><p>Going back to the good news, while last year was Australia's hottest on record, 2007 is likely to rate about 10th on the list. Any return to normal rainfall will be welcome in the national capital, which experienced its hottest spring on record and its second-lowest total rainfall.</p><p>Last year was a doubly unlucky one for Australia, Clem Davis, from Canberra's Bureau of Meteorology, said. \"But last year's El Nino was quite late and quite mild,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think Australia was impacted by the fact that we had cool waters over the Indian Ocean as well as El Nino, so it was a double-whammy effect.</p><p>Australia is put in a higher pressure situation in El Nino, and when it breaks down you get normal weather patterns in late summer and autumn.</p><p>\"El Nino usually breaks down in autumn. This usually means moisture being dragged down from the tropics and a return to a more normal rainfall situation. So on that basis you'd anticipate a return to a more normal rainfall in autumn.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-7863469</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4MPM-J1V0-TX4S-M2RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"416\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"01\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>January 1, 2007 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001154</classCode><className>MODELING &amp; SIMULATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001154</classCode><className>MODELING &amp; SIMULATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000A2L7</classCode><className>INDIAN OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Authorities said the 2400ha blaze looked like arson, and critics asked why promised federal airplanes to bomb the fire with water did not arrive until yesterday. Bulldozers were used to create a dirt ring around the perimeter of the 8km by 2.5km fire zone. Nonetheless, officials baulked at declaring the fire contained because of the slight chance that it could flare up again without warning in the midst of million-dollar real estate. The area has not had rain in 19 days. About 40 firefighters had an assortment of minor injuries. However, the blaze, feeding on tinder-dry pines and oaks 110km east of New York City, destroyed one home and a timber yard, damaged seven other homes and a train station, and shut down railways and roads. Soon after noon yesterday, 400 evacuated Westhampton residents went home. Some spent two nights sleeping in high school gyms or their cars. Joseph Monteith, Suffolk County Police chief, said arson was suspected in the blaze that started on Thursday. Two other fires were reported that night along Long Island's south shore, and a police task force was investigating if they were linked to the larger blaze. The fire won't be officially declared under control for at least three or four days. The area will be surveyed with an airborne infrared detector to ensure that every hot spot and ember is extinguished. Associated Press   REST at last . . . firefighters in Suffolk County, New York State, take a breather after fighting forest fires which raged through their area since Thursday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-NEWSMMGLSTRY000131946289</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML1995</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F7D-FNP3-RV30-R3RN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"295\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1995 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>2 - FIRST WITH THE NEWS</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>August 28, 1995 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000172</classCode><className>BEACHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N721110MM</classCode><className>RESORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N488210MM</classCode><className>RAIL STATIONS &amp; TERMINALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009MYF</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC SENSORS &amp; DETECTORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

There is the unpleasant fact that creatures eat each other to survive, not to mention reproduction. \"What are they doing mummy?\" asks the unsuspecting toddler. The answers are sometimes complicated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A bigger problem is the commitment to truth. With a movie that has the name BBC Earth stamped on it, there is a duty to scientific accuracy, and that runs headlong into a duty to make a buck. In Walking with Dinosaurs, making a buck wins.</p><p>Starting from the basis of a successful documentary series made in 1999, the feature film has been shaped and reshaped to make it more appealing for North American kids. In a sense, that is fair enough, because the story takes place in North America, albeit 70 million years ago, when dinosaurs ruled the Earth. Except that they didn't: no one and no thing ruled Earth, but let's not get into that.</p><p>The story follows a small pachyrhinosaurus named Patchi (voiced by Justin Long) who has to survive the loss of some of his family, a scary migration across the Alaskan wilderness, and big adventures such as falling in love with another cute pachyrhinosaurus called Juniper (Tiya Sircar). Patchi's constant companion is a talkative prehistoric bird called Alex, who speaks with a Mexican accent (John Leguizamo). That's also fair, because the species Alexornis was first discovered in Baja, Mexico.</p><p>Each species of dinosaur is introduced formally, with a freeze frame, a scientific name, and a description of its eating habits. The pachyrhinosaurus is a herbivore, but Patchi is grabbed as a baby by a Troodon, an omnivore with sharp teeth, who puts a hole in the bony frill at the top of his skull. Patchi is thus instantly recognisable in his herd, because he has a hole that makes a noise when the wind whistles through it (and yes, I'm sure some of the double entendres in the film are intentional).</p><p>The backgrounds were filmed in Alaska and New Zealand, to get settings that looked like Earth of 70 million years ago. Many of these are stunning, as is the dinosaur animation. But even with a great deal of scientific accuracy behind it, the film becomes cloyingly anthropomorphic.</p><p>The dinosaurs have feelings, they talk in modern American parlance and their family dynamics are just like ours (i.e. American, nuclear). Yes, of course it makes the dinosaurs more appealing to children, and yes, there is a century-old tradition of anthropomorphism in films for children, but doing it the old way isn't the only way, or always the best way. What's frustrating is that the film set out to be much better than it is.</p><p>It was originally going to be a silent film, without dialogue or narration. The dinosaurs didn't make wisecracks and the storytelling was to be entirely visual, with a strong musical score. Somewhere along the line, that changed. The dinosaurs didn't just start to talk, they got names, and the script (credited to the experienced John Collee) was stretched over \"the hero's journey\", like so many others. The designers, albeit with a team of palaeontologists watching, were told to make the dinosaurs cuter, with bigger eyes and more kid-friendly features.</p><p>I'm not sure who drove this process. Apart from BBC Earth, the partners in the film include Reliance Entertainment, an Indian conglomerate with vast wealth behind it, and Animal Logic, the Australian effects and animation house. The co-directors are Barry Cook, an experienced American animator (co-director of Mulan) and Neil Nightingale, the head of BBC Earth, the new marketing name for the BBC's natural history brand. Nightingale is a former head of the natural history unit, with a first-class degree from Oxford in zoology. We may assume that Cook took charge of the animation side, and Nightingale tried to keep it real, with educational value, and yet profitable.</p><p>The educational value is compromised. Children with an interest in dinosaurs will get some superb, thrilling sequences that are close to what we know about certain species. The younger viewers will think dinosaurs could talk, and that they were cute and playful and warm-blooded. They will also find some of the episodes quite scary, as when a forest fire almost engulfs Patchi. The narration warns us when things are heading in that direction, which is reassuring.</p><p>For its grandeur, the film deserves praise. It has great sweep, made more powerful by the addition of 3D. For its lack of nerve, its unwillingness to be the film it set out to be, and for underestimating the intelligence of modern children, it deserves less praise.Twitter: @ptbyrnes</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Meet cute: The tale's hero, Patchi (voiced by Justin Long), meets feathered friend Alex (John Leguizamo).</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-6dduov1xoq017kyxenzm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5B6H-2N41-JD34-V06W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"795\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"01\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>January 4, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5QC</classCode><className>MOVIE RATINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001177</classCode><className>MOVIE REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL67</classCode><className>PREHISTORIC LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UZ0</classCode><className>ANIMATED FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009V32</classCode><className>ANIMATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

Mr Mortenson was arrested after police found a string of outstanding warrants for drug and weapons charges.</p><p>Mendocino County District Attorney Norman Vroman said he was also considering laying murder charges against Mr Mortenson. If convicted, the men would face 15 years in jail.</p><p> \"We will prosecute everybody involved as much as I can prosecute them for as many things as I can charge them with,\" Mr Vroman said.</p><p> Evidence of a methamphetamine production lab was discovered near where the forest fire began, Mr Vroman added.</p><p> Larry Groff, 55, and Lars Stratte, 45, died hours after the blaze began on Tuesday, Australian time, after their 1950s-era Grumman tankers collided in mid-air.</p><p> Investigators believe they did not see each other because of thick smoke and that their aircraft clipped during a pass over.</p><p> Both were experienced pilots who had worked in firefighting for a number of years.</p><p> Dry, extremely hot weather throughout the US for the past week has created conditions conducive to bushfires. A number have broken out in California, including a 728ha fire that came within metres of expensive homes in the hills just north of Los Angeles.</p><p> Police are investigating whether that fire was deliberately lit. Another fire, which threatened hundreds of homes in the western suburbs of Los Angeles at the weekend, was started by children playing with matches.</p><p> In Montana, park rangers have closed large parts of Glacier National Park as firefighters fight to contain a 7288ha bushfire, started by lightning strikes.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0108301009950967</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44J4-59M0-015G-P1N2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"349\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"08\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>August 30, 2001, Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>POLICE FOUNDATION \u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>\u00a0POLICE FOUNDATION\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>STX001182</classCode><className>MURDER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N922130TM</classCode><className>PUBLIC PROSECUTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000535</classCode><className>CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES CRIME</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp;

As a senior executive at global communications giant, MCI WorldCom, he has retained a very active position in developing the technical architecture to support global e-commerce.</p><p>In the face of vast numbers of struggling and dying Internet businesses, Dr Cerf defends the technology against poor business practices.</p><p>\"The `dot bomb' situation is far from a commercial collapse of the Internet,\" he said.</p><p>\"Rather, it is proof that 20th century business principles are still relevant. You should make more money than you spend to keep your business in operation.\"</p><p>\"I think the dose of reality therapy for the Internet market is a good thing, rather like a forest fire that we now know is healthy,\" he said.</p><p>\"It means that capital will go to companies with good business models, not just `something related to the Internet'. That's good news for people with good business ideas.\"</p><p>In Melbourne this week to attend the quarterly board meeting of the international body, the Internet Corporation for Assigning Names and Numbers (ICANN), Dr Cerf highlighted the \"very hard\" technical problems inherent in the current push to de-Americanise the Internet by adding support for non-roman alphabets.</p><p>\"Some people speak about internationalisation issues as if it were simply a matter of policy, or simply a matter of becoming more culturally aware,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is a terrible oversimplification.</p><p>\"There are serious problems almost everywhere you look. Some of them really interfere with interoperability on the Internet and that is the single most important value of the existing Internet standards.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illus: Dr Cerf</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yi56oqe3nc196ng39cg</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8B-H1Y0-TXN5-R1C3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"353\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2001 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"03\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>March 16, 2001 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0001XGP</classCode><className>VERIZON COMMUNICATIONS INC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009NKR</classCode><className>INTERNET CORP FOR ASSIGNED NAMES &amp; NUMBERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS517210 WIRELESS TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS (EXCEPT SATELLITE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS517110 WIRED TELECOMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>VZC (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>VZ (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>People/Name/Cerf/Winton/Bussinessman</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Technology/Computers/Networks/Internet</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001928</classCode><className>COMPANY ACTIVITIES &amp; MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QD4</classCode><className>NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CT</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS &amp; BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DT12</classCode><className>TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000954</classCode><className>INTERNET &amp; WWW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000354</classCode><className>COMPUTER NETWORKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000571</classCode><className>ELECTRONIC COMMERCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DFIR</classCode><className>VINTON CERF</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

My personal gut feel is that could be an underestimate.</p><p>Fortunately, most fires are discovered early and are put out, giving the owners/operators a minor heart attack at the time.</p><p>Just about all of us have smelt something and found a patch of charred chaff around a dead bearing at some time in our life.</p><p>My dad used to tell us boys to walk around the header at every box unloading to the mother bin, but if you're on the go unloading with chaser bins, you have to be more disciplined.</p><p>The GRDC has recently produced a handy back pocket guide Reducing Harvest Fire Risk by agricultural engineer Dr Graeme Quick.</p><p>It has 10 key points to consider:</p><p>Recognise the big four factors that contribute to fires: relative humidity, ambient temperature, wind and crop type and conditions. Stop harvest when the danger is extreme.</p><p>Focus on service, maintenance and machine hygiene at harvest on the days more hazardous for fire. Follow systematic preparation and prevention procedures.</p><p>Use every means possible to avoid the accumulation of flammable material on the manifold, turbocharger or the exhaust system.</p><p>Be aware of side and tail winds that can disrupt the radiator fan air blast that normally keeps the exhaust area clean.</p><p>Be on the lookout for places where chafing can occur such as fuel lines, battery cables, hot wires, tyres, drive belts etc.</p><p>Avoid overloading electrical circuits. Don't replace a blown fuse with a higher amperage one. It is your only protection against wiring damage from shorts and overloading.</p><p>Periodically check bearings around the front and the machine body. Use a hand-held digital heat-measuring gun for temperature diagnostics on bearings, brakes etc.</p><p>Drag chains, or better still drag cables or grounding conductors, may help dissipate electrical charge (or static), but are not universally successful in all conditions. There are some invaluable fire-suppressing options on the market.</p><p>Use the battery isolation switch when the harvester is parked. Use vermin deterrents in the cab and elsewhere, as vermin chew some types of electrical insulation.</p><p>Observe the Grassland Fire Danger Index (GFDI) protocol on high fire risk days. Maintain two-way or mobile phone contact with base and others. Keep an eye out for hazards on machinery during the season.</p><p>The SA Country fire Service (CFS) and WA Department of Fire and Emergency Services (DFES) have rules in place for harvest ceasing when your local GFDI exceeds 35 (in the Very High fire danger category).</p><p>The GFDI is calculated using the dryness of the fuel, the fuel load, the temperature, the relative humidity and the wind speed. When harvesting, wind speed is the factor that can make a small fire into a big one.</p><p>Slightly different methodology is used to calculate the Forest Fire Danger Index for treed areas that includes an estimate of soil moisture.</p><p>They believe that when a fire occurs in these conditions it will get away with what most farmers have on hand to control it. If you are from the other states the figure of 35 is still a good standard to work by.</p><p>Such conditions could occur when a 2t/ha wheat crop is completely dry, the temperature is 40 degrees Celsius, relative humidity is dry at eight per cent and the wind is going at 30km/h, but many other combinations are possible.</p><p>In Victoria, the daily ratings are posted by the CFA and BoM: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.cfa.vic.gov.au/warnings-restrictions/total-fire-bans-andratings/\">www.cfa.vic.gov.au/warnings-restrictions/total-fire-bans-andratings/</url>       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/bushfire.shtml\">www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/bushfire.shtml</url></p><p>The BoM displays prediction maps of the maximum GFDI for the current day: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/fire-map.shtml\">www.bom.gov.au/vic/forecasts/fire-map.shtml</url></p><p>It's up to you to work out the actual location GFDI and for that you need a calculator and a data source. Those hand held meters for spray conditions fit the bill nicely and at a pinch your local automatic weather station.</p><p>Use the Macarthur Grass Fire Danger Index Mk 5 on web or in an app, (warning the FFDI is unreliable in this app).</p><p>It's much easier to sight a black header than a black panther over summer, limit the chances of yours becoming a metal merchant's delight.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARARAT-6cuqe67oh1gnxerwb3h</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARARAT2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:59X7-FYD1-JD34-V1D1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386050</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Ararat Advertiser &amp; Stawell Time</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"11\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>November 26, 2013 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F8T</classCode><className>CROP RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001475</classCode><className>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009F8T</classCode><className>CROP RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000622</classCode><className>ENGINEERING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST000A0Z7</classCode><className>MOBILE &amp; CELLULAR TELEPHONES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But Toni Childs has been on quite a journey.</p><p>In the early 1990s, the US singer had the world at her feet. Her debut album, Union, (1988) was an international hit, spawning such memorable songs as Stop Your Fussin' and Don't Walk Away. I've Got To Go Now from her second album, House of Hope, was a No. 5 in Australia.</p><p>Her powerful voice and soulful tunes cut to the heart of the public and in 1988 she was nominated for two Grammy awards. Although she didn't win, she delivered a memorable performance.</p><p>While working on a fourth album, Childs plunged herself into charity work, starting the Dream a Dolphin cause for sick kids.</p><p>It was then she discovered that she, too, was sick. She had a disease she had never heard of - Grave's Disease - a thyroid condition brought on from stress.</p><p>She went to a doctor who told her her resting pulse rate was 120 beats per minute and immediately put her on heart inhibitors. ``It was a shock because the doctors said I had to dismantle my life,'' Childs says. She put the brakes on work and focused on getting well. She describes the experience as a forest fire. ``It takes everything down,'' she says. ``And then all your bits start coming back together and it's wonderful.</p><p>``It gives you this amazing appreciation for life and the privilege of getting to do what you really love.''</p><p>What she really loves is music - and Childs finally has a new album due out. It's titled, aptly, Keep the Faith.</p><p>It was a serendipitous meeting that led her back to the recording studio. Childs was performing in a local production of the Vagina Monologues and it just so happened that Eve Ensler, the creator of that play, was in the audience. She sought Childs out after the show.</p><p>What came next was a deep bonding experience for both women. Ensler told her that her record, Union, had had a profound impact on her life.</p><p>When Ensler was down in the dumps and living out of her car, she listened to the record over and over again.</p><p>She took Childs aside and told her she needed to start singing again.</p><p>``She said, `You know what, Toni, you need to be singing. This is your gift. Why aren't you singing?' She really gave me a hard time,'' Childs says.</p><p>``And then she asked me the craziest thing: `OK, I want you to write an anthem that will inspire people to end violence against women and children for all time'.''</p><p>Childs ended up writing the song Because You're Beautiful for Ensler's documentary Until The Violence Stops. The song won an Emmy award.</p><p>Her new mood on life is summed up on the new single, One Life.</p><p>Keep the Faith is out now. Toni Childs plays The Governor Hindmarsh on September 30.

I feel like I'm a phoenix rising. I burned down to an ash and then came through that forest fire healthier and stronger than ever before.</p><p>``This album is a real departure from my other work in that it is a much more basic and rootsy collection of music.''</p><p>``Every song is written on guitar, instead of being driven by drum loops and sequencers like it was when I made my first two records.''</p><p>* FRESH from a successful sell-out tour of India over New Year and having just returned from a fifth tour of New Zealand as well as Thailand and Singapore, The Vegas Legends Show is at Club Banora on Saturday.</p><p>The show features Australia's top cabaret impersonators Kerry James and Daniel Gold. Audiences who have flocked to the two-hour blockbuster show during the past three years have gone home shaking their heads at the remarkable resemblances and vocal likenesses of the many characters portrayed.</p><p>Kerry James' impersonations of Tina Turner, Liza Minnelli, Cher, Dolly Parton, Marilyn Monroe and other Vegas Legends have been described as `just freakish' by British media.</p><p>Kerry has toured Europe, the US, the Middle East and the UK, and has worked alongside some of the biggest names in the business, including The Hollies, Tony Bennett and Jerry Lewis.</p><p>Daniel Gold's penchant for impersonating comedians is amazing. Switching from Austin Powers to Dean Martin to Jerry Lewis to Johnny Cash to Frank Sinatra, and then instantly becoming The King of rock 'n' roll, Elvis Presley, he leaves audiences spellbound with his quick fire repartee and amazing vocals.</p><p>With immaculate costuming, and backed by superbly arranged musical sequences, The Vegas Legends Show is musically brilliant, raucously funny and sometimes a little irreverent.</p><p>l Toni Childs plays Twin Towns at 8.30pm on Saturday. Tickets $45. The Vegas Legends Show, Club Banora, Saturday 8pm. No cover charge.

which they travelled through grassland, experts said yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given the right conditions, grass fires can spread twice as fast as bushfires and some victims may have mistakenly believed they could evade them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Eyre Peninsula fire travelled \"frighteningly fast\", NSW Rural Fire Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg said yesterday.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>It was a different type of blaze to the bushfires generally seen around Sydney, he added.</p><p>Very severe weather conditions, combined with the landscape of dry grassland and scrub, was to blame for Tuesday's devastation.</p><p>\"In general terms, for a given set of weather conditions, a grass fire will spread twice as fast as a forest fire,\" CSIRO senior research scientist Phil Cheney said yesterday.</p><p>\"That's under extreme conditions, with very strong winds upwards of 20km/h.\" Mr Cheney said it was possible the victims did not believe they were in much danger until the very last moments.</p><p>\"One of the difficult things for people in the path of the fire is knowing just where it is and where it's going, and very often they don't appreciate how close it is until it's virtually upon them,\" he said.</p><p>\"The reaction of people in the forest is that they either know intuitively, or have been told, that if they get caught in the forest they don't have a hell of a lot of a chance.</p><p>\"Whereas with a grass fire, there are people who are probably more familiar with the slower spreading ones and the flames don't appear all that dangerous, and when they get these very fast-spreading ones, suddenly it takes them by surprise.\" The extra fuel associated with fires in the bush results in flames travelling more slowly.</p><p>However, out in the open and exposed to dangerously high winds, grass fires can spread great distances in a short time.</p><p>\"It's largely to do with the size of the individual particles, the average size of which are generally larger in the forest,\" Mr Cheney said.</p><p>\"Grass fires are also out in the open and exposed to the full strength of the wind near the ground, and the fires respond accordingly.\" The speed of grassland fires was experienced recently in NSW.</p><p>The Parkes telescope was threatened by a blaze on December 2, with the grass fire coming within a kilometre of the historic landmark.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

But then, it would, wouldn't it?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She accuses Martin Stevenson (In Black and White, January 17) of ``ignoring the bleeding obvious\" and says that she has spoken to ``the esteemed thinkers\" of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She recommends that Mr Stevenson read the IPCC's Fourth Assessment Report Summary, but I don't think that he will; I know that I wouldn't because the masses of figures will prove whatever the IPCC wants them to prove.</p><p>In short, I don't trust the IPCC's figures as far as I can throw them and haven't since the recent talkfest in Copenhagen when all the northern airports froze and the eminent persons were frozen into their luxury hotels.</p><p>Part of the agenda for Copenhagen was to discuss the shock-horror data provided by the University of East Anglia's climate research unit.</p><p>All this data was proved to be fraudulent and figures had been tampered with, going back to 1962.</p><p>Ms O'Connor accuses Mr Stevenson of calling ``the esteemed thinkers nutters, hysterical, cultist or liars\", but that's precisely what the climate research unit provided _ lies.</p><p>She goes on to suggest that Mr Stevenson read the Australian Climate Commission's ``highly regarded work and findings\".</p><p>Again, why bother? Tim Flannery (Australian of the Year 2007) warned in 2008 that Adelaide could run out of water by 2009, and that Perth was going to become a ghost town.</p><p>In northern latitudes, London and New York were going to be flooded to the level of eight- storey buildings.</p><p>Ms O'Connor, as Minister for Climate Change, represents a discredited and impoverished government and the real message must be read between the lines towards the end of her letter when she says that to avoid the worst effect of global warming, we must ``rethink our economic and social policy structures\".</p><p>Translated into English, this means that the government wants to increase taxes again and further cut social services and allowances.</p><p>_ COL HAYWARD, St Helens.</p><p>Flag's meaning</p><p>SO, a Canberra university wonk has designed a new Australian flag for us (The Examiner, January 25).</p><p>No doubt there are many skilled artists, designers and even professors who could put together a nice composite.</p><p>Then there would be the marketing gurus and political scientists who could wear down public support for the current flag with slick TV ads and email campaigns.</p><p>Thanks, but no thanks.</p><p>The Australian flag is not a throw-together of a Union Jack, Southern Cross and Commonwealth star as its critics would have us believe.</p><p>It is our flag. The flag we are all familiar with, which unifies our national solidarity during time of war, triumph and tragedy, is not even an invention of our generation.</p><p>It is in fact our inheritance, created and left for us by our Australian forefathers. We should be thankful for it. These debates, deliberately timed annually around Australia Day, can deliver only division and disagreement.</p><p>I am not unmoved by the voices which say the flag doesn't represent me.</p><p>But my gentle reminder should be our strong agreement: the flag, whatever its colours, symbols and history, is nothing to do with our individual preference, it's about symbolising us as a nation to ourselves and being instantly recognisable abroad.</p><p>This is something the flag has done remarkably well over many decades and in every corner of the globe.</p><p>_ MICHAEL FERGUSON, MHA, Member for Bass.</p><p>Forest fire alarm</p><p>NOW that the fire danger has reduced a little, it is time to look to the future.</p><p>And what a bleak future it is. The Greens and their NGO allies have attempted to tie up 570,000 hectares of native forest with no thought as to how any fires in this area could be fought.</p><p>Now that Gunns has gone (thanks mainly to the Greens), we have less trained people to fight fires and to keep the fire trails open.</p><p>Forestry workers are disappearing at a rate of knots so they cannot help and Parks and Wildlife personnel are being reduced due to the mismanagement of the state budget.</p><p>In fact, will there be any fire trails if the proposed legislation is passed?</p><p>One suspects not.

At that stage, the US Treasury guaranteed a $1.5 billion loan to the car manufacturer, but in return the US government demanded, and received, $2 billion in concessions from unions, the company, and other stakeholders. <br/>But, Taylor notes, central bank activism took a big step forward when <person><nameText>Alan Greenspan </nameText></person>took over as the boss of the US central bank. Greenspan reversed the 1987 stockmarket collapse, he rescued Mexico in 1995, South East Asia in 1997 and then went on to save the global banking system which was at risk after the collapse of the speculative hedge fund Long Term Capital in 1998.<br/>Greenspan, of course, had some failures, notably the Russian default in 1998. But overall, Taylor argues, the perceived Greenspan \"put\" - the idea that the US central bank would slash interest rates and boost liquidity whenever a crisis arose - made investors extremely complacent. \"Buy risk, you were safe, was the only way to go\".<br/>But Taylor points out that Greenspan's efforts to rescue the global banking system after the LTCM collapse now look like child's play. \"The central banks have to pay a lot more for optimism today. Loans aren't enough; now they must give the money away. Printing presses are running flat out... and the developed world monetary base is almost three times higher than it was at the start of 2008.\"<br/>According to Taylor, \"all this money sloshing around is nothing but kindling. This is enough to start one hell of a large inflationary fire, but probably not until we have a deflationary panic first - which will add even more kindling to the pile.\"<br/>Taylor argues that the progression from the first $1.5 billion Chrysler rescue to today's multi-trillion dollar efforts by central banks in the US, the United Kingdom, Europe and Japan to support financial markets is similar to efforts to suppress forest fires.<br/>Although fire-fighters are able to limit small fires, they now know that the longer they suppress them, the greater the chances of a highly disastrous, totally uncontrollable, conflagration.<br/>When that catastrophe will occur is unpredictable but \"by suppressing small fires, the forests approach an unstable state where the dead wood, resulting from the natural cycle of birth and death in the wild, is piled high, ready to explode into flames if the conditions are right.\"<br/>Taylor argues that central banks in the developed world are following exactly the same approach. \"The central banks and other governmental authorities have piled the money so high that bubbles are popping up everywhere.\"<br/>Inflation may not have hit food prices yet, but Taylor argues that it is certainly hitting other asset prices, which is impoverishing those who do not own these inflating assets.<br/>He also points out that this strategy of inflating asset prices is highly risky. \"As those assets are in a bubble, a sharp reversal in price could appear at any time, just like the fire might begin in the forest. With so many bubbles and so much kindling, volatility in price is a sure thing.\"<br/>It's impossible to accurately predict the timing of these dramatic breakdowns - whether it's a forest fire, an earthquake or a market crash. It's also extremely difficult to contain the damage they wreak.<br/>Taylor notes that fire fighters have now worked out that the best way to control conflagrations is before they start. But, he pleads, \"please tell Bernanke!\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSSPE-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSSPE2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5532-BKP1-JD6R-T14Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388514</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-07-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"669\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Business Spectator</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50627\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"03\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>March 2, 2012 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000591</classCode><className>EMERGING MARKETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000913</classCode><className>INFLATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000157</classCode><className>BAILOUTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008XVV</classCode><className>FINANCIAL MARKETS &amp;

In one story Mr Malik's admirers used to tell - not one found in illustrated children's books - the mousedeer evades a tiger by running into a hollow log. The tiger gets its head trapped, whereupon the kancil exits the other end of the log and mounts the tiger from behind. Indonesians enjoy a ribald animal yarn as much as anyone.</p><p>But what to make of the recent dog-mounts-dog cartoons published in two newspapers? First, the Indonesian popular tabloid Rakyat Merdeka shows <person><nameText>John Howard </nameText></person>and Alexander Downer as humping dingoes, somehow related to an alleged Australian wish to take over Papua. Then The Weekend Australian, a newspaper published by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation, responds with a cartoon showing the Indonesian President, Bambang <person><nameText>Susilo Yudhoyono, </nameText></person>in formal black headcap, as a dog mounting a four-legged Papuan with a bone in his nose. \"No offence intended\" was the caption.</p><p>Actually, the cartoon could hardly be calculated to offend more. The Rakyat Merdeka drawing was not particularly funny or on-target, aside from being tasteless, so was easy for its targets to shrug off. The Murdoch newspaper's cartoon is consciously more offensive, since the dog is regarded as a particularly unclean animal by Indonesia's Muslims. It is hard to think of any other world leader being depicted the same way as the cartoon did Mr Yudhoyono. Indeed, by sharp contrast, the same newspaper had just set what may be record levels of sycophancy in its coverage of visits by Condoleezza Rice, Tony Blair and Wen Jiabao. When another of its cartoonists depicted the former president Soeharto as an orang-utang swinging nonchalantly through the jungles, during the 1997 forest-fire haze and economic crisis, its editors were soon on a plane to grovel in Jakarta. See-sawing between adulation and reckless offence hardly reflects well on editorial judgement. Sentiment in the Muslim world is inflamed enough. It's a time to do what you do with rutting dogs: bring out the hose.</p><p>Meanwhile, the failings of Indonesia's rule in Papua are apparent enough. They go back many years before Mr Yudhoyono became President, and he seems willing to break with the past as he did in Aceh. Though not happy about the cartoon, he seems willing to let it pass and is damping down any movement among his officials to react on his behalf. As Adam Malik used to say: the dogs may bark, the caravan moves on.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-58zq0a6wq2895rn3ba7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P6W-5290-TXN5-R203-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"432\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>April 4, 2006 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><classCode>CC00025NP</classCode><className>TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY FOX INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS515120 TELEVISION BROADCASTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511130 BOOK PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"83\"><className>FOX (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Indonesia</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Media/Newspapers</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Politics/Foreign Relations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>People/Name/Howard/John/Politician</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>People/Name/Downer/Alexander/Politician</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>People/Name/Yudhoyono/Susilo Bambang/SBY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Culture/Literature/Comics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp;

And, as was demonstrated by the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34181475\">killing of two British jihadis</url> in Syria recently, these unmanned aerial vehicles are increasingly deployed by the West as frontline weapons of war.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Drones are set to become a defining feature of this century. Thousands are already in operation in most developed countries worldwide - and that is likely to grow to hundreds of thousands as drones of different shapes and sizes are deployed by the media, emergency services, scientists, farmers, sports enthusiasts, hobbyists, photographers, the armed forces and government agencies.</p><p>Eventually commercial uses will dwarf all others. Amazon promises to deliver purchases within 30 minutes via delivery drones. Domino's Pizza has staged hot pizza drone delivery. More than <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.auvsi.org/blogs/auvsi-membership/2015/07/31/section333report2\">20 industries are approved to fly commercial drones</url> in the US alone, and developing countries are following suit.</p><p>The question is, is this boom in drones moving faster than the law? How to fit such a proliferation of drones into the current regulations? The answers will need to be written into national and international laws quickly in order to govern an increasingly busy airspace. Many existing laws may need to be tweaked, including those governing cyber-security, stalking, privacy and human rights legislation, insurance, contract and commercial law, even the laws of war.</p><p>There have after all been numerous suspect or dangerous uses of drones already. For example, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20150129-france-civilian-drone-legislation-lessons-usa-obama\">illegal flights over seven nuclear plants across France</url>, disruption to       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://edition.cnn.com/2015/07/18/us/california-freeway-fire/\">US forest fire-fighting</url>, and seven       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/dec/07/drone-near-miss-passenger-plane-heathrow\">near-misses at airports in the UK</url>. In the US several landowners have       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2015-07/31/american-shoots-drone-in-garden\">shot them down</url>, leading to court cases that pit claims of trespass and the right to privacy against criminal damage.</p><p>Piecemeal legal changes not enough</p><p>French legislators responded swiftly with a police order to the first balloon flights by the Montgolfier Brothers in 1784 by <url normalizedValue=\"http://lup.lub.lu.se/luur/download?func=downloadFile&amp;recordOId=1557232&amp;fileOId=1564253\">prohibiting all flights over Paris</url> without prior authorisation. In the same way sovereign states ought to define precisely how and when they will permit drone flights over their territory. So far legal development to govern drone use has been very piecemeal; most countries have done nothing yet.</p><p>Again, it was France that was first to introduce dedicated legislation governing drones through a decree in 2012 bringing drones within its civil aviation regulations. Drones are allowed to fly between 50-150 metres from the ground and there are penalties up to five years in prison and fines of 75,000 euros for <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.france24.com/en/20150129-france-civilian-drone-legislation-lessons-usa-obama\">unlawful use of a drone</url>.</p><p>Also in 2012, the US congress passed the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-112hrpt381/pdf/CRPT-112hrpt381.pdf\">Modernisation and Reform Act</url> which required the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://harvardnsj.org/2015/02/drones-in-the-u-s-national-airspace-system-a-safety-and-security-assessment/\">integration of civil drones into national airspace</url> by the end of September 2015.</p><p>The Italian Civil Aviation Authority issued <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.enac.gov.it/repository/ContentManagement/information/N122671512/Regolamento_APR_ed.1.pdf\">commercial drone regulations</url> in April 2014. The law vaguely requires the operators to comply with data-protection laws and hold insurance. In the meantime, controversial Italian surveillance firm Hacking Team is already developing drones capable of       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.startupsmart.com.au/https://www.rt.com/news/310493-wifi-hacking-spy-drones\">delivering spyware to computers and smartphones</url>, infecting them via Wi-Fi.</p><p>However, the UK has struggled with fitting drones into its legal framework as neither the Civil Aviation Act nor the Air Navigation Order provide a good fit. The Department for Transport recently announced plans to introduce <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/technology/article4546793.ece\">fines of up to \u00a32,500 for flying drones in built-up areas</url>. Some clarity is provided by the CAA's       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.startupsmart.com.au/https://www.caa.co.uk/application.aspx?catid=33&amp;pagetype=65&amp;appid=11&amp;mode=detail&amp;id=415\">Unmanned Aircraft System Operations in UK Airspace Guidance</url>, which requires drone pilots to maintain direct line of sight with drones and limits their altitude to a maximum 120 metres. Small drones must avoid and give way to manned aircraft at all times.</p><p>   Delivery by drone is already a happening in Switzerland. Jean-Christophe Bott/EPA  </p><p>Flying in the face of the law</p><p>The International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) plans to introduce policies to regulate civilian drone flight by 2028 worldwide. The EU and US have signed a formal agreement to cooperate on integrating drones into civil air traffic management. But consensus is notoriously difficult in international regulation - it could take decades to achieve a global agreement.</p><p>The last international civil air treaty of note is the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.icao.int/publications/pages/doc7300.aspx\">1944 Chicago convention</url>. This impressive treaty created the standards for the       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.startupsmart.com.au/https://www.routledge.com/products/9780415562126\">common use of airspace between nations</url>. For example, that every nation has sovereignty over its airspace and that no aircraft operated by the state (such as military or police) will fly over other states without authorisation. It also required nations air regulations to be obeyed and required aircraft to be registered and display their registration marks.</p><p>For drones, however, it's not clear what types and sizes of drones are required to be registered and display their nationality. There are drones the size of small birds or even coins that can fly across national borders in near-invisibility, upsetting these egalitarian rules. It's vital these issues are comprehensively dealt with quickly in a new treaty, in the same spirit of egalitarianism as at Chicago in 1944.</p><p>Dronefare versus Lawfare</p><p>For many, drones are typified by their use for military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq. The US is reported to have up to <url normalizedValue=\"http://nation.time.com/2011/06/26/the-new-u-s-smalls-air-force-over-afghanistan/\">7,000 drones in Afghanistan</url>, with the main source of funding for developing modern drone technology coming from the military.</p><p>Successive US governments' policies of conducting drone assassinations will perhaps go down as one of the most egregious use of air power in human history, with thousands of lives lost in an <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14650045.2012.749241?src=recsys\">amorphous conflict</url> against vaguely-defined al-Qaeda and ISIS \"affiliates\". The only legitimisation in most cases appears to be White House's early morning bureaucratic meetings.</p><p>The American Civil Liberties Union has correctly addressed this, stating: \"The <url normalizedValue=\"http://dronewars.net/drones-and-targeted-killing\">targeted killing program</url> itself is not just unlawful but dangerous ... it is dangerous to characterise the entire planet as a battlefield.\" A recent RAF strike was the first targeted       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-34181475\">UK drone attack</url> on a British citizen. However, UK armed Reaper drones have accounted for       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.startupsmart.com.au/\">up to a third of the 100 airstrikes</url>) in Iraq alone as at January 2015.</p><p>Lethal drone technology is going to be available to nearly all countries in a very short time. The possibility that even a few dozen states might follow the path beaten by the US is really a scary proposition - as what goes around may fly around.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.com/profiles/gbenga-oduntan-109813\">Gbenga Oduntan</url>, Senior Lecturer in International Commercial Law, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.com/institutions/university-of-kent\">University of Kent</url></emphasis></p><p>This article was originally published on <url normalizedValue=\"http://theconversation.com\">The Conversation</url>.

It will come as no surprise if Flight Behaviour receives comparable notice.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Though it may, within Kingsolver's home country, the US, prove socially divisive. If Richard Heinberg, the author of Power Down and a recent visitor to Sydney for the Festival of Dangerous Ideas is to be believed, \"Republican candidates think climate change is a hoax\", then Kingsolver's novel will not appeal to about 50 per cent of Americans. For Flight Behaviour is not only a novel with climate change at the heart of its drama, but also a novel of which the drama of climate change is close to its author's proselytising heart. Americans have given the world proselytising novelists since Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin caught Abraham Lincoln's eye.</p><p>Australia, a nation not without its climate sceptics, rates a mention from Kingsolver's scientist, Dr Ovid Byron. \"Deserts on fire. In New Mexico we are seeing the inferno. Texas is worse. Australia is unimaginably worse, a lot of the continent is in permanent drought.\" The novel's marvellously misnamed heroine, Dellarobia Turnbow, who dropped out of college when pregnant at 17, thinks of her husband as she well might of certain Australian politicians: \"She balked, knowing his wariness of people who wanted to save trees for trees' sake. An easy want, when they weren't your trees, or your foreclosure.\"</p><p>Flight Behaviour is set in rural Tennessee, among the more-or-less dirt poor, though they are soon mud poor due to an extended period of unseasonal rain. They may be socially and educationally deprived, but they have home computers and YouTube, which are very useful for the novel's resolution. It is as if the Bundren family from Faulkner's As I Lay Dying (1930) travelled against all odds, including flood, to get to Jefferson so that Vardaman could have a personal computer.</p><p>A reader might be excused for thinking, at the novel's inception, that she had stumbled into a work of magical realism, sort of Gabriel Garcia Marquez gone north to the Appalachians. Dellarobia, having turned her back on the family shack and gone up the hill to pursue an illicit carnal encounter, is overwhelmed to perceive, or rather to misinterpret, what she takes to be a forest fire, but which is in fact millions of Monarch butterflies glowing \"like a lake of fire\". Climate change has caused their migration pattern to be thrown out of kilter.</p><p>After the butterflies come the scientists, led Dr Byron, who points out that the butterflies have been driven by pollution from their customary Mexican winter grounds and now face extinction due to northern hemisphere temperatures. No less threatening is the fact that Dellarobia's father-in-law, Bear, has sold their land to loggers.</p><p>As Feathertown, Tennessee, near which the Turnbows live, is in Bible-belt territory, the butterfly manifestation is dubbed by some locals a \"miracle\", a miracle that they are prepared to exploit under the banner of tourism. All these threads make Flight Behaviour an often hilarious novel, less sober but no less serious than it might have been had it been merely social-consciousness tract.</p><p>For all that, Flight Behaviour is concerned with the universal catastrophe of climate change; it is also concerned, essentially, with the local, where, as local paediatrician William Carlos Williams observed, \"all things reside\". Kingsolver accesses the local through a family and its friends. Isn't that what the novel, from Mansfield Park to The Corrections has always done, and done better than any non-fiction study?</p><p>While Byron may be the book's \"mind\" (\"We are seeing a bizarre alteration of a previously stable pattern. A continental ecosystem breaking down ... Climate change has disrupted this system.\") Dellarobia is its conscience (\"Maybe her father was lucky to die young with his pride of craftsmanship intact ... Realistically it probably wasn't slave children, but there had to be armies of factory workers making this slapdash stuff ... A worldwide entrapment of bottom feeders.\")</p><p>It is to Kingsolver's credit that she declines to bring mind and conscience together in any easy amatory connection, though she does appear to have been tempted. Her conclusion is far more dramatic, far more satisfying.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-67l8wh89z5k10iuvz81w</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:573Y-5C81-F0J6-J242-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"763\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>November 24, 2012 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

Though it may prove, within Kingsolver's own country (the US), socially divisive. If Richard Heinberg, author of Powerdown and a recent visitor to Australia for Sydney's Festival of Dangerous Ideas, is to be believed and \"Republican candidates think climate change is a hoax\", then the novel will not appeal to about 50 per cent of Americans.</p><p>For Flight Behaviour is not only a novel with climate change at the heart of its drama, but also a novel of which the drama of climate change is close to its author's proselytising heart. Americans have given the world distinguished proselytising novelists ever since Harriet Beecher Stowe's Uncle Tom's Cabin caught President Abraham Lincoln's eye.</p><p>Australia, a nation not without its climate sceptics, rates a mention from Kingsolver's scientist Dr Ovid Byron: \"Deserts on fire. In New Mexico we are seeing the inferno. Texas is worse. Australia is unimaginably worse, a lot of the continent is in permanent drought.\"</p><p>The novel's marvellously misnamed heroine, Dellarobia Turnbow, who dropped out of college when pregnant at 17, thinks of her husband as she well might of certain Australian politicians: \"She balked, knowing his wariness of people who wanted to save trees for trees' sake. An easy want, when they weren't your trees, or your foreclosure.\"</p><p>Flight Behaviour is set in rural Tennessee, among the more-or-less dirt-poor, though they are soon mud-poor, due to an extended period of unseasonal rain. They may be socially and educationally deprived, but they have home computers and YouTube, which are very useful for the novel's resolution.</p><p>It is as if the Bundren family from Faulkner's As I Lay Dying (1930) travelled against all odds, including flood, to get to Jefferson so that Vardaman could have a personal computer.</p><p>A reader might be excused for thinking, at the novel's inception, that she had stumbled into a work of magical realism, sort-of Gabriel Garcia Marquez gone north to the Appalachians. Dellarobia, having turned her back on the family shack and gone up the hill to pursue an illicit carnal encounter, is overwhelmed to perceive, or rather to \"misperceive\", what she takes to be a forest fire but which is millions of monarch butterflies glowing \"like a lake of fire\". Climate change has caused their migration pattern to be thrown out of kilter.</p><p>After the butterflies come the scientists, led by Byron, who points out that the butterflies have been driven by pollution from their customary Mexican winter grounds and now face extinction due to northern hemisphere temperatures. No less threatening is the fact Dellarobia's father-in-law, Bear, has sold their land to loggers.</p><p>As the Turnbows live in Bible-belt territory, the butterfly manifestation is dubbed by some locals, Bear's wife included, a \"miracle\", a miracle they are prepared to exploit under the banner of tourism. All these threads make Flight Behaviour an often hilarious novel, a less sober but no less serious text than it might have been had it been merely social-consciousness tract.</p><p>For all that Flight Behaviour is concerned with the universal catastrophe of climate change, it is also concerned essentially with the local, where, as local paediatrician William Carlos Williams observed, \"all things reside\". Kingsolver accesses the local through a family and its friends. Isn't that what the novel, from Mansfield Park to The Corrections, has always done, and done better than any non-fictional study?</p><p>While Ovid Byron might be the book's \"mind\" (\"We are seeing a bizarre alteration of a previously stable pattern. A continental ecosystem breaking down . . . Climate change has disrupted this system\"), Dellarobia is its conscience (\"Maybe her father was lucky to die young with his pride of craftsmanship intact . . . Realistically it probably wasn't slave children, but there had to be armies of factory workers making this slap-dash stuff . . . A worldwide entrapment of bottom feeders\").</p><p>It is to Kingsolver's credit that she declines to bring mind and conscience together in any easy amatory connection. Her conclusion is far more dramatic, far more satisfying.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-67l6l1jem281naldl81w</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:573Y-1DS1-JD34-V3V9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"11\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>November 24, 2012 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

He strongly urged others to have their say in written submissions.</p><p>In his opening address, Mr Rush said the forest fire danger index had predicted February 7 would be the worst fire danger day ever in Victoria.</p><p>A figure of 50 was considered ``extreme'', but on Black Saturday it ranged between 120 and 180. In such catastrophic conditions normal warnings became useless.</p><p>``The risk that the index indicated carried with it the potential of a fire that could not be fought,'' he said.</p><p>Mr Rush said the first issues considered would be the warnings and the ``stay or go early'' policy.</p><p>An expert will give evidence to the commission that people have no knowledge of the triggers of when to leave early and when it is too late to leave.</p><p>Mr Rush said on Black Saturday Victoria recorded its highest temperatures since records began in 1859, soaring into the high 40s and with winds over 100km/h.</p><p>He said the primary concern of the commission would be to make recommendations that saved lives. The commission will hand down an interim report by August 17 and a final report by July 31 next year.</p><p>Editorial, Page 22</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-DHS-20090421-1-001-418511</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERALDSUN2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VH0-HJX1-2RYX-10Y6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"557\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 21, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000168</classCode><className>BARRISTERS &amp; SOLICITORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001849</classCode><className>WITNESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000168</classCode><className>BARRISTERS &amp; SOLICITORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N221100CC</classCode><className>ELECTRIC POWER INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N541110GM</classCode><className>LAWYERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

But it has foolishly chosen its path, and must now live with the consequences.</p><p>Reliance on transaction taxes (stamp duties, etc) was always poor policy. Those of us who attempted to sound the warning were ignored, and will now have to pay the price of government folly. That will be reduced services and a lesser future.</p><p>At the federal level, the GST was touted as the great growth tax -- the teat for the states to suckle. Doesn't that seem absurd now? It always was, of course. It is obvious that any tax on transactions will lead to less transactions -- just when we need more of them.</p><p>The option ignored by all levels of government has been a flat tax on land values. It would encourage and reward enterprise, satisfy social equity issues, and would continue to fund all public services.</p><p>Most importantly, it would dampen the cause of property booms, and thus avoid the busts.</p><p>Most economists agree that a tax on land is the least distorting tax. So why hasn't it been introduced? For a clue, check out the donors to the major political parties.</p><p>Leo Foley, Secretary, Prosper Australia</p><p>The rich are the wrong target</p><p>It seems both the Federal and State Labor governments are playing the game of politics of envy by targeting the well-off under budgetary changes.</p><p>It is good to target people earning big salaries or incomes, for the opinion polls. And having a federal government dominated by former union officials, you cannot expect much else. But these policies can have a very negative result on two fronts. The first is that those who have the income now are the ones who are keeping our service industries going through their ability to spend. Reduce that and you risk jobs.</p><p>The second is that it takes away the incentive for people to get ahead because they know the government will penalise them for their effort.</p><p>This also has a negative effect on Jobs. Stimulate the economy all you like, politics of envy will kill it.</p><p>Graeme Matthews, Old Beach</p><p>Asylum-seeker politics of fear</p><p>Recently, Australians have suffered the politics of fear and ignorance peddled by the Liberal Party (``Another asylum-seeker boat'', Sunday Tasmanian, April 26).</p><p>Dr Herbert Vere Evatt and Jessie Street had a significant role in the drafting of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights in 1945.</p><p>I want to remind your readers of the terms of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</p><p>Article 14 says simply: ``Everyone has the right to seek and to enjoy in other countries asylum from persecution.''</p><p>Not a word about detention centres.</p><p>And because of that, I think today is an appropriate occasion to call for the immediate closure of immigration detention centres.</p><p>John Ward, Gordon</p><p>Fencing rethink needed after fire</p><p>The recent Epping Forest fire clearly demonstrated that roadside fencing constructed using only treated pine strainer assemblies and posts and droppers can be totally destroyed by fire.</p><p>This allows stock to escape on to roads, creating an additional traffic hazard.</p><p>The use of metal strainer assemblies and droppers on at least every second post, while not entirely solving the problem, will at least leave the majority of fences standing and stock-proof after such a fire.</p><p>Lindsay Millar, Hillwood</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-STS-20090503-1-018-450589</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYTASMA2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VKK-32T1-2RYX-12YX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"561\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Tasmanian (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"05\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>May 3, 2009 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Immigration Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUI4OEMwN0ExMjQ4NDFBQjkyQTU0NzQzNkM0QUZGRTk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"65\"><className>Eligibility for Asylum</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OURFODA2RDc4MjIyNEY1ODhDMjc3MzA3REZBOTFGM0I7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFEMUZENzNBNkY0NDlEREI3MDBDMTRFM0IwQ0Y2NTk</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>International Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUJBMkUzQ0QwN0E0NEM4RDgzMjM1QTREMkU3RDdBODQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Asylum</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0IyQzc2NTFGMjM2NDRBMkEwQUFBREJBNUI1Q0RCN0M7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MTZCMUU5OEUyREYzNDM4MjkzMkFCQzA0MTM3QUY1NjQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;

Among many issues, the Commission will consider the vexed question of fuel reduction burns and whether enough was done before the fires struck. Figures presented to a Labor-dominated parliamentary committee show there were minimal fires in areas of Victoria where fuel reduction targets were met. But some of the communities worst hit by the fires are in regions where the Government didn't meet its own targets for back burning. Rafael Epstein reports.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">RAFEAL EPSTEIN, REPORTER: This Royal Commission will consider questions they tackled after Ash Wednesday and Black Friday in 1939.</p><p>BERNARD TEAGUE, ROYAL COMMISSIONER: Why from were those bushfires so extreme, so feral, so catastrophic, so devastating?</p><p>RAFEAL EPSTEIN: On the agenda will be back burning, or fuel reduction burning, by the agencies of the State Government.</p><p>JACK RUSH, COUNSEL ASSISTING: The purpose of prescribed burning is not to prevent fire from occurring, but to reduce the intensity of fire, it's rate of spread and the difficulty of suppression.</p><p>RAFEAL EPSTEIN: The commission will be going over old ground. A report last year from a Government-dominated parliamentary committee in Victoria recommended they almost triple the amount of back burning. Data presented to that committee shows the fires on Black Saturday were less fierce in the regions where fuel reduction targets had been met.</p><p>In the regions known as Port Philip, the north east and Gippsland, the state's Department of Environment and Sustainability had trouble reaching its burn off targets because of adverse weather and others reasons.</p><p>Those regions contain the places worst hit in February - communities like Kinglake, St Andrews and Churchill.</p><p>In regions like the south west and the north west fuel reduction targets mostly were met, in part because the forests there are easier to get into. The towns that suffered during Ash Wednesday this time were left untouched.</p><p>JACK RUSH: It has been said once a fire has started, fire intensity and the speed in which fire spreads are affected by fuel loads. Of three factors influencing fire behaviour, the quality and arrangement of fuel is the only factor that can be altered by man before an unplanned fire starts.</p><p>RAFEAL EPSTEIN: The Victorian Government says there's been more fuel reduction than ever before, but they say it's no panacea.</p><p>JOHN BRUMBY, VICTORIAN PREMIER: There are some parts of the state that I've seen in my visits where fire reduction - fuel reduction burning has occurred in the last two or three years, but it didn't start the fire. There are parts of Gippsland where that occurred, where it just swept through, irrespective of the fact there'd been fuel reduction.</p><p>RAFEAL EPSTEIN: The Commission will also look at the fire conditions predicted for the day.</p><p>On the Wednesday before the fires, emergency services received a recorded forecast, predicting that the fire danger index they used would hit unprecedented levels.</p><p>FIRE DANGER ANNOUNCER (recorded forecast): Forest fire danger ratings and grassland fire danger ratings both will peak in the 80s in the latter half of the morning.</p><p>RAFEAL EPSTEIN: Such forecasts prompted the dire but general warnings from Government and officials the sorts of figures that counsel assisting said should've prompted these thoughts within government agencies.</p><p>JACK RUSH: The intensity of the potential fires would be such that it could not be imagined by our generation.</p><p>RAFEAL EPSTEIN: The first hearings begin next month.

The Forestry Vice-Minister, Liu Guangyun, said there was no trace of sabotage behind the fire, which started in Xilinjizhen, Tuqiang, Amur and Tahe. Mr Liu said the most reliable casualty figures were 191 believed dead, 221 seriously injured and 56,000 people in almost 11,000 households affected. In the first detailed assessment of the fire's cost, Mr Liu said it had blackened 1 million ha of mainly forested land, destroyed 750,000 cubic metres of logyard timber and damaged 640,000 sq. m of buildings. He said direct economic losses, excluding standing timber destroyed and the cost of moving 40,000 firefighters to the scene, were estimated at between $153 and $188 million. Mr Liu said the three-week fire, which moved at speeds up to 60 km/h, caught soldiers and firefighters unprepared. He said people in Xilinjizhen fled naked in the night as the fire approached. He said another giant fire just across the border in the Soviet Union, which he described as three times bigger than China's, had also been put out.

xml:space=\"preserve\">\u00a0\u00a0Firefighters are still battling blazes on Melbourne's eastern fringes and in central Victoria ahead of what could be another horror day on Friday.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Country Fire Authority (CFA) has been able to downgrade urgent situations at Upwey in the Dandenong Ranges and at Daylesford northwest of Melbourne, but has warned residents to be alert.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 At Upwey, a fire that started in the Birdlands Reserve on Monday has been contained but the CFA has warned residents in adjacent areas to be on the lookout for flying embers in the tinder-dry conditions.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Even though the fire is not currently posing a threat, the communities of Upwey north of Glenfern Rd need to be aware that fire activity in the area has increased and has the potential to impact directly,\" the CFA said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 CFA spokesman Kevin Monk said ground and air crews were working to prevent any spotting of the fire.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He said 400 firefighters were at Daylesford, 110km northwest of Melbourne, attempting to contain a forest fire spread over 2,800 hectares.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We've got dozers working on that and that's where we may get some spots under the southerly conditions,\" Mr Monk told AAP.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The conditions are so dry that it only takes a small spark and the fire can race off.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 At Warburton, east of Melbourne, the threat eased after firefighters battled overnight to get on top of that blaze.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 But Mr Monk warned that conditions were likely to deteriorate on Friday with temperatures tipped to top 38 degrees combined with strong northerly winds and a south-westerly change.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Those conditions are always a concern for us and the possibility of new fires starting is a worry,\" Mr Monk said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"People in the community really need to be on alert for the day.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Premier John Brumby said only rain can snuff out the fires.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 He said it was a miracle the blaze threatening Upwey was contained with minimal damage to property.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Last night was a miraculous effort really by the firefighters and they just did a fantastic job,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Brumby said Friday was going to be another bad day for firefighters, with scorching heat set to return as 1,000 kilometres of fire fronts continued to burn.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"(It's) nothing like February 7 in terms of temperature or wind but nevertheless we're looking at something at the top end of the 30s and in the north of the state the low 40s,\" he said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Australia's growing bushfire aid appeals will be further boosted with two massive benefit concerts to be held simultaneously in Sydney and Melbourne on March 14.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Long disbanded groups are reuniting, a major cricket final is moving venue,

LEIGH PAATSCH has everything you need to know about this end-of-term's crop of new releases.</p><p>GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY (M, 121 min) NOW SHOWING Who? Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana, and the voices of Bradley Cooper, Vin Diesel. What? Sci-fi adventure-comedy. A group of reformed space criminals must work together to stop a fanatic from destroying the galaxy.</p><p>Well ... ? The latest release from Marvel Entertainment is already one of the biggest films of 2014, and stands up well to repeat viewing. The M-rating is slightly deceptive, as a majority of scenes (save for the occasional explosion) are well inside the all-ages zone.</p><p>Which age group?</p><p>under 5yo: * 1/2 5yo - 8yo: *** 9yo - 12yo: **** 13yo+: ****</p><p>THE BOXTROLLS (PG, 99 min) NOW SHOWING Who?: The voices of Isaac Hampstead Wright, Jared Harris, Ben Kingsley, Elle Fanning.</p><p>What? Stop-motion animation. A young orphan raised by sewer-dwelling trash collectors tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator. Based on the children's novel Here Be Monsters by Alan Snow.</p><p>Well ... ? A strikingly animated production from the makers of the recent surprise hits Coraline and ParaNorman. If your kids could handle the creepier material that surfaced in those films, they should have no problems here. Otherwise, easily spooked young children might be better sent elsewhere.</p><p>Which age group?</p><p>under 5yo: ** 5yo - 8yo: *** 9yo - 12yo: *** 1/2 13yo+: ***</p><p>TEENAGE MUTANT NINJA TURTLES (M, 112 min) NOW SHOWING Who? Megan Fox, Will Arnett, Whoopi Goldberg and the voices of Johnny Knoxville, Tony Shalhoub.</p><p>What? Action adventure. With the help of an intrepid news reporter, a group of mutated warriors face off against an evil kingpin who wants to take over New York.</p><p>Well ... ? The Turtles are back, but not in the family friendly guise that most '90s nostalgists would fondly remember. The combat scenes are too violent for children, while the sleazy asides when co-star Megan Fox slinks into frame are an unwelcome bonus.</p><p>Which age group?</p><p>under 5yo: * 5yo - 8yo: * 9yo - 12yo: * 1/2 13yo+: **</p><p>PLANES: FIRE &amp; RESCUE (G, 80 min) NOW SHOWING Who?: the voices of Dane Cook, Julie Harris, Julie Bowen, Brad Garrett. What? Animation sequel. When Dusty learns that his engine is damaged and he may never race again, he joins a forest fire and rescue unit to be trained as a firefighter.</p><p>Well ... ? Doesn't happen often, but this spritely and involving sequel marks a dramatic improvement upon what was only a so-so original. With so few low-impact \"entry-level\" titles for very young viewers this holiday period, this will be a reliable choice for most parents.</p><p>Which age group?</p><p>under 5yo: *** 1/2 5yo - 8yo: *** 9yo - 12yo: *** 13yo+: **</p><p>THE MAZE RUNNER (M, 117 min) NOW SHOWING Who? Dylan O'Brien, Will Poulter, Aml Ameen, Kaya Scodelario. What? Action adventure. Thomas is deposited in a community of boys after his memory is erased, soon learning they're all trapped in a maze that will require him to join forces with fellow \"runners\" for a shot at escape.</p><p>Well ... ? The M-rating is fully warranted because of the violence and a few threatening scenes, which means that it should be kept right away from young primary-schoolers. For boys 10 and over, though, this gripping chase flick will deservedly be their must-see movie of the holidays.</p><p>Which age group?</p><p>under 5yo: * 5yo - 8yo: * 1/2 9yo - 12yo: *** 13yo+: *** 1/2</p><p>THE HOUSE OF MAGIC (G, 85 min) NOW SHOWING Who? the voices of Cinda Adams, George Babbit, Murray Blue.</p><p>What? Animated adventure. Seeking shelter from a storm, a cheeky and lovable cat named Thunder sneaks into a mysterious mansion owned by retired magician Lawrence, aka \"The Illustrious Lorenzo\".</p><p>Well ... ? A cheery bundle of fun for the under-10 gang. Made in Belgium (but voiced in English), this modest affair doesn't follow the Hollywood lead of cramming every scene full of sight gags and over-chatty voice talent. This makes for a refreshing change.</p><p>Which age group?</p><p>under 5yo: *** 1/2 5yo - 8yo: *** 9yo - 12yo: ** 1/2 13yo+: *</p><p>THE GIVER (M, 97 min) NOW SHOWING Who? Brenton Thwaites, Jeff Bridges, Meryl Streep, Odeya Rush. What Drama. In a seemingly perfect community, without war, pain, suffering, differences or choice, a young boy is chosen to learn from an elderly man about the true pain and pleasure of the \"real\" world.</p><p>Well ... ? The best aspects of this intriguing future-shock drama will go right over the head of kids under 10. However, there is plenty of quality food for thought for the rest of the youth demographic, especially those impatiently waiting for the next Hunger Games.</p><p>Which age group?</p><p>under 5yo: * 5yo - 8yo: ** 9yo - 12yo: *** 13yo+: *** 1/2</p><p>THE LAND OF THE BEARS (G, 87 min) NOW SHOWING VIC-NSW-QLD, OTHER STATES TO FOLLOW. Who? Marion Cotillard (narrator).</p><p>What? Nature documentary. A rare look into the lives of the colony of brown bears on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula. Filmmaker Guillaume Vincent spent 500 days following a young cub leaving his home pack to go out on his own.</p><p>Well ... ? It has been a while since a strong feature doco struck a chord with family audiences. The 600kg stars of the show are a fascinating species that lead a tough life out on the Kamchatka, where it is winter almost nine months of the year.</p><p>Which age group?</p><p>under 5yo: *** 5yo - 8yo: **** 9yo - 12yo: ****13yo+: *** 1/2</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSUNTI-Sunday Times20140928SundayTimes26000120248780</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PSUNTI2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D7N-29X1-JD3N-52GY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244821</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"890\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Times (Perth, Australia)</publicationName><edition>SundayTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 28, 2014 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009V32</classCode><className>ANIMATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009VY1</classCode><className>ACTION &amp;

Of the 50000ha in the Thompson Catchment only 12000ha is available for harvesting, of which a maximum 150ha is harvested annually.</p><p>The quality timber from this forest is the lifeblood for many small regional towns. To end harvesting would result in the closure of sawmills and, of course, job losses. The timber workers who make up these communities are quite often the backbone of local CFAs. If their jobs go so will they and in turn the people who fight bushfires.</p><p>Harvesting contractors, like their CFA counterparts, also provide valuable expertise in firefighting. Their machinery has been the difference between a small forest fire and a major wildfire. The timber industry has provided the road network that allows better access to fires. They are the ones who are protecting our catchments from fire.</p><p>Stopping the timber industry from having access to these areas will see the forest left relatively unprotected from fire. It would be a cruel twist of fate if the forests that the environmentalists had believed they were saving, burned, (as has nearly happened recently) because the machinery and people that would have been there had gone due to environmentalists locking up the forest.</p><p>Scott Gentle,</p><p>State manager,</p><p>Timber Communities Australia, Healesville.</p><p>Tour a successTHE Lilydale &amp; District Historical Society would like to thank the Leader for its article on the old Lilydale Cemetery (January 22).</p><p>As a result of this the Australia Day twilights tour of the cemetery that was conducted by members of the society on Friday, January 26, was an overwhelming success, with about 120 people attending.</p><p>It was a beautiful evening and there was a great deal of interest in the remarkable stories of the lives of the people buried in the cemetery.</p><p>Thank you to the people who shared this experience with us.

Roosevelt to suggest he, too, would like to run for president for two more terms, in addition to the eight years he has served in the Kremlin.</p><p>``There was a time when Roosevelt, the US president, was elected four times in a row because it did not run counter to the US constitution,'' he told the annual gathering of the Valdai Club, a group of foreign academics and journalists.</p><p>And, making the point that he was entitled to run for a second term, he added: ``Neither me nor President (Dmitry) Medvedev will do anything to run counter to the Russian constitution.''</p><p>He insisted the law would be followed to the letter and nothing would be done to ``hinder the democratic process''.</p><p>``We have been discussing a long time what should happen in 2012,'' he said. ``We will proceed from the real situation nearer the time.''</p><p>Mr Putin, looking tanned and relaxed, exuded confidence during several hours of questioning that covered foreign policy, the economy and his record in running Russia for the past decade.</p><p>Speaking in a former Soviet sanatorium, he made it clear by his response to questions that he remained the dominant figure in Russian politics, as opposed to Mr Medvedev, his former subordinate who is now head of state.</p><p>He certainly did not dispel the speculation about his future, which has intensified during his action-packed summer holidays, where even by his own bare-chested macho standards, the Russian leader has outdone himself in a series of transcontinental extreme adventures.</p><p>He drove across hundreds of kilometres of the Siberian tundra in a new canary yellow Lada, stopping to meet ordinary Russians along the way; he attended a motorcycle rally in Sevastopol complete with black leather biker's outfit and a Harley-Davidson; he got into the cockpit of a firefighting helicopter and doused the flames of a forest fire outside Moscow with a ``direct hit''; and took to the sea with conservationists to fire a crossbow bolt at a grey whale.</p><p>At every turn his carefully choreographed actions have been dutifully recorded on television and in the press. Few watching would have doubted that these were the actions of a man preparing his return to power in a typically energetic fashion.</p><p>The contrast with his diminutive political partner, Mr Medvedev, has been glaring. The President seemed to spend his summer anchored behind his desk in the Kremlin struggling to cope with one crisis after another.</p><p>Mr Putin said yesterday he was simply responding to the people's desire for effective leadership, suggesting the way he dealt with the fires around Moscow had been far more successful than US President Barack Obama's reaction to the BP oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. ``People want the leadership to be solving problems, any problems that emerge, and they do not care about the methods used,'' he said.</p><p>During the final stretch of his trip across Siberia Mr Putin let slip that he was focused on returning to the Kremlin. The prospect of Mr Putin remaining in power for the next 14 years -- continuing as Prime Minister for two years and then as President for up to 12 years -- horrified the Russian opposition, who already engage in protests.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS201009081012163048</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALI2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:50YM-R711-JD3N-537M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"577\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>1 - All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>September 8, 2010 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001371</classCode><className>HEADS OF GOVERNMENT ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N921110CC</classCode><className>HEADS OF STATE &amp; GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DL87</classCode><className>DEMOCRACIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009EOQ</classCode><className>PRIME MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp; NATIONAL SECURITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000A38F</classCode><className>MARINE MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>STX000950</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N721110MM</classCode><className>RESORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE0009U46</classCode><className>VLADIMIR PUTIN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX266</classCode><className>MOSCOW, RUSSIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A2L6</classCode><className>ATLANTIC OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC578</classCode><className>RUSSIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC581</classCode><className>UKRAINE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

After a string of further hits, Toni succumbed to Graves disease and has spent most of the past decade recovering.</p><p>``When I contracted the disease I didn't know if I would ever be able to get back into music and tour so when I got back in the studio I was like a little kid stepping out of my skin, I love it so much,'' she said.</p><p>``I already had a large amount of songs ready to go right when I contracted Graves disease and had to stop my life.</p><p>``Going back into the studio I was able to record some of that plus the new stuff I had written and it just feels really good.''</p><p>Toni's music has evolved during her time away from the industry. ``What I'm doing now is rootsy and it's not done with drum loops or sequences or anything like that,'' she said.</p><p>`It's all organic and really old school. Every song is written on guitar so it has this rocky, rootsy kind of ode to some really great songwriters who inspired me earlier in my life like Neil Young, The (Rolling) Stones, Bob Dylan.</p><p>``The best part of re-emerging from the darkness and learning to embrace music once again, is simply the opportunity to evolve and get down to the core of my purpose.</p><p>``I feel like I'm a phoenix rising, burned down to an ash and then coming through that forest fire healthier and stronger than ever before.''</p><p>With word that she was back and raring to go in the music scene, organisers of Jackson Browne's world tour were quick to jump at the opportunity to have the singer on board.</p><p>``They knew I was touring again so I just got an invitation asking if I would like to do it and I said I would love to do it because I actually know Jackson and he's really good friends with my cousin so that was a really wonderful thing,'' Toni said.</p><p>TONI CHILDS</p><p>Toni Childs and Richard Clapton will support Jackson Browne at his Townsville Entertainment Centre concert on Tuesday, March 10. Tickets cost $98 pre-sold or $100 at the door. To book call the Box Office on 4771 4000.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TWNBUL-BUL-20090226-1-021-920029</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TOWNSVILLEB2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7V3K-FFG1-2RYX-13B0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463812</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"430\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Townsville Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"02\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>February 26, 2009 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DB57</classCode><className>AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000889</classCode><className>IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRW8</classCode><className>ORPHAN &amp; RARE DISEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6U</classCode><className>SONG WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002063</classCode><className>ENDOCRINE SYSTEM DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DPK4</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DPLG</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001184</classCode><className>MUSIC INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001070</classCode><className>RECORD RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DPK4</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000DPLG</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
