Forest are noted.</p><p> \"There are concerns around those activities on the plantation in that you may increase fire risk with machinery and all sorts of things,\" the report reads</p><p> \"Having better fire management capability from the proponent or an arrangement with</p><p> HQ Plantations for us is critical to be able to detect those fires early.\"</p><p> A spokeswoman for Forest Wind told the Chronicle the company \"recognises the importance of fire risk management and is committed to deliver its responsibilities under the Queensland Fire and Emergency Service Act\".</p><p> The spokeswoman said the latest fire mitigation technology had been incorporated into the project such as transformer isolation, arching avoidance design and fire proof materials.</p><p> \"A detailed Fire Hazard Impact Assessment for Forest Wind has been undertaken, identifying potential hazards within the wind farm and the forest operation,\" she said.</p><p> A spokeswoman for HQ Plantations said the Plantations' fire management was primarily based on prevention, early wildfire detection and weighted suppression.</p><p> \"We aim to work collaboratively with all stakeholders in fire management and will do so with Forest Wind Holdings as their project unfolds,\" the HQ Plantation's Spokeswoman said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Peacefully.\" 16/5) asks why universities are being so roundly criticised. While defending their role in defence of free speech, he ignores a major reason for the current pro-Palestine actions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The students involved are calling for their universities to get out of research with Israeli weapons and surveillance companies and institutions while their government bombs Gaza into a dystopian future and continues its inhuman occupation of Palestinian territories.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Their protests are timely, show up the pusillanimous Albanese government, and deserve our support.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ken Blackman, Inverloch</p><p>Gonski model fail</p><p>The public education system has a higher proportion of students with disabilities than the non-government sector, (\"Disability forces school funding rise\", 16/5) . The usual response to this fact is a justifiable demand for more money, but there is another issue here, which is the disproportion itself, which arises because of the Gonski funding model flaws that we are not allowed to mention.</p><p>On the one hand, the Gonski model provides the full loadings for disadvantage, including disability, for all students, no matter the sector, thus encouraging non-government schools to take more such students. On the other hand, the schooling resource standard for non-government schools is adjusted according to each school's median parental income, forcing many schools to put their fees up and drive disadvantaged students out of them into the government sector, increasing social stratification and lowering overall educational achievement.</p><p>Gonski is a dud model and needs to be replaced by a model that adjusts the funding of non-governments schools according to the fees they charge so that they are supported - and even required - to take more disadvantaged students.</p><p>Chris Curtis, Hurstbridge</p><p>School behaviour</p><p>Having undertaken many years of teacher training in Australia, and 40 years of being a leader in teacher education as a practising teacher and academic here and in the UK, I think I am qualified to ask why Britain's \"school behaviour chief\" (surely a post derived from a need occasioned by poor school behaviour), is listened to after \"visiting Australian schools this week\". (\"School Behaviour Chief's clear message for teachers\", 15/5).</p><p>The former Soho nightclub owner left his teacher training feeling unprepared to manage a classroom. This, in itself, may be a result of factors other than a failure of the British teacher education system. There is no such thing as a single \"classroom\" to be fully prepared for.</p><p>Australian classrooms are diverse. An increasing number of children and students are being asked to learn in a language, English, which is new to them. We have an exam system which is antiquated, and a curriculum which to many children of the digital age seems purposeless.</p><p>Bad behaviour is not just a matter of bad manners, though all teachers agree that respect and routines are essential for successful classroom learning.</p><p>The visiting behaviour chief's assertion that current Australian graduates are underskilled, and that this could be traced back to university academics who \"promulgated all types of odd bizarre actions about behaviour\", is at best, ignorant, and at worst, absurd.</p><p>Australian educational experts would, no doubt, agree that many children, are indeed, behaving badly. Their message, based on Australian experience, would surely be that if we are to change behaviour, we need a whole-society approach.</p><p>This would include such measures as control of social media; ways of dealing with childhood mental illness; equality of resourcing for public and private schools; parenting support; and, importantly, a recognition that a monolingual delivery of the curriculum disadvantages many students. Sadly, teacher education, however poor or excellent, is neither the demon, nor the panacea for school behaviour.</p><p>Kay Moulton, Surrey Hill</p><p>Greater glider death</p><p>Re \"Endangered greater glider found dead next to department's felling site\", 15/5. I was there yesterday when the still warm body of this greater glider was found.</p><p>I'm a member of the community group that successfully took VicForests to court for failing to protect endangered greater gliders during its logging operations. This win was the result of endless hours of evidence-gathering in the forest at night where I came to know and love these beautiful, gentle creatures.</p><p>It's devastating that we now have an organisation, Forest Fire Management Victoria, that can log without any environmental oversight.</p><p>Volunteers had sent detection reports to FFMV of greater gliders and Leadbeater's' possums in the very trees that were marked for removal, but these were ignored.</p><p>As the Officer of the Conservation Regulator has said in an email, \"Decisions around DEECA's fire operations, including assurance, are managed through the department\". This does not augur well for what's left of our forest wildlife.</p><p>Rosemary Storey, St Andrews</p><p>Firefighter lives first</p><p>Dangerous trees are one of the most serious risks faced by firefighters, and tragically a volunteer lost his life at the Black Saturday Murrindindi fire in 2009. Two firefighters also lost their lives at the Harrietville fire in 2013 from falling trees.</p><p>It beggars belief that the Victorian National Parks Association and Environmental Justice Australia puts the loss of one greater glider ahead of protecting firefighters who have to work in potentially extremely dangerous conditions to control bushfires - bushfires that ironically can destroy vast swathes of habitat for greater gliders and Leadbeater's' possums.</p><p>The loss of a few hollow-bearing trees along strategic firebreaks is a small price to pay, particularly when there are tens of thousands of hectares of forest with hollow-bearing trees remaining untouched.</p><p>Peter Farrell, Point Lonsdale</p><p>Pay your car privilege</p><p>It is hard to have sympathy for people who buy or rent inner-city apartments with no parking, who then complain about not being able to park their cars. (14/5/). As a former resident of an inner Sydney suburb, I know that properties with off-street parking, or access to a resident parking scheme, sell or rent at a premium to those that do not.</p><p>The inner suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney were designed around public transport and walking, not cars. It is just not feasible for everyone to own a car. If you want to live in an inner suburb and own a car, then you must be prepared to pay extra for the privilege.</p><p>James Proctor, Maiden Gully</p><p>Bring on tram extensions</p><p>I was impressed and pleased to read the article regarding completing the 50-metre \"missing link\", (\"The 50-metre 'missing link' fix that will open new cross-city tram routes\", 16/5), which will provide an additional, vital east-west link to our tram network.</p><p>There are other quick wins and tweaks to be had around Melbourne that can further improve the network and increase flexibility in operation.</p><p>For example, the route 48 to North Balwyn should be extended up to Doncaster Shoppingtown and the route 70 extended to Deakin University via Elgar Road to link up with the route 75, and the 64 extended down Nepean Highway to Southland and so on.</p><p>Once the Metro Tunnel opens there is scope, I believe, to reroute some of the St Kilda tram routes and/or introduce some inner city short workings running north to south. For example, the 67 Carnegie could be routed via Chapel, Church and Swan</p><p>streets into the city via Flinders or Collins Street using existing pointwork.</p><p>Steven Haby, Hughesdale</p><p>Insecure men</p><p>I greatly appreciated your theatre critic Cameron Woodhead's interview with Trophy Boys playwright Emmanuelle Mattana. Its nuanced analysis of insecure masculinity that hides behind the traditional dominant and abusive masculinity that boys in many parts of our society learn.(\"Schoolboys ranked this smart young woman. Her response is thrilling,\" 15/5).</p><p>As a boy, I went to a private boys school in Sydney and felt I could never be \"man enough\". I was the soft boy that never fitted into the dominant image of what a man had to be.</p><p>I found the pictures in the Trophy Boy play that showed the physical posturing that boys learn confronting, as they brought back memories and feelings of the dominant masculinity I could never live up to.</p><p>We need to continue to have conversations about this dominant and patriarchal form of masculinity and explore alternative forms of manhood. Men (and boys) need models that will help them embrace more of their feminine side. Men insecure in their own masculine identity will attack, abuse and denigrate those who express a softer, more human form of masculinity that is balanced with femininity.</p><p>These men deny their femininity, and will project their feelings of weakness onto others as they work to dominate and hide their insecurities.</p><p>With women, they will use tactics to make them objects they can rate to give themselves a sense of power over others (as happened at Yarra Valley Grammar).</p><p>In conversation, they dominate and compete with others, especially women, to assert their fragile hypermasculinity. The incident with the boys at Yarra Valley Grammar highlights the need for our society (including schools, football clubs, business leaders etc.) to work at how we educate our boys to be real men.</p><p>Bruce Hart, Bittern</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7vg70en07804czg7395</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C1V-VVJ1-JD34-V01C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1548\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

stay alert, monitor local conditions and decide what they would do if the situation changed.</p><p>The CFS said the fire had earlier broken containment lines and multiple spotfires had started to the

A community has been cut off, businesses have been ruined, farmers can't get their cattle out, scores of people have lost their jobs and Australia's most expensive hotel, the $160m Emirates One&amp;Only Wolgan Valley resort, has shut up shop and no one knows when it will open again.</p><p>The Wolgan Valley, less than 100km from the outskirts of -Sydney, is now one of the most -isolated places in Australia.</p><p>Access has been severed by -extreme weather events - firstly Australia's biggest forest fire, the Gospers Mountain Fire, and then 21/2 times as much rain as it has ever had since records began in the 1800s.</p><p>The 25km-long valley is hemmed in by dramatic sandstone cliffs that rise like prison walls. There's only one road in. Seared by fire and then saturated and eroded by rain, vast tension cracks -appeared above the Wolgan Gap Rd, leaving it vulnerable to a \"catastrophic collapse\". Last November Lithgow City Council closed the road, forever.</p><p>For months, the only access into the valley was via a rugged and treacherous fire trail.</p><p>The council cut a new road, the Donkey Steps, down into the valley, which opened in March. It is just a few degrees shy of being the steepest public road in the world. It's locked to the public and can be accessed only by residents with four-wheel drives. It's far too dangerous for trucks.</p><p>The closure of the Wolgan Gap Rd has caused havoc and devastation for residents and workers in the valley.</p><p>The Emirates resort has made about 90 staff redundant and it will remain closed until at least the end of next year.</p><p>The resort was one of the largest employers in Lithgow shire. Resort general manager Tim Stanhope can't see light at the end of the tunnel and has resigned to take up a position in Vietnam.</p><p>The resort's closure has had a dramatic effect on local businesses that supported it: butchers, bakers, florists, dry cleaners, plumbers.</p><p>And it has had a devastating -effect too on the farmers and small tourism operators in the valley.</p><p>And no one knows when a new, proper access road will be built. What they do know is that it will take years and will cost tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>Council general manager Craig Butler says that with increasing -severe weather, driven by climate change, there needs to be a new model to allow council's like his to cope.</p><p>\"One wonders about the model, going forward,\" he says. \"I'm not sure that the various forms of government have enough fast twitch muscles for the effects of climate change.\" INQUIRER P19</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-2db01bdc79cf11ee8af7539effab18ec25aa10587ab7f2bfa833b16f57832abc</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69JD-D1P1-F0JP-W07N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"424\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 4, 2023 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001010</classCode><className>LAYOFFS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001981</classCode><className>LAYOFFS &amp;

community.\" </p><p>Following the fires, authorities including FFMV, the CFA, SES and Victoria Police hosted bushfire information sessions in Fairhaven, Lorne and Kennett River on Sunday, March 19.

sessions, where feedback on communication to accommodation providers and visitors was one issue raised. </p><p>Mr Hardman and Mr Allen both stressed the importance of planned burns. </p><p>\"The risk of not burning is far greater than the risks associated with carrying out burns,\" Mr Hardman said. </p><p>Mr Allen, who has lived in Lorne all his life, said bushfires were part of the risk taken by those living in the forest. </p><p>\"I thought (authorities) handled the whole thing very well.\" </p><p>Before every planned burn, firefighters consider several factors when selecting the most suitable time to light a planned burn. </p><p>Planned burns are conducted all year round as conditions allow. </p><p>In the Otways and Far South West districts, the number of planned burns can vary from 42 in 2021-22 to 74 in 2011-12. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Sharp spikes in temperature can destroy coral tissue directly even before bleaching unfolds. Consequently, if temperatures exceed 2\u00b0C above the normal summer maximum, heat-sensitive corals die very quickly. </p><h>What is coral bleaching?</h><p>Bleaching happens when marine heatwaves disrupt the relationship between corals and their \"photosynthetic symbionts\" - tiny organisms that live inside the corals' tissues and help power their metabolism.</p><p>Severe bleaching is often fatal, whereas corals that are mildly bleached can slowly regain their symbionts and normal colour after the end of summer, and survive. </p><p>Before 1998, coral bleaching on the Great Barrier Reef was infrequent and localised. But over the past four decades, bleaching has increased in frequency, severity and sptial scale, as a result of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan8048\">human-induced climate heating</url>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: We just spent two weeks surveying the Great Barrier Reef. What we saw was an utter tragedy</emphasis></p><p>\"Mass coral bleaching\" refers to bleaching that is severe and widespread, affecting reefs at a regional scale or even throughout the tropics triggered by rising global sea temperatures.</p><p>The Great Barrier Reef consists of more than 3,000 individual coral reefs. It's the same size as Japan or Italy, and extends for 2,300km along the coast of Queensland. Widespread coral deaths during extreme heatwaves, affecting hundreds of millions of coral colonies, <url normalizedValue=\"https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15805\">far exceed the damage</url> typically caused by a severe cyclone.</p><h>How bad is 2024?</h><p>Heat stress this week is reaching record levels on large parts of the Great Barrier Reef. </p><p>Climate scientists can measure the accumulation of heat stress throughout the summer by using a metric called \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pacioos.hawaii.edu/voyager/info/coral_bleaching_degree_heating_week.html\">degree heating weeks</url>\" (DHW), which factors in both the duration and intensity of extreme heat exposure. This measures how far the temperature is above the threshold that triggers mild bleaching (1\u00b0C hotter than the normal summer maximum), and how long it stays above that threshold.</p><p>The same DHW exposure can result either from a long, moderate heatwave or from a short, intense peak in temperatures. The 2023-24 summer has been a slow burner on the Great Barrier Reef - sea temperatures have not been as extreme as during previous bleaching events, but they have <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bom.gov.au/oceanography/oceantemp/sst-outlook-map.shtml\">persisted for longer</url>.</p><p>As a general rule of thumb, 2-4 DHW units can trigger the onset of bleaching, and heat-sensitive species of coral begin to die at 6-8 DHW units. So far this summer, <url normalizedValue=\"https://x.com/profterryhughes/status/1762293105175445921?s=12&amp;t=jfoU3j0RiQtYeeHqbSpjlA\">according to the US National Oceanographic and Atmospheric Administration</url>, heat stress on the Great Barrier Reef has climbed to 10-12 DHW units on many individual reefs, and has been north and south compared to the central region. Heat stress will likely peak in the next week or two at levels above all previous mass bleaching and mortality events since 1998, before falling as temperatures drop.</p><p>Coral bleaching is typically very patchy at the enormous scale of the Great Barrier Reef. In each of the previous events since 1998, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdfExtended/S0960-9822(21)01490-1\">20-55% of individual reefs</url> experienced severe bleaching and coral deaths, whereas 14-48% of reefs were unharmed.</p><p>Given the near-record levels of heat stress this summer, we can expect heavy losses of corals to occur on hundreds of individual reefs over the next few months.</p><h>What's the longer-term outlook?</h><p>This latest, still-unfolding event was entirely predictable, as ocean temperatures continue to rise due to global heating. </p><p>Three of the seven mass bleaching events so far on the Great Barrier Reef coincided with El Ni\u00f1o conditions (1998, 2016 and this summer), and the remaining four did not. Increasingly, climate-driven coral bleaching and death is happening regardless of whether we are in an El Ni\u00f1o or La Ni\u00f1a phase. Average tropical sea surface temperatures are <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aan8048\">already warmer today</url> under La Ni\u00f1a conditions than they were during El Ni\u00f1o events only three or four decades ago.</p><p>The Great Barrier Reef is now a chequerboard of reefs with different recent histories of coral bleaching. Reefs that bleached in 2017 or 2016 have had only five or six years to recover before being hit again this summer - assuming they escaped bleaching during the 2020 and 2022 episodes. </p><p>Clearly, the gap between consecutive heat extremes is shrinking - we are vanishingly unlikely to see another 14-year reprieve like 2002 to 2016 again in our lifetimes, until global temperatures stabilise.</p><p>Ironically, the corals that are now prevalent on many reefs are young colonies of fast-growing, heat-sensitive species of branching and table-shaped corals - analogous to the rapid recovery of flammable grasses after a forest fire. These species can restore coral cover quickly, but they also make the Great Barrier Reef more vulnerable to future heatwaves. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Concern for the Great Barrier Reef can inspire climate action - but the way we talk about it matters</emphasis></p><p>Attempts to restore depleted coral cover through coral gardening, assisted migration (by harvesting larvae) and assisted evolution (rearing corals in an aquarium) are prohibitively expensive and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cell.com/one-earth/pdf/S2590-3322(23)00189-6.pdf\">unworkable at any meaningful scale</url>.

For the Republicans, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/commentary/nikki-haleys-supporters-ponder-pondering-their-new-vote-for-donald-trump-or-joe-biden/news-story/4f3f73bac5050883f892bab311c2c178\">Nikki Haley</url> secured a narrow win over <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/world/mitch-mcconnell-backs-donald-trump-for-president-despite-years-of-acrimony/news-story/c23e96a3aa45d34e4af4af9870637aeb\">Donald Trump </url>in tiny Vermont on the same day, having notched a victory in the US capital a few days earlier. But Trump won all 14 other contests. Biden brought his total vote share in his primaries to 86 per cent; Trump to 64 per cent.</p><p>On Wednesday, Haley bowed to the inevitable, ending her campaign with a pointed message for Trump from a transatlantic icon of conservatism. \"I have always been a conservative Republican and always supported the Republican nominee,\" she said. \"But on this question, as she did on so many others, Margaret Thatcher provided some good advice when she said, 'Never just follow the crowd. Always make up your own mind'.\"</p><p>So the election we all knew was coming has come. On Thursday, too late for this column, Biden was to deliver his third and most important <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theaustralian.com.au/world/what-to-watch-for-in-joe-bidens-state-of-the-union-address/news-story/e428dd3b7b34969dbbd9d9cf9ed0863e\">State of the Union </url>address. Though it's a state occasion, this year it marked the beginning of the uphill effort to rescue Biden's parlous position for November.</p><p>He starts in as weak a condition as any incumbent president in recent history. Biden's approval rating stands at an average of 39 per cent, according to Real Clear Politics. At this stage in their re-election campaigns, Trump was at 45 per cent and went on to lose, Barack Obama was at 48 per cent and won narrowly, George W Bush was at 50 per cent and won even more narrowly.</p><p>Biden trails Trump in polls by an average of about 2 percentage points. That's not much but the details are worse. At about 47 per cent, Trump is scoring better in polls than he has ever done. In seven states won narrowly by Biden four years ago, Trump leads by averages of 8 in Nevada, 7 in Georgia, 6 in North Carolina, 6 in Arizona, 4 in Michigan, 1 in Wisconsin. Biden leads by a half a percentage point only in Pennsylvania. </p><p>If the result is like this, Trump will win an electoral college landslide. But we are eight months out. An eternity in politics.</p><p>The contest will revolve around four pivots. First, the issues. For all the attention paid to lawsuits, democracy and character, voters seem fixated on core policy issues. And on all the things they care about, Biden is in deep trouble.</p><p>Immigration is the most important. It's hard to see how Biden changes negative perceptions on this after three years in which his administration has let in more than seven million illegal immigrants - four times the number in four years under Trump. </p><p>On the economy, Biden is also way behind, but there are signs of potential. Inflation is gradually falling and unemployment remains low. If the economy stays strong, Biden could make up vital ground.</p><p>Foreign policy is another weakness for Biden. Since the botched withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Americans have given him low marks, and as wars rage in the Middle East and Europe, the sense of insecurity voters feel about the world is deepening. Biden urgently needs progress on both fronts to improve his chances. The one issue Biden could leverage to his advantage is abortion, where Democrats are strongly favoured over Republicans. But it doesn't rank high on voters' concerns.</p><p>The second pivot is age v character. At 81 Biden is widely deemed by voters to be too old for another four years in the job. Trump, though not much younger, does not arouse the same concerns. But the former president's behaviour, especially after the 2020 election, and his forest fire of legal problems have left many undecided voters deeply uncomfortable.</p><p>As it stands, the various criminal cases Trump faces are being pushed into a distant future, but there will still be courtroom action. At least one trial - in New York over his alleged illegal payments to a porn star - will get attention. A conviction, even one viewed by many as politicised, could damage him.</p><p>The third pivot is the appeal of an independent candidate. We've never had an election before in which voters so disliked both major party candidates. That looks set to result in the strongest showing in decades by a third party. Robert F Kennedy, maverick scion of the famous family, with his taste for anti-vax campaigns and conspiracy theories, is getting about 10 per cent in polls.</p><p>If a more plausible candidate who pitches to voters in the vast middle of America gets in, they could do even better. Haley has ruled out a bid but still faces pleas to run. Kyrsten Sinema, the Arizona Democrat recently turned independent, announced her resignation from the Senate this week, expressing disgust at the lack of common ground in politics. With her nonpartisan record she could have real appeal to voters.</p><p>The final pivot is a mix of what another Donald, Rumsfeld, famously called known and unknown unknowns. </p><p>The two main candidates are so familiar there probably aren't any more shoes to drop. But a serious health episode for either elderly gentleman, Biden in particular, would upend the race, maybe even force a change of candidate. </p><p>A major incident - a terrorist attack, or serious crimes committed by an illegal migrant - could be devastating for Biden. Escalation of the regional wars around the world could block out all other voter concerns. </p><p>And - this must be said - in a country with a long history of assassination, disorder and bloodshed, the threat of political violence is ever present, with wholly uncertain consequences.</p><p>In a campaign characterised so far by almost numbing predictability, who would bet against the shockingly unpredictable?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Times</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

In the last few weeks have had little, if any rain, across the state, and that has certainly dried out grasslands.\"</p><h>Which communities are most at risk?</h><p>On Monday, CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan warned people in the communities of <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Rainbow, Warracknabeal, Minyip, Rupanyup and Murtoa</emphasis> to prepare a bushfire action plan and consider evacuating early Tuesday morning or on Monday night.\u00a0</p><p>\"Tomorrow's [Tuesday's] conditions will put you and your family's lives at risk if a fire starts and takes hold,\" Mr Heffernan said.</p><p>\"Do not plan to defend your home on catastrophic fire danger days. The safest place to be is away from high-risk areas such as campsites, parks and forests.</p><p>\"If you are caught out and all other bushfire plans have failed, be aware of local last-resort options such as Neighbourhood Safer Places and designated Community Fire Refuges.\"</p><p>Dozens of schools and early-childhood education and care services have been closed in the Wimmera region due to the fire risk \u2014 <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.vic.gov.au/early-childhood-school-closures\">a list is being updated on the state government's website</url>.</p><p>Mr Heffernan also urged residents in high-risk areas to check on their vulnerable neighbours \u2014 a message for Victorians across the state, where a heatwave warning is in place.</p><p>Outside the bushfire zone, the warning is urging Victorians to drink plenty of water, avoiding leaving anyone in a hot car and seeking out shade and cool spaces.</p><h>What about campers and travellers in the area?</h><p>Authorities have urged everyone to avoid all unnecessary travel on roads in and around high-risk areas.</p><p>On Monday, Forest Fire Management Victoria's chief fire officer Chris Hardman told campers to immediately leave all parks in the danger zone, including the <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Grampians National Park, Little Desert National Park and Wail State Forest</emphasis>.</p><p>\"Catastrophic fire days really mean that fires can be uncontrollable, fast-moving and sometimes impossible for emergency services to suppress effectively,\" he said.</p><p>\"Do not visit parks and forests \u2026 in the footprint that is incorporated in the catastrophic fire conditions.</p><p>\"If you're already camping in any of those parks, you need to leave tonight [Monday].\"</p><p>Outside the highest risk zones, authorities have also warned campers not to leave fires unattended.</p><h>How reliable will Victorian fire warnings be?</h><p>Authorities made a particular point of emphasising that on a day with such catastrophic conditions, there was a risk Victoria's fire warning system could become overwhelmed.</p><p>\"You may not receive a warning in time, such is the nature of how fast fires can occur,\" Mr Heffernan said.</p><p>Authorities have made clear that with such dangerous conditions, it may be impossible to effectively suppress fast-moving grassfires that could quickly threaten lives.</p><p>Mr Heffernan stressed the importance\u00a0of residents in high-risk areas having more than one source of information and being prepared for power outages.</p><p>\"So have the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.emergency.vic.gov.au/respond/\">Vic Emergency</url>\u00a0app, have the information available to you, but don't necessarily wait for an official alert or a warning,\" he said.</p><p>\"Be ready to take action on your own in order to save yours and your family's life.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

If those objectors don't want ducks hunted, do they want rabbits protected as well?</p><p>If they care that much, do something about the birds and animals killed on our roads and leave the legitimate hunters alone.

Animal agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation, land degradation, species extinction, toxic groundwater, ocean dead zones.</p><p>There is no evidence of kangaroos in plague proportions.

The $100 million of farmers was well and truly overshadowed by their complete blunders.</p><p>Farmers were unable to capitalise on their crops as BOM said it was going to stay dry so urea and other additives were unattainable, reducing yields and quality.</p><p>Then, with their forecast of El Nino over summer, we, and many other farmers, didn't apply fly prevention to our sheep, to save money and it would be a total waste if dry and hot. This is the first year in many we have not applied fly prevention. Guess what we are doing now: you guessed it, treating flyblown sheep.</p><p>Thanks BOM, hope your staff enjoy their holidays.</p><p>Stuart McClelland, Bealiba</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-486acb04aa9211ee92ce2cf85075cb349580ed0970a37df90eee45b48d46c631</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B2P-C5K1-JD3N-515N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp;

Authorities have declared a \"<url normalizedValue=\"https://news.cfa.vic.gov.au/news/catastrophic-fire-danger-for-wimmera\">catastrophic</url>\" fire risk in some parts of the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At the time of writing, the Bayindeen bushfire near Ballarat was still burning out of control, almost <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.aol.com/news/thousands-told-flee-homes-australia-230102847.html\">a week</url> after it began. It had razed 21,300 hectares, destroyed six homes and killed livestock. And more than 30,000 people in high-risk areas between Ballarat and Ararat had <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/feb/27/victoria-fires-bushfires-evacuations-warnings-extreme-danger-ballarat-ararat\">reportedly been told</url> to leave their homes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This statewide emergency is noteworthy for several reasons. First, it represent a big test of Australia's updated fire danger rating system. The new version adopted in 2022 dictates that if a fire takes hold under catastrophic conditions, people should leave an area rather than shelter in place or stay defend their homes.</p><p>The second point to note is the timing: late February, when many Australians probably thought the worst of the bushfire season was over. Climate change is bringing not just more frequent and severe fires, but <url normalizedValue=\"https://climate.nasa.gov/news/2315/study-fire-seasons-getting-longer-more-frequent/\">longer fire seasons</url>. That means we must stay on heightened alert for much longer than in the past.</p><h>Under catastrophic conditions, leave</h><p>The current <url normalizedValue=\"https://afdrs.com.au\">Australian Fire Danger Rating System</url> was implemented in September 2022. It's a nationally consistent system based on the latest scientific research.</p><p>Authorities hope the system will more accurately predict fire danger. It was also designed to more clearly communicate the danger rating to the public. For example, it involves just four danger ratings, compared to the previous six under the old Victorian regime.</p><p>\"Catastrophic\" fire danger - previously \"code red\" in Victoria - represents the worst conditions. The main message for the public under these conditions is:</p><p>If a fire starts and takes hold, lives are likely to be lost. For your survival leave bushfire risk areas.</p><p>Under catastrophic conditions, people are advised to move to a safer location early in the morning or even the day before. Authorities warn \"homes cannot withstand fires in these conditions. You may not be able to leave, and help may not be available\".</p><h>Lessons from Black Saturday</h><p>Australia's previous fire danger rating system was developed in the 1960s and was formally known as the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.csiro.au/en/research/disasters/bushfires/mk5-forest-fire-danger-meter\">McArthur Forest Fire Danger Index</url>. It initially comprised five risk levels ranging from low-moderate to extreme. However, states were free to adapt the system to their needs, including adding extra categories.</p><p>The devastating 2009 Black Saturday bushfires in Victoria <url normalizedValue=\"https://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/2025/remembering-black-saturday-the-extraordinary-weather-behind-victorias-2009-bushfires/\">killed 173 people</url>. Many people died after staying to defend their properties. </p><p>The tragedy prompted scrutiny of the fire danger ratings system in Victoria and the \"code red\" category was added. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://knowledge.aidr.org.au/resources/ajem-apr-2011-preparing-for-a-code-red-day/\">message</url> under those conditions was that those living in a bushfire-prone area should leave. The first code red was declared in 2010, then another <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-11-21/emergency-officials-declare-code-red-day-for-victoria/11722420\">in 2019</url>.</p><p>That system was replaced by the national system in 2022.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Read more: Our planet is burning in unexpected\u00a0ways - here's how we can protect people and nature</emphasis></p><h>Don't stay and defend</h><p>Under the current fire danger rating system, catastrophic conditions mean everyone should leave an area. The leave orders currently issued in Victoria cover many thousands of people, and represent a big test of this advice. </p><p>We don't yet know how many people will heed the advice of authorities. However, at least some people have reportedly decided to <url normalizedValue=\"https://9now.nine.com.au/today/victoria-fires-update-beaufort-wedding-venue-owner-staying-behind-to-protect-home-and-business/2ae18f36-0025-461b-a45b-2171893c9a67\">stay and defend their properties</url>.</p><p>If thousands of others do flee, what will result? Will rural roads be blocked? Do we have the infrastructure to temporarily house all those evacuees? Whether or not the fire situation escalates on Wednesday, there will be much to learn about how we deal with such threats.</p><p>Certainly, it's prudent for people in high-risk areas to leave. In hot, windy conditions, a fire could erupt and take hold in minutes. The <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/a-major-blackout-left-500-000-victorian-homes-without-power-but-it-shows-our-energy-system-is-resilient-223494\">collapse</url> of electricity transmission towers in Victoria last week showed the vulnerability of such infrastructure in high winds. It doesn't take long for downed power lines to ignite the surrounding bush.</p><p>Is there an potential alternative to the mass relocation of people in response to a major fire risk? Yes: building communities that are sufficiently fire-proofed to withstand catastrophic fire weather.</p><p>This could be achieved through adaptation measures such as building <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/6/8/298\">fire bunkers</url> and specially-designed houses. It would also involve carefully managed bushland and creating fire breaks by planting non-flammable plants. It may also include <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.adi8066\">targeted cultural burning</url> by Traditional Owners.

hectares.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Authorities are warning of potentially catastrophic fire danger across parts of Victoria mid-week as the west of the state reels from a bushfire that has been burning for five days.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Bayindeen fire has burnt more than 19,500 hectares, destroying three homes north of Beaufort and another six near Raglan.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The blaze has also claimed sheds, livestock and farming equipment.</p><p>About 600 firefighters are working to suppress the fire, which has been burning since Thursday last week.</p><p>On Sunday afternoon, about 200 people gathered in Beaufort for a community meeting about the fires.</p><p>Among them was Sandy Little, a wool farmer from Raglan who has\u00a0been in the Country Fire Authority (CFA) for most of his life.</p><p>He said the fire was like nothing he had seen before.</p><p>\"It's one of the worst, fastest-moving fires I've seen,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Little lost his wool shed and 70 sheep in the fire, but was grateful to still have his house standing.\u00a0</p><p>Other farmers have lost their homes and livestock too.</p><p>\"There have been miraculous saves, but lots of heartbreak too,\" Mr Little said.</p><p>Ballarat CFA incident controller Jon Rofe told community members gathered to be prepared for the coming week.</p><p>Ahead of Wednesday, Mr Rofe said the strategy was to actively suppress the blaze, using an earth trail around the fire to create a break in the fuel and slow it down.</p><p>He said locals would see an increase in fire activity and smoke as crews actively burned areas untouched by fire to remove fuel.</p><p>There will also be increased aircraft activity as crews try to suppress the fire between the earth trail and where it was burning.</p><p>Twenty-four aircraft were working on the fire on Sunday, including water-bombing helicopters and observation craft.</p><p>Mr Rofe said if the fire broke out on the eastern side, it could spread over the Western Highway past Beaufort and head north-east towards Lexton and beyond.\u00a0</p><p>Victoria Police District Commander Jason Templar said the Western Highway could be shut if the fire posed a safety risk and alternative routes would be available.</p><p>Health representatives told people with compromised health to wear masks to minimise smoke exposure during the next few days.</p><p>Central Highlands Water reported no impact on drinking water quality to date, but people with private drinking water supply were urged to seek alternative sources.</p><p>There have been reports of asbestos in some of the burn sites and anyone in these areas must wear an N95 mask.</p><p>Department of Agriculture will have eight teams on the ground for welfare checks and urgent cases.</p><h>Fire danger could be catastrophic</h><p>The Mallee, Wimmera, and South West Victoria regions all have an extreme fire danger rating for Wednesday.</p><p>Bureau of Meteorology senior meteorologist Angus Hines did not rule out the fire risk reaching catastrophic levels for parts of Victoria.</p><p>\"If we do see those hot, dry, and windy conditions sharpen up even further, we could see very high and extreme fire dangers, or possibly a repeat of catastrophic fire danger for parts of the state,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Haines said\u00a0moderate fire danger was forecast across most of the state\u00a0on Monday and Tuesday along with cool, settled conditions, but this would change mid-week.</p><p>On Wednesday, hot and dry winds are forecast to gust from inland through the west of the state including the Mallee, Wimmera, and South West Victoria regions.</p><p>Temperatures are also set to soar with a high of 44 degrees Celsius forecast for Mildura, 37C\u00a0 for Horsham, and 36C for Beaufort.</p><p>Mr Haines said temperatures were likely to remain high for the rest of the week, with no rain forecast for the coming days.</p><p>\"The wind may die away, but we're still anticipating a number of regions will stay in high fire danger towards the end of the week,\" he said.</p><p>The forecast will be reassessed in the coming days.</p><p>CFA chief executive Jason Heffernan said the CFA, Forest Fire Management Victoria and Fire Rescue Victoria were working together to prepare for Wednesday.</p><p>Mr Heffernan said the CFA had requested support from New South Wales crews to help bolster firefighter numbers and prevent fatigue.\u00a0</p><p>He said residents as far away as Bendigo might smell or see smoke drift from the fire area as crews did strategic burnt offs.</p><p>People should check the VicEmergency app or website if they are concerned.</p><p>\"It's likely to be smoke drift from this fire, but if in doubt, or you see a fire without firefighters in attendance, call triple-0,\" Mr Heffernan said.</p><h>Volunteers drop everything to help out</h><p>Volunteers from Tyers Fire Brigade, in Victoria's east, had an early start on Friday morning as they travelled about 375 kilometres to help fellow CFA crews battle an out-of-control bushfire in the state's west.</p><p>Tyers CFA captain Ross Wisewood said he had immense pride for his volunteers who dropped everything they were doing to lend a hand.</p><p>\"It's just about helping your mate, helping your community,\" Mr Wisewood said.</p><p>\"We don't do it for the medals or the honour; we do it to help our family.\"</p><p>It was not uncommon for CFA volunteers to travel long distances to assist other brigades when bushfires got out of control.</p><p>In recent years, Mr Wisewood said the CFA had become much better at ensuring available resources were sent to the right place at the right time.</p><p>\"We might be volunteers, but we pride ourselves on delivering a professional service to the community,\" he said.</p><p>With more hot weather on the way this week, there are concerns bushfires could pop up in other parts of the state.</p><p>However, Mr Wisewood said the CFA would be ready.</p><p>\"A lot goes on in the background when we have those spike days,\" he said.</p><p>\"That's when state and [incident control centres] \u2026 start to hone down into smaller areas, smaller districts.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

the town battles to find recruits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mallacoota CFA first lieutenant Rod Lewis said there were about 24 volunteers in 2019-20, when he was captain.</p><p>But he said age had caught up with some volunteers, while few young people took up volunteering.</p><p>\"The ideology has changed,\" Mr Lewis said.</p><p>Current Mallacoota CFA Captain Tracey Johnston said: \"Maybe ask the township why no one is stepping up to volunteer at any of the emergency services in town - except Ambulance Victoria where their Ambulance Community Officers are paid a turnout fee as well as a training fee.\" </p><p>The shortfall means that while the Mallacoota brigade can respond to fires, it must rely on other, more distant brigades for support.</p><p>Just last week, Mr Lewis said the brigade was called out to a 20ha fire at Maramingo, which then required back-up from the NSW Rural Fire Service and Victorian government forest fire crew from Cann River, 60 kilometres away.</p><p>Right across the state the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/victoria/cfa-burnout-fails-to-recruit-and-retain-volunteer-firefighters/news-story/a8a391d9fddab771956d6f6ee6ff89c5\">CFA is struggling to retain and recruit volunteers</url>, with operational firefighter numbers dropping from 34,380 in June 2019 to 28,785 today.</p><p>In the meantime, bushfire conditions have rapidly worsened in Far East Gippsland and along the NSW South Coast.</p><p>The NSWRFS issued its <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/photo/?fbid=694110199428353&amp;set=a.291088386397205\">first catastrophic fire warning for the season </url>at 11am on Tuesday last week, after gusty north winds swept onto the coats and temperatures hit 34 degrees. </p><p>Conditions were exactly the same in Mallacoota, but the CFA issued no warnings and is yet to even impose fire restrictions.</p><p>Mallacoota resident and Howitt Society member Angie Cooper said she was so worried she \"hammered facebook (on Tuesday) to get people to be aware conditions were going to be atrocious\".</p><p>\"It's so wrong that our government and its emergency services agencies did not even bother to issue any warnings.\"</p><p>When asked why a catastrophic fire day was not called for Far East Gippsland CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said: \"Victoria's high-risk fire season typically begins a few weeks or months after New South Wales begins experiencing warmer conditions.</p><p>\"CFA works with partner emergency service agencies and the Bureau of Meteorology to determine when fire danger ratings will commence in Victoria and relies on continuous feedback from partner agencies, CFA brigades and districts about local conditions.</p><p>\"In East Gippsland, CFA is closely engaging with local members and will declare the start of the fire danger period within weeks.\"</p><p>It may be declared as early as October in some areas, and typically remains in place until the fire danger lessens, which could be as late as May.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Bureau of Meteorology data indicates soil-moisture levels are well below average in Victoria's south-west.</p><p>The Country Fire Authority's chief officer, Jason Heffernan, said the holiday hotspot of Aireys Inlet, Torquay and the region stretching back to Ballarat were among the areas of rising concern.</p><p>\"I'm keeping a really close eye on the Otways,\" he said. \"We are seeing drying in that area.\"</p><p>Other destinations, including Anglesea and Lorne, are also within the danger zone.</p><p>The authority is bracing for a hot and dry summer in the state's south-west. The Bureau of Meteorology has forecast a 65 per cent chance of below median rainfall from December to February. The El Nino weather pattern has increased the likelihood of a dry, hot summer.</p><p>Heffernan said grass fires would also present a risk across the state. \"That I can say for certain.\"</p><p>The CFA conducted 192 planned burns in 2022-23, compared with an average of about 200 each year. It carries out burns with private landholders, councils and water-management authorities.</p><p>Heffernan said the CFA would have enough people power to respond to outbreaks this summer, pointing to a total of about 52,000 volunteers, including 28,900 operational volunteers who are trained to attend fires.</p><p>Surf Coast Shire Mayor Liz Pattison said her municipality had a population of about 38,000, but that ballooned to about 100,000 during summer. She urged residents and holidaymakers to use the Vic Emergency smartphone app to keep updated about bushfires.</p><p>Last summer marked 40 years since the Ash Wednesday bushfires that brought devastation to Surf Coast towns, including Anglesea and Lorne. Since then, there have been major fires at Wye River and Separation Creek.</p><p>Pattison said the growing population meant more people were now living closer to fire-prone national parks. \"The townships along the coast have expanded significantly,\" she said. \"They're all within high-risk bushfire areas.\"</p><p>The CFA's warning about a risky summer comes after an early start to the bushfire season. Firefighters have spent weeks battling blazes at Loch Sport and Briagolong in Gippsland.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria has conducted 48 planned burns across the state since July 1, as well as slashing and mulching on public land. In the 2022/23 financial year, the agency carried out planned burns and mechanical treatments (including mulching and mowing) on more than 92,000 hectares of public land.</p><p>Hardman agreed south-west Victoria faced a serious risk this summer, but said crop fires were also a danger in the Wimmera and Mallee regions, where harvesting would soon get under way. He warned crop fires could be fast moving and inflict extensive damage. \"They can be scary on a bad day with strong wind,\" he said.</p><p>Melbourne University research fellow Hamish Clarke, who studies bushfires, said climate change was increasing the frequency and severity of natural disasters.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7smzlsz7qjr13u1yplrx</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69HV-FVY1-JD34-V1F7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"563\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Plans to redevelop an old barracks and an industrial site into \"luxury\" units and apartments have in both cases met with Chandler-Mather's fierce opposition.</p><p>At Tugulawa Park, his website details in glowing terms the installation of a new yet instantly \"much-loved\" community garden where an access road is planned for 855 new low- to medium-density riverfront homes.</p><p>\"I'm spending a lot of my time right now pushing the federal government to invest in public and affordable housing,\" Chandler-Mather states, before outlining his many objections to this specific proposal, which include concerns about flooding and traffic, as well as over that new road.</p><p>He wants the entire site purchased by the federal government for public parkland, community facilities and \"a small portion of affordable housing\".</p><p>Meanwhile, on the other side of his electorate, plans for the construction of two 26-story towers on what is currently an industrial site have also met with opposition, despite the 470 new homes contained therein. The plan, the Greens MP states, will create \"further congestion\" and \"misses a fantastic opportunity\" to use the site to instead expand the neighbouring park. Seriously. And Chandler-Mather insists it is Labor that doesn't get the scale of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/policy/economy/labor-s-pledge-to-build-1-million-homes-set-to-fail-20230410-p5cz9b\">housing emergency.</url></p><p>Like many an <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.afr.com/rear-window/falinski-channels-his-inner-nimby-20220228-p5a0bj\">inner-city MP before him</url>, Chandler-Mather claims he isn't opposed to development, just bad development made without compensating investment in supporting infrastructure.</p><p>Being a Green, Chandler-Mather is also iffy on commercial property developers and their creation of homes for the wealthy or middle-class.</p><p>The fact Greens voters in inner-city suburbs are usually wealthy or middle-class is no electoral issue at all because those with property portfolios can reason this through.

here how the fire impacted the forest, but to be up here in this environment and at these falls working with local contractors, it was more a kind of soothing thing,\" he said.</p><p>\"Something to get away from the stress of the fires and the work, the workload back at home, and with the communities.</p><p>\"Hopefully the community can come up here, see what this, reflect on what's here, what we have got, not about what's happened, but getting away from it.\"</p><h>Silver lining in fire funding</h><p>The bushfire recovery process\u00a0helped unleash a fresh stream of funding for tourism projects in the region that would have likely otherwise taken years to secure.</p><p>It's a small silver lining for residents\u00a0eager to see the region move forward.</p><p>Just a short drive away, the fires have unveiled previously obscured views of neighbouring snow-capped Mount Kosciuszko, allowing the new Walkers Lookout to be created.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria\u00a0officer Cameron McDonald\u00a0said the project was to\u00a0help get people back to the area.</p><p>The fires also destroyed popular High Country huts, including Wheelers Creek Hut, Gibsons-Pinnibar Hut and Ski Hut.</p><p>They had\u00a0been renovated only months before they were completely destroyed by the fires.</p><p>They have been rebuilt along with\u00a0new horse yards among\u00a0the charred trees.</p><p>The High Country projects are expected to have a positive flow-on effect for the communities in the valleys below.\u00a0</p><p>\"We are trying to create an area that people can come in to stay, there's things to see while they are here, and then into Corryong and shop locally and support the locals to get back on their feet,\" Mr McDonald said.\u00a0</p><p>With the Upper Murray Region receiving an average of more than 210,000 domestic visitors annually, the local community is hoping that those numbers will grow.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Each view about 180 degrees and those images are stitched together so you have an unimpeded view,\" he said.</p><p>The system also requires a \"human in the loop\", with the AI at times struggling to differentiate smoke from clouds or dust.</p><p>\"The last thing we want is just too many notifications. People will stop paying attention,\" Mr Walsh said.</p><p>\"It [the feed] goes through a person, and they review it and will say, 'Yes, it is a fire' and then we will be alerted to that, or they'll say, 'No, false alarm'.</p><p>\"The camera has a 30x optical zoom on it, so they [a human operator] can take over the camera and zoom in and determine what it is.\"</p><h>Timber production under threat</h><p>Australian National University professor David Lindenmayer said AI was needed to prevent Australia losing more of its valuable forests.</p><p>His team was part of an international study that found up to 35 million hectares of timber-producing forests were lost to fires in the 20 years up to 2021, putting global timber production under significant threat.</p><p>It also found Australia was among the worst-affected nations.</p><p>\"What that means is by proportion, Australia is losing more of its wood-production forest to extreme or high-severity wildfire than any other place on the planet, except Portugal,\" Professor Lindenmayer said.</p><p>\"We need to start to embrace new technologies to be able to detect fires much more, and be able to suppress those fires much more quickly.</p><p>\"Not only drones, not only AI, but also things like lightning-strike modelling, because we know that there are parts of landscapes that are much more susceptible to ignitions from dry lightning.</p><p>\"But also to use our new insights into the flammability of vegetation to understand where there's ignition places that are likely to start high-severity wildfires.\"</p><h>Citizen science has a role</h><p>Assessing forest fuel loads in a nation as vast as Australia is a major challenge, which is where researchers hope the public can combine with AI to play a role.</p><p>Researchers at Adelaide University and the University of the Sunshine Coast have developed a mobile phone app that scans user-submitted photos to predict forest fire risk.</p><p>Adelaide University professor Javen Shi said AI scanned images, uploaded to the NOBURN app, for bushfire hazards, in the way human experts would do in the field to estimate the severity and possible spread of a potential bushfire.</p><p>\"Our AI can estimate the fuel load distributed around Australia, so authorities would know which part may have accumulated higher risk, so they may need to do some backburning or other activities,\" Professor Shi said.</p><p>AI could also be used to provide a risk analysis of areas too remote or dangerous for people to explore.</p><p>\"[The] more people could take photos, that would be better, but we also understand not every park is safe for everyone to go, and that's where smart AI can come in,\" Professor Shi said.</p><p>\"Causal AI can see a million problems as one problem. In those parks or forests where you don't have enough data, you learn the pattern from many other different data sets. It's kind of like what ChatGPT was doing.\"</p><p>Professor Shi hopes the app will also spark greater public interest in the potential for AI to help predict and prevent bushfires, as well as better allocating firefighting resources.</p><p>\"Authorities, experts and citizens \u2014 they don't know enough about the potential of AI to help in fighting bushfires,\" he said.</p><p>\"This app is just the beginning.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCRIN-103277424</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCRLN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B2X-BVJ1-JBN5-F550-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473528</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"772\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Rural News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37476\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Science and Technology:Computer Science:Artificial Intelligence</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters, Accidents and Emergency Incidents:Disasters and Hazards:Fires:Bushfires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Rural:Forestry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment:Forests</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia:SA:Mount Gambier</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia:SA:Adelaide</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Wombat Forestcare convener Gayle Osborne said legal action was being taken because VicForests had failed to adequately survey the site for threatened species.</p><p>However, Ms Osborne refused to make further comment until she had spoken to her barrister.</p><p>Meanwhile, Mr Kirby said \"we're all just banging our heads against a brick wall\", with no support from the Andrews government\".</p><p>Prof Tolhurst said it would take 40 to 50 years for the fallen timber to break down.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardman said \"record rain over the past two years has provided challenges to safely clear storm fallen timber in Wombat Forest\". \" Editorial, Page 22</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-7e7b2098505d11eea772b83752a5b095199d1f764b357fd5113d762a913a9bfe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:695B-3161-JD3N-50D4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"438\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 13, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;
