You should leave using the Ararat Halls Gap Road and head towards Ararat. When you leave remember to take your pets, medications, mobile phone and charger. In the car:</p><p>If you are travelling, do not enter the area. Make a u-turn and travel to safety. Slow down and turn on your headlights. Smoke will make it difficult to see. If you are unable to leave you should shelter indoors:</p><p>Close all exterior doors, windows and vents. Turn off cooling systems. You must take shelter before the fire arrives. The extreme heat is likely to kill you well before the flames reach you. Shelter in a room that has two exits, such as a door or window including one directly to the outside. It is important to be able to see outside so you know what is happening with the fire. If your home catches on fire and the conditions inside become unbearable, you need to get out and go to an area that has already been burnt. If you cannot get indoors, other last resort options include:</p><p>Shelter in the middle of a large open area like a ploughed paddock, football oval or sporting reserve. Get into a large body of water like a dam, lake, river, the ocean or inground pool. Try to protect yourself from the fire's heat. If you are caught in fire in your car:</p><p>Park behind a solid structure to block the fire's heat or pull over to cleared area. Try to position the car towards the approaching fire. Turn on your hazard lights and headlights. Close all windows. Turn off the air-conditioning and shut all the air vents. Turn your car engine off. Get down as low as possible below window level and cover up with a pure woollen blanket. Impacts in your area:</p><p>Trees can be extremely hazardous during a bushfire or high winds. Avoid standing, parking or travelling in areas of fire affected trees. Bushfires can generate extreme heat. Heat will kill you before the fire reaches you. Earlier: Emergency services are advising residents of several Grampians townships to leave now before conditions worsen.</p><p>A 'Watch and Act' message was issued for Bellfield, Bellfield Settlement, Halls Gap, Lake Fyans, Pomonal.</p><p>There is a bushfire at Grampians National Park, Bellfield that is not yet under control. The bushfire is travelling in a southerly direction from the Terraces Fire Line, near Lake Bellfield in the Grampians National Park. A wind change is expected around 2:pm, which may cause the fire to change directions towards Pomonal and surrounding communities. Conditions can become very dangerous and unpredictable. \"Don't wait, leaving now is the safest option - conditions may change and get worse very quickly,\" the statement said.</p><p>\"Emergency services may not be able to help you if you decide to stay.\"</p><p>Tuesday, February 13, is a Total Fire Ban for the Wimmera, Mallee and Northern Country fire weather districts; the Wimmera is rated as Catastrophic.</p><p>A Catastrophic Fire Danger Rating means conditions will be the most dangerous for a fire under the new Australian Fire Danger Rating System.</p><p>What you should do:</p><p>Monitor changes to the situation. Increased wind speed, change in wind direction, smoke or poor visibility can indicate the situation is changing. Protect yourself and your family. If you are away from home, do not return. If the situation changes or you feel unsafe you should leave:</p><p>Take your pets, medications, mobile phone and charger. Many people have died trying to leave at the last minute during fires. Travel to the home of family or friends that are away from the warning area or Stawell or Ararat. Impacts in your area:</p><p>Bushfires can spread quickly and are extremely dangerous. Bushfires can generate enormous amounts of radiant heat. Heat will kill you before the fire reaches you. Bushfires can start spot fires and embers can travel large distances ahead of the main fire. Trees can be extremely hazardous during a bushfire or high winds. Avoid standing, parking or travelling in areas of fire affected trees.

are calling on WA's\u00a0environment minister to urgently review prescribed burning practices by the Department of Biodiversity, Conservation and Attractions (DBCA) after a fire it lit escaped containment lines.</p><p>The fire burnt more than 25,000 hectares of wilderness forest near Walpole on WA's south coast \u2014 with the burn only prescribed for 15,000 hectares.</p><p>DBCA took almost two weeks to extinguish the fire, which was lit in late November.</p><p>Walpole Nornalup National Park Association's\u00a0David Edmonds said the prescribed burn area was already considered\u00a0very large.</p><p>\"[15,000 hectares]\u00a0is pretty hefty for an area that's meant to be the biodiversity pinnacle for the Walpole wilderness,\" Dr Edmonds said.</p><p>\"From there [the fire]\u00a0went down into another 10,000 hectares, which was also high quality environment.\"</p><p>Prescribed burns are intended to reduce the severity of bushfires and to help protect lives, property, and biodiversity.</p><p>The Walpole forest is a designated wilderness area because of its remoteness, natural aesthetic, and biodiversity importance, being home to the largest quokka population in the world.</p><p>This burn was aimed at protecting the habitat from wildfire during the upcoming bushfire season.</p><p>\"It's actually almost done the exact opposite \u2014 it's burnt under really hot conditions, and a much bigger area than was originally planned,\" Dr Edmonds\u00a0said.</p><p>A DBCA spokesperson said the department had followed all protocols for prescribed burning.</p><p>\"A comprehensive plan was prepared that met international risk management standards,\" they said.</p><p>\"DBCA is reviewing the incident in consultation with the Department of Fire and Emergency Services, with lessons learnt to be incorporated into future operations.</p><p>\"DBCA continues to liaise and engage openly with all of its stakeholders around prescribed burning at state, regional and local level.\"</p><p>There was an out-of-control\u00a0burn by the\u00a0Department of Environment and Conservation in the same region in 2009.</p><p>That blaze burnt 10,000 hectares instead of the prescribed\u00a03,000 as containment efforts failed.</p><h>Local knowledge critical</h><p>Dr Edmonds, alongside other conservation scientists, has been calling for an independent review into prescribed burns for several years.</p><p>Forest pathologist Joanna Young urged the environment minister to act on getting independent assessments of DBCA's performance regarding nature conservation.</p><p>\"The department can't review itself because they can't admit [if] they've made a mistake,\"\u00a0Dr Young said.</p><p>\"You've got a big department, a big bureaucracy, blanket prescriptions, and blanket prescriptions are bad for biodiversity \u2014 it just doesn't work.</p><p>\"You have to feed into local knowledge, and modify your prescriptions for local conditions, otherwise you're not going to maintain biodiversity.\"</p><p>UWA Professor of Biodiversity\u00a0Stephen Hopper said he was\u00a0devastated about the recent burn.</p><p>\"I think the way forward is to have a sensible broad-based community discussion about protecting biodiversity in the Walpole wilderness that involves management authorities like DBCA,\" Dr Hopper\u00a0said.</p><p>\"In planning a fire you need to take advantage of contemporary knowledge systems.</p><p>\"It's about 20 years since a significant review of burning regimes was undertaken that involved people inside and outside the department.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I see the way the constant thinking about how to juggle expenses keeps us on edge. It's not good for us mentally, physically or spiritually.</p><p>Indeed, recent research from The Salvos shows that people's mental health is the top concern for 73 per cent of our clients.

This means less opportunities to lower bushfire risk through planned burning and other measures.</p><p>Despite the fire activity we have already seen in spring, our bushfire risk management program will continue where conditions are suitable and it is safe to do so.</p><p>Victoria will always have bushfires, but we want our communities to know that we are ready to respond with close to 1800 FFMVic personnel on the frontline this season.</p><p>They are part of the Department of Energy, Environment and Climate Action's 3000 personnel who perform a fire or emergency role, which include around 1200 personnel with accreditation in incident management.</p><p>Our firefighting equipment includes more than 500 ultralight tankers, around 100 heavy tankers, as well as more than 300 additional plant and trucks.</p><p>Ground operations are also supported by Victoria's aerial fleet of 51 aircraft contracted for the 2023-24 summer season.

I spent the next six months travelling across the state and fighting fires,\" he said.</p><p>Once a fire is called in and a broadcast goes out to all the local RFS units, firefighters will choose whether or not to go on a fire.</p><p>Mr Russell said volunteers could choose to go, but it depended on how many people had elected to go.</p><p>\"Usually the roll-out time for firies from the moment of activation can be under 12 minutes,\" he said.</p><p>Many volunteers are 9 to 5 workers within the local community.</p><p>Mr Russell said that when it came to a call, it could almost be a push-pull situation.</p><p>\"A lot of employers would prefer their employees to stay and work, but during a natural disaster, when a 'Section 44' is declared, an employer cannot hold their employee back and has to let them go.\"</p><p>The hardest part of the job is not battling the blaze; it is managing the adrenaline rush when on a fireground.</p><p>\"Adrealine is the number one thing you get,\" Mr Russell said.</p><p>\"When you see what you are getting called to, it could be a structure fire, someone trapped, or a grassfire or bushfire you get used to it.</p><p>\"You've got to learn how to control the adreadaline, as it can sometimes take over. You learn how to adapt and relax.</p><p>\"So, when we hop in the truck, we try to remain calm and keep those lines of communication open.\"</p><p>The RFS, however, is more than just firefighters. It is also the volunteers who are on the phones at the control centre.</p><p>\"You could also do catering, there are roles in the support brigade, there are options to work around aircraft, and so much more,\" Mr Russell said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HVNCTL-doc7tigh00za8g1jfkb5ael</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HVNCTL2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B0W-DP81-JD34-V1KJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">436970</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"432\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hunter Valley &amp; North Coast Town and Country Leader</publicationName><edition>Internet Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"01\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>January 2, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Severe weather</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001811</classCode><className>VOLUNTEERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000512</classCode><className>DISMISSALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Like Smythesdale, residents were seen helping others in getting animals to safety.</p><p>Ms Paxton said she was grateful for the community helping each other out and also thanked the Ballarat community for offering floats to help take horses to safety.</p><p>\"I only got about two hours (sleep), on and off,\" she said.</p><p>\"There were CFA trucks coming from places I've never heard of.\"</p><p>Ms Paxton also praised the CFA and local volunteers for their tireless work, which likely saved houses.</p><p>\"The CFA guys and girls were incredible,\" she said.</p><p>\"They just made sure people were safe.\"</p><p>The pair said they had also heard reports of flames jumping from the tops of trees.</p><p>The warnings were eventually downgraded to Advice messages in the early hours of Wednesday morning, however the blaze was still not under control.</p><p>Firefighting efforts continued into Wednesday, with aerial waterbombers continuing to dump water on the fireground.</p><p>On Wednesday morning, CFA Incident Controller Stephen Walls said the fire had burnt just less than 500 hectares, and cooler and less windy conditions helped in the fight, but efforts would likely continue into today.</p><p>\"I have to say it's not moving very quickly,\" Mr Walls said. \"The community might see some increased smoke on occasions from the fire but there would be no cause for concern if they do.\"</p><p>As of Wednesday morning, Mr Walls said there was no significant property damage.</p><p>A formal investigation into the cause was due to be conducted on Wednesday.</p><p>\"I'd just like to thank the firefighters who worked (on Tuesday) under trying conditions and into (Tuesday night),\" Mr Walls said. \"There were a lot of people from Forest Fire Management Victoria and the CFA who clocked on (Tuesday morning) and didn't clock off until (Wednesday morning).\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BALCOU-doc7u52ubgp1h48j1qe7vg</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BALCOU2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BB8-73Y1-F0J6-J266-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385903</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"651\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Community Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 15, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>META PLATFORMS INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS516210 MEDIA STREAMING DIST SVCS, SOCIAL NETWORKS, AND OTHER MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONTENT PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>SIC7374 COMPUTER PROCESSING &amp;

south-eastern Australia has stretched into a third day, making it Victoria's worst run of autumn hot weather in 80 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Bureau of Meteorology (BOM) said temperatures were expected to reach the mid to high 30s in every Victorian district except the Alps on Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By 3pm, Port Fairy in the state's south-west had reached temperatures above 40 degrees while nearby Warrnambool recorded 39.5 degrees.</p><p>It was slightly cooler in Melbourne with temperatures sitting around 35 degrees.\u00a0</p><p>Conditions in Victoria over the last three days have been 10 to 16 degrees Celsius above the March average and a heatwave warning remains in place for most of the state.</p><p>Heatwave warnings are also in place for parts of Tasmania and South Australia.</p><p>Senior meteorologist with the BOM, Sarah Scully, said Victoria had not seen three consecutive days of autumn temperatures in the high 30s since 1942.\u00a0</p><p>\"Melbourne's had a number of March overnight minimum temperature records broken and there's also been some maximum temperature [records],\" she told ABC News Breakfast.</p><p>\"There's a really strong and stubborn high pressure system in the Tasman Sea that directs hot, northerly winds over south-eastern Australia and these blocking high pressure systems also prevent cold fronts from being able to sweep across those southern parts of the country and flush away the heat.\"</p><p>A southerly change is expected to sweep through southern parts of Victoria early Tuesday morning.</p><h>'Extreme event' brings hot nights for Tasmania and SA</h><p>In Hobart, overnight temperatures fluctuated between 25 and 27 degrees.</p><p>The average minimum temperature for Hobart in March is 11 degrees.</p><p>\"Most of the night [was] well above 17 degrees, [which is] quite an extreme event,\" the BOM's Michael Conway said.</p><p>\"It will be one of the hottest nights we would have had in terms of minimum temperatures.\"</p><p>Tasmanians were bracing for Monday to be another warm day \u2014 with about 31 degrees forecast in Launceston and 27 in Hobart.</p><p>Temperatures fell short of hitting those highs, with Launceston reaching just 29 degrees and about 22 degrees in Hobart by the late afternoon.\u00a0</p><p>A high-pressure ridge will bring a cold front over the state throughout the week, leading to cooler conditions, but no rain.</p><p>BOM records show <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-11/adelaide-south-australia-heatwave-mad-march/103571616\">Adelaide has experienced three consecutive overnight temperatures of over 25 degrees</url>, as Adelaide's open-air Mad March festival has been underway.</p><p>The SA Ambulance Services responded to at least 50 heat-related call-outs during the weekend.</p><p>Total fire bans with extreme fire danger are in place for six districts in South Australia on Monday.</p><h>Victorian music festival cancelled amid extreme heat</h><p>An Extreme Fire Danger warning and total fire ban is in place for the South West district of Victoria</p><p>Chief fire officer with Forest Fire Management Victoria, Chris Hardman, said Monday's conditions would be challenging.</p><p>He said organisers of the Pitch Festival, near Moyston, made the right call to cancel the remainder of the event considering the conditions and fire danger.</p><p>\"When we have these heatwave events associated with music festivals, dance parties or other events, they can lead to high-risk situations that people can find themselves in,\" he told ABC News Breakfast.</p><p>\"I'm really pleased that in those areas where we have a total fire ban that those events have been cancelled.\"</p><p>Tanya Smith's two sons attended the Pitch Festival until it was cancelled, but she said it should not have gone ahead.</p><p>\"It's not about how well it's run, we knew that the weather conditions were going to be like this, the fact that it's been cancelled is of no surprise to anyone, it was always going to happen,\" she told ABC Radio Melbourne.</p><p>\"It just seems like madness to me that this was allowed to go ahead.\"</p><p>A 23-year-old man died at the Alfred Hospital after being flown from the area in a critical condition early on Sunday morning.</p><p>Two other men, aged in their 20s and 30s, were taken to local hospitals after attending the festival \u2014 Ambulance Victoria said all three incidents involved suspected substance abuse.</p><h>No Moomba parade this year</h><p>The parade at Melbourne's Moomba Parade was also cancelled to protect the health of performers, spectators and workers during Monday's extreme heat.</p><p>Other parts of the festival, including activities on the Yarra River will go ahead.</p><p>Lord Mayor Sally Capp said it was a difficult decision to cancel the parade.</p><p>\"Absolutely devastating, so many people are frankly gutted, including the City of Melbourne team that work for a year to prepare for this event\u00a0and knowing that the parade is really the jewel in the crown. It was just not possible,\" she told ABC Radio Melbourne.</p><p>Ms Capp said crowds at the Moomba Festival were down around 25 per cent on previous years.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-103571296</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BHP-FNT1-JBN5-F548-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"791\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 11, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>CC0005FT7</classCode><className>VICTORIA SA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>CC0009S08</classCode><className>SA AMBULANCE SERVICE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC000DRDR</classCode><className>SEA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>NAICS325510 PAINT &amp;

recruitment to fight fires as part of a home affairs review of Australia's personnel and equipment capacity to respond to natural disasters.</p><p>However, Emergency Management Minister Murray Watt said while calling on the defence forces would become a \"last resort rather than first port of call\", the government \"wouldn't want to commit to obliging people\" to volunteer. </p><p>A semi-professional model that pays personnel for services through a fire season to build firefighting capability is also on the table.</p><p>The news follows Victoria's CFA last week launching a recruitment drive as the number of volunteers continues to fall.</p><p>The Australasian Fire Authorities Council recently urged Australians to prepare for the  since the 'black summer' of 2019-20 due to predicted heatwaves, decreased rainfall and high fuel loads. </p><p>Mr Watt also told The ABC the nation is \"much better prepared\" for the coming fire season than heading into 2019-20, despite Regional Development Minister and Eden-Monaro MP Kristy McBain saying land management had \"not progressed substantially\". </p><p>Meanwhile, a catastrophic fire warning was raised last week on the New South Wales south coast.</p><p>The NSW Rural Fire Service have confirmed that since July 1 40,000 hectares, or 13 per cent of its planned target of 300,000ha of hazard reduction burns for 2023-24, had been completed.</p><p>Meanwhile, Victoria has used a \"risk-based\" approach to fuel management, rather than a hectare-based target, since 2016.</p><p>Victoria Forest Fire Management Victoria Chief Fire Officer Chris Hardman said this allowed for a focus on areas \"with the greatest impact to minimise bushfire risk\" for communities and the environment.</p><p>Since July 1, 40 planned burns, along with slashing and mulching, have been conducted across Victoria, including near Toolangi, Casterton, Giffard, Buchan, Orbost, Portland, Shelly and the Grampians National Park.</p><p>In the coming weeks more are scheduled for East Gippsland and across Loddon Mallee, identified as key risk areas by in the AFAC report.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

During spring, fuels were consistently wet with flooding in large parts of the region,\" the report states. </p><p>But FFM Victoria's records show the rise in the Port Phillip zone's residual risk has been building for 15 years, from 39 per cent in the wake of 2009 Black Saturday fires, which consumed much of the fuel, to 85 per cent by mid-2021.</p><p>In 2009, a Victorian Bushfire Royal Commission recommended the state set an annual fuel reduction target of 390,000ha, which the then Brumby Labor and then Liberal-Nationals Coalition governments accepted.</p><p>However the Andrews-Allan government abandoned hectare-based targets in 2015, opting for a computer modelled measure of residual risk, which compared the damage a fire would inflict with no fuel load management versus what past wildfires and controlled burns had achieved.</p><p>The government then set a residual risk target for the Port Phillip zone of 80 per cent, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/fuel-loads-soar-as-andrews-government-plays-with-numbers/news-story/10fec748cb3b8096b8999b2747bf9ba7\">but consequently redrew the boundary and lifted the target to 85 per cent in 2019</url>, as it struggled to manage rising fuel loads.</p><p>The residual risk model was developed by the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/top-bushfire-scientist-kevin-tolhurst-dies/news-story/cd6361a7dbcea023371e9c1eef301bbe\">late University of Melbourne bushfire researcher Kevin Tolhurst</url>, who prior to his death warned setting the 85 per cent target \"had more to do with what FFM Vic thought was achievable, rather than what was desirable or acceptable\".</p><p>FFM Vic has responded to the rising risk in the Port Phillip zone by committing to:</p><p>PLANNING and preparing additional burns to take advantage of conditions when they are favourable. </p><p>PRIORITISING areas for fuel management treatments based on what will bring about the greatest reduction in regional risk (close to housing).</p><p>REVIEWING existing fuel management nominations to take account for recent shifts in fuel hazard and the resultant risk after the (past) La Nina conditions.</p><p>NOMINATING fuel management treatments that will complement fuel management treatments being delivered in

nitf:lede=\"true\">Properties in the state's North West have been under siege by an out-of-control bushfire that has burnt through more than 121,000 hectares, after a fire-generated thunderstorm caused the blaze to double in size.</p><p>Burning within an area within 17 kilometres south of Narrabri, 20km west of Boggabri and 40km north-east of Coonabarabran, the Duck Creek Pilliga Forest fire has caused havoc for more than 12 days.</p><p>As of Tuesday evening, the NSW Rural Fire Service downgraded the fire to an advice level following significant amounts of rainfall across the fire-ground.</p><p>While the rain brought some welcomed relief, on Wednesday morning, NSWRFSNarrabri control centre public information officer, Allan McCartney, said the fire remained uncontained.</p><p>\"We had an average of 20 millimetres of rain overnight on the fire-ground which is certainly not enough to put it out, but it has quietened the fire's activity,\" he said.</p><p>\"While there are areas in the south that have taken a run, there is still some unburnt country in between that which has got the potential for erratic fire behaviour when the rain stops and it dries out.</p><p>\"We don't have any detail on livestock losses at the moment, and we don't have a figure on property damage yet, but we have no reported house losses.\"</p><p>Bureau of Meteorology meteorologist Jiwon Park said wet weather conditions and cooler temperatures were expected for the midweek.</p><p>\"Starting from Tuesday we expect thunderstorms in the Narrabri area, it could be hit and miss, but it could also have the potential to bring localised heavy falls,\" he said.</p><p>\"The main activity of rainfall is expected on Tuesday through to Thursday with the peak on Wednesday, however, any rainfall (of more than) 5mm will be useful for the firefighting efforts.</p><p>\"We also expect the temperature to drop 10 degrees to somewhere between 24 to 27 degrees during the midweek period before it rises again towards the end of the week.\"</p><p>Residents in the Baan Baa, Willala, Goolhi, Rocky Glen, Stannix Park, Jacks Creek, Bohena Creek and Wynella area remain on alert as burning embers, changes in wind direction and smoke continued, as The Land went to press.</p><p>In the Jacks Creek area, 30km south of Narrabri, local sheep producer Nic Hann said her

The 2019/ 20 Gospers Mountain Fire grew to be the largest bushfire in the world that was caused by a single lightning strike and lasted over 79 days, despite the enormous amount of resources deployed. It is important to note that there were many tremendous efforts made across SE Australia during the 2019/ 20 bushfires by fire fighters (including brigades, private landowners and other citizens) and support personnel across firegrounds.</p><p>In relation to the 2019/ 20 major bushfires, it is the author's opinion (and many others) that there has been inadequate listening to many communities and active and retired experienced land and fire managers in relation to bushfire management and mitigation concerns raised during and after the bushfires. Many submissions and concerns to improve bushfire management and mitigation have been missed, or worse, ignored. This matter is well explained in the valuable document <url normalizedValue=\"https://quadrant.org.au/opinion/doomed-planet/2020/11/the-flaming-idiocy-of-yet-another-bushfire-panel/\">\u201cThe Utter Failure of Yet Another Bushfire Panel\u201d by Roger Underwood</url>.</p><p>It is important to identify and consider all of the contributory factors that influenced the fuels, forest fire resilience, bushfire attack, safety, impact, cost, bushfire extent and intensity in relation to the 2019/ 20 bushfires across south eastern Australia, of the order of 7.5 million hectares burnt.</p><p>This contributory factor assessment is the authors own individual assessment, in many cases own opinion/ judgement from the information at hand and has been documented using a bushfire contributory factor checklist; discussions with bushfire fighters/ retired fire fighters/ farmers; review of a number of key submissions to the Royal Commission into National Natural Disaster Arrangements; review of a number of bushfire science papers; bushfire articles and other bushfire information.

The author has prepared this document in good faith, was focussed on assessing the key issues in detail and accepts he may not have identified all issues, noting it was a time-consuming task. It is essential for Australia that contributory factors that influenced fuels, forest fire resilience, bushfire attack, safety, impact, cost, bushfire extent and intensity of the 2019/ 2020 major bushfires across south eastern Australia are identified.</p><p>Considering all the contributing factors in <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/John-ODonnell-Annexure-1.-The-Listed-contributory-factors-in-relation-to-the-2019-20-bushfires.pdf\">Annexure 1</url>, the author considers that the devastating 2019-20 fires were inevitable under difficult bushfire conditions at the time.</p><p>The author is not the only one who has identified risks and deficiencies in fire management.\u00a0 As noted in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00049158.2020.1769899\">Davey and Sarre (2020)</url>:</p><p>\"The Black Summer bushfires are a watershed for how Australia must manage fire risks in its landscapes and to be better prepared for such fires. The fires of 2019/20 have shown that current fire management will not, or is unlikely to, sustain the full range of ecosystem processes and biodiversity, nor reduce to an acceptable level the impact of wildfires on local and rural communities, forests and ecological communities, biodiversity and wood resources. Finding sustainable, affordable and socially acceptable approaches to managing fire requires a cohesive, considered, evidence-based approach across jurisdictions and tenure.\"</p><p>Considering the above, the author believes that we as a society have not adequately achieved management of fire risks in our landscapes and are not better prepared for such fires since the 2019/ 20 bushfires, especially noting the limited prescribed burning, current heavy fuel loads, dense regrowth, large areas of dead trees and noting the recent release of NSW areas of bushfire fire concern outlook for spring and summer 2023 covering the majority of the state.</p><p>Nolan et al. (2021) in their paper <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mdpi.com/2571-6255/4/4/97\">\u201cWhat Do the Australian Black Summer Fires Signify for the Global Fire Crisis?\u201d</url>ask a critical question \u201cIs Australia Better Equipped for a Future of Extreme Fire Seasons?\u201d and their response is:</p><p>\"While governmental inquiries produced broad-ranging recommendations, we argue that they have not resulted in a fundamental shift in the way in which fire will be managed in the future. Overwhelmingly, they reinforce the status quo of a centralised and technology focussed approach to the mitigation of risk, with greater strategic nuance and an expanded role for national level co-ordination. While technological solutions can provide important support for fire management, the implementation of technological solutions may also lead to perverse outcomes if not implemented thoughtfully.\"</p><p>This author agrees with the Nolan et al. findings above, especially in regards to \u201cthey have not resulted in a fundamental shift in the way in which fire will be managed in the future\u201d.  Limited state prescribed burning data over the last five years supports this view.</p><p>The 2019/ 20 bushfire contributory factors in <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/John-ODonnell-Annexure-1.-The-Listed-contributory-factors-in-relation-to-the-2019-20-bushfires.pdf\">Annexure 1</url> provide a base allowing consideration of opportunity areas and exploring ideas and innovation, including in relation to the establishment of safe, healthy and resilient landscapes, importantly reducing bushfire extent and intensity, and improving community safety, fire fighter safety and native fauna habitat safety.\u00a0</p><p>Considering the contributory factors in relation to safety alone, including community, fire fighter safety, infrastructure and environmental safety, these identified factors are of the utmost importance and hopefully this document has identified they key issues that need urgent actioning. Discussions in communities and amongst fire fighters may be useful in further progressing these issues with government.</p><p>It is essential to consider and address identified contributory factors, noting that if we as a society don\u2019t actively identify, consider and effectively address the contributory factors that influenced the fuels, fire resilience, bushfire attack, safety, bushfire extent and intensity of the 2019/ 20 major bushfires across south eastern Australia and action associated opportunities, Australia will continue to have more of the same disastrous bushfires, impacting on communities, fire fighters, infrastructure, flora, fauna and the environment.</p><p>Actioning contributory factors is all the more important as Australia has now entered a drier period, considering the lack of progress on addressing important contributory factors, considering low rates of prescribed burning and also considering in many cases the complacency in regards to bushfire mitigation management.\u00a0 A cooperative spirit is required to pull this all together.</p><p>An <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/environment/weather/widespread-fire-concern-for-majority-of-state-after-years-of-heavy-rain-20230719-p5dpjv.html\">important map prepared by RFS in July 2023</url> highlights the current areas of fire concern covering of the order of 3/ 4 of NSW of the greatest concern ahead of the looming fire season, noting that these areas have had significant growth due to three years of heavy rain, and will dry out quite rapidly if there is hot and windy weather and hampered hazard reduction mitigation efforts.</p><p>In this article RFS Commissioner Rob Rogers also raises important preparation issues:</p><p>\u201cWe ask people not to be complacent just because there have been some quiet times. People need to do simple things: clean out their gutters and get their bushfire survival plan ready.\u201d</p><p>The Bushfire Front document <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bushfirefront.org.au/about-us/a-blueprint-for-effective-fire-management/\">A Blueprint For Effective Fire Management</url> outlines many opportunities to rectify a number of the contributory factors.</p><p>There are opportunities for bushfire fighters and land managers to use the contributory factor tables as checklists to assist in identifying local area, district, regional, state and national bushfire opportunities.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/John-ODonnell-Annexure-1.-The-Listed-contributory-factors-in-relation-to-the-2019-20-bushfires.pdf\">Annexure 1.

It is too late to leave,\" was the information given to residents in the immediate warning area on VicEmergency.</p><p>\"The safest option is to take shelter indoors immediately.\"</p><p>The fire was around 100 hectares in size and moving in a northerly direction in a canola crop, a CFA spokesperson said.</p><p>A total of 25 tankers from CFA and Forest Fire Management Victoria were battling the blaze. Emergency services air craft had also been dispatched.</p><p>What you should do if you are in the danger zone:</p><p>Quickly move indoors:</p><p>Bring your pets indoors. Close all exterior doors, windows and vents. Turn off cooling systems. You must take shelter before the fire arrives. The extreme heat is likely to harm you well before the flames reach you. Shelter in a room that has two exits, such as a door or window, including one directly to the outside. It is important to be able to see outside so you know what is happening with the fire. If your home catches on fire and the conditions inside become unbearable, you need to get out and go to an area that has already been burnt. If you cannot get indoors, last resort options include:</p><p>Shelter in the middle of a large open area like a ploughed paddock, football oval or sporting reserve. Get into a large body of water like a dam, lake, river, the ocean or in-ground pool. Try to protect yourself from the fire's heat. In the car:</p><p>If you are travelling, do not enter the warning area. Make a u-turn and travel to safety. If you are currently driving slow down and turn on your headlights; smoke will make it difficult to see. If caught in fire:</p><p>Park behind a solid structure to block the fire's heat or pull over to cleared area. Try to position the car towards the approaching fire. Turn on your hazard lights and headlights. Close all windows. Turn off the air-conditioning and shut all the air vents. Turn your car engine off. Get down as low as possible below window level and cover up with a woollen blanket.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BENADV-doc7sxe5l69fa1rrab9fxn</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BENADV2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69P4-M5N1-F0J6-J088-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385915</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Bendigo Advertiser</publicationName><edition>Internet Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 22, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disaster management</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accident</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>N111120MM</classCode><className>OILSEED FARMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Some 225 people, mostly tourists and campers, were evacuated by boat to a nearby fishing village and then taken by bus to makeshift shelters in the town of Martigues. \"We are braced for a difficult fight throughout the night,\" said a spokesman for the firefighting service in the Bouches du Rhone department. The fire broke out in the afternoon, sending out plumes of black smoke. It crossed eight kilometres in two hours, fanned by strong winds, the firefighting service said.Seven water-dumping planes and a number of helicopters and other aircraft were deployed to back up 1,200 firefighters, officials said. \"We were in Martigues for shopping but now we cannot enter our home in La Couronne. All the roads have been cut off and the fire's burning everywhere,\" said Mylene Greffeuille. \"We're very worried because my father is old and he is La Couronne,\" near the fire, she said. Part of a highway from Marseille to Martigues has been closed. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857159658955589025876100224</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60HH-9MC1-F03R-N4RS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"229\"/><timeReceived>1:05 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>August 5, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Watercraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0MxQzI5MEYyM0MwNEM0N0I2NEZEOTg3QUJGN0U0RUU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjkyMjE3M0YxQTQ1NEU2MzgxNTdFRDYzRjBFN0Q4MDU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Rotorcraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI1Rjc4RTRCNEEyNEFEMjlCMTVGODg5OTg3NTZFQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEyRTREQTdBRjkzNDE5OTk4ODAzMEY5MDkzRjlGRTE</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Smoking</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NUY4NDAyOEI0MkJGNDJGQTg5MTAwMTMzNjVBNjA4NkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QkIzQUQyQzBFMEQyNDUwNThDRDhERDY2QjdDMzREOTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMKX</classCode><className>BUSINESS REPORTS &amp; FORECASTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D170</classCode><className>BOMBINGS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D7JM</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS0008X36</classCode><className>PROVENCE-ALPES-COTE D'AZUR, FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I'm asking those questions quite often these days.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When footage of P. Diddy Combs assaulting his then girlfriend Cassie Ventura played on TV screens around the world, many networks chose not to broadcast the more graphic images of the rapper kicking her as she lay on the floor of the hotel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Likewise, footage of a greyhound writhing in agony after a fall on the Wentworth Park dog track a couple of weeks ago was blurred out to spare viewers the discomfort of seeing what had actually happened.</p><p>And from Gaza most recently, we were spared from seeing the most graphic images of the immediate aftermath of the Israeli airstrike that burned and dismembered dozens of Palestinians who'd sought refuge in tents.</p><p>I can't help wondering if santising the injustices captured by cameras deadens us to wrongdoing. I remember a moment from my school days watching a film about World War II when for the first time I saw grainy black and white images of concentration camp victims being bulldozed into a pit.</p><p>There was no trigger warning from the teacher. The class of 25 boys fell totally silent, the room filled only with the whirr of the Bell &amp; Howell projector and the plummy narration. It was a profound moment for all of us.</p><p>Part of my childhood innocence died in that classroom. At the same time I was awoken to the industrial scale of evil that operated just 15 years before I was born. Seared into memory, it was a stark and necessary lesson about the cruelty humans inflict on each other. And a reminder of my own good fortune.</p><p>Contemporary news reporting would likely blur those images of corpses, softening the horror for the comfort of viewers. Before the footage even aired, it would be preceded by a warning that the report might distress some viewers.</p><p>Hard truths are these days easy to avoid if you don't want to be troubled by them.</p><p>I wonder what Lee Miller would have made of this tendency to soften and blur horror.</p><p>Miller was a wartime photographer who captured the London blitz, the liberation of Paris and the Buchenwald and Dachau concentration camps. She became a photojournalist, she said, to document war as historical evidence. What she saw and photographed led to post-traumatic stress disorder, clinical depression and alcoholism after the war. Her story is portrayed by Kate Winslet in the movie Lee, to be released in September this year.</p><p>Had Eddie Adams' photo of the execution of Nguyen Van Lem in Saigon during the Tet offensive in 1968 been blurred or pixelated, would the opposition to Vietnam War have been less intense? And what if the terror and pain on the naked Phan Thi Kim Phuc's face when she was photographed running from a napalm strike in South Vietnam by Nick Ut had been masked? Sometime revulsion is needed to galvanise opinion.</p><p>As distressing as it may have been to watch, the death of that greyhound in agony on the dog track might not have been forgotten so quickly if we'd all seen the horror of it rather than a blurred blob on the screen. The condemnation of P. Diddy Combs would have been louder - and his lame apology for his actions seemed even more inadequate - had we seen the full violence of his actions.</p><p>We need to look evil in the eye if we want to defeat it.</p><p>HAVE YOUR SAY: Have we become too squeamish when it comes to confronting horror? Why do we lap up gore in movies but look away in real life? Are trigger warnings necessary before news reports?

Opposition home affairs spokesman James Paterson said if elected next year the Coalition would use section 116 of the Migration Act to cancel the visas of student protesters \"found to be involved in spreading anti-Semitism or supporting terrorism\".</p><p>- The head of Doctors Without Borders has slammed the Australian government for supplying arms to Israel and failing to apply sanctions over its seven-month military offensive on Gaza. \"Australia must apply appropriate sanctions on Israel, as it would to any other global state that refuses to comply with UN Security Council resolutions,\" Medecins Sans Frontieres president Dr Christos Christou said on Tuesday.</p><p>- The Federal Court has been asked to halt the destruction of habitat trees across Victoria after an endangered greater glider was found crushed near a firebreak inside a national park. The Warburton Environment Group has taken action against the Victorian government's Forest Fire Management unit after the dead glider was found at the base of a fallen tree a fortnight ago.</p><p>THEY SAID IT: \"Journalism can never be silent: that is its greatest virtue and its greatest fault. It must speak, and speak immediately, while the echoes of wonder, the claims of triumph and the signs of horror are still in the air.\" - Henry Grunwald</p><p>YOU SAID IT: Dangerous synthetic opioids 300 times potent than heroin are turning up in illicit drugs yet only two jurisdictions in Australia have agreed to pill testing.</p><p>\"I agree that drug/pill testing is a good idea and will save some lives,\" writes Michael. \"However, it is difficult to understand how rational, intelligent people are prepared to ingest something into their body, and trust that it is safe, when it has come from a ruthless drug dealer. There seems to be a lack of personal responsibility and consideration of any adverse consequences of taking a substance that has come from such a dubious source.\"</p><p>Matt writes: \"Offering widespread pill testing is the way to go, if we care about reducing deaths. There are so many myths around drug policy, most of which have comprehensively failed the test of time. Beyond pill testing, the current criminalisation of drug possession and use clearly does not work in terms of suppressing trade and demand - that should be obvious. The only groups that really benefit from the status quo are organised crime groups that make a huge amount of money from keeping things just they way they are now.\"</p><p>\"I agree totally to the widespread use of pill testing,\" writes Patti. \"I think it will inform users to what is in the drugs they are buying and will put them off or at least make them more cautious as to their supply. It is one thing to take something you think is OK, but to find out it is cut with all manner of nasties is alarming.\"</p><p>Reading The Echidna in Bangkok, Carl writes: \"I know this sounds high and mighty of me, but what is it that turns people to drugs in the first place? Is life really that dull and unexciting that you need to pop a pill to liven it up? The entire journey is soon over and you're back to another day, often regretful. I gave up everything, booze too, some years ago now and when people are surprised at my total abstinence, my simple reply is that I'm now living in reality.\"</p><p>\"Teaching kids to research and test drugs before taking them is smart,\" writes Jennifer. \"Forcing them to take the risk when encouraged by naive and silly peers (as happens), is stupid. Putting politics and principles before lives shows a complete lack of compassion and consideration for the kids, their families and friends.

Its impact is longer, more intense fire seasons, and an increase in the average number of elevated fire weather days.</p><p>The weather is a significant contributor to bushfire risk and severity and is beyond the control of our firefighters.</p><p>While clear fire district boundaries are in place, our firefighting resources are not bound to the distinction between city and country. Regardless of where they live, Victorians can rely on interagency co-operation.</p><p>That co-operation is a central outcome of Victoria's Fire Services reform. It has significantly improved since the devasting Black Saturday and the 2019-20 Black Summer fires.</p><p>The reform has us working towards a common goal of delivering a world-class fire service and ensuring a sustainable system that will keep Victorians safe. FRV is proud to work closely with the Victorian government and other key stakeholders to deliver this generational reform.</p><p>FRV works tirelessly to place resources and equipment in the hands of our firefighters. Our training capability is world class and prepares our firefighters for the extraordinary challenges ahead.</p><p>Each year, an average of 18 people lose their lives in house fires, and many more are seriously injured. While now is the time to prepare for summer, Victorians must never lose sight of the year-round fire risks.</p><p>Fire preparedness is a shared responsibility.

However, fire danger ratings are lower today.</p><p>Holidaymakers and locals in the Gippsland Lakes hamlet of Loch Sport, about 20 kilometres south of Bairnsdale, were told yesterday afternoon they had to take shelter immediately as it was too late to leave when a grass fire approached.</p><p>However, the warning was downgraded to a watch and act message just before 4pm.</p><p>The downgraded alert still told residents on Loch Sport's western edge to leave now yesterday evening.</p><p>Loch Sport is home to about 1000 people but swells on sunny days due to its idyllic location wedged between Ninety Mile Beach and Lake Victoria.</p><p>A separate blaze from an unattended campfire yesterday also sparked an emergency warning for Forge Creek on the other side of Lake Victoria, north of Loch Sport.

More than 120 houses were incinerated close to the front line of fighting between the separatists and Ukrainian forces. This handout picture from the press service of the Ukrainian State Emergency Service on July 7, 2020 shows residents and police trying to extinguish fires and limit damage in a house, during a wildfire at Novoaydarivsk district, Lugansk region State Emergency Service of Ukraine / Handout Regional governor Serhiy Haidai told Radio NV the fire, which started on Monday, may have been caused by arson. He said teams were trying to evacuate at-risk areas but some older residents were refusing to leave.  \"They don't want to leave their homes. They say, 'here we were born, here we will die',\" said Haidai. Spring wildfires earlier this year ravaged more than 66,000 hectares in the exclusion zone around Chernobyl in northern Ukraine, scene of one of the world's worst nuclear accidents in 1986. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-IBTX132857159416318810375776100114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">IBTX-132857</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:609J-5XV1-F03R-N2WW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484253</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"261\"/><timeReceived>11:06 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>International Business Times Australia</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"07\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>July 7, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp;

8, it left in it's wake a bushfire which while now being controlled, has burned out more than 129,200 hectares.</p><p>The Duck Creek fire was listed as out of control a number of times, with a fire-generated thunderstorm causing the blaze to double in size before firefighters began to get the upper hand by Wednesday afternoon, December 20, assisted by significant rainfall across the fire-ground.</p><p>Burning within approximately 17 kilometres south of Narrabri, 20km west of Boggabri and 40km north east of Coonabarabran, the Duck Creek Pilliga Forest fire has caused havoc for more than 12 days.</p><p>NSW RFS Narrabri Control Centre public information officer Allan McCartney said the the rain brought some welcome relief.</p><p>\"We had an average of 20 millimetres of rain overnight on the fire-ground which is certainly not enough to put it out but it has quietened the fire's activity,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have limited intelligence on the fire-ground this morning, but we've got crews out there assessing where the fire edge is at the moment so hopefully we'll get some air crews up to do more scanning.</p><p>\"The current weather is not conducive to a big fire spread, however it will change so there is still quite a bit of containment work to be done.</p><p>\"While there are areas in the south that have taken a run, there is still some unburnt country in between that which has got the potential for erratic fire behaviour when the rain stops and it drys out.</p><p>\"We don't have any detail on livestock losses at the moment, and we don't have a figure on property damage yet but we have no reported house losses.\"</p><p>Bureau Of Meteorology meteorologist Jiwon Park said wet weather conditions and cooler temperatures were expected for the mid-week.</p><p>\"Starting from Tuesday we expect thunderstorms in the Narrabri area, it could be hit and miss, but it could also have the potential to bring localised heavy falls,\" he said.</p><p>\"The main activity of rainfall is expected on Tuesday through to Thursday with the peak on Wednesday, however any rainfall above five millimetres will be useful for the firefighting efforts.</p><p>\"We also expect the temperature to drop 10 degrees to somewhere between 24 to 27 degrees during the mid-week period before it rises again towards the end of the week.\"</p><p>In the Jacks Creek area, 30 kilometres south of Narrabri, local sheep producer Nic Hann said her property was impacted by two fire-fronts on Monday December 18 and remained very unsteady on Tuesday December 19.</p><p>\"We managed to save all of our assets and majority of our livestock, although it is too dangerous to complete a full property inspection,\" she said.</p><p>\"Judging by the movement of the fire, at least 80 per cent of our property has been impacted in some way.</p><p>\"Without being able to assess the property due to falling trees and continual smoulder it is hard to be certain.\"</p><p>Evacuation centres have been established in Narrabri and Gunnedah for affected residents.</p><p>The Newell highway between Narrabri and Coonabarabran remains closed.</p><p>Visit <url

We are building control lines with bulldozers and graders, burning unburned fuel between the control line and fire edge ... and using all our resources including about 20 aircraft to directly attack any spots,\" Mr Bates said.</p><p>Mr Bates said the main areas of concern for Wednesday were around Raglan and Beaufort, toward Lexton and Amphitheatre and back toward Elmhurst, with the weather bureau forecasting strong north to northwest winds during the day before a strong south-westerly change late afternoon or early evening.</p><p>\"Really south and east to the northeast of the current fire ... based on the potential for fire to get out and travel in a south east direction then move toward the north east,\" he said.</p><p>\"Similar to last Thursday there's a potential run of fire spotting ahead of the fire front then with that south west wind change there's the potential for a long flanking fire to become a head fire,\" he said.</p><p>With the extreme fire risk on Wednesday there is also the potential for new blazes to break out separate from the large bushfire burning for almost a week.</p><p>\"We encourage people to keep up to date with the VicEmergency app, to listen and heed those warnings and be really conscious of what is going on,\" Mr Bates said.</p><p>\"If you've got a fire plan, enact it. If you're going to leave early, I strongly suggest leaving Tuesday evening or night.</p><p>\"Leaving at the last minute is not a wise decision.\"</p><p>Ballarat Pony Club will open their grounds at Victoria Park from Tuesday to allow for horse owners to evacuate their equines before and during Wednesday's extreme fire weather.</p><p>CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan urged property and home owners to prepare ahead of Wednesday's extreme fire conditions - including mowing lawns, moving wood piles, clearing branches, cleaning gutters and simple precautions such as moving combustible front and back doormats.</p><p>\"Many, many homes were saved from the Bayindeen fire because the community took the time to prepare their homes before leaving, and that really assisted firefighters in doing house to house to save those properties,\" Mr Heffernan said.</p><p>The Victoria Park base camp began to take shape on Monday, with road closures to occur in and around the park.</p><p>Council is working with users including the Ballarat Cricket Association, dog obedience club, school sports, soccer club and the Ballarat Football and Netball Club to minimise the impact on them and find alternative venues.</p><p>Events planned in Victoria Park including the Red Hot Summer Tour on March 16 and Summer Salt on March 17 will not be impacted.</p><p>\"The City of Ballarat is pleased to offer our support to the CFA who are doing an outstanding job battling the blazes that are yet to be brought under control,\" said Ballarat mayor Des Hudson.</p><p>\"We ask people who live and travel in the Victoria Park precinct to be mindful of the camp that's quickly being established. We are trying to minimise the impacts on regular park users but roads into the park will need to be closed. Please be patient and understanding of the important work that's being done to assist our emergency support agencies.</p><p>\"And with extreme weather conditions predicted for Wednesday, it's also a timely reminder for us all to ensure our properties are fire ready - ensure your grass has been slashed and your gutters cleared.

uncontained Duck Creek Pilliga Forest bushfire burns towards homes and properties near Bohena Creek in the state's North-West.</p><p>\"If you are in the area of Bohena Creek, between McCanns Road, Perimeter Road, Tomlinson Lane and Newell Highway, your life is at risk,\" NSWRFS said on Facebook.</p><p>\"It is too late to leave, as the fire approaches seek shelter now in a solid structure such as a house.</p><p>\"Do not be caught in the open path of the fire, a safer location may include a well cleared area nearby.</p><p>\"Neighbourhood safer places offer a place of last resort if there are no other options.\"</p><p>An evacuation centre at The Crossing Theatre, Narrabri, has been established for residents affected by the fire.</p><p>The NSWRFS expect embers to be blown long distances ahead of the main fire-front and start spot fires which may impact homes and properties earlier than the main fire-front.</p><p>Firefighters and water bombing aircraft are currently working in the area to protect properties and slow the spread of the fire.</p><p>With north westerly winds forecast this afternoon, the fire is expected to push in a south easterly direction.</p><p>The NSWRFS have also warned residents in the Baan Baa, Willala and Goolhi area to be aware of ember attacks.</p><p>The Newell Highway between Coonabarabran and Narrabri also remains closed.</p><p>For fire updates visit the NSWRFS website or NSWRFS fires near me map.</p><p>As of 10:49am Monday December 18 Firefighters and residents in the state's North-West are on high alert as a large uncontained bushfire within the Pilliga Forest 18 kilometres south of Narrabri and 28km west of Boggabri continues.</p><p>The Duck Creek Pilliga Forest Fire has burnt through more than 64,700 hectares after a dry lightning storm hit the region 11 days ago.</p><p>An evacuation centre at The Crossing Theatre, Narrabri, has been established for residents who have been affected by the fire.</p><p>The Newell Highway between Coonabarabran and Narrabri also remains closed.</p><p>While the blaze was at an emergency level early Monday morning, it has since been downgraded to a watch and act level.</p><p>The fire has now eased near Jacks Creek and Bohena Creek, but continues to burn in the area of Terra Delba Road, Wesport Road and the Newell Highway where firefighters remain working with property owners.</p><p>For Baan Baa, Wynella and Willala, north westerly winds are forecast to increase later this morning, which will push the fire in an easterly and south easterly direction.</p><p>\"Landholders in the areas of Baan Baa, Wynella, and Willala should monitor the situation closely, review their bushfire survival plan and prepare their properties,\" NSW Rural Fire Service said on Facebook.</p><p>The NSWRFS has advised residents in these areas to stay alert and monitor their surroundings.</p><p>\"Know what you will do if the fire impacts where you are and if you are not prepared to the highest level, leaving early is the safest option,\" the agency said.</p><p>More than 50 bush and grass fires were burning statewide on Monday, according to the RFS website, as a severe heatwave warning remained for the Northern Rivers, Mid North Coast and Northern Tablelands Districts.</p><p>With Australian Associated

I'm starting to get emotional just talking about it.\"</p><p>The NSW Coroner Teresa O'Sullivan\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2024-03-27/nsw-sydney-bushfire-inquiry-findings-recommendations/103632542\">this week concluded</url>\u00a0her inquiry into the 2019-20 \"Black Summer\" bushfire season.</p><p>The strategies used by authorities to try and protect the homes of residents like Mr Webb was scrutinised during the inquiry.</p><p>The Currowan fire and the Gosper's Mountain fire in the Blue Mountains were used as case studies to examine decisions to use back-burning.</p><p>Ultimately three people were killed and 89 homes destroyed in Conjola and surrounding towns when the Currowan fire jumped the Princes Highway on New Year's Eve.</p><p>The coroner concluded the decision to carry out a back-burn the day before as part of a containment strategy was appropriate, despite it causing spot fires.</p><p>She recommended fire investigators be provided with modelling indicating what would have occurred had the fire not been lit.</p><p>Mr Webb believed this would improve transparency around back-burn decisions.</p><p>\"I think that recommendation gives the community the understanding of what the authorities have to deal with when they are making those decisions,\" said Mr Webb.</p><p>\"If they educate the community and say, 'this is what would have happened if we had not done this',\" said Mr Webb.</p><p>\"It is comforting if we understand how the system works and it helps us understand what the authorities are trying to do.\"</p><h>Back-burns 'appropriate'</h><p>The coroner also recommended fires accidentally caused by back-burns be treated as a public safety issue triggering a report to the coroner.</p><p>Some community members in Conjola and Mount Wilson still believe back-burning was responsible for starting the fires that destroyed their homes.</p><p>In the case of the Currowan fire, the coroner concluded that authorities should have considered limiting back-burning operations due to the extreme weather forecast for New Year's Eve.</p><p>However, she agreed with expert evidence that found the use of back-burning as a containment strategy was \"appropriate in the circumstances\".</p><p>Meanwhile the coroner also concluded the back-burn lit to contain the Gosper's Mountain fire in the Grose Valley was also \"appropriate\".</p><p>NSW Rural Fire Service (RFS) Commissioner Rob Rogers said the agency has already adopted a previous recommendation for independent reviews of back-burn decisions.</p><p>He welcomed the recommendations regarding back-burn modelling.</p><p>\"It is easy to criticise what happens with a back-burn but often if we do nothing then we get a worse or similar outcome anyway,\" he said.</p><h>Communications blackout like the \"dark side of the moon\"</h><p>Another key issue considered by the inquiry was the shortcomings of communication systems.</p><p>In November 2019, the RFS believed the Kangawalla fire burning near Glenn Innes was under control, before it intensified and tore through the town of Wytaliba killing two people.</p><p>The inquiry heard there was a delay of more than an hour and a half between the first report of the catastrophic fire conditions and the RFS issuing an emergency alert.</p><p>The former Mayor of Glenn Innes Carol Sparks's Wytaliba home was damaged in the fire.</p><p>\"We have to look at what is happening on the ground and the communication between people on the ground and those in the control centres,\" she said.</p><p>\"They did not know that the fire was at Wytaliba at that time.\"</p><p>\"They were looking at maps and by the time they realised the fire was happening it was too late.\"</p><p>The inquiry acknowledged shortcomings in the way the RFS verified on the ground reports and issued emergency warnings and recommended further training for RFS personnel.</p><h>Volunteers back safety improvements</h><p>Communication within the RFS was also scrutinised.</p><p>Volunteer John Walters fought the Badja Forest fire that destroyed the town of Cobargo on New Year's Eve.</p><p>The president of Cobargo Rural Fire Brigade recalled the terrifying moment his radio stopped working.</p><p>\"It was a bit like the astronauts going around the dark side of the moon,\" he said.</p><p>\"We suddenly lost connection to the outside world, and we had to operate autonomously.\"</p><p>Commissioner Rogers said the agency is in the process of upgrading its communication systems but fell short of committing to adopt all the recommendations.</p><p>\"The integration of the emergency alert system into RFS systems, we have to understand what that means,\" he said.</p><p>\"I don't know how complex that is, how long it would take us, how much money it would cost.\"</p><p>The inquiry echoed <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-02-27/auditor-general-nsw-rfs-no-overarching-strategy-climate-bushfire/102028854\">previous reports</url> that found shortcomings in the NSW firefighting fleet.</p><p>\"There is a need to look at our fire appliances design from the ground up,\" Mr Walters said.</p><p>\"Let's put our crews into fire trucks, not commercial trucks that have been adapted to be fire trucks.\"</p><p>The inquiry heard firefighter Samuel McPaul was killed after his 1999 fire truck was picked up in a fire tornado in the Green Valley fire near the NSW-Victoria border.</p><p>The coroner found Mr McPaul's truck was not \"fit-for-purpose\" and recommended the RFS improve the structural integrity of fire trucks.</p><p>The RFS said it is upgrading safety equipment to better protect volunteers, including improved vehicle standards.</p><p>\"Things like safety equipment, new helmets, respiratory protection, retrofitting safety systems to trucks and working with Monash on things like falling object protection,\" Commissioner Rogers said.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It was ominous, it was like 'what the hell does this mean?' Because I don't know. No one does.\" The forests around bushfire-ravaged communities along the NSW south coast are thick with young black wattle and eucalyptus trees while the grass in paddocks is turning yellow as the weather becomes hotter and drier.</p><p>Only about a quarter of hazard reduction planned in the state by the NSW Rural Fire Service was completed last financial year due to severe flooding and prolonged wet weather caused by three consecutive La Nina events over the past two-years.</p><p>The Badja Forest fire was ignited by lightning on December 27 in 2019 near the Snowy Mountains town of Cooma before travelling about 70km southeast to the Bega Valley Shire village of Cobargo on New Year's Eve.</p><p>The devastating blaze was the deadliest of all the Black Summer bushfires, killing seven people including Wandella dairy farmer Robert Salway and his son Patrick, Richard Steele, Colin Burns, John Smith, Ross Rixon and -Michael Clarke.</p><p>Fire-resistant agapanthus line the perimeter of retired forester Bruce Lever's home in Coolagolite and burn marks left from the embers spat out by the Badja Forest fire remain on the awning of his house.</p><p>Mr Lever spent decades working in bushfire suppression and has cleared his own land, as well as clearing leaves from gutters and checking sprinklers will work and keep his property damp if flames again lick his doorstep.</p><p>He said the danger this summer would come from grass fires instead of forest and whether an area had been controlled burned did not entirely eliminate the risk of bushfire.</p><p>\"The area covered by the -Cobargo fire had been extensively control burned in the years preceding it,\" he said.</p><p>\"In the words of the manager I spoke to about it, it 'made bugger all difference'.</p><p>\"Now it (control burning) does make a difference.

NSW Emergency Services Minister Jihad Dib said preparing for the fire season was a responsibility shared by all community members and it was important residents in bushfire-prone areas started preparing now.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-7291254e4acb11eea5f1e50940231e83c31e0116f5696f5486fd8ddf97d1b134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:693M-9FP1-F0JP-W0P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"756\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"09\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>September 5, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLQ6</classCode><className>FIRE SAFE MATERIALS &amp; PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000561</classCode><className>EL NINO &amp; LA NINA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp; FLOODING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DM3Y</classCode><className>FORESTRY WORKERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

theft when he lit a fire that ravaged more than 1,000 hectares of land in the Tamworth region, a court has heard.\u00a0</p><p>A NSW children's court today heard he and an accomplice\u00a0stole 200 litres of diesel fuel from a\u00a0logging excavator near Hanging Rock\u00a0in the late hours of October 26, 2019.\u00a0</p><p>The man, whose identity cannot be published because he\u00a0was 17 at the time, brought his own containers to the site which were\u00a0leaking fuel and carried the canisters onto the back of his getaway vehicle.\u00a0</p><p>Some fuel left behind was then set alight with a cigarette lighter\u00a0before the pair left the scene to go camping.</p><p>The fire destroyed 1,042 hectares of the Tamworth region, including parts of the Nundle State Forest and a commercial pine plantation.\u00a0</p><p>The damage costs were estimated to be between $1.1 and $1.7 million.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>The now 20-year-old\u00a0pleaded guilty to two charges last year,\u00a0including\u00a0intentionally cause a fire and be reckless to its spread\u00a0and larceny of a value greater than $2,000.</p><p>The magistrate said the offence was most grave.\u00a0</p><p>\"To put this into perspective, it's about 10.42 square kilometres that has been destroyed,\" the magistrate said.</p><h>'Extremely regretful'\u00a0</h><p>The man's defence lawyer\u00a0Kimberley Norquay-Evans said he client's\u00a0intent was only to destroy the evidence of the fuel theft.\u00a0</p><p>\"I accept the extent of the damage, but the only consequences should be for acts that could have been reasonably foreseen,\" Ms Norquay-Evans said.\u00a0</p><p>\"Any level of planning was only to destroy the evidence.\"</p><p>She said there was no level of planning to light the greater fire that spread.</p><p>\"He is extremely regretful,\" she said.</p><p>This was quickly rejected by the magistrate, who said the incident was reckless.\u00a0</p><p>\"There was a cigarette lighter taken,\" the magistrate said.</p><p>\"There was containers taken.</p><p>\"It's reckless in setting something ablaze for no good reason.\"\u00a0</p><p>The court heard the then-teenager had been self-medicating his depression from a young age with alcohol and cannabis.</p><p>He had no prior criminal record.</p><p>The magistrate sentenced him to 12 months in jail, to be eligible for parole in five months.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
