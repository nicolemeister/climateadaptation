Book now for the holidays at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.qld.gov.au/camping\">www.qld.gov.au/camping</url> or 131 304. Visitors to Fraser Island must be aware of dingoes and need to keep a very careful watch on children and young teens -- never let them play or walk unsupervised. At Carnarvon National Park, access to the Gorge section day use area is open to all vehicles. The Amphitheatre remains closed. At the Mt Moffatt section, Dargonelly Rock Hole and Top Moffatt camping areas are both open. At Wongi State Forest, fire restrictions mean you must bring a gas or fuel stove. Diamantina National Park is open. Use caution when crossing floodways and travelling around the park due to damage from recent floods.</p><p>What's on: Lots of Go Bush activities are on offer during the school holidays. Learn about the amazing history of the Glass House Mountains next Wednesday. Join a ranger to walk around the base of Mt Tibrogargan and appreciate its beauty and heritage. On Thursday, discover the wonderful world of dragons and dinosaurs at Daisy Hill Conservation Park. Children even get to make a fossil. Or join the popular ranger-for-a-day holiday workshop at David Fleay Wildlife Park at West Burleigh. Cost is $35 a child and includes park entry, all activities, a photograph with an animal and a certificate. Book on 5576 2411. Check out the centenary of national parks historical exhibition at the Queensland Museum until April 27. It showcases memorabilia from the past 100 years, interactive displays and a documentary. Since the first national park was declared in 1908, Queensland's park estate has grown to 282 national parks from desert to rainforest to reef.</p><p>News: At Kenilworth Forest Reserve, the Bundaroo Creek bridge is closed to all traffic for maintenance. Forest Drive is closed from Funnels Hut Rd to Booloumba Creek. Access to Booloumba Falls and Booloumba View lookout remains open via Booloumba Creek Rd. At Molle Islands National Park, the walking track between Sandy Bay and Mt Jeffreys' intersection is closed for maintenance. Contact EPA Whitsundays on 4967 7355 for track updates. A feral pig was recently sighted on Long Island. Feral pigs can be aggressive and visitors should walk in groups, stay on the track and supervise children.</p><p>Wildlife: Snakes are still active this time of year. Clearing debris, wood piles, long grass and loose leaf piles can minimise places for snakes to hide in your back yard.</p><p>Compiled by the Environmental Protection Agency.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML-20080404-1-053-250011</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4S6G-XFX0-TX5N-015T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"418\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - First with the news Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"04\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>April 4, 2008 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"62\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

They include overcharging or outright defrauding of customers, misleading advice, exploiting vulnerable Australians and other misdeeds. Even if financial institutions (mostly) do look after their customers, the commission is inquiring into misconduct - and finding plenty. The question for regulators is how this blatant and harmful misconduct can happen, and why it appears so widespread.\"</p><p>HOLD THE FRONT PAGE</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CRIKEY-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CRIKEY2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T04-0VY1-F0NT-H31V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">388510</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1933\"/><timeReceived>07:10:29 GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 First Digital Media All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Crikey</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"50624\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>August 7, 2018 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

devastation caused by the deadly Victorian bushfires.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The second and third in line to the British throne made a brief visit to the Australian High Commission in central London on Tuesday to sign a condolence book for the hundreds of families affected by the blazes.</pre></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\"><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 They spent about five minutes discussing the fires with high commissioner John Dauth, consul-general Paul Ganly and acting agent-general for Victoria Ian Marland before signing the book and meeting a large crowd of the commission's female staff.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"<person><nameText>Prince William and Prince Harry </nameText></person>were deeply shocked and saddened by the forest fire disasters that have struck Victoria recently,\" they said in a joint statement released by St James' Palace.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"They just wanted to pay their respects to the Australian people today and let those who have been tragically bereaved and others who have been left homeless know that their thoughts and prayers are with them.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Dauth gave the princes yellow ribbons to wear on their suits in commemoration of the more than 200 people killed by the fires, prompting <person><nameText>Prince Harry </nameText></person>to joke he would continue wearing his throughout the upcoming Ashes cricket series.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The high commissioner told the princes how more than 100 people had signed the condolence book while many others had sent donations and letters of support.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"They were interested to know what the current situation is and were alarmed, as are we all, by the further dangers of the fires in Victoria,\" Dauth told reporters.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"<person><nameText>Prince William </nameText></person>said he assumed that (the donations and letters) were from expatriate Australians and he was surprised and I think pleased when I told him we had very many letters from British people.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"I think they felt pleased they had been here and they felt part of the contribution the royal family has made to marking this sad time in Australia.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 <person><nameText>Prince William </nameText></person>also appeared to impress a group of about 15 swooning female members of the high commission's staff as he stopped for a quick chat before leaving.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Ebonee Bailey-Gregory, from Hobart, was among those keen to catch a glimpse of the princes and said she found <person><nameText>Prince William </nameText></person>full of charm.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"He asked if a lot of people had come through and if we were all Australians and if we knew people back home who were affected,\" she said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The visit by the princes to the high commission comes a week after their grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, signed the condolence book.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Queen has also made a private donation to the Red Cross appeal for bushfire victims, while Princess Anne attended last weekend's National Day of Mourning memorial service in Melbourne.</pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

nitf:lede=\"true\">Victoria's bushfire emergency is not over, with today and Friday looming as extremely dangerous.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">People in the Warburton Valley and Yarra Valley could come under direct threat today.</p><p>Fire chiefs are warning residents of these areas that if they plan to leave rather than stay and try to defend their properties, they should leave early today.</p><p>Country Fire Authority state duty officer Neil Bumpstead said residents would be most at risk after the wind change forecast for this afternoon.</p><p>He warned that if fire did reach the Warburton Valley, people who had left should be prepared to stay away for several days.</p><p>\"We cannot stress enough that with limited road access in the Warburton Valley, traffic may become congested,\" he said.</p><p>\"Being on the roads is dangerous during a fire threat.\"</p><p>The Enoch Point area, near Gaffneys Creek and south of Eildon, was of particular concern, with winds expected to turn north and north- westerly today at speeds of between 20km/h and 30km/h.</p><p>State duty officer at the Department of Sustainability and Environment Andrew Graystone said today's forecast was also for extreme forest fire danger in the Mallee and very high forest and grassland fire danger across the state, with the exception of East Gippsland.</p><p>The CFA has declared today a day of total fire ban in the north-western, north-eastern, eastern and central districts.</p><p>Premier John Brumby urged people in fire-prone parts of the state to implement their fire survival plans.</p><p>Mr Brumby said no Victorian should need to be reminded that the state was very dry after a drought lasting many years and then the baking heat of recent weeks.</p><p>\"It doesn't need much to make them [fires] run,\" he said.</p><p>\"So for people in those threatened areas, put your fire survival plan in place and if you're going to stay and defend, do all the things that are in the rule book.\"</p><p>Concerned about a rift between the CFA and the firefighters' union about how the fire services performed on Black Saturday, Mr Brumby called for an end to finger- pointing.</p><p>He said Victorians should work hard to avoid a repeat of what happened after the Ash Wednesday fires of 1983, when many firefighters resigned from the CFA \"because lives were lost and they thought they hadn't done enough, that they'd failed\".</p><p>\"That's the last thing we want in Victoria now,\" Mr Brumby said on radio before yesterday's National Day of Mourning service.</p><p>\"I don't know of any firefighter who didn't do their best.\"</p><p>Mr Brumby said the bushfires royal commission would investigate all issues, including the performance of the CFA and other emergency services and the adequacy of fuel- reduction burning policies and emergency warning systems.</p><p>with Clay Lucas</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Leonards says that he did play and broke a window. The window is located far away from the dartboard, which is on the main door. Sheldon wants ski-ball tickets as he has finally decided on the price he wants for them.</p><p><br/> Leonard gives Sheldon the ski-ball tickets from a box and also pulls out an ugly, itchy red sweater, which was knitted by her aunt. Sheldon finds that there are less tickets and wants to see if there are more in the box. Leonard blocks Sheldon's attempt to check the box. Soon, he tells Sheldon not to flip out because he did not return a DVD that was rented on Sheldon's name, seven years ago.<br/> Sheldon is calm and acting reasonable, which freaks out both Penny and Leonard. Leonard tells him that being reasonable means not to fixate on the DVD, not waking him up in the middle of night or nagging him while he is on the toilet. Sheldon tells him that it is no picnic for him, too to talk to him while he is on the toilet.<br/> Sheldon reminds Leonard that he should have remembered that the unresolved issues make him uncomfortable. It is like an itch in his brain that he cannot scratch. Sheldon has a solution and asks Leonard to put on the itchy sweater and share the experience with him. Leonard agrees to do that to prove that one can have a problem and solve it, without looking like a complete lunatic. He is expected to wear the sweater till he returns the DVD. However, he is unable to return the DVD because the owner of the DVD store is dead.<br/> Leonard thinks that it is time to take off the sweater and he tells Sheldon that I didn't use it to antagonise everyone around me. However, Howard suggests that he seeks out the next of the kin, which Sheldon things is a pretty good idea. Leonard has to keep wearing the itchy sweater, which has put itchy rashes all across his upper body.<br/> Also, the sweater has made Leonard an itchy mess. Howard describes him as a person who is impersonating a lunatic bear, showing that only he can prevent a forest fire. Sheldon is says that Leonard is a walking a mile in his metaphorical shoes. At Penny's apartment, Penny wants him to take off the sweater since Sheldon is not there to watch, but Leonard refuses to do that as he does not want Sheldon to win.<br/> Leonard is unable to find anyone related to the dead DVD owner, and his patience has given-up. He almost screams when Sheldon suggests that he look for his relatives in countries such a Lebanon. Sheldon finally tells him not to flip out at the revelation that seven years ago, he found out the DVD is late and paid for it.

This compares with 92 burns, covering almost 11,000ha, conducted last bushfire season. And the burning has begun, with the first taking place in the north-east corner of Belair National Park on Monday this week.</p><p>The next is due on Tuesday or Wednesday, depending on the weather conditions, says Mike Wouters, the department's acting manager of fire management. ``We need 20 or 25 degrees, some wind but not too much,'' he said.</p><p>``We don't want it too dry, but not a wet cloudy day. The humidity needs to be below 40 per cent. The perfect spring day is a good day for burning.</p><p>``If it's too hot, the fuel dries out too much and the fire will be too intense and potentially uncontrollable. Same as if there is too much wind, the fire spreads too much and we have less control.''</p><p>The Government's main aim is to reduce bushfire risk across South Australia. A major focus is the Mt Lofty Ranges, where 41 prescribed burns are planned, covering 1200ha.</p><p>Mt Lofty Ranges Fire Cooperative convenor Richard de Groot said burns were targeted to reduce heavy fuel loads in strategic areas of parks and reserves. ``There is conclusive evidence both nationally and internationally that prescribed burning lessens the impact bushfires would otherwise have on assets and the community,'' he said.</p><p>``Reducing heavy fuel loads is very important, because it can make it easier to control a bushfire, help prevent a bushfire spreading to residential areas, and ultimately save people's lives and property.''</p><p>But no amount of prescribed burning can protect the community from the worst bushfires.</p><p>Forest fire expert Dr Kevin Tolhurst, from the University of Melbourne, gave advice to Victoria's Royal Commission into the Black Saturday fires which claimed 173 lives.</p><p>He said the vegetation that becomes fuel for a fire is just one source of energy. The other sources of energy are the weather (wind and heat), the topography, and the fire itself (radiation, convection, mass-ignition effects).</p><p>``In some circumstances, a wildfire, even in a recently prescribed burnt area, may cause catastrophic damage even if the extent and degree of damage is diminished,'' he said.</p><p>``Prescribed burning to reduce fuel hazards must be considered in combination with other impact mitigation strategies such as fire suppression, building design and planning, communication, and avoidance.''</p><p>CSIRO research scientist Justin Leonard said the fuel close to homes and in the last 50m right up to the back fence was ``absolutely critical'' but in some cases fires were unstoppable.</p><p>``Once the weather escalates past certain thresholds, that fire in the landscape won't stop at a break or a prescribed burn or anything,'' he said.</p><p>``Prior to that escalation, there are many opportunities to be more active at suppressing an initial start, halting the fire front or reducing the extent of the fire while conditions are mild.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV-20101016-1-046-095222</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVSUN2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:517R-FHR1-JD3N-53SJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-08-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - State Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>October 16, 2010 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

In the North Island of New Zealand, Steam, a five-year-old huntaway, herds more than 1000 deer to fresh pastures each day. Eighteen-month-old Heavenly Angel, a Pyrenean mountain dog, would probably enjoy a job like Steam's and so her handler, Marshall, takes her to try out guarding goats for a northern Californian farmer, while Mike, an eight-year-old Dutch shepherd and a veteran of a US secret service pilot project established in the late 1990s, has an extraordinary nose for counterfeit money.</p><p>Ultimate Response</p><p>A1 (digital), 9.30pm</p><p>A sudden forest fire is sweeping out of control through Banff National Park in Canada and specialist search-and-rescue helicopter teams must pluck confused hikers off smoke-covered mountains. Across the country, on the West Coast Trail in the Pacific Rim National Park, emergency calls are coming in from hikers when the 77-kilometre trail become so muddy that's its injury rate matches a downhill ski facility.</p><p>Dame Alicia Markova</p><p>Ovation, 5.30pm</p><p>Famed for her interpretations of the lead roles in Giselle, Swan Lake and The Nutcracker, English ballerina Alicia Markova began her career when she was spotted by Russian dance impresario Serge Diaghilev. That was in 1920 when she was 10 years old. Under Diaghilev's watchful eye, Markova become a star and exerted a major influence on the emerging British ballet scene and with her dancing partner, Anton Dolin, founded the London Festival Ballet, which in turn became the English National Ballet. She was still dancing Giselle at the age of 48 and performed on stage for the last time in the early 1960s. Subsequently, she worked as a dance director and teacher. Dame Alicia died in December at the age of 94.</p><p>Good Eats</p><p>Lifestyle Food (digital), 9.30pm</p><p>The thought of preparing souffle has bugged cooks for ages, but is host Alton Brown really going to help when he insists a strong measure of science is all that's needed to control the egg foam? Then there's the question of managing heat in the oven.

Decades later, the two-time best actor Oscar winner sat down with his children to watch the film about a young deer dealing with the sudden death of its mother.</p><p>Hoffman saw it with new eyes.</p><p>\"Bambi is frightening,\" he says, raising his eyebrows. \"When all those animals get burned in the forest fire - you don't realise until you have kids how frightening that is.</p><p>\"The same with Pinocchio. I remember reading Pinocchio to my kids and he falls asleep by the fire and his legs get burned. It's extraordinary, some of these stories. They are brilliant but powerfully brutal.\"</p><p>Hoffman is front and centre in the new wave of Hollywood animated films, lending his voice to two movies last year. The 71-year-old voiced martial arts guru Master Shifu in the animated blockbuster Kung Fu Panda, the third-highest-grossing film worldwide in 2008 with $US631 million ($924 million) in takings.</p><p>Next, Hoffman brings Roscuro the rat to life in The Tale Of Despereaux, a visually beautiful computer-animated film with a look inspired by Flemish artists.</p><p>Based on the Newbery Medal-winning book by Kate DiCamillo and set in the kingdom of Dor, where royalty, peasants and rodents once lived in harmony, the story examines the themes of betrayal, revenge and forgiveness.</p><p>The kingdom is shaken up when the inquisitive Roscuro wanders into the queen's castle and accidentally falls into her soup. The monarch has a fatal heart attack when she sees Roscuro and, as a consequence, the grief-stricken king banishes all rats to the dungeon.</p><p>The hero of the film is big-eared misfit mouse Despereaux (voiced by Matthew Broderick), whose love of reading books rather than chewing them puts him at odds with other rodents.</p><p>Joining Hoffman and Broderick in the all-star cast are <person><nameText>Sigourney Weaver, </nameText></person>Kevin Kline, Tracey Ullman and <person><nameText>William H.

As a teenager toiling away in drama school, teachers and peers laughed at her desire to make a living out of acting.</p><p>More than 50 movies and three Oscar nominations later, the New Yorker has proved them wrong but says she doesn't hold a grudge. \"Forgiveness is a powerful thing and I love the fact it's being dealt with in a movie for children.

But most finds have been limited to one or two or three planets, usually gargantuan balls of gas similar to Jupiter or Saturn.</p><p>But at up to seven planets, the new discovery is almost as rich as our own solar system, which counts eight.</p><p>Christophe Lovis, of Geneva University, one of the scientists behind the find, said the first five were most comparable to Neptune.</p><p>``They are made essentially of rocks and ice. They have a solid core. But on top of that is a layer of gas, of hydrogen and helium most likely,'' he said. ``They are probably not habitable.''</p><p>The sixth is possibly a Saturn-like planet, while the seventh, the smallest, would be so close to its star that its ``year'' would take just over a day.</p><p>Lovis and his team haven't been able to observe the planets directly, which is typical. Few planets can be seen against the blazing light given off by their much more massive parent stars.</p><p>The European Southern Observatory compares the challenge to ``spotting a dim candle in front of a raging forest fire''.</p><p>So the scientists used the observatory's 3.6 metre telescope at La Silla, Chile, to study the star itself. Over six years, they took 190 measurements, checking it for the telltale wobbling caused by the gravitational forces of nearby planets.</p><p>Boss noted that the method was ``biased toward finding the big guys'' because the greater the planet, the greater its gravity and the more it made its parent star wobble. But he said the discovery showed that finding smaller planets was still possible.</p><p>``This field has gone from zero to close to 500 planets in just 15 years,'' Boss said.</p><p>``Fifteen years we did not know about the big guys. Earth-like planets are going to be quite commonplace.''</p><p>The find was made by researchers from Switzerland, France, Germany and Portugal and has been submitted to the journal Astronomy and Astrophysics.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-MER-20100831-1-017-282477</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:50X0-8D61-F0JP-W0CX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-07-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"509\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>August 31, 2010 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001330</classCode><className>PLANETS &amp; ASTEROIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008YVR</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY &amp; SPACE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DT42</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0008X7S</classCode><className>OBSERVATORIES &amp; TELESCOPES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A2AG</classCode><className>SATURN</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A28F</classCode><className>JUPITER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A29X</classCode><className>NEPTUNE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Her kidnapping comes to represent the rape of the landscape of Indonesia.</p><p> Jamieson uses the clown servants of King Rama as the protagonists. On their quest to rescue Sita they face forest fire, famine, wood-chipping, white-water rafting and a surreal urban chaos.</p><p> The shadow puppets are innovative. Not only do we see traditional characters but forest animals, instrumental creatures playing rock songs, and huge electric pylons and buildings.</p><p> In addition, there is distressing imagery of real riots and blasted landscapes in Indonesia.</p><p> The musicians, puppeteers, actors and singers are secreted for most of the 95 minutes at the rear of the stage. They create magical and disturbing images designed by Julian Crouch and lit by Damien Cooper.</p><p> The spectacular musical composition by Grabowsky combines the sounds of Indonesian gamelan music with melodic or cacophonous contemporary Western music. The effect is transporting.</p><p> Sita is challenging both theatrically and sociologically -- and a hoot for the family. Kids loved it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DHS0011041110562512</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERALDSUNLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44KC-YMJ0-0197-93WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"337\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"11\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>November 4, 2000, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000996</classCode><className>KIDNAPPING &amp; ABDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001779</classCode><className>URBANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009VG1</classCode><className>MUSIC COMPOSITION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009U6N</classCode><className>POP &amp; ROCK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST0009FY2</classCode><className>ECOLOGY &amp; ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001795</classCode><className>FOLK &amp; WORLD MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001498</classCode><className>RIOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"51\"><classCode>STX000814</classCode><className>BOATING &amp; RAFTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC305</classCode><className>INDONESIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

As the amber rubs against the animal's fur, it creates a mild static electrical charge, completely undetectable to the animal, which gives the tick a shock. It also releases a resinous scent, which deters ticks and fleas from staying in the animal's coat. The Ticlace is effective within two to three weeks and lasts for up to 12 months of continuous use.

It was one of only 13 companies across the country.</p><p>Among the myriad environmental programs it implements are the PADI National Geographic Dive Program, which gives passengers the chance to observe and explore like an underwater scientist, and Mr Wallish's brainchild, Save A Shark.</p><p>\"I introduced Save a Shark about five years ago,\" he said.</p><p>\"It came about because I saw a similar program being run in Thailand called Save the Elephant and I wanted to do the same sort of thing on the Great Barrier Reef.</p><p>\"At the time, shark finning was a really big issue and movies were coming out like Sharkwater, highlighting the fact that 80 to 90 per cent of our sharks were under threat.\" The program has educated more than 100,000 passengers on issues facing sharks and will have raised $30,000 by the end of this year for student research through the Oceania Chondrichthyan Society.</p><p>Mr Wallish is director of the Association of Marine Park Tourism Operators (AMPTO) and Passions staff are helping to stop the spread of crown of thorns starfish by killing about five of the coral-eating animals each month as part of an AMPTO-led eradication program.</p><p>The company also recently introduced a carbon offset scheme which raised $900 last year towards planting trees in the Daintree.</p><p>\"To my knowledge we're one of the only boats in the whole of Australia that as a tourist operator offers passengers the chance to offset the carbon footprint of their trip, very similar to the way the airlines do,\" Passions' environmental sustainability co-ordinator Russell Hosp said.</p><p>But it hasn't always been smooth sailing for Passions, which was dreamt up by Mr Wallish and his friend Steven Carter in 1987.</p><p>\"We quit our jobs, cashed in our superannuation, sold our cars and basically started to build a boat,\" he said.</p><p>\"We raised $25,000 and ran out of that in about a month.</p><p>\"So we talked our parents into mortgaging their houses, raised another $120,000 and brought in a couple of other people and two years later ended up building the first boat.\" Passions 2 was born a decade later.</p><p>Mr Wallish invested in Passions 3, an 82ft fibreglass catamaran, in 2003. It was delayed for two years after a forest fire destroyed the first model. The company now employs 29 staff and takes 25,000 passengers to Michaelmas Cay National Park and its exclusive mooring at Passions Reef each year.</p><p>It aspires to be the benchmark Reef operator for eco-tourism in Australia and sales and marketing manager Adam O'Malley said interactivity and engagement was key to achieving this goal.</p><p>\"We could quite easily put a video up, show passengers the colours of fish and coral,\" he said.</p><p>\"But to take that one step further and talk about the threats to the Reef and what we're doing to protect it, then giving people the chance to get involved is really something quite special and we're really excited about where we're going to go with that.\" Passions of Paradise celebrates its 25th anniversary on May 30.Do you know someone doing something to preserve the Great Barrier Reef?

As part of a short series, COREY MARTIN speaks with Launceston firey, Robert Featherstone, still going strong after 40 years' service.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GOUGH Whitlam was Australia's prime minister, Cyclone Tracey destroyed Darwin and Countdown first aired on television when Robert Featherstone became a firefighter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The year was 1974 and a 16-year-old Mr Featherstone was on his year-11 summer break when he signed up with the Tasmanian Rural Fires Board.</p><p>\"I went back to school and finished Rosny College in '74 on the Friday and started work on the Monday as a casual,\" he recalled.</p><p>\"They used me as a casual until they were able to get approval for a position in the state headquarters purchasing area.</p><p>\"A lot of the work at that time involved checking the fire trails, doing fuel reduction burns and supporting the volunteers.\"</p><p>In 1979, the Tasmania Fire Service was formed and Mr Featherstone was working in the Huon region, an area he called home for 15 years.</p><p>In 1989 he moved to the Northern region as the Tamar district officer, before moving on to the Launceston Fire Brigade in 1994 and remains today.</p><p>In February 2009, he managed a team in Victoria to help combat the devastating Black Saturday bushfires, a disaster that killed 173 people.</p><p>Mr Featherstone is Launceston's senior station officer, Perth volunteer officer and has spent 41 years in the service carrying out an interest that began at an early age.</p><p>\"When I was three years old I got a little fire truck pedal car for Christmas and the first time I used it I took it down to the end of the footpath, put the ladder up against the post and it slipped on the star picket, which almost impaled me ... so I've never trusted ladders since,\" he said.</p><p>\"I got interest in burning off at about 10 because the grandparents had a shack down on the peninsula and she was a good cook, I'd be in the kitchen trying to get the cake mix.</p><p>\"To fix that she gave me a roll of newspaper and box of matches and told me to get rid of the bracken on the bank, I've been burning off ever since.\"</p><p>Mr Featherstone said a majority of the work firefighters do revolves around the acronym PPRR - plan, prepare, respond and review.</p><p>He said that system worked by planning for all four seasons, preparing the gear, responding to fires and reviewing how things went.</p><p>Mr Featherstone said he had made a few mistakes that colleagues fail to let him forget; like the time he sent a crew to investigate a spot-fire in the distance, which turned out to be the red moon rising.</p><p>\"One of the best pieces of advice I received was way back from one of the bosses who said 'Robert, whenever you go to a forest fire the first thing you do is get a campfire going, put the billy on, sit down and have a cuppa tea',\" he said.</p><p>\"It gives you a chance to see which way the clouds are blowing, how long it's going to take to get the crews here and come up with a decent plan - instead of going in and busting your boiler and losing the fight.</p><p>\"Education for the elderly and young to see if they're ready for what may happen is also important ... you see a few deaths along the way in car accidents, house fires and just stupid acts.</p><p>\"I attended the Brisbane Street backpackers fire where 20 people were stuck on the first floor and one person died.</p><p>\"It's not nice seeing some of the things that have happened, so all the campaigns and education that we provide have made things better over time.\"</p><p>He said technology use had been fundamental in the service becoming more efficient.</p><p>Mr Featherstone said tools such as smartphones, tablets, thermal-image cameras and vehicle identification were priceless.</p><p>\"If we get the vehicle rego before we get to the job, we can type it into the laptop and can tell what sort of car it is, where to cut it, where the airbags are, where the battery is and where the disconnect points are - all that before we get there,\" he said.</p><p>\"The same can be applied to information about properties and things like Google maps is extremely beneficial, plus there are four radios on the trucks and I'm carrying the work phone, personal phone and a pager.</p><p>\"When I first started I spent a lot of time sharpening axes ... we are lucky to use an axe now.</p><p>\"I have picked up some of the knowledge and experience from people who had had 50 years service when I started ... and I try and hand that on to the people coming through now - it's knowledge that was gained 80 years ago and is still valid.\"</p><p>He said he had most enjoyed the camaraderie of his colleagues, which he described as a second family.</p><p>He said being in a team of 15 other firefighters provided plenty of laughs, trust, experiences and rewarding accomplishments.</p><p>Tasmania Police were invited to take part in this series, however, were unable to supply The Sunday Examiner with a candidate.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Launceston senior station officer Robert Featherstone has spent 40 years with the Tasmania Fire Service Picture: NEIL RICHARDSON</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EXMPPR-6ktii4sbf48173dbsluw</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EXMPPR2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5G57-BRP1-F0J6-J146-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386168</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-05-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"807\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Examiner Newspaper</publicationName><edition>Examiner First Edition Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"06\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>June 7, 2015 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Mr Cheney's final report about the spread of the bushfires in the ACT and NSW between January 8 and 18 last year was examined at the inquiry yesterday.By contrast, a combined submission to last year's NSW coronial inquiry into the Brindabella Range fires by the National Parks and Wildlife Service and NSW Rural Fire Service said only \"on 18 January under the influence of extreme fire weather, the McIntyre's Hut fire broke to the west across the Goodradigbee River in at least two locations [late morning]\". Mr Cheney said yesterday he made further investigations of reports that breakaways had occured across the Goodradigbee River, which was being used as the western containment line for the McIntyre's Hut fire on January 17.He told the inquiry that some time around midday on January 17 the western edge of the McIntyre's Hut fire broke away across the Goodradigbee River, where crews were patrolling by foot.</p><p>That breakaway was contained but another breakaway across the river occured in the vicinity of McIntyre's Hut some time before 9.30pm.Mr Cheney said the breakawayon the western side burned towards the south behind the main fire on January 18.It then burned eastwards between the earlier breakawayfrom the eastern perimeterof the McIntyre's Hut fire and the northern flank of the Bendora fire in the ACT.The rapidly moving \"centre\"fire crossed Namatjira Drive behind Mount Arawang about 4pm.\"There may have been some variation in there but it appeared to be pretty consistentand maintaining a rate of spread of 20km per hour, which is the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere to my knowledge,\" Mr Cheney said.The inquiry has been adjourned until September 7.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-2293580</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2004</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4D63-4Y30-0045-5413-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"385\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2004 The Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited</copyright><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"08\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>August 28, 2004 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N923120MQ</classCode><className>CORONERS COURTS &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

For example, Tinker Bell deliberately flashing her knickers, or all those topless mermaids. Sure, there was strategic hair placement, but there was also some serious aquatic side-boob.</p><p>Like Mickey Rourke, Peter Pan hasn't aged that gracefully. I'd never picked up that P. Pan was actually a bit of a dick, pitting Wendy against the mermaids, against charming racist stereotype Tiger Lily.</p><p>With adult eyes, there's a lot that's a little off about the movie. At the beginning of the film, Mr Darling displays some serious anger-management issues, and then he and his wife leave their children in the care of a St Bernard wearing a hat. In the '50s, dog-based child care may have been fine, but these days it would get you a visit from a child protection officer.</p><p>Of course, my son didn't care about any of that. He just wanted to see the pirates, but even they gave me conniptions, with Captain Hook casually murdering another pirate just for singing. As someone who is easily annoyed by off-key warbling, I could sympathise, but if my son picks up that attitude, my husband is in grave danger.</p><p>I had rosy memories of that other classic Bambi, with it's wobbly-legged fawn and adorable bunny chum Thumper. Revisiting it a few years ago, I was shocked by the horror: Bambi's mother gets killed by hunters, Bambi gets shot, and there's a fatal forest fire. Then there's the most gruesome part of all: Thumper succumbs to a bout of myxomatosis and becomes a zombie, then Bambi gets infected, and they eat all the hunters.</p><p>I thought maybe we'd have more luck with a modern children's film. Now, there are some kids' movies (Toy Story, Up) you can happily go to without a child in tow. Dinosaur Train: Dinosaur Big City is not one of them. How is that even a proper title, for a start? It's like terrible fridge poetry.</p><p>For those of you who aren't staff members to an under-five, Dinosaur Train is basically about Buddy, a young tyrannosaurus, who's been taken in by pteranodons (flying reptile things), without any acknowledgement that, at some point in later life, he's going to treat his adopted family as hors d'oeuvres.</p><p>To get round that whole the-interesting-dinosaurs-didn't-all-live-in-the-same-era conundrum, there's a time travelling train that picks them all up, so they can hang out together. I hope I haven't made that sound too interesting, because DT:DBC is cheesy and tedious, and made me want to jam my hand in a door. By the end of it, I was longing for some Peter Pan-style inappropriateness, or Bambi's hunters to take out some of these flying reptiles.</p><p>We finally hit the jackpot with Monsters University, which is the prequel to Monsters, Inc. It turns out that explaining the idea of a prequel to a little kid is quite tricky. In the end I went with: \"They finished telling the story in the first movie, but then they wanted to make some more money.\"</p><p>My son just couldn't get the concept that this was a story about Mike Wazowski (one-eyed pea creature) and Sully (Mardi Gras yeti) when they were younger, so explained it to himself as \"They're just pretending to be other people\", and we left it at that.</p><p>The animation is beautiful (and incredible), the voice work is fantastic and there are the requisite good gags for grown-ups. Initially, I worried the monsters' scariness might actually be too scary, but Digby lapped it all up, and loved every minute. So, after that success, we've decided to relax. Next week we're taking him to see World War Z.</p><p>You can follow Cal on Twitter: @calbo</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-6awdunmm13415b87xbz7</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58W0-50V1-JD34-V1C0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>July 12, 2013 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Melbourne</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Culture/Literature/Childrens Literature</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Culture/Film</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Population Groups/Age Groups/Children</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VKZ</classCode><className>FILM GENRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001177</classCode><className>MOVIE REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N624400CC</classCode><className>CHILD CARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DA0C</classCode><className>RACISM &amp; XENOPHOBIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VKZ</classCode><className>FILM GENRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001177</classCode><className>MOVIE REVIEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He found an eerie wasteland of deserted farms and ghost towns. But people still work there.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IT IS snowing in the Ukraine and the road to Chernobyl, 130 kilometres north of the capital, Kiev, is pristine white.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fields and tall forests of pine and oak slide past on either side as we slow to pass a horse and haycart, driven by two peasants clad in thick, black coats to keep out the cold.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It could be a rural scene from a century ago, or even just 10 years ago, when this region was the bread basket of the former Soviet Union.</p><p>But life has changed dramatically here ever since reactor number four at the Chernobyl nuclear power station exploded in the first hours of 26 April 1986, showering caesium 137 and other radioactive fallout over central Europe, Scandinavia and Britain.</p><p>Now, no one dares eat the fruit on the trees or the fish in the streams around Chernobyl and the countryside has become a wasteland, a land of ghost towns and deserted farms.</p><p>Officially it is called the \"Exclusion Zone\" _ a no-go area extending in a 30-kilometre circle around the Chernobyl nuclear power station, near the border with Byelorussia.</p><p>But to everyone in the Ukraine, it's known simply as \"the zone\". It is a place of warped humor and knowing smiles, where alcohol is banned but vodka appears from under the table the moment guests or visitors arrive.</p><p>With the vodka come the wry jokes about radiation. Take a full bottle of vodka and follow each shot with a red wine chaser. When the vodka bottle is empty you won't need to worry about radiation.</p><p>The Russians call the zone \"the land of alienation\". The Ukrainians call the people who have worked in it \"the liquidators\". In both countries, the word \"sarcophagus\" now refers to only one thing _ the zone's epicentre, the concrete and metal coffin of Chernobyl's reactor number four.</p><p>The scientists say no one will ever live in the zone again, though criminals and outlaws are said to roam its \"forbidden forests\".</p><p>About 800 former residents have also moved back to their villages inside the zone, defying repeated attempts by guards to drive them away.</p><p>They are mostly older people without children who say, \"we are going to die soon anyway, we want to die in our own homes\".</p><p>TO ENTER the zone requires official permission, which usually takes a week of tangling with the Soviet-inspired bureaucracy.</p><p>We have the help of Valentina Pastushyna, who is the chairwoman of the Kiev branch of the Ukraine Republican Society of the Children of Chernobyl, the public organisation which has helped arrange eight visits to Australia by children affected by the Chernobyl disaster.</p><p>She has managed to organise our permit in just three hours. She tells us to bring our passports; we might also need some US dollars.</p><p>We are joined on our journey into the zone by the imposing figure of Giorgy Batula, who heads the Chernobyl Committee, a public organisation set up to unite all who were evacuated and suffered, including the liquidators.</p><p>Giorgy and Valentina are both former residents of Pripyat, a city of high-rise apartments housing 58,000 people, three kilometres from the reactor. It was evacuated in the days after the explosion. This is a rare chance for them to return.</p><p>Giorgy was the deputy chief of construction in Pripyat, an important person in what was a growing city. Valentina is meeting her husband Sergei, who works in Chernobyl village designing automated machinery that will replace jobs now done manually at the reactor plant. Like most of the 6000 people employed in the zone, he works two weeks on, two weeks off. During his shift, he lives 40 kilometres away in a dormitory suburb and commutes daily by bus. No one is allowed to live full-time in the zone.</p><p>We arrive at the 30-kilometre gate, where the zone begins, and are told we must transfer to an approved vehicle. As a precuation against contamination, there are two types. One is allowed to travel inside the 30-kilometre zone but not into the 10-kilometre inner zone around the reactor. The other can travel inside both zones, but can never leave the 30-kilometre perimeter.</p><p>Giorgy has shown the guards our authorisation to enter and we are soon driving off in a battered green van towards Chernobyl village, 18 kilometres from the reactor.</p><p>Chernobyl was once a pretty village of farm cottages and fruit trees.</p><p>Now it is overgrown and abandoned, except for a few hundred people who travel here daily to work in administration. It lies at the end of a narrow road lined with forests, flanked by signs warning against throwing cigarette butts and matches out the window. The trees hold so much radiation, mainly in their bark, that authorities fear any forest fire would send clouds of radiation into the atmosphere In the village's central square stands a large statue of Lenin. I try to ask Valentina why it hasn't been pulled down. This has been a common fate of communist heroes elsewhere in the former Soviet Union.</p><p>But she doesn't understand. I make out as if to kick the statue. This she does understand and immediately nods and bursts into laughter. It is not clear how much of a catalyst the Chernobyldisaster was for the Ukraine's push for independence, but it certainly played a part.</p><p>We visit three different buildings for clearance and then pick up Valentina's husband, Sergei, and Nikolai Anysimov, an interpreter who has worked at Chernobyl for the past two years.</p><p>Nikolai worked at the petroleum institute in Kiev with American and British oil experts until the money ran out in 1990.</p><p>\"With the coming of perestroika, the institute's research functions broke down. So I had to find some work and finally I came here,\" Nikolai says, as we drive off towards the reactor.</p><p>\"These were agricultural lands before the accident. Now it is only wild grass. There are no activities here.\"</p><p>Down the road he points to a collection of mounds a few hundred metres away.</p><p>\"A village called Kopache existed here before the accident. It was so badly contaminated that it was decided to break up all the houses and bury them into the ground. A few buildings survived. Now it's only grass and shrubbery. After they finished, they buried the bulldozers that buried the village.</p><p>\"The same happened with the forests. The main radiation attack was like a narrow tongue. One part of the forest still lives. Right next to it, trees died within days. They turned yellow and red and their pine needles fell off. These trees have been felled and buried in the ground.\"</p><p>We pass nuclear reactors five and six which were under construction at the time of the explosion. Everything has been left as it was _ cranes hang motionless over the unfinished reactor towers. Trucks, buses, helicopters and building materials lie abandoned by the road. No one dares touch them.</p><p>Steam rises over water ducts coming from the two nuclear reactors that still operate. A third is under repair after a fire.</p><p>Nikolai points to a lake, which is the main water supply, and cracks a joke. \"It's very abundant in fish. Very large fish,\" he laughs.</p><p>\"But very much contaminated. By the way, we have found no cases of fish with two heads.\"</p><p>Reactor four was entombed in walls of concrete and metal five metres thick after the accident. Hence its name, the sarcophagus. But there are cracks and fissures in the casing. Nikolai says scientists have told him gaps were left deliberately so that air could get inside.</p><p>We stop in car park 300 metres from the sarcophagus. It has a sinister presence, borne out by Nikolai's firm instructions not to go near the fence where radiation is 10 times higher.</p><p>\"We will not stay here long, maybe three minutes for some photos.</p><p>Because, you know, this is not a good place to be.\"</p><p>I am anxious that we leave even sooner. Nikolai says scientists still do not have a clear understanding of what caused the explosion and some believe there could still be fuel burning inside.</p><p>\"There was a desire to produce more power, so there were overloads to the equipment. Then, they began to carry out some experiments, which were periodically performed at the plant. There were personnel who did not have the proper attitude. There were many other possible causes.\"</p><p>Before we leave, Nikolai points to a sign on a wall opposite the sarcophagus, put there by the Russians who built the plant. It reads: \"We shall come to the victory of communism.\"</p><p>\"Some scientists here are very pessimistic about the sarcophagus,\" Nikolai says. \"They say no one knows what will happen to it in the next half an hour, let alone the next 100 years. Everyone says the whole structure is shabby and not too stable and it will only stand for 10 years.\"</p><p>A plan to encase the sarcophagus in a larger dome of glass and ceramic has been developed by the French. This should last for 100 years.</p><p>\"If men go inside the sarcophagus in protective suits it is only for a very short time,\" Nikolai says. \"Mostly the data comes from the several hundred sensors installed inside.</p><p>Men who removed fuel and other debris from the reactor after the accident were allowed to work inside for only 30 seconds. For that, they earned a week's wages and a holiday in Kiev.</p><p>The main danger now is from background radiation and from contaminated land and groundwater. Nikolai says the radioactive debris fell in patches and some areas outside the zone are more contaminated than areas inside.</p><p>\"We have just gone over a hot patch in the road,\" laughs Nikolai, as we drive away. \"But it's OK. We were going fast.\"</p><p>The gathering darkness accentuates the eeriness of entering Pripyat, just three kilometres from the reactor. It is surely the largest ghost city on earth.</p><p>Before the accident, Pripyat housed 58,000 people in its high-rise apartments. Now it is empty, its residents were evacuated in the days after the explosion.</p><p>Think of the high-rise units in Collingwood; scatter dozens of derelict cars, trucks and buses around; take away all the people; and multiply it all 10 times. Then you have Pripyat.</p><p>Valentina and Giorgy point out their former homes. They are both very emotional at this point and Giorgy wipes tears from his eyes.</p><p>During our previous few days in Kiev, Valentina had taken us to visit several homes of families who were residents of Pripyat and victims of the Chernobyl accident. With Mrs Zina Botte, the Ukraine Consul for Melbourne, acting as interpreter, we were told many tragic stories, such as that of Klava and Leonid Pilypeyko and their children Sergei and Svetlana, who now live in the Kiev suburb of Vyshgorod.</p><p>Klava was bedridden for a year. Her arms, legs and face were swollen.</p><p>So were her thyroid glands, which were eventually removed in an operation in 1990. Now she takes thyroxine tablets daily. \"I thought I was going to die,\" she says.</p><p>Leonid, too, has enlarged thyroid glands and the doctors have told him his heart is weakened. Their son, Sergei, also has enlarged thyroid glands and suffers respiratory problems. He goes to school one week on, one week off. Their daughter, Svetlana, suffers similarly.</p><p>Svetlana was one of the Chernobyl children recently stranded in Australia who were flown home for free by Lauda Air.</p><p>Klava said Pripyat before the accident was a paradise, a place full of colorful roses and children playing on swings. She believes the Chernobylexplosion and aftermath was foretold in the apocalyptic writings in the Revelation of St John, the last book of the New Testament. \"There will be a heaven, but you won't be able to eat any of the fruit,\" she said.</p><p>Luba Sirosh was born 10 kilometres from Chernobyl and lived her entire life there until two days after the accident. She remembers her parents' farmhouse, where she grew up with eight brothers and sisters, as a \"house full of laughter\".</p><p>Luba said the explosion buried her eldest brother. Now her younger brother is also sick. She does not know how to help him.</p><p>Luba's father is also buried near Chernobyl village. She grieves that she cannot return to pluck the grass from his grave and lay flowers there. Like most former residents of Chernobyl and Pripyat, she knows she will never go back.</p><p>Officially, 42 people have died as a result of the Chernobyl disaster.</p><p>But the real figure could be hundreds or even thousands.</p><p>Giorgy peers through the gloom at Pripyat's empty apartments. He says a total of 130,000 people were evacuated from the towns, villages and farms around Chernobyl. \"There are 68,000 people now registered as sick due to Chernobyl. They have different illnesses; the most common is swollen thyroid glands. There are already many cancers.\"</p><p>Nikolai says scientists believe that most radiation-induced cancers will not show up for eight to 10 years after the accident, which is a year or two from now.</p><p>Valentina expects that the victims of Chernobyl will die prematurely.</p><p>\"Every slight illness sends fear through them ... that they are dying. Many children know they are sick, but don't really understand why.\"</p><p>She says all survivors have regular medical check-ups. This is partly so that doctors can monitor the effects of radiation. But while the hospitals treating the sick are clean and warm, much of the medical equipment doesn't work and there is a chronic shortage of medicines.</p><p>Even having simple vitamin supplements would help.</p><p>IT SEEMS incomprehensible that people already affected by radiation would voluntarily chose go back to work inside the zone.</p><p>Leonid Pilypeyko, who works at Chernobyl, just shrugged when I asked this question in Vyshgorod the day before. \"There is very high unemployment in the Ukraine,\" he replied, \"and there is a stigma against employing Chernobyl victims. It's a job and we get extra money and benefits, such as free public transport.\"</p><p>Giorgy Batula, too, returned to work inside the zone for six years as a supply manager and in the militia. A year ago he left to take up his job with the Chernobyl Committee in Kiev. \"Sure, I'm happy,\" he says, when I ask him if he's glad to have left the zone.</p><p>Before we leave Pripyat, we are surprised to see lights on in one tall building. It's the former Pripyat Hotel. Nikolai can't resist another joke. \"It's the hotel with the largest number of vacancies in Europe,\" he laughs.</p><p>There is a decontamination team working there. Nearby, scientists have built a greenhouse to study the effects of radiation on plants. The entire zone has become a giant laboratory for scientists.</p><p>\"There are now many wild animals inside the zone _ wild boar, deer, foxes, wolves, rabbits, dogs _ much more than previously because there is no activity here, no industries,\" says Nikolai. \"Swedish scientists come with rifles and go around the forest shooting deer and wild boar. They take samples from their flesh, meat and intestines to determine radiation levels and compare it to animals in Sweden.\"</p><p>Nikolai is not worried about the radiation in the zone. \"At first I was. But now I've got accustomed to it, like most people here.\"</p><p>He says the authorities are very strict about who enters the zone and what is taken out. It's part of the image promoted by the nuclear industry about Chernobyl _ that the accident was a disaster, but that the danger was contained.</p><p>Security was tightened last October, when officials announced that a small quantity of nuclear fuel was stolen from Chernobyl.</p><p>As we leave Pripyat in total darkness and arrive at the gate denoting the 10-kilometre inner zone around the reactor plant, the guard in his cubbyhouse on the gate is sound alseep.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-1520120202</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VYG-N2V1-JBJ7-N3W2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2586\"/><timeReceived>10:46 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

The language of low, moderate, extreme, high extreme is considered best to explain that scenario.\"</p><p>Mr Rees admitted one of the CFA's \"core responsibilities\" was to warn communities and it had done so \"to the best of our abilities\".</p><p>Mr Rush said an infra-red aerial scan took a snapshot of the Kilmore East fire at 12.33pm on February 7, which was relayed to the Integrated Emergency Coordination Centre in Melbourne. From the image, a fire behaviouralist mapped the path the fire would likely take between 2pm and 9pm, taking into account the south-west wind change.</p><p>Kinglake, Kinglake West, Strathewen, Pheasant Creek and St Andrews were all in the potential impact zone.</p><p>But, the commission heard, it was 5.55pm before an urgent threat message was issued for Kinglake and just 35 minutes later the town was under attack.</p><p>Of the 173 people killed by the savage fires, 159 died in the Kinglake region. Kinglake itself lost 38 residents and Strathewen lost 27.</p><p>When asked if an alert message could have been issued for Kinglake earlier, Mr Rees said: \"There was smoke in the sky, there was a whole lot of things happening, there was a whole lot of activity around, in terms of fire in the district, and our message is very clear, that we get and give as much information as we have available\".</p><p>Asked why he did not issue a radio warning about the danger until 7.45pm on Black Saturday, he said it had not been his responsibility.</p><p>Mr Rees said it was up to local incident control centres to decide what messages were given out.</p><p>No one in Victoria had a legal responsibility to warn the community about fire dangers, he said.</p><p>Under intense questioning, he said the community had \"a responsibility as well to obtain information and make judgements\".</p><p>The royal commission, chaired by Justice Bernard Teague, continues today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: John Rush, QC, left, questions CFA chief Russell Rees at the royal commission yesterday.

Then the ash started to fall and my daughter thought it was a volcano.</p><p> \"We'd never seen anything like it. There was no warning at all.\"</p><p> She said her washing was covered in fine grey ash and her curtains and bed linen wreaked of smoke from the fire she estimated to be 5km away.</p><p> However, her major concern was the roof of the family home, the only collection point for the household water.</p><p> \"We all rely on tanks up here and have to be careful that our water does not become contaminated,\" Ms McCallum said.</p><p> \"We can't filter it. Forest fire ash is very fine and washes straight into the tank with the next shower of rain.\"</p><p> Unable to control her anger she contacted the Geeveston district ForestryTasmania office and blasted the local authorities. The offer to clean the roof was immediate. After further negotiation the corporation yesterday offered to replace the McCallums' tank water.</p><p> The same offer stood for their neighbours who were similarly affected.</p><p> Ms McCallum intends spreading the word about Forestry Tasmania's conciliatory move to the other 14 households in her immediate neighbourhood of Sheoak Rd.</p><p> And given the almost truce-like conditions, she plans to tackle the corporation on a couple of other fronts -- water quality in nearby Judd Creek and a more economic and environmentally friendly disposal plan for wood stockpiled for regeneration burns.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-MER0204171003171016</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEMERCURY,HOBALTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:45KY-P8F0-015H-925W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"353\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>April 17, 2002, Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>STX000195</classCode><className>BOMBS &amp; EXPLOSIVE DEVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DQY1</classCode><className>GREEN ECONOMY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The delay caused the film to be pirated widely in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Burke's comment shows the importance Australian distributors place on school holidays and films targeted at kids and families when it comes to doing big box office business.</p><p>The LEGO Movie was held for the prime Easter school holiday period and its $30 million gross is the biggest for any 2014 release so far.</p><p>But if not for the proliferation of illegal downloads, that gross would more likely sit in the $35-$40 million range.</p><p>Over the past three years, G and PG-rated films have, on average, accounted for more than 26 per cent of the total box office takings in Australia.</p><p>While not all G and PG films are specifically targeted at kids (oldies' favourite The Hundred-Foot Journey is one recent PG example), kids' titles do make up a good proportion of those films.</p><p>M-rated films (not recommended for children under 15) have also become a mainstay of the school holidays, especially given the surge of young-adult novel -adaptations in the wake of the Twilight and Hunger Games franchises.</p><p>Movies rated M which have successfully targeted school holiday windows this year include Divergent, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><p>Ian Sutherland, Group Director of Marketing at the national chain Event Cinemas, said school holiday periods saw a flurry of kids' movies hit the cinemas.</p><p>\"During one of the busiest periods of the year, families can frequent our cinemas multiple times, catching as many new-release flicks as time allow,\" he said.</p><p>In the past week, the most in-demand titles at the cinema have been teen-friendly fare: The Maze Runner, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Into the Storm.</p><p>In the post-LEGO landscape, Village Roadshow has vowed to go day-and-date with US releases in future; and Burke believes fellow distributors 20th Century Fox and Universal will follow suit.</p><p>And whether this will mean Aussie kids can no longer -expect a flood of animation and adventure into cinemas every school holidays remains to be seen.</p><p>In the upcoming Christmas/New Year period the new -release movies will include: Paddington (yes, the bear); Annie; Big Hero 6; Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb; Penguins of Madagascar (a funny flick following the -successful Madagascar -series) and what will be an Aussie -favourite, Paper Planes, a 3D family drama film starring Sam Worthington and Anthony -LaPaglia.</p><p>BOXTROLLS (PG) This stop-motion animation is about a young orphan raised by sewer-dwelling trash collectors, as he tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator. The film is a strikingly animated production.</p><p>THE GIVER (M) The best aspects of this intriguing future-shock drama will go over the heads of kids under 10. But there's plenty of food-for-thought for the rest of the youth demographic. Rated M and now showing everywhere.</p><p>MAGIC (G) A loveable homeless cat sneaks into a mysterious mansion owned by retired magician Lawrence. The House of Magic, a beautifully rendered animation, is a cheery, quick-paced bundle of fun for the under-10 gang.</p><p>MAZE RUNNER (M) Dropped into a giant maze with other boys, Thomas learns he will have to team up with other \"runners\" to escape. The M-rating is fully warranted but for boys 10 and over, this gripping chase flick will be their must-see movie.</p><p>PLANES (G) Planes : Fire &amp; Rescue is a a dramatic improvement upon a so-so original. When Dusty learns his engine is damaged and he may never race again, he joins a forest fire and rescue unit to be trained as a firefighter.</p><p>TARZAN (PG) The tale of a boy raised by apes, showing at Dendy, has been a family favourite for generations. This animated version sees Tarzan and Jane facing a mercenary army dispatched by the CEO of Greystoke Energies.</p><p>NINJA TURTLES The Turtles are back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles but this time not as family friendly with the M-rated combat scenes too violent and threatening for many children, coupled with sleazy asides by Turtles co-star Megan Fox.</p><p>BEARS (G) The Land Of The Bears is an animal documentary which gives an engaging and rare look into the lives of brown bears on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula. The 600kg stars of the show are a fascinating species. Great for the whole family.</p><p>GUARDIANS (M) Guardians of the Galaxy is a sci-fi adventure-comedy about group of reformed space criminals who work together to stop a fanatic from destroying the galaxy. Most scenes (save from an occasional explosion) are inside the all-ages zone.</p><p>SHARK 3DThe Great White Shark 3D nature documentary, showing at the IMAX Theatre in Darling Harbour, gives a breathtaking encounter with the predator we love to fear. Shot at Great White hotspots the world over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-The Telegraph20140927Telegraph320000120238911</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D7M-09X1-F0JP-W3PB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 27, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0005A8H</classCode><className>VILLAGE ROADSHOW LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp;

Though not in Gran Turismo's league, it's on the way there.</p><p>Like the better-developed titles, Off Road Wide Open has first-rate scenery and vehicle graphics. The Americana \"garage\" houses Jeep (1970 CJ-5 and 2001 Wrangler), Chevrolet (1975 K10 Blazer and 2001 Silverado ute), Dodge (2001 Durango and 2001 Ram 2500 ute), Ford (1966 Bronco and 2001 F150 ute) and a pair of Hummers (soft-top and wagon). The vehicles start out in basic form, with upgrades to \"modified\", \"pro\" and \"unlimited\" dependent upon success in the game.</p><p>Three venues are available: Moab National Park in Utah, Yosemite National Park in California, and one merely listed as Hawaii. They're well rendered, with unexpected treats such as a freshly extinguished Yosemite forest fire (complete with spot fires and plenty of smoke) and some freshly cooled - in part - lava next to an active volcano in Hawaii.</p><p>Sadly the realism seems to taper off - rapidly - about here. Driving physics are at times weird, going from the sort of response you'd expect from a big 4WD with some weight and a high centre of gravity to Gran Turismo-like grip in a matter of seconds. Vehicles return to the upright as easily as they roll, and perhaps, thankfully, there's no representation of damage, which would add more realism. Especially since the vehicles will handle 350-metre vertical drops with aplomb. Certainly more than a human spine can withstand.</p><p>Apart from the questionable physics, another considerable dislike is one more American-accented \"CHECKPOINT!\" shouted during races. It even sounds like the same voice heard in rival game Burnout!</p><p>Though not of simulation quality, there's enough depth of game-play in Off Road Wide Open to keep you entertained a while.</p><p>RATING: 7/10</p><p>PLATFORM: Sony PlayStation 2</p><p>RETAIL PRICE: $99.95</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P0N-6DB0-TXN5-S34X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yidjtzblw4uuxvg51i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2002</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"324\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2002 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"02\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>February 7, 2002 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008X9S</classCode><className>PRODUCT REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A39R</classCode><className>COMPUTER SOFTWARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009S73</classCode><className>SOFTWARE SERVICES &amp; APPLICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001912</classCode><className>RETAIL &amp; WHOLESALE TRADE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS127</classCode><className>HAWAII, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS160</classCode><className>UTAH, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The delay caused the film to be pirated widely in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Burke's comment shows the importance Australian distributors place on school holidays and films targeted at kids and families when it comes to doing big box office business.</p><p>The LEGO Movie was held for the prime Easter school holiday period and its $30 million gross is the biggest for any 2014 release so far.</p><p>But if not for the proliferation of illegal downloads, that gross would more likely sit in the $35-$40 million range.</p><p>Over the past three years, G and PG-rated films have, on average, accounted for more than 26 per cent of the total box office takings in Australia.</p><p>While not all G and PG films are specifically targeted at kids (oldies' favourite The Hundred-Foot Journey is one recent PG example), kids' titles do make up a good proportion of those films.</p><p>M-rated films (not recommended for children under 15) have also become a mainstay of the school holidays, especially given the surge of young-adult novel -adaptations in the wake of the Twilight and Hunger Games franchises.</p><p>Movies rated M which have successfully targeted school holiday windows this year include Divergent, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><p>Ian Sutherland, Group Director of Marketing at the national chain Event Cinemas, said school holiday periods saw a flurry of kids' movies hit the cinemas.</p><p>\"During one of the busiest periods of the year, families can frequent our cinemas multiple times, catching as many new-release flicks as time allow,\" he said.</p><p>In the past week, the most in-demand titles at the cinema have been teen-friendly fare: The Maze Runner, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Into the Storm.</p><p>In the post-LEGO landscape, Village Roadshow has vowed to go day-and-date with US releases in future; and Burke believes fellow distributors 20th Century Fox and Universal will follow suit.</p><p>And whether this will mean Aussie kids can no longer -expect a flood of animation and adventure into cinemas every school holidays remains to be seen.</p><p>In the upcoming Christmas/New Year period the new -release movies will include: Paddington (yes, the bear); Annie; Big Hero 6; Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb; Penguins of Madagascar (a funny flick following the -successful Madagascar -series) and what will be an Aussie -favourite, Paper Planes, a 3D family drama film starring Sam Worthington and Anthony -LaPaglia.</p><p>BOXTROLLS (PG) This stop-motion animation is about a young orphan raised by sewer-dwelling trash collectors, as he tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator. The film is a strikingly animated production.</p><p>THE GIVER (M) The best aspects of this intriguing future-shock drama will go over the heads of kids under 10. But there's plenty of food-for-thought for the rest of the youth demographic. Rated M and now showing everywhere.</p><p>MAGIC (G) A loveable homeless cat sneaks into a mysterious mansion owned by retired magician Lawrence. The House of Magic, a beautifully rendered animation, is a cheery, quick-paced bundle of fun for the under-10 gang.</p><p>MAZE RUNNER (M) Dropped into a giant maze with other boys, Thomas learns he will have to team up with other \"runners\" to escape. The M-rating is fully warranted but for boys 10 and over, this gripping chase flick will be their must-see movie.</p><p>PLANES (G) Planes : Fire &amp; Rescue is a a dramatic improvement upon a so-so original. When Dusty learns his engine is damaged and he may never race again, he joins a forest fire and rescue unit to be trained as a firefighter.</p><p>TARZAN (PG) The tale of a boy raised by apes, showing at Dendy, has been a family favourite for generations. This animated version sees Tarzan and Jane facing a mercenary army dispatched by the CEO of Greystoke Energies.</p><p>NINJA TURTLES The Turtles are back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles but this time not as family friendly with the M-rated combat scenes too violent and threatening for many children, coupled with sleazy asides by Turtles co-star Megan Fox.</p><p>BEARS (G) The Land Of The Bears is an animal documentary which gives an engaging and rare look into the lives of brown bears on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula. The 600kg stars of the show are a fascinating species. Great for the whole family.</p><p>GUARDIANS (M) Guardians of the Galaxy is a sci-fi adventure-comedy about group of reformed space criminals who work together to stop a fanatic from destroying the galaxy. Most scenes (save from an occasional explosion) are inside the all-ages zone.</p><p>SHARK 3DThe Great White Shark 3D nature documentary, showing at the IMAX Theatre in Darling Harbour, gives a breathtaking encounter with the predator we love to fear. Shot at Great White hotspots the world over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-The Telegraph20140927Telegraph20000120232007</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D77-6671-JD3N-54MY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"825\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 27, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0005A8H</classCode><className>VILLAGE ROADSHOW LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"80\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp;

You can't go and fight a war with a part-time army.</p><p>\"You need fully trained professional firefighters to prepare us, and the resources are not there.\"</p><p>The department's secretary, Greg Wilson, acknowledged the department was reviewing its staffing levels.</p><p>\"We've got staffing submissions before the Government that go to questions about resources into the future, which I'm unable to talk about from a cabinet and confidence point of view,\" he said.</p><p>\"But we're certainly building our resources, building our capability and getting better at it.</p><p>\"The Government will want to look at the findings of the commission and a whole range of other factors, I suspect, before it makes definitive decisions about resources in response to the proposals that we've put to them recently.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-2825377</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7XV5-MXW1-2RG7-21FR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><timeReceived>1:29 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>February 20, 2010 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Ballarat 3350</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Bendigo 3550</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Marysville 3779</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Sale 3850</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Event</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Event/ROYAL COMMISSION.

The delay caused the film to be pirated widely in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Burke's comment shows the importance Australian distributors place on school holidays and films targeted at kids and families when it comes to doing big box office business.</p><p>The LEGO Movie was held for the prime Easter school holiday period and its $30 million gross is the biggest for any 2014 release so far.</p><p>But if not for the proliferation of illegal downloads, that gross would more likely sit in the $35-$40 million range.</p><p>Over the past three years, G and PG-rated films have, on average, accounted for more than 26 per cent of the total box office takings in Australia.</p><p>While not all G and PG films are specifically targeted at kids (oldies' favourite The Hundred-Foot Journey is one recent PG example), kids' titles do make up a good proportion of those films.</p><p>M-rated films (not recommended for children under 15) have also become a mainstay of the school holidays, especially given the surge of young-adult novel adaptations in the wake of the Twilight and Hunger Games franchises.</p><p>Movies rated M which have successfully targeted school holiday windows this year include Divergent, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. Ian Sutherland, Group Director of Marketing at the national chain Event Cinemas, said school holiday periods saw a flurry of kids' movies hit the cinemas.</p><p>\"During one of the busiest periods of the year, families can frequent our cinemas multiple times, catching as many new-release flicks as time allow,\" he said.</p><p>In the past week, the most in-demand titles at the cinema have been teen-friendly fare: The Maze Runner, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Into the Storm. In the post-LEGO landscape, Village Roadshow has vowed to go day-and-date with US releases in future; and Burke believes fellow distributors 20th Century Fox and Universal will follow suit.</p><p>And whether this will mean Aussie kids can no longer expect a flood of animation and adventure into cinemas every school holidays remains to be seen.</p><p>In the upcoming Christmas/ New Year period the new release movies will include: Paddington (yes, the bear); Annie; Big Hero 6; Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb; Penguins of Madagascar (a funny flick following the successful Madagascar series) and what will be an Aussie favourite, Paper Planes, a 3D family drama film starring Sam Worthington and Anthony LaPaglia.</p><p>GUARDIANS (M) Guardians of the Galaxy is a sci-fi adventure-comedy about group of reformed space criminals who work together to stop a fanatic from destroying the galaxy.</p><p>Most scenes (save from an occasional explosion) are inside the all-ages zone.</p><p>BOXTROLLS (PG) This stop-motion animation is about a young orphan raised by sewer-dwelling trash collectors, as he tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator. The film is a strikingly animated production.</p><p>THE GIVER (M) The best aspects of this intriguing future-shock drama will go over the heads of kids under 10. But there's plenty of foodfor- thought for the rest of the youth demographic. Rated M and now showing everywhere.</p><p>MAGIC (G) A loveable homeless cat sneaks into a mysterious mansion owned by retired magician Lawrence. The House of Magic, a beautifully rendered animation, is a cheery, quick-paced bundle of fun for the under-10 gang.</p><p>MAZE RUNNER Dropped into a giant maze with other boys, Thomas learns he will have to team up with other \"runners\" to escape. The M-rating is fully warranted but for boys 10 and over, this gripping chase flick will be their must-see movie.</p><p>PLANES (G) Planes : Fire &amp; Rescue is a a dramatic improvement upon a so-so original. When Dusty learns his engine is damaged and he may never race again, he joins a forest fire and rescue unit to be trained as a firefighter.</p><p>TARZAN (PG) The tale of a boy raised by apes, showing at Dendy, has been a family favourite for generations. This animated version sees Tarzan and Jane facing a mercenary army dispatched by the CEO of Greystoke Energies.</p><p>NINJA TURTLES The Turtles are back in Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles but this time not as family friendly with the M-rated combat scenes too violent and threatening for many children, coupled with sleazy asides by Turtles co-star Megan Fox.</p><p>BEARS (G) The Land Of The Bears is an animal documentary which gives an engaging and rare look into the lives of brown bears on Russia's Kamchatka peninsula. The 600kg stars of the show are a fascinating species. Great for the whole family.</p><p>SHARK 3DThe Great White Shark 3D nature documentary, showing at the IMAX Theatre in Darling Harbour, gives a breathtaking encounter with the predator we love to fear. Shot at Great White hotspots the world over.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GCBULL-Gold Coast Bulletin20140927GoldCoast26000120236041</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QGCBUL2014</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5D7N-2G31-JD3N-5174-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464543</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"823\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2014 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Gold Coast Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><edition>GoldCoast Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2014\"><dateText>September 27, 2014 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>CC0005A8H</classCode><className>VILLAGE ROADSHOW LTD</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002R8Q</classCode><className>FOX ENTERTAINMENT GROUP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"85\"><className>NAICS713110 AMUSEMENT &amp;

So Barnett's ambitions would be tied to his success on the forest issue -- a neat alignment of Coalition and self-interest.</p><p> Barnett has made numerous public pledges not to challenge the Premier, but his extraordinary candour in an interview with The Australian leaves him open to attack.</p><p> Barnett, though, speaks with the confidence of a man with the support of many Liberal colleagues and, importantly, Perth's tight-knit business community.</p><p> Court's deputy knows there will be rivals in the succession race which, if the Coalition manages to scrape over the line to win a third successive term, would begin in earnest on election night.</p><p> Court is no great friend, nor natural ally, of Barnett and, ironically, giving his deputy exactly what he wants might help sink his ambitions.</p><p> Eking out a compromise between the timber industry and conservationists appears a nigh impossible task. Giving Barnett the job might permanently cripple his succession hopes.</p><p> And if Barnett manages to extinguish the forest fire, he probably deserves to be the next premier.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9906294008295412</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4580-5M60-0197-54MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"331\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1999 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"06\" year=\"1999\"><dateText>June 29, 1999, Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000195</classCode><className>BOMBS &amp; EXPLOSIVE DEVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009F93</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX017</classCode><className>PERTH, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The delay caused the film to be pirated widely in Australia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But Burke's comment shows the importance Australian distributors place on school holidays and films targeted at kids and families when it comes to doing big box office business.</p><p>The LEGO Movie was held for the prime Easter school holiday period and its $30 million gross is the biggest for any 2014 release so far.</p><p>But if not for the proliferation of illegal downloads, that gross would more likely sit in the $35-$40 million range.</p><p>Over the past three years, G and PG-rated films have, on average, accounted for more than 26 per cent of the total box office takings in Australia.</p><p>While not all G and PG films are specifically targeted at kids (oldies' favourite The Hundred-Foot Journey is one recent PG example), kids' titles do make up a good proportion of those films.</p><p>M-rated films (not recommended for children under 15) have also become a mainstay of the school holidays, especially given the surge of young-adult novel -adaptations in the wake of the Twilight and Hunger Games franchises.</p><p>Movies rated M which have successfully targeted school holiday windows this year include Divergent, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.</p><p>Ian Sutherland, Group Director of Marketing at the national chain Event Cinemas, said school holiday periods saw a flurry of kids' movies hit the cinemas.</p><p>\"During one of the busiest periods of the year, families can frequent our cinemas multiple times, catching as many new-release flicks as time allow,\" he said.</p><p>In the past week, the most in-demand titles at the cinema have been teen-friendly fare: The Maze Runner, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Into the Storm.</p><p>In the post-LEGO landscape, Village Roadshow has vowed to go day-and-date with US releases in future; and Burke believes fellow distributors 20th Century Fox and Universal will follow suit.</p><p>And whether this will mean Aussie kids can no longer -expect a flood of animation and adventure into cinemas every school holidays remains to be seen.</p><p>In the upcoming Christmas/New Year period the new -release movies will include: Paddington (yes, the bear); Annie; Big Hero 6; Night at the Museum: Secret of the Tomb; Penguins of Madagascar (a funny flick following the -successful Madagascar -series) and what will be an Aussie -favourite, Paper Planes, a 3D family drama film starring Sam Worthington and Anthony -LaPaglia.</p><p>BOXTROLLS (PG) This stop-motion animation is about a young orphan raised by sewer-dwelling trash collectors, as he tries to save his friends from an evil exterminator. The film is a strikingly animated production.</p><p>THE GIVER (M) The best aspects of this intriguing future-shock drama will go over the heads of kids under 10. But there's plenty of food-for-thought for the rest of the youth demographic. Rated M and now showing everywhere.</p><p>MAGIC (G) A loveable homeless cat sneaks into a mysterious mansion owned by retired magician Lawrence. The House of Magic, a beautifully rendered animation, is a cheery, quick-paced bundle of fun for the under-10 gang.</p><p>MAZE RUNNER (M) Dropped into a giant maze with other boys, Thomas learns he will have to team up with other \"runners\" to escape. The M-rating is fully warranted but for boys 10 and over, this gripping chase flick will be their must-see movie.</p><p>PLANES (G) Planes : Fire &amp; Rescue is a a dramatic improvement upon a so-so original.

This six-part comedy stars UK comedian Rob Brydon (left) as English astronomer Dr Paul Hamilton, sent to Broken Hill to take up a position at the Royal Australian Observatory. The joint Australian/British co-production has its moments, but for the most part this fish-out-of-water comedy also feels dated. Kris McQuade, Kat Stewart and Tim Draxl co-star.</p><p>BIOGRAPHY</p><p>Bad Boys</p><p>(7.30pm, Monday-Friday, Biography Channel)</p><p>Premiere. Five-night special, detailing some of the more notorious \"bad boys\". The series kicks off with former US president Bill Clinton (left). Then comes Larry Flynt, Jack Nicholson, Nick Nolte and Mick Jagger. Labelled \"the comeback kid\" because of his ability to triumph over sex scandals and countless setbacks, the Bill Clinton story is a gem.</p><p>HISTORY</p><p>Revival: Saving Our History</p><p>(8.30pm, Wednesday, History Channel)</p><p>Premiere. Hosted by Steve Liebmann (left), this Australian production visits a number of restored buildings across Australia and examines their cultural and historical significance. The history of each building will be told from the point of view of its social and architectural significance. Restored properties featured include Luna Park's carousel and Ballarat's Her Majesty's Theatre.</p><p>REALITY</p><p>Rebel Billionaire</p><p>(7.30pm, Thursday, FOX8)</p><p>Pay premiere. Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson (left) leads 16 young entrepreneurs on a round-the-world reality competition. Sir Richard takes the would-be moguls to international destinations where they tackle challenges that help shape future billionaires. But unknown to the 16 young people they are competing for the biggest prize in reality TV history: the presidency of Virgin</p><p>Worldwide, plus $US1million.</p><p>LIFESTYLE</p><p>Home</p><p>(7.30pm, Wednesday, LifeStyle Channel)</p><p>Brendan Moar, Shannon Fricke and Peter Evans (left) continue their fresh and vibrant look at styling, home, gardens, cooking and casual entertainment. This series of Home recognises that Australia does not exist in a vacuum, but rather is open to influences from all over the world. As a result, the show travels to Japan, Spain, Denmark and Slovenia for some of the latest trends.</p><p>SPECIAL</p><p>Mythbusters</p><p>(10.30pm, Monday, Discovery Channel)</p><p>Hosts Adam Savage and Jamie Hyneman (left) use scientific experiments, special effects and Buster -- one very abused crash-test dummy -- to bust urban myths. This episode sees if an unsuspecting scuba diver can be sucked out of the water by a fire-fighting helicopter and end up in the middle of a forest fire, and if Hollywood's zany car stunts live up to their status. Top series that delivers plenty of entertainment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DHS0510051H11598611</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERALDSUNLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4H81-DY00-015G-T1TY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"448\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"10\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>October 5, 2005 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>DISCOVERY CHANNEL MULTIMEDIA\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0008YVR</classCode><className>ASTRONOMY &amp;

The NSW Coalition government has taken the state from the weakest to the strongest economy in four years. They must be doing something right (\"Baird builds winning lead\", 16/3).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Remember, he is leasing the poles and wires, not selling them. What's more the government retains 51 per cent ownership from day one. What a pity Neville Wran didn't lease the land between Strathfield and the City instead of selling it. We could have had a WestConnex for far less cost. Surely they deserve a second term.</p><p>Ian Neilson Killara</p><p>Grand Prix would be right up Clover's alley Thank you Tim Blair for the humorous start to my Monday morning as I envisage your proposed Formula One circuit should the Australian grand prix ever be held here in Sydney (\"Turning Grand Prix into a demolition derby ... for all the right reasons\", 16/3).</p><p>It brings tremendous joy thinking the course could start and finish right outside Lord Mayor Clover Moore's Redfern house - a better choice could not be made unless it was directly outside the head office of the Sydney Greens.</p><p>The roaring sound of high-revving engines and reeking fumes would no doubt send them into cardiac meltdown.</p><p>David Ingram Randwick</p><p>No truth in unions' poles and wires advertising A former advertising executive told me the other day, \"If I'd told lies in my advertising days like these unions are telling right now, I would have been sued!\" (\"Unions' reckless punt backfires\", 16/3) The Nationals are keeping the regional poles and wires (that's over 90 per cent of the state) in government hands, which really is protecting regional jobs. So what are the unions complaining about? They should be thanking them.</p><p>Also, if power prices more than doubled under the last Labor government, what makes the unions think prices will stay lower under a Labor government again?</p><p>Bruce Thompson Port Macquarie</p><p>Shortsighted to put our trust in private sector Brian Potts asks what's wrong with privatisation (\"Letters, 16/3). In return I ask what business would provide vital resources such as water, electricity, if they couldn't do so at a profit?</p><p>What companies would provide employment for Australians if they could employ overseas staff at a fraction of the cost?</p><p>A government's sole role should be to reallocate resources to where they are needed if the private sector won't provide them.</p><p>The necessities of life shouldn't be provided at a profit but provided as necessary. That's something called society.</p><p>Soon we will have multinationals providing employment for everyone but Australians, which will mean no tax revenue and no expenditure.</p><p>How shortsighted are we?</p><p>Kevan Silver Helensburgh</p><p>The forgotten land to west of the mountains Mike Baird and Luke Foley, while you intend to spend hundreds of millions of dollars revamping the metropolitan area if elected, may I remind you NSW does not end at the top of the Blue Mountains.</p><p>You not have noticed there are two areas west of the mountains. They are called the Central West and the Far West of NSW.</p><p>Believe it or not there are people living in these areas, yet not once have you mentioned in your promises any funding to these areas.</p><p>No mention of any relief for our drought-affected farmers, or funding to repair some of our dodgy roads. Hospitals and education seem to come second best after the big city.</p><p>Your big ideas for more tunnels and bigger motorways to relieve congestion are targeted to the metropolitan area only.</p><p>Get business to come to the country instead of going overseas, and you will relieve the pressure you so much desire and create jobs in the western areas.</p><p>Alan Jones Forbes</p><p>Where were fans to witness Souths miracle?</p><p>The mean, lean Redfern machine was on full display on Sunday afternoon as the South Sydney Rabbitohs performed a second-half miracle to defeat the Sydney Roosters 32-26 (\"Ruthless GI tears Chooks to shreds in thriller\", 16/3).</p><p>Pity though that only 27,289 spectators turned up to watch an enthralling encounter at the 80,000 capacity ANZ Stadium.</p><p>Eric Palm Gympie, Qld</p><p>No one does it better than Jeremy the dinosaur \"Clarkson's career faces extinction\", says the headline (16/3). Well, let me say this. I have no knowledge of the incident that has sparked this forest fire of reporting on the Top Gear prophet, other than what the newspapers have so far reported.</p><p>But what I do know in regards to the man who calls himself a dinosaur is that Jeremy Clarkson has demonstrated to untold millions of men the absolute importance of keeping the \"boy\" in the man.</p><p>No one has perfected it quite the way he has, other than his two apostles, Richard Hammond and James May.</p><p>Clarkson also reminded the world not to take things too seriously, and that driving should be fun as well as an art form, and man and car should come together as one, and that we would be far better off without the cave loads of thought police trying to come up with yet another way to spoil our fun and fine us for doing so.</p><p>Jeremy, you may call yourself a dinosaur, but do the maths, my boy. Dinosaur shows are packing them in all over the world.</p><p>Kids of all ages, including those on aged pension cards like myself, are dying to get close to this, the rarest of cave-dwellers.</p><p>Take a bow, my man.Dave Burt Kingswood</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-The Telegraph20150317Telegraph322000124551722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FHR-YJ51-JD3N-51NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>March 17, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001390</classCode><className>PRIVATIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00009735</classCode><className>ELECTRICITY PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000755</classCode><className>FORMULA ONE RACING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DSD5</classCode><className>ENERGY PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST00090NP</classCode><className>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001648</classCode><className>SUITS &amp; CLAIMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00009735</classCode><className>ELECTRICITY PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DHE4</classCode><className>LAND LEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DSD5</classCode><className>ENERGY PRICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS005</classCode><className>NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Surely they deserve a second term.</p><p>Ian Neilson Killara</p><p>Grand Prix would be right up Clover's alley Thank you Tim Blair for the humorous start to my Monday morning as I envisage your proposed Formula One circuit should the Australian grand prix ever be held here in Sydney (\"Turning Grand Prix into a demolition derby ... for all the right reasons\", 16/3).</p><p>It brings tremendous joy thinking the course could start and finish right outside Lord Mayor Clover Moore's Redfern house - a better choice could not be made unless it was directly outside the head office of the Sydney Greens.</p><p>The roaring sound of high-revving engines and reeking fumes would no doubt send them into cardiac meltdown.</p><p>David Ingram Randwick</p><p>No truth in unions' poles and wires advertising A former advertising executive told me the other day, \"If I'd told lies in my advertising days like these unions are telling right now, I would have been sued!\" (\"Unions' reckless punt backfires\", 16/3) The Nationals are keeping the regional poles and wires (that's over 90 per cent of the state) in government hands, which really is protecting regional jobs. So what are the unions complaining about? They should be thanking them.</p><p>Also, if power prices more than doubled under the last Labor government, what makes the unions think prices will stay lower under a Labor government again?</p><p>Bruce Thompson Port Macquarie</p><p>Shortsighted to put our trust in private sector Brian Potts asks what's wrong with privatisation (\"Letters, 16/3). In return I ask what business would provide vital resources such as water, electricity, if they couldn't do so at a profit?</p><p>What companies would provide employment for Australians if they could employ overseas staff at a fraction of the cost?</p><p>A government's sole role should be to reallocate resources to where they are needed if the private sector won't provide them.</p><p>The necessities of life shouldn't be provided at a profit but provided as necessary. That's something called society.</p><p>Soon we will have multinationals providing employment for everyone but Australians, which will mean no tax revenue and no expenditure.</p><p>How shortsighted are we?</p><p>Kevan Silver Helensburgh</p><p>The forgotten land to west of the mountains Mike Baird and Luke Foley, while you intend to spend hundreds of millions of dollars revamping the metropolitan area if elected, may I remind you NSW does not end at the top of the Blue Mountains.</p><p>You not have noticed there are two areas west of the mountains. They are called the Central West and the Far West of NSW.</p><p>Believe it or not there are people living in these areas, yet not once have you mentioned in your promises any funding to these areas.</p><p>No mention of any relief for our drought-affected farmers, or funding to repair some of our dodgy roads. Hospitals and education seem to come second best after the big city.</p><p>Your big ideas for more tunnels and bigger motorways to relieve congestion are targeted to the metropolitan area only.</p><p>Get business to come to the country instead of going overseas, and you will relieve the pressure you so much desire and create jobs in the western areas.</p><p>Alan Jones Forbes</p><p>Where were fans to witness Souths miracle?</p><p>The mean, lean Redfern machine was on full display on Sunday afternoon as the South Sydney Rabbitohs performed a second-half miracle to defeat the Sydney Roosters 32-26 (\"Ruthless GI tears Chooks to shreds in thriller\", 16/3).</p><p>Pity though that only 27,289 spectators turned up to watch an enthralling encounter at the 80,000 capacity ANZ Stadium.</p><p>Eric Palm Gympie, Qld</p><p>No one does it better than Jeremy the dinosaur \"Clarkson's career faces extinction\", says the headline (16/3). Well, let me say this. I have no knowledge of the incident that has sparked this forest fire of reporting on the Top Gear prophet, other than what the newspapers have so far reported.</p><p>But what I do know in regards to the man who calls himself a dinosaur is that Jeremy Clarkson has demonstrated to untold millions of men the absolute importance of keeping the \"boy\" in the man.</p><p>No one has perfected it quite the way he has, other than his two apostles, Richard Hammond and James May.</p><p>Clarkson also reminded the world not to take things too seriously, and that driving should be fun as well as an art form, and man and car should come together as one, and that we would be far better off without the cave loads of thought police trying to come up with yet another way to spoil our fun and fine us for doing so.</p><p>Jeremy, you may call yourself a dinosaur, but do the maths, my boy. Dinosaur shows are packing them in all over the world.</p><p>Kids of all ages, including those on aged pension cards like myself, are dying to get close to this, the rarest of cave-dwellers.</p><p>Take a bow, my man.Dave Burt Kingswood</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-The Telegraph20150317Telegraph22000124545779</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FHP-XWH1-F0JP-W0C4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-07-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"881\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"03\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>March 17, 2015 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DIJW</classCode><className>PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DL5Q</classCode><className>TYPES OF GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001390</classCode><className>PRIVATIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008X9I</classCode><className>CITY GOVERNMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00009735</classCode><className>ELECTRICITY PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000755</classCode><className>FORMULA ONE RACING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DSD5</classCode><className>ENERGY PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST00090NP</classCode><className>MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001648</classCode><className>SUITS &amp; CLAIMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST00009735</classCode><className>ELECTRICITY PRICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DHE4</classCode><className>LAND LEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX001900</classCode><className>ENERGY &amp; UTILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DSD5</classCode><className>ENERGY PRICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS005</classCode><className>NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Corcoran</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">US space agency NASA is preparing to launch drone missions high in Australian skies during the next six weeks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">NASA is operating an ex-US Air Force RQ-4 Global Hawk Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) - the largest, most sophisticated drone in operational service today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With the wingspan of a Boeing 737 airliner and a flight endurance exceeding 30 hours, the Northrop-Grumman Global Hawk, costing a hefty $US200 million each when fitted out with sophisticated eavesdropping equipment, is designed to circle the globe on secret military Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance (ISR) missions.</p><p>NASA announced that one of two ex-military Global Hawk it operates will conduct scientific missions from the USPacific Island territory of Guam, \"to track changes in the upper atmosphere and help researchers understand how these changes affect Earth's climate\".</p><p>NASA says scientists have installed 13 different instruments on the Global Hawks to capture air samples, and analyse clouds, gases and solar radiation for the <url normalizedValue=\"https://espo.nasa.gov/home/attrex\">Airborne Tropical Tropopause Experiment</url> (ATTREX) flights.</p><p>The Agency has previously launched drones to monitor hurricanes in the Atlantic, gathering data to assist in making more accurate predictions on tropical storms.</p><p>The first mission was due to take off on Tuesday, but NASA did not release details of any flights over Australia.</p><p>Pilots warned to look out for drone until March 2</p><p>However an AirServices Australia routine pilot alert, or NOTAM, indicates that the NASA Global Hawk will operate at short notice in Australian airspace at heights between 45,000 -60,000 feet from January 17 until March 2 this year.</p><p>The NOTAM states that Air Traffic Control will provide \"separation\" in the unlikely event that any local manned aircraft are operating at such extremely high altitudes.</p><p>Airservices Australia yesterday confirmed that the NASA Global Hawk would conduct tropospheric research in Brisbane's Flight Information Region (FIR).</p><p>\"Brisbane's FIR covers an area including northern New South Wales, Queensland, Northern Territory and northern Western Australia plus airspace over the north and north eastern oceans,\" a spokeswoman said.</p><p>\"The Global Hawk will not operate over the Australian mainland or out of Australian airports.</p><p>\"Airservices does not anticipate issuing further NOTAMs for Global Hawk operations.\"</p><p>The NASA missions will launch from the US Air Force's Andersen Air Base in Guam, the headquarters for all US military Global Hawk intelligence gathering operations in the Asia Pacific region.</p><p>US military Global Hawks also periodically deploy on civil missions.</p><p>In 2008 a US Navy Global Hawk <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.af.mil/News/ArticleDisplay/tabid/223/Article/125309/global-hawk-u-2-capture-essential-wildfires-images.aspx\">monitored the progress of a massive forest fire that swept through California</url>, and the US Air Force flew 20 Global Hawk missions in the aftermath of Japan's 2011 tsunami and nuclear crisis, collecting radiation data and imagery over the stricken Fukushima reactor.</p><p>In November 2013 a Global Hawk \u00c2 operated over the typhoon-ravaged southern Philippines in support of relief efforts.</p><p>Designed as an intelligence gatherer</p><p>While Global Hawk is now proving useful in the civil world, the UAV's primary function is as a highly effective global electronic intelligence gathering platform.</p><p>In 2012 US intelligence analyst and author Matthew Aid told the ABC that: \"Almost every day one of the US Air Force Global Hawks based on the island of Guam can be found flying off the North Korean coastline taking pictures of targets deep inside the country that are more detailed than those coming from satellites.</p><p>\"They fly at 60,000 feet, 75 miles off the North Korean coastline, taking grainy shots taken from a 45-degree angle.\"</p><p>Mr Aid says the US and Australia shared much of the highly sensitive signals intelligence gathered by assets such as Global Hawk.</p><p>\"Australia is a member of the so-called Five Eyes intelligence club that also includes the US, the United Kingdom, Canada and New Zealand,\" he said.</p><p>He said that from 2002-05, Iranian diplomats routinely lodged diplomatic protests over US spy drones \"flying daily signals intelligence and imagery collection missions along Iran's borders with Iraq and Afghanistan and along Iran's Persian Gulf coastline\".</p><p>In 2012 ABC News Online reported that the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-04/australia-moves-to-buy-spy-drones/4236544\">US Air Force had flown classified Global Hawk missions from the Royal Australian Air Force at Edinburgh in South Australia from 2001-2006</url>.</p><p>The intelligence gathering flights were revealed by a group of local Adelaide aviation enthusiasts who monitored aircraft radio frequencies.</p><p>The Australian Defence Force is now considering the acquisition of seven large, high altitude, long endurance drones for maritime surveillance and border protection.</p><p>The frontrunner for the $1.5 billion to $3 billion Air7000\u00c2 Defence project is the Triton, a maritime variant of Global Hawk.</p><p>Since winning the 2013 federal election, the Coalition Government has backed away from a\u00c2 promise, made while in Opposition, to fast-track acquisition of Triton.</p><p>Having a NASA Global Hawk in Australian skies may also provide a convenient opportunity to assess if the largest, costliest unmanned aerial vehicle flying today represents value for money.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
