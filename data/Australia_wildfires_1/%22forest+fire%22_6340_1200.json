It has been produced as a partnership between councils, Forestry Corporation, the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service, as well as firefighters from both the NSW Rural Fire Service and Fire and Rescue NSW.</p><p>The Hunter plan will be exhibited for 42 days, including on the NSWRFS' website.</p><p>\"Our NSW Rural Fire Service firefighters and other emergency service volunteers have been doing an amazing job throughout a series of disasters lately, and they can get even better if locals get involved and share their experiences and skills,\" Mr Provest said.</p><p>Taylor Martin, Parliamentary Secretary for the Hunter, said the region would be first to use the new process to assess the dangers as the mercury rose.</p><p>\"The NSW Bushfire Inquiry following the 2019/20 Black Summer recommended implementing this new process for bushfire risk management planning, which incorporates new modelling and methods for assessing the danger to people and property,\" Mr Martin said.</p><p>Upper Hunter MP Dave Layzell said the input of locals would help shape the plan into something that could offer more value ahead of disasters.</p><p>Mr Layzell said the local knowledge and insights of residents would form an invaluable part of the BFRMP.</p><p>\"I'm encouraging everyone interested to view the draft plan and provide their feedback on how we can effectively prepare for when a bush fire does occur,\" Mr Layzell said.</p><p>Residents in the local government areas of Cessnock, Dungog, Maitland and Port Stephens are invited to provide feedback.</p><p>The plan comes ahead of the second fire season since the Black Summer blazes, including the Gospers Mountain blaze that set a record for being the biggest forest fire in Australian history as it licked at the Hunter's edges.</p><p>A royal commission convened in 2020 found the federal government had a larger role to play in the future, regarding natural disaster responses.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NHLDAU-doc7lyni77tu2p989gk19d</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NHLDAU2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6603-3HB1-JD34-V3CD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314240</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Newcastle Newspapers Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newcastle Herald (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

Something similar should happen over this side [of the Mountains] if real explanations are going to be forthcoming.\"</p><p>The meeting was attended by RFS Assistant Commissioner Jayson McKellar and Superintendent Karen Hodges, the incident controller on the day of the backburn.</p><p>Many residents spoke of their concern at the lack of communication with no warning given that the fire was heading their way.</p><p>Several residents told the meeting they had left their homes to get fuel for fire-fighting pumps but were not allowed back home, being stopped at road blocks by police and unable to try to protect their properties.</p><p>There was a Q&amp;A session at the meeting although the RFS said they were constrained because of the ongoing coronial inquiry into the bushfires. Outstanding issues raised included:</p><p>Lack of communication from fire authorities; Lack of warning to residents that fire was approaching; Why the original RFS strategy was changed; and Questions over the weather conditions on the day. Mr Brown said there should be \"a rethink about being so reliant on backburns, on how they are done and less risky alternatives\".</p><p>An RFS spokesman issued a short statement to the Gazette, saying: \"The RFS acknowledges the Gospers Mountain fire, and the concerns of residents about this particular backburn, continue to have an impact on some members within the local community. The Gospers Mountain fire is the largest forest fire ever experienced in Australia, having burned 512,000 hectares during some of the worst fire conditions ever experienced in NSW.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BLUMOU-doc7mtzp9hnz2p129apbme1</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BLUMOU2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66F3-9W21-JD34-V1KR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385916</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"459\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Blue Mountains Gazette</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; Internet Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 21, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Traffic accident</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Terrorist attack</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>N923120MQ</classCode><className>CORONERS COURTS &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A3C5</classCode><className>GREAT DIVIDING RANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He called for independent rescuers to be allowed into the zone to rescue the remaining koalas, check for injuries and relocate them to a safer area if they were healthy enough.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-154356e8dfe011ecb282ea43e6fb0b941746feb88260d731276c29c05bccc0e5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65K3-SMT1-F0JP-W0D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"339\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Geelong Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>May 31, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEBQ</classCode><className>BURN INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FJK</classCode><className>NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000C47H</classCode><className>WOUNDS &amp; INJURIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DORP</classCode><className>EUTHANASIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712190GM</classCode><className>NATIONAL PARKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

address a community meeting of people\u00a0devastated by the blaze.\u00a0\u00a0</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Almost three years after Australia's catastrophic Black Summer bushfires, senior members of the NSW Rural Fire Service met with a \"wounded\" community demanding\u00a0an apology.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sam Ramaci,\u00a0like several of his neighbours, claims a back-burn lit by the RFS on December 14, 2019,\u00a0was responsible for the destruction of his cool room, tractor\u00a0and the property that was to fund his retirement.</p><p>\"If they hadn't started the back-burn, my house would be still standing,\" he said.</p><p>The Mount Wilson back-burn was intended to protect several Blue Mountains communities from the Gospers Mountain fire, burning to the north.</p><p>But as weather conditions deteriorated, fire crews lost control\u00a0and up to 20 structures were destroyed.</p><p>Independent analysis found the blaze burned for 53 days, destroyed 63,700 hectares, and would go on to make up part of the biggest forest fire in Australian history.</p><p>Berambing resident Michelle Leer, whose 30 acres of land was blackened in the aftermath, told the community meeting\u00a0\"the RFS failed\".</p><p>\"Our confidence has been shaken \u2026 in the people from Sydney who made the decision,\" she said.</p><p>\"I would like to know who made the call to start the back-burn\u00a0despite locals saying 'no.'\"</p><p>Other residents raised issues of communication, stating they were unaware the back-burn was lit or that it later escaped containment lines.</p><p>RFS Assistant Commissioner Jayson McKellar addressed the town hall.</p><p>\"We're sorry for the heartache, the pain, the anguish that\u00a0everyone's been through, especially those who lost property \u2026 and those who lost their life,\" he said.</p><p>But, when pressed on the specifics of the back-burn by residents, he raised the ongoing NSW Bushfires coronial inquiry.</p><p>Superintendent Karen Hodges, who was the incident controller on the day of the back-burn, reiterated they were \"restricted\" in what could be said.</p><p>\"I don't want to prejudice the proceedings,\" Ms Hodges told the floor.</p><p>To some, this was a disappointment.</p><p>\"A part of me is really pleased [by the meeting] because they're making an effort and some serious people have had to confront a wounded community \u2026 but there's been no specific apology,\" William Gruner said after the meeting.</p><p>He lost everything except for his Mount Tomah house in the blaze.</p><p>\"What I wanted to see happen in this meeting was the RFS command to acknowledge that Mount Wilson back-burn was a mistake,\" Mr Gruner said.</p><p>Assistant Commissioner Jayson McKellar told residents that back-burning policies had\u00a0been reviewed and updated in the aftermath of the Black Summer bushfires.</p><p>The Mount Wilson back-burn will be investigated as a specific case study at a coronial hearing on September 20, 2022.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

People are going to access the cheapest available method to keep their houses warm in winter.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Victoria's autumn round of legal firewood collection runs from March until the end of June, but Shepparton's nearest collection point is about a 45-minute drive to Benalla.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The national park's proximity to the regional city makes it Victoria's biggest illegal firewood hotspot.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's quick access to the resource, but also you've got a ready-made market at your doorstep,\" Mr Chant says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The firewood is sold on sites like Facebook Marketplace, which requires no seller identity verification and enforcement generally comes via targeted surveillance or catching perpetrators in the act.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Trying to shut them down on social media is a difficult thing,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It takes a lot of investigation and that's something that we need to look at, frankly, as a whole government.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 While those taking wood for personal use tend to be frustrated but co-operative when confronted by enforcement officers, Mr Mercier says commercial thieves can be aggressive or try to escape, fearing the seizure of their saws, trailers and vehicles.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Last year, we had somebody who was coming in the opposite direction to one of our local rangers ... with four cubic metres in the trailer, tried to do a runner, broke the axle, and left it,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Others have collided with trees or abandoned their trailers trying to escape prosecution.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Last year the Conservation Regulator laid 625 charges and issued 85 infringement notices for firewood offences in Victoria.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Many perpetrators have existing criminal records, Mr Chant says, and magistrates aren't holding back when handing out penalties of almost $10,000 and jail time if the matter goes to court.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"People we're dealing with have often been violent offenders too, so we need to be aware of that,\" Mr Chant says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Sometimes things can go wrong and we need to plan accordingly.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Trees of Aboriginal cultural significance, such as scar trees and canoe trees, have also been destroyed by firewood thieves, though perhaps unintentionally.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Cultural heritage trees can sometimes be hard for the average person to define,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Greater Shepparton was historically home to eight different clans of the Yorta Yorta nation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Conservation Regulator is currently raising awareness of cultural heritage trees and the importance of hollows for habitat, which can take 80 years to develop after a branch breaks.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Other hotspots for firewood theft include Gippsland in Victoria's southeast and the Grampians in the west.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 One man living adjacent to the state forest in Gippsland was caught using a feller buncher - effectively an excavator with an attached chainsaw arm - to extract and cut hundreds of tonnes of timber at an industrial level.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Mercier, who has worked in Victoria's national parks for more than two decades, says rangers are increasingly encountering fringe groups in state forests and national parks.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 One man recently called Parks Victoria to declare himself above regulations, claiming he had the right to harvest firewood on public land.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"He quoted the Magna Carta and all sorts of other things,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The world has changed since COVID.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Having said that,\" Mr Chant replies with a grin, \"I've never had better reception on my phone since getting the third jab.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Jokes, confrontations and chases aside, the pair love their jobs.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We've been doing this for a long time and I couldn't think personally what else I'd rather be doing,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Chant agrees.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's a privilege to be entrusted to actually do this job, to protect it for the current generations, but future generations as well,\" he says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Some of these bigger trees, once they're gone, it's going to take a long time for them to be replaced, if ever.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67T2-C3W1-DYG0-93SB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Australian Associated Press Pty.

People are going to access the cheapest available method to keep their houses warm in winter.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Victoria's autumn round of legal firewood collection runs from March until the end of June, but Shepparton's nearest collection point is about a 45-minute drive to Benalla.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The national park's proximity to the regional city makes it Victoria's biggest illegal firewood hotspot.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's quick access to the resource, but also you've got a ready-made market at your doorstep,\" Mr Chant says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The firewood is sold on sites like Facebook Marketplace, which requires no seller identity verification and enforcement generally comes via targeted surveillance or catching perpetrators in the act.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Trying to shut them down on social media is a difficult thing,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It takes a lot of investigation and that's something that we need to look at, frankly, as a whole government.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 While those taking wood for personal use tend to be frustrated but co-operative when confronted by enforcement officers, Mr Mercier says commercial thieves can be aggressive or try to escape, fearing the seizure of their saws, trailers and vehicles.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Last year, we had somebody who was coming in the opposite direction to one of our local rangers ... with four cubic metres in the trailer, tried to do a runner, broke the axle, and left it,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Others have collided with trees or abandoned their trailers trying to escape prosecution.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Last year the Conservation Regulator laid 625 charges and issued 85 infringement notices for firewood offences in Victoria.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Many perpetrators have existing criminal records, Mr Chant says, and magistrates aren't holding back when handing out penalties of almost $10,000 and jail time if the matter goes to court.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"People we're dealing with have often been violent offenders too, so we need to be aware of that,\" Mr Chant says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Sometimes things can go wrong and we need to plan accordingly.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Trees of Aboriginal cultural significance, such as scar trees and canoe trees, have also been destroyed by firewood thieves, though perhaps unintentionally.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Cultural heritage trees can sometimes be hard for the average person to define,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Greater Shepparton was historically home to eight different clans of the Yorta Yorta nation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The Conservation Regulator is currently raising awareness of cultural heritage trees and the importance of hollows for habitat, which can take 80 years to develop after a branch breaks.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Other hotspots for firewood theft include Gippsland in Victoria's southeast and the Grampians in the west.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 One man living adjacent to the state forest in Gippsland was caught using a feller buncher - effectively an excavator with an attached chainsaw arm - to extract and cut hundreds of tonnes of timber at an industrial level.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Mercier, who has worked in Victoria's national parks for more than two decades, says rangers are increasingly encountering fringe groups in state forests and national parks.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 One man recently called Parks Victoria to declare himself above regulations, claiming he had the right to harvest firewood on public land.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"He quoted the Magna Carta and all sorts of other things,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The world has changed since COVID.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Having said that,\" Mr Chant replies with a grin, \"I've never had better reception on my phone since getting the third jab.\"<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Jokes, confrontations and chases aside, the pair love their jobs.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We've been doing this for a long time and I couldn't think personally what else I'd rather be doing,\" Mr Mercier says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Chant agrees.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"It's a privilege to be entrusted to actually do this job, to protect it for the current generations, but future generations as well,\" he says.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"Some of these bigger trees, once they're gone, it's going to take a long time for them to be replaced, if ever.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67T2-C3W1-DYG0-93SC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"906\"/><timeReceived>8:00 AM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Australian Associated Press Pty.

CFA South West regional commander Peter Creak said Tuesday's simulation formed part of the extensive preparation to ensure the region was ready for the fire season. \"Summer evacuations along the Great Ocean Road pose a significant challenge for emergency services due to increased visitation, but we're always prepared for that possibility,\" he said.</p><p>He said grasslands in the region had dried dry out with the warmer weather, which had seen fuel loads having a greater fire potential. The emergency response scenario simulated fires threatening coastal towns that were further affected by traffic on the Great Ocean Road, requiring participants to direct resources, plan evacuations and prepare warnings.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-d7a951505c9711ecb00cf477865bdaf55dfd5fe58a00b60e635e219bd5ca725c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:649G-DF41-F0JP-W02T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-12-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"234\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Geelong Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>December 15, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N923120CC</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

to save his community.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He is among the next generation of firefighters in Queensland's Wide Bay learning how to save lives and protect\u00a0property.</p><p>\"It's good to learn with all the different emergency services so that if a scenario were to happen you can contribute and help the people that need it,\" he said.</p><p>\"I was helping with the back burning and securing the edges of the property.\"</p><p>The Rural Fire Service (RFS) has jumped on favourable weather conditions to teach PCYC Emergency Service Cadets emergency exercises in the lead-up to the summer fire season.</p><p>Fifteen-year-old cadet section leader Tanisha Hanlon was also thrown in the deep end.</p><p>\"It's good to be a part of it because if the actual scenario does happen, you have an understanding of how you can help and maintain it,\" she said.</p><p>\"We do get a lot of curious looks when we talk about our unit, a lot of people don't understand what we do \u2014 they all think we're in the army.\"</p><h>Rain brings respite</h><p>The RFS is predicting a relatively mild fire season across the Wide Bay region as Australia enters its third La Ni\u00f1a in a row.</p><p>Area director Craig Adams said\u00a0above-average rainfall was expected through to Christmas.</p><p>\"It's good news for our firefighters, it doesn't look like we're going to have anywhere near a severe forest fire danger period,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our RFS volunteers are putting up with boggy conditions out there when they're trying to address any wildfires.</p><p>\"The long-term forecast is going to give us an opportunity to assist landowners in undertaking some of those mitigation burns to try and promote some fresh pick for the grazing farmers.</p><p>\"We will get our occasional grass fires, but I don't think it is going to be as severe as what we've experienced over the past couple of years.\"</p><h>Memories of K'gari</h><p>Almost two years ago, it was a very different scenario when bushfires ravaged more than half of K'gari (Fraser Island's) bushland.</p><p>The Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service (QPWS) acting regional director Stephen Price said they had been working year-round to mitigate bushfire threats.</p><p>\"We continue to work very closely with Butchulla people on K'gari, we have elevated their participation in the planned burning program,\" he said.</p><p>\"On K'gari we have implemented 11 planned burns which are largely strategic \u2026 mitigation burns around key infrastructure.\"</p><p>Mr Adams said the fire threat never went away.</p><p>\"We need people to be fire aware,\" he said.</p><p>\"K'gari is over 180,000 hectares and it's very difficult to manage once a fire gets away.\"</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

They cover a tenth of the world's land but hold <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-87343-3\">one-third of the land's carbon</url>, stored mainly in organic-rich soils and in trees. Now, a new study in the journal <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0805\">Science</url> provides further evidence that emissions from wildfires in high northern latitudes are already increasing at an alarming rate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In these forests, the cold climate and often waterlogged ground means fallen tree bark, needles and other dead organic matter takes a long time to decompose. This has allowed the soils to accumulate carbon over thousands of years after the ice sheets retreated at the end of the last ice age. Since then, these ecosystems have mainly been shaped by wildfires ignited by lightning.</p><p>These fires release some of the carbon stored in trees and in the upper layer of soil back into the atmosphere. The release of soil carbon is hugely significant. It means a boreal forest fire will release 10 to 20 times more carbon compared to a similarly sized fire in other ecosystems where fires consume mainly vegetation and where the soil itself does not contain enough carbon to burn.</p><p>However, these boreal forests might burn only once a century, sometimes even less often than that. This is much longer than in most other fire-prone ecosystems, and the extra carbon stored in soils and trees in the long period between fires normally exceeds the losses from fires. For the past 6,000 or so years this delicate relationship between carbon uptake and release was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1474-y\">quite stable</url> and boreal forests served as a globally important carbon sink.</p><p>But global heating, which is particularly pronounced in the Northern Hemisphere's high latitudes, is threatening the balance. Soaring temperatures have <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/climate-change-wildfire-risk-has-grown-nearly-everywhere-but-we-can-still-influence-where-and-how-fires-strike-185465\">lengthened the fire season</url> and increased the frequency and severity of wildfires and there is growing evidence that as the interval between fires shortens, more carbon is being released from organic soils in boreal forests than the ecosystems can reabsorb.</p><h>Satellites can spot gas emitted by wildfires</h><p>That's where the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.ade0805\">latest study in Science</url> comes in. The researchers, mostly based in China, used satellite observations of wildfire smoke plumes to look for carbon monoxide, which is invisible to the naked eye but shows up at certain infrared wavelengths. Carbon monoxide isn't itself a greenhouse gas, but if you know how much of it there is, you can infer the amount of carbon dioxide in wildfire smoke as well. </p><p>This contrasts with the more conventional methods employed by current wildfire emission models. These also use satellites, but record active fires or burned areas simply by comparing before and after images. They then factor in a range of assumptions on how much vegetation would typically have been consumed and how much carbon is emitted per area of different types of vegetation and soil burned.</p><p>While this new carbon monoxide method has its own uncertainties, it provides independent and more direct estimates of wildfire emissions. It also has potential to give us a more detailed understanding of the differences in wildfire carbon emissions between different ecosystems.</p><h>A dramatic increase</h><p>The new study showed a significant increase in emissions from boreal fires over the past two decades. Things were particularly dramatic in 2021, when they comprised a record 23% of global vegetation wildfire emissions, more than twice their contribution in a more typical year. </p><p>If this trend continues, the boreal forest may very soon become the dominant source of global emissions from biomass burning, overtaking the notorious tropical peatland fires (such as those in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.carbonbrief.org/indonesian-fires-now-on-a-par-with-brazils-total-annual-emissions/\">Indonesia in 2015</url>) in terms of global significance and adding further to the \"fire-carbon-climate warming\" feedback.</p><p>The 2021 fire season was made particularly extreme by simultaneously hot and dry conditions both in North America and northern Europe and Asia. If such weather patterns do become more frequent, leading to more fires in the boreal region, these forests may reach a \"wildfire tipping point\". A study examining the extreme fires of 2014 in boreal north-west Canada demonstrated that some areas were already <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/increasing-wildfires-threaten-to-turn-northern-hemispheres-boreal-forests-from-vital-carbon-stores-into-climate-heaters-122069\">turning from carbon sinks into net emitters</url>. This new study covering the entire boreal biome suggests this ecosystem as a whole - from Siberia to Canada - is rapidly approaching this tipping point.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Don't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?</emphasis><br/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Get a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.

three organisations on the eve of the fire season.\u00a0</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A\u00a0tower that played a vital role during the Ash Wednesday disaster in 1983\u00a0has become embroiled in a battle between three organisations on the eve of the fire season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Mount\u00a0Warrnambool tower, about 25 kilometres\u00a0north-east of Warrnambool, is manned sporadically during the fire danger period.</p><p>It's seen by the Country Fire Authority (CFA) as a vital weapon in its bushfire fight each year, having been used to spot \"many\" fires over the years.</p><p>But the management and ownership of the fire tower is at the centre of a dispute between\u00a0Moyne Shire Council, the state environment department\u00a0and the CFA\u00a0over\u00a0who is responsible for the increasingly dilapidated building.</p><h>Council says 'it's not ours'</h><p>Moyne Shire Council recently received a request\u00a0from the Hopkins Curdies CFA group to investigate replacing the fire tower\u00a0as it had\u00a0been deemed unsafe for use.</p><p>According to a report to the council, the\u00a0CFA\u00a0indicated the\u00a0council owned\u00a0the tower and was responsible for its repair\u00a0or replacement.</p><p>However, the council's investigations\u00a0found it doid not own the asset, and that it was built on crown land, meaning it was\u00a0the responsibility of the state government.</p><p>Councillors this week voted to withdraw the council from any responsibilities connected to the tower, including the provision of employees to man the tower on high risk days, minor cleaning and readiness of the fire tower, and the installation of a portable toilet.</p><p>Instead, councillors suggested the council\u00a0continue to pay the CFA the amount it\u00a0contributes for staff - between $4000 and $9000 - but leave\u00a0the administration and provision of personnel to the CFA.</p><h>So who owns the tower?</h><p>A Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning spokesperson confirmed the property was\u00a0on crown land.</p><p>\"In the 1970s, the fire tower was built as a joint project between [Moyne Shire's predecessor]\u00a0Warrnambool Shire Council and CFA,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>\"Maintenance and management of the tower has continued to be a joint arrangement between local government and CFA.</p><p>\"No formal tenure arrangements are in place.\"</p><p>The spokesperson said the tower was\u00a0in CFA jurisdiction\u00a0despite it being on Crown land and the department having a firefighting role via its Forest Fire Management Victoria arm.</p><h>What does the CFA say?</h><p>A\u00a0CFA spokesperson said the Mount Warrnambool fire tower would be\u00a0fully operational throughout this year's fire season\u00a0and the authority would\u00a0continue to fulfil a leadership role in managing and maintaining it.</p><p>However the CFA stopped short of committing to full ownership of the tower.</p><p>\"Fire towers are valuable community assets and we'll work with stakeholders to determine funding arrangements for ongoing maintenance,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>\"CFA will endeavour to deliver any necessary maintenance works to ensure the lookout remains operational, in line with CFA South West Region's infrastructure priorities.\"</p><p>The ABC understands that discussions are continuing between the three parties.</p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

restricted to residents of a select list of shires, which are all or partly within the Central zone. </p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria planning team leader Amy Groch said the changes would help maintain a more sustainable domestic firewood supply for Central Victorian locals.</p><p>\"While firewood is free to collect, supply is not unlimited,\" Ms Groch said. \"This means firewood needs to be managed responsibly to ensure environmental sustainability.\"</p><p>\"These new restrictions have been introduced following extensive community consultation.</p><p>\"We want to remind the community that firewood can only be taken from designated firewood collection areas in state forests during approved Autumn and Spring collection seasons, from 1 March to 30 June and from 1 September to 30 November, respectively.</p><p>\"Designated firewood collection areas are selected for a range of reasons including the availability of firewood, community safety, and to protect sites of cultural and environmental significance.\"</p><p>FFMV has warned its officer can ask people to prove their address when collecting fire wood and that hefty penalties apply for <url

The sun was shining, the birds were chirping and the kangaroos were relishing the heat of the day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It was the first season opener for Bundanon in 2022 that wasn't dampened with a torrential downpour from La Nina.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Having experienced the historic property - originally owned by Arthur and Yvonne Boyd - under both conditions, it was great to see the sun draw a sizeable crowd for the opening of 'Siteworks: From a deep valley.'</p><p>The newest exhibition, 'Inside, underground', is a multi-faceted showcase of work bringing together both artists and scientists. It is centered around the exploration of interior weather systems and the transformative potential of the natural world.</p><p>Curator, Sophie O'Brien expertly gave us a tour of the space, explaining in detail every work on display.</p><p>The work that personally stood out to me was titled Older than bees by Isadora Vaughan, who created the piece while on residence at Bundanon. Vaughn's work is a wall constructed out of beeswax blocks, joined together by heat and pressure.</p><p>Behind the wall sits a mechanical light tower which intermittently lights up the structure, transforming the work as a whole.</p><p>Vaughn said the work is intended to represent \"a tension between the organic and the industrial.\"</p><p>At the conclusion of the season the wall will be smashed into small pieces and melted down to be used in future works on site.</p><p>Another highlight was The Possum Skin Cloak Project. In honour of the traditional process of possum skin cloak making, Yuin Walbunja Elder and artist Aunty Loretta Parsley and Gunai artist Kirli Saunders led an intensive on-country residency.</p><p>The work was created over a five-day period with 10 First Nation women being involved in the collaborative effort, with the final work being gifted to the Bundanon Collection.</p><p>At the culmination of the tour, we learned about the World Weather Network (WWN) and Budanon's involvement in the program.</p><p>The WWN is a collective of 27 arts organisations across the world started by Artangel in the United Kingdom. For one year through this program, organisations will share 'weather reports' about their local weather and our shared climate.</p><p>\"This will create an archipelago of voices and viewpoints on a new global platform,\" Ms O'Brian said. \"It will provide different ways of understanding the weather across multiple localities and languages.\"</p><p>Bundanon weather reports will consist of a dynamic program of talks, commissioned poems, interactive postcards, photographs and video works.</p><p>At the conclusion of the tour the season three program was officially opened to the public with Budanon CEO Rachel Kent addressing the large crowd that had gathered.</p><p>\"It gives me a huge pleasure to welcome you all to Bundanon and introduce to you our third season,\" she said.</p><p>\"Siteworks is Bundanon's annual event for all-ages, focusing on art and the natural environment which makes great sense for where we are located.\"</p><p>Ms Kent acknowledged the \"small but incredible\" team at Bundanon who continue to \"punch well above their weight\" in their efforts to bring every season to life.</p><p>After the address visitors made their way down to the hill overlooking the Shoalhaven River where we were able to witness a special smoking and dance ceremony performed by Gadhungal Murring and led by Dharrawal knowledge holder and language teacher Drew Longbottom.</p><p>The spectacular dance performance again revolved around the local natural environment with a focus on birds and animals and what they tell us about our natural environment.</p><p>Next Katie Paterson's performance, To burn, forest, fire, was centered around engaging the olfactory senses through the scents of the first and last forests on Earth.</p><p>Finally the day closed with a musical performance by Nick Wales, Jason Noble. Veronique Serret and Bree van Reyk titled Atmospheres.</p><p>This conceptual performance was based around capturing the natural sounds and surrounds of the Bundanon landscape.</p><p>While you can visit the new exhibition at anytime, the next big schedule of events for season three will be held on Saturday, January 14, 2023.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SOUCOA-doc7nxk33j7jpw15p7wbc8y</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SOUCOA2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:671G-X7Y1-JD34-V0G3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">390631</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"687\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Ms Stevens said on Tuesday.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Dashing into his ute, which was towing a firefighting trailer, Mr Burns took off down a narrow road to try to outrun the blaze.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The next day, local Rural Fire Service captain Ewan Thompson found Mr Burns? remains in his burnt ute about three kilometres from Jiliby.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The ute sat on exposed metal rims, its glass windows were gone and the trailer had tipped in a way suggesting Mr Burns misjudged a turn and ran up a bank.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ?I believe he was blinded by smoke and possibly, a very fierce burst of fire,? Mr Thompson told the inquest.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The fire chief said he'd helped Mr Burns on Jiliby until about 3am when deciding the community's south was facing a graver situation.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 His last words to Mr Burns - ?if your life is threatened, leave and go to the fire shed? - were met with a nod.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"He didn?t say anything, he understood what I was saying,? Mr Thomspon said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 A neighbour of Mr Burns who'd fought smaller bushfires also tried to defend her property until the last moment, describing how embers breached her house's wooden shutters as her family escaped through back paddocks in search of already-scorched ground.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 ?We weren?t expecting what came,? Deborah Dance said.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The inquest was told the fire was beyond anything local crews had ever seen, becoming extreme after nightfall and forcing firefighting to continue throughout the morning.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 One local firefighter described Mr Burns as ?strong-willed?, noting the difficulty in trying to budge his choice once Mr Burns made a decision.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Burns' partner, Threlly, agreed he was sometimes stubborn and wanted things \"his way\" while describing a kind, generous ?bushman? who made sure to look after her, his friends and his community.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"I miss Colin every day,\" she said in a statement, read by Ms Stevens.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Mr Burns' inquest is part of a broader inquiry into the Badja Forest Fire, which claimed seven lives.<br/>\u00a0\u00a0 The state coroner has been told the blaze was ignited after lightning struck a remote forest on December 27, 2019.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AAPNEW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63JD-0VR1-JC0X-K266-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"513\"/><timeReceived>3:14 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Australian Associated Press Pty.

In the early hours of December 31, the fire wiped out the remote Nerrigundah and Belowra valleys.</p><p>Coroner Teresa O'Sullivan heard Belowra man Colin 'Col' Burns, 72, died in his vehicle after a late decision to leave his property on December 31, 2019. His remote bush property was 55km west of the nearest town, Bodalla. Col was unable to make a safe escape after his trailer, equipped with firefighting gear, flipped when negotiating a curve of a narrow unsealed road.</p><p>Police confirmed Col's remains were located inside the vehicle and concluded he died from the fire's impact. Col was known as a \"true bushman\" and dedicated member of Belowra RFS for 40 years.</p><p>Colin Burn's partner, Threlly, who lived in Sydney, said in a statement: \"I miss Colin everyday, all the time ... he is still in my heart and I am very teary-eyed.\"</p><p>In the neighbouring bush village of Nerrigundah, another tragic story of an unsuccessful escape was heard. John Smith, 71, left his Batemans Bay home to prepare his property at Nerrigundah the day before his fate.</p><p>The court heard that John's car crashed into a tree, and that he attempted to escape on foot but couldn't outrun the fire on December 31. His burnt-out car was discovered three days later.</p><p>At that stage, his remains were not yet found and a search began with RFS and Police. It wasn't until 7am on January 6, that a friend of John's found his remains in a gully about 50 metres from his car.</p><p>As the Badja Forest Fire escalated into the morning of December 31, the country town of Cobargo was directly in its path. Earlier during the inquiry, a submission from a Cobargo RFS member spoke of 15-20 metre flame heights through grassland as fire fronts approached Cobargo from the west.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard the deaths of a well-known father and son of Cobargo. Robert, 63, and Patrick, 29, Salway died in their paddock while defending their farm on the morning of December 31, 2019. The pair were battling spot fires before, what experts described as \"a ferocious firestorm\" trailing the main fire front, took their lives.</p><p>Cobargo's Ross Rixon, 84, was also attempting to battle the blaze that completely destroyed his Cobargo property on December 31. Coroner O'Sullivan heard Ross died one week later. He died of a heart attack after suffering burns to his face. He was remembered as \"a real Aussie bushy and strong as an ox\".</p><p>The fire continued a path of destruction, headed for the small rural suburb of Coolagolite, near Cobargo, where Richard \"Rick\" Steele perished in his granny flat. Coroner O'Sullivan heard the 56-year-old agreed on a plan to stay and fight the fire with his neighbour who owned the property.</p><p>Their plan was to pump water from a nearby dam to fight the fire, however the power was cut off in the early hours of December 31 and the pump no longer worked. They both went into their homes to pack their belongings and leave the property.</p><p>Rick's neighbour told the court his driveway was on fire as he fled in his car. He said there was no sign of Rick's headlights behind him. The next day, Rick's remains were found inside the granny flat.</p><p>The Badja Forest Fire fire burned steadily for some weeks before a change in weather caused a sudden and severe turn on Thursday, January 23, the day Michael 'Mick' Clarke died. Mick lived alone on a property nestled in bushland at Bumbo, near Bodalla.</p><p>Coroner O'Sullivan heard Mick's brother was unable to reach Mick in time to help at the property as conditions got too dangerous. Hours later, a neighbour found Mick's remains among the rubble of his home.</p><p>In the second week of the inquiry, Coroner O'Sullivan heard firefighter Samuel McPaul died when a fire tornado rolled his truck onto its roof during the Green Valley blaze, near the Victorian border.</p><p>The court heard Samuel was travelling in the back of a fire truck that rolled onto its roof at Jingellic. Rodney O'Keeffe was also travelling in the back and was badly burned. The driver, Andrew Godde, was also hospitalised.</p><p>Examinations showed the marks on the truck and gouge marks in the ground suggested the 10-tonne truck was lifted by extreme forces. A weather expert told the court the fire vortex at the property had a depth of about five kilometres and winds up to 320km/h.</p><p>The inquiry continues as the coroner completes the examination of 25 deaths of the black summer fires across the state.</p><p>Findings of the deaths examined so far will be presented next year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ILMYAU-doc7hlxiz10an8wpw1hgnm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ILMYAU2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63N2-0KC1-JD34-V40W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314241</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"848\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Illawarra Newspapers Holding Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Illawarra Mercury</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 20, 2021 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accident</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cause of death</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N923120MQ</classCode><className>CORONERS COURTS &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001745</classCode><className>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N922110CC</classCode><className>LAW COURTS &amp; TRIBUNALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001745</classCode><className>TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Its steep volcanic hills are covered in stands of mountain ash and home to wallabies and lyrebirds.</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://static.ffx.io/images/$zoom_0.28%2C$multiply_1.0582%2C$ratio_1.5%2C$width_756%2C$x_7%2C$y_0/t_crop_custom/q_86%2Cf_auto/ec4dd6587a09b035ea223b770ba9ed0ae20994b1\">Link to Image</url></p><p>Michael Clayton-Jones</p><p>Landcare groups say they have surveyed both of the earmarked areas - the largest is 75 hectares - on foot and estimate about 30 per cent of the tree canopy has been damaged.
