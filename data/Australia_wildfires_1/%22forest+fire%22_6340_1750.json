Australian Community Media urges caution for readers as this could be deeply upsetting.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A coronial inquiry has heard Colin \"Col\" Burns, 72, died in his vehicle when fleeing the Badja Forest Fire on December, 31, 2019.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Col's death was heard at the NSW Bushfire Coronial Inquiry to the 2019/2020 bushfires on Tuesday, September 7.</p><p>The assisting counsel to the coroner said it was likely Col could not defend his property, or himself, and made a decision to evacuate.</p><p>\"Due to extreme conditions and the pace of the fire, he was unable to make it to safety,\" the assisting counsel said.</p><p>Col was a \"true bushman\" who continued to live on his family farm of 1500 acres. He had some cattle on the property that was described as being remote with dense bushland, 55km west of the nearest town, Bodalla.</p><p>Col was an active and dedicated member of Belowra RFS for about 40 years.</p><p>On December 30, the day before his death, fire encroached his property from the west and destroyed the first of his three cottages.</p><p>In a testimony to the court, Belowra RFS captain, Ewan Thompson, said Col understood the advice was to leave and seek shelter at the fire shed.</p><p>Despite losing his first cottage to the blaze, Mr Thompson said Col didn't want to leave.</p><p>\"He was always going to stay and defend the rest of his property,\" Mr Thompson told the court.</p><p>Mr Thompson had more than 50-years of firefighting experience and described conditions to the court.</p><p>\"I had never seen a fire behave that way,\" he said.</p><p>\"We never had to fight fire in the early hours of the morning. Usually fires are mid-morning, (or) late afternoon when they fully get going.</p><p>\"This one took-off and really became extreme at nine or 10 at night ... I have never fought a fire with such a big front before.\"</p><p>Col's remaining dwellings were positioned on top of a ridge, making them \"difficult to defend\".</p><p>\"No matter what direction the fire came, he was going to be under threat,\" Mr Thompson said.</p><p>RFS crews of Dalmeny and Belowra helped Col prepare into the night of December 30, before leaving in the early hours of December 31.</p><p>Mr Thompson was the last to safely leave Col's property. He informed Col the weather conditions had changed and fire was threatening the southern end of the valley.</p><p>\"I was very concerned,\" he said.</p><p>\"I had to make a decision to leave or stay there. I decided more people were going to be at risk at the southern end of the valley, I had to say to him that I had to leave.\"</p><p>Col's neighbours, Keith and Deb Dance, went to inspect their property at about 8.30am when they saw Col's fire-strewn ute and that he didn't make it.</p><p>READ MORE: The 'tsunami of fire' that wiped out everything its path at Belowra</p><p>They informed RFS members who reported to Police and cordoned off the area.</p><p>Due to radio, electricity and mobile phone outages, search and rescue personnel could not access the valley at the time.</p><p>On January 2, police detectives flew by helicopter to Belowra and spoke with RFS members.</p><p>Detectives found Col's ute positioned on its rims with the trailer tipped on its side. Both the ute and trailer were extensively damaged. Police told the court, Col's trailer was equipped for fighting fires.</p><p>Police believed the trailer flipped when the ute negotiated a curve of the narrow unsealed road. Police confirmed Col's remains were located inside the vehicle and concluded he died from the fire's impact.</p><p>The inquiry continues.</p><p>READ MORE FROM THE INQUIRY:</p><p>Inquest into Upper Murray fire which killed Samuel McPaul continues Inquiry told Badja fire cut-off family before Bumbo man's death 'Ferocious firestorm' claimed Far South Coast father and son, coronial inquiry told Bushfire coroner told of 'hard and honest' Ross Rixon Richard Steele's tragic death in Coolagolite Inquiry hears man was 'totally disillusioned' before tragic death in Nerrigundah fire</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BATPOS-doc7hjd3oa90xh1bpfe7gnm</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BATPOS2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63M0-4K71-F0J6-J0GK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386713</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"652\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Further planned burning is scheduled for inland areas, with the largest individual planned burn near Forrest.</p><p>FFMVic Otway district manager David Roberts said the current weather outlook was favourable for planned burning through to the end of April.</p><p>\"The eastern Otways continues to be our priority for planned burning due to the high density of coastal townships surrounded by dense bushland,\" he said.</p><p>\"Reducing fuel loads means bushfires are less intense, making it more likely that firefighters can contain them before they impact on people, property and the environment.\" For large planned burns to be conducted safely, crews will use aircraft including helicopters for aerial ignition, water bombing and observation.</p><p>This year's program will build on the work undertaken during autumn planned burning in 2019 across the Otway District, which covered more than 5500ha.All planned burns in areas with known wildlife populations are supported by a range of measures before, during and after burns to manage the welfare of wildlife.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECHOAU-6fd0f752576e11ea9d9330238a991890b0866a0d84ef3fda37aa94ee3992cede</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECHOAU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YBJ-Y441-JD3N-51Y1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463781</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"278\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Echo (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Echo Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>March 4, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

On the other, there is a fierce debate going on about our right to reasonable and necessary care and support, with the National Disability Insurance Agency and the Morrison government proposing radical changes to the National Disability Insurance Scheme.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Is it any wonder the disability community is experiencing high levels of anxiety, fear and despair?</p><p>A survey conducted by People With Disability Australia (PWDA) last year revealed a massive percentage of disabled people were experiencing unprecedented uncertainty and anxiety about being supported during a pandemic.</p><p>That number has escalated exponentially.</p><p>The people who will die are now not \"just\" the elderly. More than 70 per cent of our seniors have now been vaccinated. We are also talking about disabled people, our family members and those who are paid to care for us.</p><p>Let us be clear. If the intention is to \"let her rip\" before ensuring that all of the 1a and 1b vaccine rollout groups are vaccinated, this will not be \"living with Covid\". This will be eugenics against a protected group of citizens. People with disability will die.</p><p>State premiers and chief ministers believe we should be eliminating community transmission. If we let the virus run rampant, the cost to human life will be immeasurable. This is not an acceptable course of action in any civilised society.</p><p>Our community is now the community most at risk. That includes younger people with disability and underlying health conditions.</p><p>We must urgently ensure disabled people in our community, including younger disabled people, are safe. To do that, we need a clear strategy to suppress, contain and eliminate the virus, with a focus on those most clinically vulnerable and most at risk.</p><p>Our federal government must immediately make a commitment to: ENSURE the 1a and 1b rollout is complete at record speed, especially in residential disability settings; URGENTLY give disabled persons access to the safest and most appropriate vaccine, regardless of their age; INCREASE transparency in public reporting, especially around national daily statistics and weekly disability statistics; ENSURE we understand how disabled people who are not NDIS participants are tracking, especially Aboriginal people, people from culturally and linguistically diverse communities, people living with homelessness and others from marginalised groups; MAKE sure PWDA's 11-point plan has been activated and a clear vaccination plan for people with a disability, their carers and support workers is undertaken as a matter of urgency - halting the plan to implement reforms to the NDIS, especially independent assessments; and ENSURE disabled people have what they need to live a life where they have the same opportunities as other people, including to be safe from Covid.</p><p>We are only able to live with the virus once people with disability and our community is safe from it - that means implementing the basic measures above, as well as building national quarantine facilities and ensuring everyone has access to a safe and appropriate vaccine.</p><p>Now is the time for action. Australia has a community that has always rallied around in times of crisis. Australians expect leadership in times of crisis, for every Australian.</p><p>We need strong and responsible leadership right now which values the health and safety of their citizens over profit - leadership that will lead us out of danger and towards an optimistic, Covid-free future. Samantha Connor is the president of People with Disability Australia.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GEADVT-95aa3772e30411eb843a233b139a571dd3dfa909a4901459c9ae42891eadd76c</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">GEADVT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:634N-4R31-JD3N-54B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">270575</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-07-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"618\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Geelong Advertiser (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Geelong Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"07\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>July 14, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"75\"><className>Public Health &amp;

He was doing incredibly critical work,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>\"He was a Melbourne boy who had a great love for the great outdoors, and a keen fisherman.</p><p>\"He started with us as a project

from the cut-of town of Mallacoota have sailed into Western Port Bay onboard the Navy vessel HMAS Choules.</p><p>The coastal town, near the NSW border, was hit by an out-of-control bushfire on New

people out of the community.</p><p>About 200 evacuees, along with 66 CFA volunteers, will be brought ashore on landing craft to be reunited with friends and family.</p><p>Mallacoota remains without power but many locals have opted to stay in the town, which remains completely cut off, as work continues to clear fallen and damaged trees from the only road out of town.</p><p>Fires remain 'dangerous, dynamic and volatile'</p><p>Fire crews were on Wednesday attempting controlled burns near coastal communities in a bid to protect property ahead of a wind change predicted to cause problems across fire grounds later this week.</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said fire conditions on Friday were likely to rise to extreme in the Northern Country, severe in the Mallee and north-east and very high in East Gippsland.</p><p>Mr Crisp said there were 21 fires burning throughout the state on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>\"That's more than 1.2 million hectares, mainly of the eastern part of our state, that has burnt,\" he said.</p><p>Rain and cooler temperatures this week have granted a brief reprieve to firefighters, but Ms Neville said the rain had \"in no way changed the risk\".</p><p>\"These fires remain dangerous, dynamic and volatile,\" she said.</p><p>Another expected round of dry lighting, combined with a forecast wind change, could potentially cause fast-moving fires across Victoria, she said.</p><p>A group of 67 North American firefighters arrived in Melbourne on Wednesday morning and will start working with local fire crews on Saturday.</p><p>Mr Crisp said they would help the CFA analyse and plan how to fight fires in difficult terrain, and support air crews.</p><p>The North American crew joins 41 firefighters from the United States already working in East Gippsland.</p><p>Another 140 people from North America are due to arrive in two weeks to help with incident management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The regular failure of politicians to appropriately answer questions when they can be answered, including at the state and local government levels and in many other forums Australia-wide, and instead spin a diverting message ultimately retarding, for example, economic and social progress, is surely a collective national skill.</p><p>Peter Edwards White Beach</p><p>ENERGY EMBARRASSMENT I DON'T know about anyone else, but I'm starting to get cranky with the Liberals' Angus Taylor announcing, whenever he gets the chance, that sticking to coal and gas for decades to come is what the majority of Australians in fact want.</p><p>Am I wrong in thinking that the majority of Australians want to start winding back on gas and coal as quickly as it is possible to do so, for the sake of the planet?</p><p>Sticking to coal and gas, as Taylor is suggesting, will risk isolating Australia from other developed counties of the world, and it may start to look more like a mendicant, failed or rogue country along with others, including North Korea and Myanmar.</p><p>Most Australians, I genuinely believe, are embarrassed by the fact that Australia has taken so long to come up with anything like a sustainable energy plan.</p><p>And it looks like they are going to be embarrassed for a whole lot longer, if Angus Taylor's views are any sort of guide to the way most Liberal politicians are thinking.</p><p>Michael McCall Primrose Sands</p><p>FUTURE CONCERNS WHAT divine right do the Nationals have to deny my children and grandchildren a better future by their climate change inactions?

The apocalyptic views of a \"former fire chief\" with no background in public forests are suggestive of an under-appreciation of the central fuel management problem, and an unawareness of the decline of forest firefighting effectiveness wrought by societal changes (such as risk-averse work protocols) and political decisions (such as broadscale forest \"lock-up\").</p><p>Since the mid-1990s, forest firefighting has to varying degrees lost its determined urgency, calculated risk-taking, localised command, pre-season hazard reduction, forestry access networks, and bush-experienced machinery operators, which all formerly enabled ground-based crews to contain most forest fires to a small size.</p><p>Attempts to compensate for this with huge expenditure on waterbombing aircraft has not reduced the extent of forest fire.</p><p>Collectively in southern and eastern Australia, these shortcomings have led to hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of hectares being unnecessarily incinerated, despite circumstances that would formerly have enabled quick control.</p><p>Victoria's 2019-20 East Gippsland fires and Tasmania's 2019 Geeveston fire are recent examples.</p><p>The reality is that large forest fires say more about hamstrung forest and fire management than climate change.</p><p>Mark Poynter Sandy Bay</p><p>DON'T RAISE YOUR HOPES READER Fred Groenier asks whether the PM's conversion to net zero can be regarded as a miracle (Quick Views, October 19).</p><p>If I were Mr Groenier, I'd urge caution, and wait until the thimble and pea trick achieves miracle status, before he gets his hopes up any further.</p><p>Stephen Jeffery Sandy Bay</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-fce4b1a431f811ecba8a4d575037429717f32281d91d799c687ea9fc53e708b8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63X5-YGX1-F0JP-W3GR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-10-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Hobart Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"10\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>October 23, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009XG5</classCode><className>BRITISH MONARCHS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp;

Increased forest dieback in response to heat stress and the reduction in cool-season rainfall would add to risks, the paper said.</p><p>Fire weather could also worsen, with \"some evidence that these extreme front events [that draw heat from inland Australia to the coast] will become more frequent in southern Australia\", the report said.</p><p>Similarly, the number of days favouring extreme pyrocumulonimbus clouds - fire-induced storm cells - forming over firegrounds are also projected to have \"significant increases\" under a high greenhouse gas emissions future.</p><p>During the satellite era up to 2019, 60 such fire-induced weather events were recorded or suspected in Australia, researchers found. During the 2019-20 fire season, at least 29 such events occurred including at least 18 in a week. The week-long flurry had \"previously undocumented impacts on winds and chemical composition into the stratosphere,\" the paper found.</p><p>The warming climate was forecast to alter natural climate variability, such as increasing the likelihood of extreme El Nino events and positive phases of the so-called Indian Ocean Dipole that typically reduce rainfall in south-eastern Australia.</p><p>\"The potential exists for more frequent years with extreme hot and dry conditions in southeast Australia, beyond that expected from mean temperature and rainfall trends alone,\" the research found. \"If this potential is realised, fuels in south-east Australia will be dry from winter to summer more often, and dangerous fire weather during fire seasons will occur more frequently.</p><p>\"We don't expect every summer to be like 2019-2020 - and this La Nina year is a good example of that,\" Professor Abrams said. \"However, ... if we can bring ourselves onto a low greenhouse gas emission pathway, these projected climate changes won't be as extreme and will be easier to adapt to than if we were on a high-emissions pathway\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-doc7dyr4x9zmpv15v5spnex</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61PM-F711-F0J6-J0BN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"461\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;

He was doing incredibly critical work,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>\"He was a Melbourne boy who had a great love for the great outdoors, and a keen fisherman.</p><p>\"He started with us as a project firefighter and decided to live in the north-east of Victoria.</p><p>\"He's such a well-loved guy.</p><p>\"It's a devastating loss.</p><p>\"I can't imagine what Mat's family are going through.\"</p><p>Buchan \"hero\" Mick Roberts was identified as the first victim of the bushfire emergency, while Maramingo Creek timber worker Fred Becker was confirmed dead at the weekend.</p><p>Hundreds of homes have been destroyed as the fires rage across East Gippsland and the state's north-east.</p><p>Final maritime evacuees from Mallacoota arrive</p><p>The last evacuees from the cut-of town of Mallacoota have sailed into Western Port Bay onboard the Navy vessel HMAS Choules.</p><p>The coastal town, near the NSW border, was hit by an out-of-control bushfire on New Year's Day that forced thousands to shelter on the foreshore.</p><p>HMAS Choules docked near HMAS Cerberus this afternoon, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-04/bushfire-mallacoota-evacuees-arrive-at-hastings-on-mv-sycamore/11840576\">marking the end of the maritime operation</url> to get more than 1,000 people out of the community.</p><p>About 200 evacuees, along with 66 CFA volunteers, will be brought ashore on landing craft to be reunited with friends and family.</p><p>Mallacoota remains without power but many locals have opted to stay in the town, which remains completely cut off, as work continues to clear fallen and damaged trees from the only road out of town.</p><p>Fires remain 'dangerous, dynamic and volatile'</p><p>Fire crews are today attempting controlled burns near coastal communities in a bid to protect property ahead of a wind change predicted to cause problems across fire grounds later this week.</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said fire conditions on Friday were likely to rise to extreme in the Northern Country, severe in the Mallee and north-east and very high in East Gippsland.</p><p>Mr Crisp said there were 21 fires burning throughout the state this afternoon.</p><p>\"That's more than 1.2 million hectares, mainly of the eastern part of our state, that has burnt,\" he said.</p><p>Rain and cooler temperatures this week have granted a brief reprieve to firefighters, but Ms Neville said the rain had \"in no way changed the risk\".</p><p>\"These fires remain dangerous, dynamic and volatile,\" she said.</p><p>Another expected round of dry lighting, combined with a forecast wind change, could potentially cause fast-moving fires across Victoria, she said.</p><p>A group of 67 North American firefighters arrived in Melbourne this morning and will start working with local fire crews on Saturday.</p><p>Mr Crisp said they would help the CFA analyse and plan how to fight fires in difficult terrain, and support air crews.</p><p>The North American crew joins 41 firefighters from the United States already working in East Gippsland.</p><p>Another 140 people from North America are due to arrive in two weeks to help with incident management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

He was doing incredibly critical work,\" Mr Hardman said.</p><p>\"He was a Melbourne boy who had a great love for the great outdoors, and a keen fisherman.</p><p>\"He started with us as a project firefighter and decided to live in the north-east of Victoria.</p><p>\"He's such a well-loved guy.</p><p>\"It's a devastating loss.</p><p>\"I can't imagine what Mat's family are going through.\"</p><p>Buchan \"hero\" Mick Roberts was identified as the first victim of the bushfire emergency, while Maramingo Creek timber worker Fred Becker was confirmed dead at the weekend.</p><p>Hundreds of homes have been destroyed as the fires rage across East Gippsland and the state's north-east.</p><p>Final maritime evacuees from Mallacoota arrive</p><p>The last evacuees from the cut-of town of Mallacoota have sailed into Western Port Bay onboard the Navy vessel HMAS Choules.</p><p>The coastal town, near the NSW border, was hit by an out-of-control bushfire on New Year's Day that forced thousands to shelter on the foreshore.</p><p>HMAS Choules docked near HMAS Cerberus this afternoon, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-04/bushfire-mallacoota-evacuees-arrive-at-hastings-on-mv-sycamore/11840576\">marking the end of the maritime operation</url> to get more than 1,000 people out of the community.</p><p>About 200 evacuees, along with 66 CFA volunteers, will be brought ashore on landing craft to be reunited with friends and family.</p><p>Mallacoota remains without power but many locals have opted to stay in the town, which remains completely cut off, as work continues to clear fallen and damaged trees from the only road out of town.</p><p>Fires remain 'dangerous, dynamic and volatile'</p><p>Fire crews are today attempting controlled burns near coastal communities in a bid to protect property ahead of a wind change predicted to cause problems across fire grounds later this week.</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said fire conditions on Friday were likely to rise to extreme in the Northern Country, severe in the Mallee and north-east and very high in East Gippsland.</p><p>Mr Crisp said there were 21 fires burning throughout the state this afternoon.</p><p>\"That's more than 1.2 million hectares, mainly of the eastern part of our state, that has burnt,\" he said.</p><p>Rain and cooler temperatures this week have granted a brief reprieve to firefighters, but Ms Neville said the rain had \"in no way changed the risk\".</p><p>\"These fires remain dangerous, dynamic and volatile,\" she said.</p><p>Another expected round of dry lighting, combined with a forecast wind change, could potentially cause fast-moving fires across Victoria, she said.</p><p>A group of 67 North American firefighters arrived in Melbourne this morning and will start working with local fire crews on Saturday.</p><p>Mr Crisp said they would help the CFA analyse and plan how to fight fires in difficult terrain, and support air crews.</p><p>The North American crew joins 41 firefighters from the United States already working in East Gippsland.</p><p>Another 140 people from North America are due to arrive in two weeks to help with incident management.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Instead, the Coalition government is backing a significant expansion of the gas industry, which it predicts will be 13 per cent larger in 2050 than it is now.</p><p>Under the federal government's gas industry strategy, taxpayers will support the private sector to develop viable new gas fields and develop an extensive network of new pipelines and related infrastructure.</p><p>The bushfire royal commission identified climate change as a key risk to ongoing bushfire catastrophe but did not make recommendations about reducing greenhouse emissions to curb the threat.</p><p>The CSIRO report found other factors have an impact on the extent and intensity of bushfires such as the amount of vegetation or fuel load in a forest, the time elapsed since the last fire, and hazard reduction burning. But Dr Canadell said the study showed the link between weather and climate conditions and the size of bushfires was so tight, it was clear these factors far outweighed all other fire drivers.</p><p>\"Almost regardless of what we do the overall extent of the fire, really, is dictated by those climate conditions,\" he said.</p><p>Climate scientists have found climate change is exacerbating the key fire risk factors identified by CSIRO's study, with south-eastern Australia becoming hotter, drier and, in a particularly worrying trend, more prone to high wind on extremely hot and dry summer days.</p><p>The weather system that drove a blast furnace's worth of westerly wind across NSW and Victoria's forests, sparking some of the worst fires of the Black Summer in 2019-20, will be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/experts-warn-extreme-bushfire-weather-risk-growing-20191231-p53nw1.html\">up to four times more likely</url> to occur under forecast levels of global warming.</p><p>\"All the various climate trends, which are so important, are all on the rise and they're all connected to various degrees with anthropogenic climate change,\" Dr Canadell said.</p><p>The study shows fires are becoming bigger and more common even when the Black Summer is not factored in. When the first half of the study period, from 1988 to 2001, is compared to the period between 2002 and 2018, the average annual forest burned area in Australia increased 350 per cent. That figured ramps up to 800 per cent when the fires of 2019-20, which <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>burnt more than 24 million hectares of land</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, are included.</p><p>Mega-fires, which burn more than 1 million hectares, have \"markedly\" increased with three of the four recorded from 1930 occurring since 2000, while the gap between big blazes has had a \"rapid decrease\", the study says.</p><p>Last year, the bushfire royal commission reported fuel-load management through hazard reduction burning \"may have no appreciable effect under extreme conditions\" that typically cause loss of life and property.</p><p>The CSIRO findings bolster that conclusion and call into question <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/critics-put-axe-to-forestry-industry-push-to-increase-logging-20200126-p53utg.html\">calls for native forest logging</url> to be used as a bushfire management tool.</p><p>\"This is happening regardless of anything that we might or might not do to try to stop the fires,\" Dr Canadell said.</p><p>The increased frequency of bushfires is giving the bush less and less time to recover, which is changing ecosystems and threatening the survival of many plants and animals that are struggling to adapt to the pace of change and loss of habitat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fascinating answers to perplexing questions delivered to your inbox every week.

But Dr Canadell said the study showed the link between weather and climate conditions and the size of bushfires was so tight, it was clear these factors far outweighed all other fire drivers.</p><p>\"Almost regardless of what we do the overall extent of the fire, really, is dictated by those climate conditions,\" he said.</p><p>Climate scientists have found climate change is exacerbating the key fire risk factors identified by CSIRO's study, with south-eastern Australia becoming hotter, drier and, in a particularly worrying trend, more prone to high wind on extremely hot and dry summer days.</p><p>The weather system that drove a blast furnace's worth of westerly wind across NSW and Victoria's forests, sparking some of the worst fires of the Black Summer in 2019-20, will be <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/experts-warn-extreme-bushfire-weather-risk-growing-20191231-p53nw1.html\">up to four times more likely</url> to occur under forecast levels of global warming.</p><p>\"All the various climate trends, which are so important, are all on the rise and they're all connected to various degrees with anthropogenic climate change,\" Dr Canadell said.</p><p>The study shows fires are becoming bigger and more common even when the Black Summer is not factored in. When the first half of the study period, from 1988 to 2001, is compared to the period between 2002 and 2018, the average annual forest burned area in Australia increased 350 per cent. That figured ramps up to 800 per cent when the fires of 2019-20, which <link service=\"DOCUMENT\"><marker>burnt more than 24 million hectares of land</marker><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"lni\"/><keyValue value=\"\"/></locatorKey></locator></link>, are included.</p><p>Mega-fires, which burn more than 1 million hectares, have \"markedly\" increased with three of the four recorded from 1930 occurring since 2000, while the gap between big blazes has had a \"rapid decrease\", the study says.</p><p>Last year, the bushfire royal commission reported fuel-load management through hazard reduction burning \"may have no appreciable effect under extreme conditions\" that typically cause loss of life and property.</p><p>The CSIRO findings bolster that conclusion and call into question <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/critics-put-axe-to-forestry-industry-push-to-increase-logging-20200126-p53utg.html\">calls for native forest logging</url> to be used as a bushfire management tool.</p><p>\"This is happening regardless of anything that we might or might not do to try to stop the fires,\" Dr Canadell said.</p><p>The increased frequency of bushfires is giving the bush less and less time to recover, which is changing ecosystems and threatening the survival of many plants and animals that are struggling to adapt to the pace of change and loss of habitat.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Fascinating answers to perplexing questions delivered to your inbox every week.

Life always comes first.\"</p><p>Earlier this week, fire crews were put on high alert after a grassfire threatened a housing estate in Melbourne's west.</p><p>Residents of Mount Cottrell, Truganina and Chartwell were urged to leave their homes on Monday evening as the fire burned out of control until firefighters contained the blaze later that night. More than 50 crews were called to battle it.</p><p>The latest fuel management report from Forest Fires Victoria showed that the risk of bushfire was 64 per cent in 2019-20, compared with 69 per cent for the previous period. The priorities for fuel management in a three-year burning program include forested areas in Ballarat, Castlemaine, Macedon and Bacchus Marsh and the Surf Coast and Otway hinterlands, as well as forests in Melbourne's north and east.</p><p>Mr Hardman said the state's fire-suppression resources, including some of the state's record number of 51 summer aircraft firefighting fleet, additional 740 firefighters and 400 plant contractors, had been allocated to the high-risk areas. \"A hard, aggressive first attack is critical in those areas,\" he said. \"Even though those areas are highest risk, we find that if we apply our resources there it will ensure that the risk is mitigated as far as possible.\"</p><p>Mr Hardman stressed that despite the coronavirus pandemic, planned burns and bushfire preparations were largely unaffected.</p><p>A state government report analysing Victoria's bushfire risk released late yesterday revealed that in 2019/20 there were 230,000 hectares of public land scheduled for fuel management. But 130,000 hectares had been burnt by bushfires or were inaccessible to crews.</p><p>The report also revealed the risk of fires in the Grampians increased to 75 per cent in 2019 to 2020 up from 69 per cent the previous year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-doc7dohlzr8x20xf9l1alt</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61JC-1BC1-JD34-V366-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Print &amp;
