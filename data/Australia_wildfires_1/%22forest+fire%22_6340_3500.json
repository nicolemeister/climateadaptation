They can then declare a national climate emergency and begin a joint strategy, for curbing our emissions faster than we are currently committed to and for adapting to a changed environment.</p><p>It will take many years before emissions curbed globally, not just locally, will have an impact.</p><p>In the meantime, adapting to a changing environment means building in disaster management as a way of life.</p><p>What we are learning is that no matter how well prepared we are, the intensity of fires in parched conditions presents an almost unassailable circumstance.</p><p>So it's with this in mind that Victoria - parched in Gippsland and the northwest, dry in others parts and deep in lush vegetation in others - is, hopefully, listening carefully to the observations of those experiencing fire now.</p><p>Here's one: \"We thought we were prepared,\" NSW beef and soybean producer Carolyn Duff told the ABC.</p><p>\"We know the country, we know fires, we are prepared,\" said Carolyn, whose farm at Toorooka in the Upper Macleay Valley was burnt out.</p><p>\"And we have never seen anything like this ever. It is catastrophic and you will never beat it. Looking back now and after going through it, we were never ever going to stop it.</p><p>\"It was igniting 12 kilometres in front of the fire.\" There's plenty more like this to read on news websites.</p><p>Our CFA is warning of high-consequence fires this summer.</p><p>It's reporting increased fuel loads and flammability in many of our forests and a rainfall deficit in line with historically severe forest fire seasons.</p><p>All of which means we have to prepare well at home and rethink whether we will go or stay in the face of fire.</p><p>So, for country communities, here are some reminders.</p><p>In the Black Saturday fires of February 2009, of the 173 people who died, 113 perished inside their homes and a further 27 just outside them. Eleven died in cars fleeing the fires. A further 10 died on roadways. Many people successfully escaped approaching flames by car.</p><p>Research by the then Bushfire Co-operative Research Centre from the fire at Murrindindi that day found that: IF MOST community members believe that their community is not at risk, most individuals will be psychologically unready to make sound, survival-related decisions under imminent bushfire threat. (Communities influence individuals' decisions via shared, normative beliefs about bushfire risk.) INFORMATION and advice from close family members and from people perceived to have bushfire-related expertise (firefighters, SES, police) will be extremely influential. (Advice and information from particular others will be a major determinant of an individual's decisions - the more so under conditions of uncertainty.) WHAT others are observed to be doing is an important determinant of an individual's decision making. People are social beings, and take their cues about what to do by noting what others are doing in a given situation - especially a situation characterised by uncertainty.</p><p>MEN are more likely to stay and defend their property; women are more likely to leave - especially if they have strong feelings of responsibility for the physical or psychological wellbeing of other family members.</p><p>THE legendary \"Murphy\" was an optimist with regards to bushfires. All involved should be warned to expect and be ready for something really important going seriously wrong at the worst possible time - with potentially fatal consequences.</p><p>PEOPLE aged under 18 or 70-plus, those with disabilities or other impairments - physical, social, psychological - should not be in a situation where they are at risk of bushfire attack.</p><p>IN EXTREMIS, an individual's ability to: regulate emotions such as fear and anxiety; focus on emerging threats from the environment; and keep actions focused on surviving in a potentially lethal environment will largely determine survival.FOR a variety of complex reasons, some individuals will choose to act in ways that jeopardise their safety, and the safety of others.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-c60e1c2609a311eab1aa5e53f773900c7c84719adb72b02539ce2a5326a75ff9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XJ5-5VK1-F0JP-W0X5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"853\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 20, 2019 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RjE4Nzc5N0NGQTVDNDhDMkJEQjFEQURGRjBGRURDRkM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009G89</classCode><className>REGIONAL &amp; LOCAL GOVERNMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>N111110MM</classCode><className>SOYBEAN FARMING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I told them: 'If we don't do a burn-off now, there'll be no birds. There'll be no goannas, no snakes, no wallabies. They'll all be bar-becued.\" Another Tonimbuk resident, cartoonist Mark Knight, said some residents were left to defend their homes without assistance from the CFA.</p><p>\"We fought this fire for three days on our own,\" he said. \"Black Saturday they were all over us. They were fantastic. We didn't see them this year.\" Rex Newton, 70, returned to his Tonimbuk home and wildlife refuge- yesterday to find it burnt to the ground. He said he was near the rear of his property when he saw fire race over a hill towards his back door.</p><p>\"I only have the clothes on my back and it isn't that nice a shirt,\" he told the ABC as he sifted through ash and twisted metal. By the time he managed to load his dog, cat and cockatoo and jump into a car, the fire had singed the hair on his arms.</p><p>Firefighting resources have been stretched to breaking point, with more than 2000 personnel deployed to contain nearly 20 significant- fires across the state.</p><p>Although the crisis had abated last night, emergency services were bracing for the impact of a viole-nt weather change expected to bring strong winds, lightning strikes and possibly snow to some of the same alpine areas scorched by fire.</p><p>A Forest Fire Management Victoria spokesman, when asked why fuel reduction burning had not been carried out on the crown land next to the Bunyip State Park, said that under a change to fire risk management, burning had become- more targeted.</p><p>\"We are using a risk-reduction target to focus our fuel-management strategies on areas that will have the greatest impact,\" the spokesman said. \"This target means we are burning smarter, rather than focusing on a number-of-hectares target.</p><p>\"In some cases this may mean less planned burns - in other areas it may mean more - but communities can be assured that our activities are focused on making them safer and protecting their local environment.\" The immediate threat shifted yesterday from Tonimbuk to the alpine town of Dargo, where the small community was at one point menaced by two bushfires.</p><p>Leanne Estcourt said from insid-e the historic Dargo Hotel that the town was encircled by smoke, with the skies glowing lumin-ous orange. Some town residents sought shelter in the pub.</p><p>\"We have got some people that are here that the fires are affecting their properties as we speak, and the phones are going crazy because we have got the department ringing us all the time,\" Ms Estcourt said. \"It is pretty stressful when you don't know the situation and how bad it is.\" By late afternoon, the threat to properties in Dargo had eased, althoug-h the fires were not under control.</p><p>The Tonimbuk fire was the worst to hit the area since Black Saturday 10 years ago, when a fire which began in the Bunyip State Park destroyed 31 houses and burnt more than 26,000ha.</p><p>Graeme Moore, the Mayor of Cardinia Shire, which takes in Tonimbuk, said his community had been hammered by the fire but praised the CFA.Additional reporting: Tessa Akerman</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-b2e82a863e5811e9a3a1619e5d177992ed249be370804798a1b9cfb59c674777</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VJP-S161-JD3N-53K8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-03-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"658\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 5, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>State Parks</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzAxRThENzk5NTQwNDY1MTkxMTgxQTAyRjgwOTE5OEE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6ODE4NDg4QUI2RDA3NDQ2RkI1QTRFNjA4OUM3QjA4MzA</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLX0</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

Two homes were also lost in the Budgeree-Wilsons Promontory fires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hundreds of firefighters were battling to contain the Bunyip blaze, as residents bunkered down in evacuation centres, not knowing if their homes would be among those lost.</p><p>The Bunyip fire razed homes and sheds, and incinerated vineyards yesterday.</p><p>While many residents chose to stay and defend their homes, others were forced to do so after being told it was too late to leave, after the Princes Freeway was closed in both directions between Nar Nar Goon and Drouin.</p><p>The freeway, and many other local roads, could remain closed for days. Drouin Secondary College will be closed today also.</p><p>Hundreds of people were left without power, with around 550 homes cut off around 2.40pm yesterday at Gembrook, Maryknoll, Nar Nar Goon and Tynong.</p><p>The severity of the blaze prompted the Premier Daniel Andrews to implore people not to risk their lives - and put others in danger. \"Don't put yourself in harm's way and potentially add to the already considerable workload our firefighters have,\" he said.</p><p>Late yesterday afternoon firefighters began focusing on their own safety, on high alert for a wind change which was expected to make conditions even more unpredictable and dangerous.</p><p>More than 850 of them fought to control the blaze sparked by lightning strikes on Friday night, using 100 fire trucks, 18 heavy machines and 10 aircraft.</p><p>Meanwhile, campers and daytrippers had to be evacuated from Wilsons Promontory, due to a fire north of Tidal River.</p><p>At 5.30pm, authorities issued emergency warnings for two other large fires at Yinnar South and Dargo, while a fourth major blaze raged near Licola. Despite the wind switching from the north-westerly to south-easterly direction, bringing cooler conditions, firefighters may have to wait until Wednesday before a cold front brings \"limited rain\".</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria's Chris Eagle said the Bunyip fire in Gippsland had \"significantly expanded\" yesterday afternoon.</p><p>Mr Eagle said he expected more homes would be lost once the ash and smoke had cleared.</p><p>\"We had three [destroyed properties] confirmed this morning, but given the fire's grown over 4000 hectares today, more will be impacted,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Eagle said he expected the Princes Freeway would remain closed in both directions between Nar Nar Goon and Drouin for several days, as well as many other local roads in the affected area.</p><p>Lightning strikes ignited the blaze on Friday night and four separate fires morphed into one on Saturday.</p><p>Yesterday, the fire burnt dangerously close to two electricity transmission lines linking the Latrobe Valley and Melbourne. \"Firefighters are protecting these transmission lines, both on the ground and through water bombing from the air,\" a company statement said.</p><p>The lines are running at the north of the fire and at the southern border, near the Princes Freeway. The company operates Victoria's electricity transmission network and said supply could be exposed to risk.</p><p>\"However the situation is unpredictable, and may change quickly,\" the statement said.</p><p>Fire had already damaged power lines and poles in the Gippsland area with outages reported in Toninbuk, Yinnar South and Budgeree.</p><p>Residents of Labertouche were door knocked and told to evacuate yesterday afternoon.</p><p>Others in areas including Bunyip, Cornucopia, Garfield, Gentle Annie, Longwarry, Maryknoll, Nar Nar Goon, Tonimbuk and Tynong were told it was too late to leave and to take shelter immediately.

The bright yellow machine came to grief in a blustery weather change that ramped up the threat level across the thickly populated southeast corner, pitching on to its side when forced into an emergency landing.</p><p>Amazingly, the pilot walked away with a head gash; residents of Pechey had earlier been advised to leave because of the severity of the bushfire danger.</p><p>Weary fire crews were hard-pressed to cover dozens of blazes that flared in the heat and strong winds, flowing on from the searing conditions in NSW on Tuesday. The uncontained Cobraball fire near Yeppoon on the Queensland central coast continued to menace homes and rural properties: it has accounted for 13 of the 14 houses lost in the state since late last week.</p><p>Professor Bradstock's team from the University of Wollongong's Centre for Environmental Risk Management of Bushfires reviewed- data and interviewed people caught up in the 2013 Blue Mountains disaster, west of -Sydney, to understand why their homes were destroyed or spared.</p><p>More than 200 homes went up when fierce blazes ripped through the communities of Springwood, Winmalee and Yellow Rock six years ago.</p><p>The researchers found that dwellings with a separation of at least 40m from forest or bushland were most likely to be saved, -reinforcing the findings of the Black Saturday inquiry as well as studies overseas.</p><p>But the next most important factor was the presence of one or more residents, the as-yet-unpublished study revealed. If someone stayed to defend the property with support from trained firefighters, the probability of destruction dropped by up to 25 per cent against doing nothing.</p><p>\"We have pretty strong -evidence that property defence by the agencies and also the owners who are properly prepared makes a big difference,\" Professor -Bradstock said.</p><p>\"So stay and defend still has validity, but how the authorities nuance that message is a challenge.\" Since the Black Saturday carnage in Victoria on February 7, 2009, in which 173 people were killed and more than 2000 homes were razed, fire authorities have accepted that a catastrophic rating of 100 or more on the Forest Fire Danger Index would overwhelm efforts by even the best-prepared householder to defend a property.</p><p>Increasingly this spring, the Rural Fire Service in NSW and the Queensland Fire and Emergency Services have urged people to leave in the face of severe or emergency-level blazes.</p><p>As detailed in Inquirer on page 11, parts of the country are burning that have never before been -impacted by severe bushfire, including- iconic rainforests.</p><p>Since the razing in September of the Binna Burra Lodge on the Gold Coast hinterland, backing on to a World Heritage-listed reserve of virgin Gondwana rainforest, other importan-t wet subtropical forests have burned at Terania Creek in the famed Nightcap Nation-al Park near Lismore, northeast NSW, while parts of the region's usually luxuriant Clarence Valley have been blackened.</p><p>The towering moss-lined Antarctic beech forests at Wauchope, inland of Coffs Harbour, remain under threat. Rainforest expert and fire ecologist David Bowman, of the University of Tasmania, said: \"To think that those iconic rainforests are burning is very discombobulating.\" Professor Bradstock, who sat on the expert panel for land manageme-nt at the Black Saturday inquiry, said the fire danger index was in the process of being overhauled under a national initiative- headed by the NSWRFS.</p><p>Currently, it covers only temperatur-e, humidity, wind speed and an approximation of drought-related dryness to gauge the level of bushfire threat.</p><p>\"With great fairness to the invent-ors, it's a very antiquated system and we can do much better now,\" he told The Australian.</p><p>Fanned by the swirling winds, flames from the Cooroibah outbreak on the Sunshine Coast advance-d on properties at Noosa North Shore, forcing the precinct's evacuation for the second time since the weekend. The situation was described by firefighters as \"very dangerous\" before residents were urged to flee. People at -Kilkivan, west of Gympie, and Woodgate near Bundaberg were also told to leave their homes.</p><p>The Insurance Council of Aust-ralia extended a catastrophe declar-ation in NSW to Yeppoon and the Sunshine Coast after putting- the cost of bushfire-related claims at $50m to date, with the figure expected to grow.</p><p>Conditions are forecast to ease on Thursday in Queensland, before building up again at the weekend. Authorities in NSW warned that strengthening winds meant properties were still at risk there.</p><p>INQUIRER P11</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-3dc4999c05e511ea921e692189891175aa620b6b9da6d983d4c9cae725d37454</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XGW-8R61-F0JP-W1SD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-11-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"866\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian3 Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 14, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001477</classCode><className>RESEARCH REPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp; NATURAL RESOURCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7R6</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT PILOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001500</classCode><className>RISK MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A3C5</classCode><className>GREAT DIVIDING RANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS001</classCode><className>NEW SOUTH WALES, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

nitf:lede=\"true\">Victoria is facing its first day of dangerous bushfire conditions this season.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters are on standby in the Mallee, in the state's north-west, where temperatures are forecast to reach the mid-30s with winds gusting up to 90 kilometres per hour.</p><p>Forest Fire Management's Scott Falconer said dry forests and predictions of possible lightning strikes are cause for concern.</p><p>\"We're going from a pretty mild spring into really unexpected warm to hot weather,\" Mr Falconer said.</p><p>\"I would describe this as a bit of a wake-up call that the season's changed.\"</p><p>The Mallee region reaches to the New South Wales border.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-22/hot-spring-as-weekend-may-break-september-nsw-heat-records/8974050\">Total fire bans have been implemented across half of NSW with some parts expected to hit 40 degrees Celsius</url> for the first time in September since records began.</p><p>\"The further north you go [in Victoria], the hotter it gets,\" Mr Falconer said.</p><p>\"And as most people would know hot temperatures and high winds are the real risk factors.\"</p><p>Holidaymakers warned to be extra cautious</p><p>Mr Falconer said the start of the school holidays today increased the risk.</p><p>\"We anticipate that we'll have a lot of people camping up on the Murray River and in the great parks of the north-west of the state,\" he said</p><p>Authorities urged holidaymakers to take extra care with their camp fires, with gusty winds able to easily carry embers into the bush.</p><p>Conditions are not as severe as they are at the height of the bushfire season in January and February, but authorities said people still needed to be careful.</p><p>\"But we're going into that period and certainly those sorts of temperatures and those sorts of winds really do present a potential threat to people if a fire gets out of a camp fire, for instance,\" Mr Falconer said.</p><p>The Southern Australian Seasonal Bushfire Outlook 2017 predicted the fire season was likely to start earlier and be more active than usual due to a warmer, dry winter and forecast of a hot summer.</p><p>Two firefighting aircraft are on standby at Stawell to respond to any fires that break out in the Mallee region.</p><p>Strong wind warnings have been issued for much of Victoria, with elevated areas warned to brace for 100 kilometre per hour winds.</p><p>But the Bureau of Meteorology warned the unseasonably warm temperatures would not last.</p><p>A cold front was expected to cross the state late on Saturday, bringing a cooler air stream.</p><p>Snow was predicted above 1,400 metres on Sunday and as low as 1,100 metres on Monday.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

The solitude took my mind off things.\" One of those things was the memory of rushing to help his workmate Brian, in a gas explosion in a Queensland gas plant they worked in back in 1999.</p><p>Mr Brown was thrown clear in the explosion, but as he got up he heard Brian's screams and went back in to find him.</p><p>\"When I found him, he was screaming about his legs,\" Mr Brown said. \"When things settled I could see his left leg had gone and was lying eight feet (2.4m) away against a wheelie bin\".</p><p>Bob received an Australian bravery medal for his actions in September 2000. The Prospectors and Miners Association of Victoria has supported Mr Brown, calling on DELWP to compensate him for the loss of the mine.</p><p>Mr Brown said he wanted $7000 to help replace his tools and offset the loss of the mine.</p><p>However DELWP Forest Fire Management Victoria Murray Goldfields District manager Paul Bates offered Mr Brown $270 for the loss of his hand tools last Friday, but refused to offer compensation for the mine.</p><p>Mr Brown's friend, Andrew Ayres, said DELWP was well aware of the mine, with Mr Bates producing photographs of it, taken 12 months ago.</p><p>\"It wasn't as though DELWP didn't know about the mine, given Paul Bates had photographs of the mine taken about 12 months ago,\" Mr Ayres said. \"They did more damage to the local bush in 10 minutes than Robert ever did sinking a mine shaft.\"A DELWP spokesman said the mine shaft was located within a planned burn area scheduled to be carried out this autumn and a decision was made to fill the open shaft for the safety of firefighters and the public. DELWP stated its officers became aware of the mine in 2015 and tried to contact the miner by visiting the site more than a dozen times over the next two years without success.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WeeklyTimes20180321WeeklyTimes11000363164865</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RX8-XYJ1-JD3N-5159-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-03-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"447\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>March 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DL6S</classCode><className>EXPLOSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000D7FP</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001066</classCode><className>MANAGERS &amp; SUPERVISORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008YTW</classCode><className>UNDERGROUND MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N212221MM</classCode><className>GOLD MINING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000CUY8</classCode><className>HAND &amp; POWER TOOLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000D7FP</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DL4P</classCode><className>OIL &amp; GAS FACILITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS005</classCode><className>NORTHERN TERRITORY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

On Febuary 7, 2009, a new record maximum temperature of 46.4C was set in Melbourne, and the forest fire danger index reached 170; far higher than 1983's Ash Wednesday or 1939's Black Friday.</p><p>If we got a repeat those conditions, we could expect the same number of fatalities, says Professor Ross Bradstock, one of Australia's leading bushfire experts.</p><p>\"If you were to replay the scenario, the weather, the ignition points and timing, I would say you'd get roughly the same result. All bets are off under those conditions. The sort of weather we saw, it was probably the worst fire weather in the world. It's a turbocharged furnace.\"</p><p>He did not suggest we had learnt nothing from the disaster.</p><p>\"We can tinker with our systems, our evacuations, our warnings. But it's so far off the scale, you have to question whether any of the things we do can make a difference.\"</p><p>The bushfire royal commission led to several key changes in the way we warn communities - warnings are sent via SMS and apps almost as soon as fires break out. The biggest change has been the shift in messaging, away from a choice of 'stay or go', toward urging people to leave early.</p><p>On Black Saturday, even the most-prepared residents found property defence challenging, and many were overwhelmed by fire.</p><p>Now, official advice on extreme fire danger days is that even the best-prepared homes will not be safe, and that leaving the night before or early in the day is the safest option.</p><p>But research undertaken through the Bushfire &amp; Natural Hazards CRC suggests while the message may have changed since Black Saturday, people are choosing to stay even when advised to leave.</p><p>A significant number of people tell researchers they simply won't leave until a bushfire breaks out nearby.</p><p>Many won't even leave if a bushfire does break out - waiting for it to directly threaten them, which can lead to dangerous late evacuations, or being trapped at an unprepared property.</p><p>Some people remain unaware of bushfire risk and many do not, or can not, adequately plan and prepare for a bushfire.</p><p>The CFA wants to make it very clear: people who do not get out of harm's way cannot expect to be saved.</p><p>When a fire threatened houses in Hepburn Springs on Saturday, police door-knocked 70 houses by 3am, urging people to leave.</p><p>\"Even at that point, people chose to stay,\" says Steve Warrington, the CFA's chief officer. \"We made it really clear - we won't be sending a fire truck up your street. We won't compromise the safety of our crew when you made a decision to stay there after we'd advised you to leave.\"</p><p>Mr Warrington says there's only so much his firefighters can do.</p><p>\"The big gap is the community not recognising what they have to do.

officer Kade Dowie has praised efforts of crews as a spate of fires broke out across Ballarat on Sunday afternoon.</p><p>He said the fire on the Western Freeway had now been contained, but crews would remain on the scene later this evening and overnight to patrol and mop up the flanks of the fire.</p><p>The fire had been headed in a northerly direction due to the strong winds and was contained before reaching Olliers Road in Mount Rowan.</p><p>The cause of the fire is under investigation with CFA and Victoria Police following standard policy.</p><p>Duty Officer Dowie said there had been 20 CFA appliances on scene attending to the fire, as well as a fire bombing helicopter and an observation air craft.</p><p>He said Forest Fire Management Victoria is also on scene to help clean up trees in the area, but the early indication is there has been no structural damage and no injuries, however there is the potential for fences to have been damaged.</p><p>He could not clarify whether the fires on either side of Creswick Road on the Western Freeway were part of the same fire or separate, and determining this would be part of the investigation.</p><p>Meanwhile, another grass fire in Napoleons started between 2.30pm and 2.45pm on Sunday.</p><p>Duty Officer Dowie said this fire had been contained \"really quickly\" by the 12 crews on scene.</p><p>The fire was about five hectares in size and there had been no damage or injuries.</p><p>The cause of this fire is also under investigation.</p><p>UPDATE, 4.15pm: The fire near Napoleons has now been declared under control.</p><p>However, fire crews are expected to remain on scene for some time and smoke may still be visible in the area.</p><p>It is not known how it started.</p><p>As for the fire near the Western Freeway, it is now listed as being contained.</p><p>UPDATE, 3.55pm: One of the fires is now under control and firefighters are focusing their efforts on the fire closer to Invermay.</p><p>There are currently 21 units battling that particular blaze.</p><p>However, another fire has broken out in Napoleons, to the south of Ballarat.</p><p>Sixteen units are currently fighting that fire, which is burning in the bush near Natrass Road.</p><p>Winds are still hovering around 50km/h, although there have been 63km/h gusts recorded from the south-east.</p><p>2.30pm: Two out-of-control grassfires have started near the Western Freeway to Ballarat's north.</p><p>One fire is burning near the Creswick Road/Midland Highway overpass, while another is burning further along the highway towards Invermay.</p><p>The fires are being fuelled by winds up to 50km/h.</p><p>There are at least six CFA units on scene at the Creswick Road fire, while there are 13 at the Invermay blaze.</p><p>Air support has also been requested.</p><p>The fires started just after 2pm and are about two kilometres apart.</p><p>It is not yet know how they started, although police are investigating.</p><p>People are advised to avoid the area.</p><p>More to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

If it had been a northerly wind it would have blown to the houses or dairy,\" Mr Moir said.</p><p>\"It just shows how easily it can happen on a day you wouldn't expect.</p><p>\"If it had been 32 degrees instead of 22 degrees they would have been at the neighbour's place to stop it before it reached the bush.\"</p><p>The fire brought back memories of the January 10 Framlingham Forest fire that burnt the western boundary of his property 11 years ago.</p><p>The eagle, which was found dead in the paddock, was believed to have hit the powerline and sparked the blaze.</p><p>Mr Moir said that there had been a breeding pair of wedge-tailed eagles that had lived in a big gum tree on the edge of the Framlingham Forest for more than 20 years.</p><p>And even though that tree was burnt in the fire a decade ago, the eagles could be seen every two years flying around the area with their young. \"We're just hoping it's not one of the breeding pair,\" Mr Moir said.</p><p>Mr Moir said he was impressed with how well organised the CFA was and how quickly they contained the blaze.</p><p>Crews spent two hours mopping up after the blaze and Mr Moir spent the night regularly checking on it, including getting up at 4am.</p><p>\"All farmers do, you feel a responsibility even though there's no fault or blame anywhere. Then you think sure I could have rolled over and slept til 6.30am and then got up. If I hadn't got up two hours before and it had flared up and all of a sudden my neighbour's place is on fire because I didn't check it....that's what you do.\"</p><p>Region 5 operations operations manager Richard Bourke said the rapid response from the brigades and planes helped contain the blaze to under five hectares.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WRBLST-doc6z21c31763cpd7b1f2q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WRBLST2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5RRY-STR1-JD34-V1H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386174</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"450\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Standard</publicationName><edition>Print &amp; Internet Editions</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"02\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>February 21, 2018 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Emergency services</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accident</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Traffic accident</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001839</classCode><className>WILDLIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N112120MM</classCode><className>DAIRY FARMING</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It's said that bad luck comes in threes. After a drought that lasted a decade and crippled much of the state, the rains came, flooding vast expanses of eastern Australia. And while the record rainfall this year brought many regions back to life it has also encouraged a blanket of grass to advance across the state, transforming large parts of NSW, and Australia, into a significant fuel source for bushfires. </p><p>Forest fires in Katoomba this week signalled the bushfire season is upon us. Yet it is the tall, thick band of fine fuel which extends from Queensland to Victoria; and west of the Great Dividing Range to South Australia that poses the real danger. Despite the Bureau of Meteorology's forecast for above average rainfall through spring and summer, fire experts say it takes only a week of hot, rain-free weather for grass to \"cure\" or dry out, turning much of the state into a fire hazard. The bureau predicts above average summer temperatures for southern parts of the state, while northern regions should experience temperatures slightly below average. The Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, Shane Fitzsimmons, says more than 2000 grass fires have ignited since July. Despite the forecast of a weaker La Nina this year, parts of the state are unlikely to get away unscathed. \"Across NSW we've got grassland fuel loads the likes of which we have not seen for 30 or 40 years,\" he says. The last time the state had similar levels of grass growth was in the summer of 1984-85, when six people died and 40,000 head of stock were destroyed by fires that raged across more than 4.5 million hectares, he says. Any rain over spring and summer would have no effect on the grass that has already grown and cured over the past 18 months, Fitzsimmons says. \"It's all dry, it's all dead,\" he says. Rain that fell on partially cured grass would extend the drying process. \"We're happy to see the La Nina outlook, but we need to make sure that doesn't put into place a false sense of security, complacency or apathy,\" Fitzsimmons says. Melbourne University fire ecologist Dr Kevin Tolhurst says the fine fuel nature of grass made it easy to ignite, often by lightning strikes. But the main danger of grass fires is their speed, he says. \"Typically a grass fire over an hour will average about 20 to 22 kilometres, where as a forest fire going between two and five kilometres an hour is [considered] a pretty fast forest fire,\" Tolhurst says. Though he adds that grass fires are usually not as intense. \"The heat output is much less and the time taken for a fire to burn out is much quicker,\" Tolhurst says. The behaviour of a grass fire will depend on whether there are trees in the landscape. \"If trees are present, then spotting, the process of numerous new fires starting ahead of the main fire front, is much more likely.\" In pure grassland fires, spotting is limited which makes them more controllable and easier to predict, he says. While their speed can catch people unawares, historically forest fires cause the most damage to houses and properties. \"In a forest fire you might be burning something between 10 and 50 tonne of fuel per hectare. In a grassland area you are probably burning between two and six tonnes per hectare,\" Tolhurst says. It is easier for people or their property to become trapped in a forest fire rather than be overrun by it, he says. To predict grassland fire danger, the NSW Rural Fire Service combines weather data from the Bureau of Meteorology with satellite data and field reports on the amount of grass, measured in tonnes per hectare, and the degree it is cured or dried. The manager of community planning at the service, Dr Simon Heemstra, says satellite images provided by the bureau, capture the colour or \"greenness\" of the vegetation, which can be used to estimate the amount of moisture in the fuel. \"The colour from green to straw to light brown gives us an estimate of the percentage cured,\" Heemstra says. But the images can give false low readings if there is too much green tree canopy. \"Once we get over 70 per cent cured, we are starting to get into a situation where you could have bad fires,\" he says. The amount of fuel per hectare is measured by field reports. \"At the moment it is continuous across most of NSW,\" he says . \"In some cases we are getting it up to people's armpits.\" Once fuel conditions have been calculated they are combined with the daily temperature, relative humidity and wind speed to give what is called a Grassland Fire Danger Index. This index gives a scale of how difficult a fire under those specific conditions will be to control. Dr Andrew Sullivan, a senior research scientist at CSIRO, says historically the index was a ranking between 0 and 100. However advances in weather and fuel data means that the scale is now open-ended. \"Once you get an FDI above 50, it is very difficult to do anything about it,\" Sullivan says. \"You are now into the realm of we'll do the best we can, but the conditions are pretty bad.\" Once a grass land fire has ignited, fire managers use a model developed by CSIRO to predict the rate of spread and intensity of the fire. Sullivan, who helped develop the model, says it takes into account the weather as well as the type of pasture such as natural ungrazed grass land, mown fields or paddocks eaten out by stock. \"If you know where a fire started you can use the model to determine what its average speed will be, and then for a given length of time how far it will travel,\" Sullivan says. It can also predict the fire's shape and the height of the flames, although its overall accuracy depends on the reliability of the input values such as weather data and fuel conditions, he says. After a busy start to the bushfire season, Fitzsimmons says landowners need to prepare their properties for bushfire season, with appropriate firebreaks in grassy regions. \"The real key is everyone should have a bushfire survival plan.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Ominous sign ... a grass fire in Menangle this year could be a sign of what is to come this summer.

He said time was running out for the removal of grass, which could have the same effect as a \"moat filled with petrol\" if allowed to dry near homes and public areas.</p><p>Mr Sauer said Hobart City Council, with its well established fire management protocols, had been a \"leading light, and other Tasmanian councils were grasping the nettle\".</p><p>Glenorchy City Council this week announced an upgrade of its bushfire mitigation program, including the creation of a new bushfire management co-ordinator position.</p><p>Mayor Kristie Johnston said the council was developing plans to mitigate bushfire impacts including fuel reduction burns, vegetation slashing, fire trail maintenance and land holder communication.</p><p>Clarence City Council's bushfire management strategy has been in place since 2011.TFS's bushfire-ready neighbourhoods program, an SFMC initiative which includes landowner discussions, has won a best practice in behavioural change award from the Institute of Public Administration.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-HobartMercury20161216Hobart10000194458673</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MD7-5921-JD3N-52S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-12-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"390\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Hobart Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 16, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

Mal Alexander, Vermont</p><p>Get your hand out I OBJECT to how gleefully politicians spend billions of our dollars. The bigger the amount of B spent, the better. They think somehow the B word impresses us.

The asphalt that connects the potholes is usually in reasonable shape.</p><p>On the Kyneton to Redesdale road, there is a sign that states: \"We will be fixing this road soon.\" I don't know how long the sign has been there but it looks like it needs to be renewed, too.</p><p>Phil Browne, Woodend</p><p>See through the smoke DARYL Young (Text Talk, May 2) blames the CFA for ruining his autumn day with smoke.</p><p>His local CFA volunteers can explain how they are not lighting the burns (it's Forest Fire Management) and how a burn in the right place can help them to protect a suburb like Doreen, which is surrounded on three sides by bush and rural countryside.</p><p>P.J.

Why have we given away so many great players now starring for other clubs? Where are our top-class key position players, ie full-forward, full-back? When are we going to address skill errors including missing easy goals, dropping easy marks, too much ineffective handball, fumbling and how about a little more \"man-up\" instead of allowing opponents to run free?</p><p>When are we going to play four quarters instead of one or two and going to sleep for the rest?</p><p>How are we going to hold on to promising young players who will be offered more money from clubs with greater potential for success?</p><p>Over to you, Blues.</p><p>G.

A forward must kick goals for his team to win. Kicking seven goals from six games won't cut it in today's game.</p><p>This year, Joe has failed to kick goals or assist teammates, and repeatedly turned the ball over to opponents.

Melbourne: Haze hangs over city as planned burns continue across Victoria</nitf:hl1></nitf:hedline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Melbourne's week of hazy mornings has continued today, as fire authorities make up for lost time igniting more than 100 controlled burns across Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Forest Fire Management Victoria's chief fire officer Stephanie Rotarangi said Victorians could expect a reprieve from the smoky conditions over the weekend, before burning recommenced next week.</p><p>\"We're still behind schedule on the number of planned burns that we would have hoped to have achieved at this time, but the season has been quite late - March was a bit variable - so this is the first settled period that we've had,\" she said.</p><p>\"We'll continue to make the most of every opportunity, while attempting to minimise the impact of smoke.</p><p>\"Next week is also looking pretty settled for planned burning, so we will make use of the opportunities across the state to reduce that fuel.\"</p><p>Most of the burns have been in Gippsland, the Hume region, the Yarra Valley and around Lorne on the south coast.</p><p>There are more than 20 burns still in progress.</p><p>Air quality warnings issued</p><p>An emergency alert issued on Thursday for poor air quality in Mooroolbark because of smoke from several planned burns remains in place.</p><p>Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) executive director Tim Eaton said people aged over 65, young children, pregnant women and those with existing heart or lung conditions were most at risk of health issues from the smoke.</p><p>\"In those sensitive groups people normally have for example asthma management plans or plans from their doctor if they've got a lung condition or that sort of thing,\" he said.</p><p>\"We simply ask that they follow those plans.\"</p><p>Ms Rotarangi said fire management consulted with the EPA and the Bureau of Meteorology before commencing planned burns.</p><p>\"There was a little bit of extra smoke in the city yesterday, but that's just bearing in mind that we're not the only ones making use of these conditions, there has been a number of private burns as well as our burns,\" she said.</p><p>She said while the haze had made for some \"pretty\" sunrises this week, fire authorities would continue to try to minimise smoke from the burns.</p><p>\"We're also really conscious that planned burning does affect people, particularly their ability to enjoy the conditions outside and we're just really thanking Victorians for their patience, it's an important program and the whole point of it is to stop bushfires.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
