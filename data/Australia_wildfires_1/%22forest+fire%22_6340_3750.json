Their share of global greenhouse gases is less than 0.2 per cent, or about a eighth of Australia's.</p><p>Still, on a per-capita basis, both nations have among the highest emissions in the world, Mr Shaw said.</p><p>Tally up the 90-odd nations contributing less than 1 per cent of emissions and you reach almost a third of the global total - larger than China or the US, he says.</p><p>\"An issue like this is something the whole world has to grapple with,\" Todd Muller, Mr Shaw's counterpart from the National Party, says.</p><p>To remove the politics from the negotiations, all sides agreed to take advice on New Zealand's targets from an independent climate commission.</p><p>\"If you have essentially your best and your brightest informed by science ... it's an easier place to have a conversation with your community than just playing partisan politics with them,\" Mr Muller said.</p><p>Mr Shaw said the Opposition could have exploited a potentially divisive policy - agriculture contributes half of New Zealand's greenhouse gas emissions - but didn't.</p><p>\"They are playing an absolute straight bat,\" he said. </p><p>New Zealanders, like Australians, have endured an increasing spate of extreme weather events. These include a record hot year in 2016, droughts and a major forest fire last year.</p><p>\"We've definitely had a lot more extreme rainfall events,\" Nava Fedaeff, a climate scientist with the National Institute of Water and Atmospheric Research (NIWA), said. </p><p>Farmers, who have in the past objected fiercely to taxes on methane, appear more ready to accept the need to act. <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.mfe.govt.nz/sites/default/files/Organisations-1/11259_DairyNZ_Redacted.pdf\">DairyNZ, for instance, has welcomed the prospect</url> of emissions targets enshrined in legislation to give the sector \"much needed certainty\".</p><p>Trish Rankin, a dairy farmer managing 440 cows for a Maori-owned co-operative near Hawera in the Taranaki region of the North Island, said climate action \"needs to be apolitical - it needs to be able to last over time\".</p><p>Ms Rankin said New Zealand farmers realise their social licence depends on them being good custodians of the land, and the principle extends to curbing emissions. Open consultations with experts have also helped.</p><p>\"If you know they are listening to you, you're more likely to listen to them,\" she said.</p><p>Mr Shaw said one reason for the different response is that farmers - unlike Australian coal companies - have options.</p><p>\"People are still going to want to eat in 30 years' time, so the question is what do you produce and how do you produce it - not whether or not you're going to produce food,\" he said. \"But in 30 years' time, you can pretty much guarantee no one in the world is going to use coal for anything.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEAUS-1520064630</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEAUS2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TGD-7T61-DY19-C14S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404060</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-10-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"733\"/><timeReceived>12:00 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

It's nonsense.</p><p>``In my view it downgrades the importance of prescribed burning.</p><p>``If there's no fuel, there's no fire. You can't do much about weather or drought, but you can do something about fuel.''</p><p>FFV hopes the commission will recommend the prescribed burning target be increased from 130,000ha to the 385,000ha-a-year target recommended by a parliamentary committee but not implemented by the Victorian government.</p><p>However, the groups who commissioned the bushfire science report by RMIT sustainability researcher and PhD candidate Chris Taylor -- including the Wilderness Society and the Victorian National Parks Association -- said it aimed to put prescribed burning into context as a fire management tool.</p><p>The Wilderness Society's Richard Hughes said: ``Vegetation clearance, including firebreaks, will not prevent the spread of fires under catastrophic weather conditions and should only be considered as one part of a broader fire management strategy.''</p><p>Mr Taylor's report uses a formula produced by leading University of Melbourne fire researcher Kevin Tolhurst that tracks the effectiveness of prescribed burns in slowing fires as conditions worsen and the forest fire danger index (FFDI) increases.</p><p>Mr Taylor extrapolated the formula, which previously stopped at an FFDI of 100, to cover FFDIs up to 200, such as existed on Black Saturday. He found ``the probability of previous prescribed burns slowing a head fire significantly decreased with increasing FFDI'' and that at 200 it had practically no effect.</p><p>He said yesterday areas of previously burnt forest hit during Black Saturday suffered just as severe damage as areas of virgin forest that had not been burnt.</p><p>Mr Tolhurst, who was working with fire authorities at the emergency co-ordination centre during Black Saturday, said the extrapolation of the formula was valid in that burns had little effect in slowing fires on catastrophic days. But he said such extreme conditions occurred only for about 26 hours every two months, and the rest of the time prescribed burns were an effective fire mitigation tool.</p><p>``It would be quite dangerous to extrapolate from that and say that prescribed burning is not useful,'' Mr Tolhurst said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS200909101006290089</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALI2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WK8-CHG0-YBDY-R352-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"534\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>1 - All-round Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>September 10, 2009 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>AUSTRALIAN CONSERVATION FOUNDATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N813312MM</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL &amp;

Also, because it makes us feel good.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">How might we help kids understand they can feel good by doing good in their communities?</p><p>Some schools encourage community service even at primary school level and organisations such as Scouts and Guides have long done this.</p><p>More than two decades ago, one such program began in four primary schools in Bairnsdale in East Gippsland. The Junior Community Award was originally introduced by the Education Department as a pilot program to address racism and violence in the community.</p><p>A local school principal at the time, David Hawkey, continued the Awards and it has since been adopted and is now managed by the Rotary Club of Mitchell River.</p><p>The Junior Community Award has now spread to Spain, Wales, Gibraltar, and last year to Scotland.</p><p>It's for grade 6 students to complete out of school hours and its aims are fourfold: to raise the level of knowledge in children on the range of values in their community, to give a greater understanding of what makes communities work, to provide an opportunity for children to experience the satisfaction of community work, and to give them an opportunity to see and understand their own potential value to the community regardless of their academic, physical or other abilities.</p><p>Kids are asked to dedicate one hour each week for 10 weeks to service, either by assisting a community group or a person.</p><p>For social experience, they take part in a community commemoration, attend a community meeting, find out about someone else's religious beliefs, attend an arts performance and experience another culture.</p><p>For physical education, they develop a physical skill or learn a new one, dedicating two hours a week for 10 weeks to it. Similarly, they develop a new skill (playing an instrument, sewing etc) over 10 weeks for an hour each week.</p><p>The kids complete diaries explaining what they did and return them to the club. Some have reported attending local government meetings, and others, fly-fishing club AGMs. Some have visit Buddhist temples, Catholic churches and other places of worship.</p><p>Erika Lind, now 29, recalls attending Bairnsdale CFA brigade and local council meetings when she completed the award 17 years ago.</p><p>\"Doing the award was my first exposure to the adult world (outside of family) and for me it was the starting point for my community service,\" she said.</p><p>Today Erika, a science graduate and forest fire management officer living back in East Gippsland at Swifts Creek, is a CFA volunteer, sits on the Swifts Creek Bush nursing centre committee of management and is on the board of Women and Firefighting Australasia.</p><p>Like Cambridge scholar and applied maths lecturer Douglas Brumley who completed the award when he was at Lucknow Primary School, maybe Erika already had an eye for being part of a wider world, for giving back.</p><p>Douglas's dad, Richard, says the help and interest of active teachers and community members who makes these things happen all help \"craft a kid\".</p><p>The award's diary manager and wife of the awards creator, Lorna Hawkey, who continues to support her husband's initiative, says the end game is for kids to understand how their communities work and how everyone can fit in regardless of their differences.</p><p>In the end they do good to feel the good that comes with achieving the award. Or is it the other way around? Do they feel good doing the good activities?</p><p>Either way, hopefully, they become solid community supporters.We sure need 'em out here.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WeeklyTimes20170906WeeklyTimes30000323689904</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5PDG-TH71-F0JP-W0NJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"09\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>September 6, 2017 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

Then the announcement</p><p>comes that there are 30,000 firefighters in the United States and only</p><p>400 are smokejumpers.</p><p>These are brave men and women who parachute into the heart of a forest</p><p>fire, steering themselves into the key areas to save lives and fight</p><p>the fire.</p><p>At the end of Semler's scrambled melange you wish their parachutes had</p><p>never opened.

Former American football star Howie Long shows as</p><p>an actor he's a great gridiron player; he can't act his way out of a</p><p>paper bag. He's Jesse Graves, the new chief of a firefighting crew,</p><p>taking over from Wynt (Glenn).</p><p>Meanwhile, at Wyoming State Penitentiary, convicted killer of 17 and</p><p>robber of $31 million, Earl Shaye (bug-eyed William Forsythe in a</p><p>hilarious blonde wig), connives to start a forest fire and joins the</p><p>convicts who are seconded to fight such blazes.</p><p>From there it's by the numbers escape, taking a hostage (Suzy Amis</p><p>as an unlikely ornithologist) and the clash with Graves as the big,</p><p>BIG fire closes in.</p><p>Apart from those shortcomings, Firestorm fails on a vital front. It</p><p>doesn't look hot.</p><p>Despite the terrific technology and clever special effects, there's no</p><p>feeling of being baked, fried, roasted or even toasted, let alone</p><p>choked on the imaginary fumes.</p><p>Instead, Semler belts the action along in the style of the old movies</p><p>he obviously absorbed when he was a youngster at Saturday afternoon</p><p>movie matinees.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV9803212A20323516</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEADVERTISERLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4597-JJP0-0197-D2WM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Advertiser</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"03\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>March 21, 1998, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp;

It's a testing server where a game's developer team trials features and balance changes before being made available to players. For now, the CTE is available only on PC and players need to have the US$50 (AU$65 approx) Premium Pass to enjoy it. </p><p>There're a bunch of new weapons coming to the DLC pack and they have already gone live for some players. According to GameSpot[1], a total of 11 'Battlefield 1' firearms have been revealed so far. Both the Infantry and Sniper versions of the Lebel Model 1886 are included. Some of the firearms are variants of other guns. Three Melee weapons highlighted are Cogwheel Club, Trench Fleur and Nail Knife. Players will have to complete challenges to unlock these weapons. Challenges may include accumulating kills using different weapons, revive/resupply teammates etc. CTE registration steps are explained in this Reddit[2] thread. The game's big winter update is already live and it has introduced a number of bug fixes and a higher level cap for each class. As most 'Battlefield 1' players are aware of, new 'They Shall Not Pass' footage has surfaced online (videos shared below). They show the new mega-powerful Behemoth, the Char 2C tank, which is based on a real-world French tank. The videos also show one of the four new maps, Fort De Vaux. Moreover, a brand new weapon, the Lebel bolt action rifle, looks insanely solid and powerful. According to another GameSpot[3] report, some the things shown in the videos may change when the final 'Battlefield 1' 'They Shall Not Pass' DLC goes live. The DLC will be introducing the French army to 'Battlefield 1.' It will also add three other French maps, namely, Verdun Heights, Soissons, and Rupture. The DLC will also bring with it the highly-anticipated Frontlines mode, which is a mix of Conquest and Rush. EA has revealed map details, and two of the maps tease environmental effects, such as thunderstorm and forest fire. This is totally new to the 'Battlefield 1' multiplayer and provides an excitement to the series. Stay tuned on IBT AU for more updates on the game.

Here young Sebastian (played as in the previous film by Felix Bossuet) roams freely in company with Belle, the film's real star.</p><p>Sebastian, like Belle, is a foundling, taken in by the crusty but golden-hearted farmer Cesar (Tcheky Karyo).</p><p>With France liberated at last, all three await the return of Cesar's daughter Angelina (Margaux Chatelier), a fighter in the Resistance. But the idyll is shattered by news that she has died in a plane crash on the way home.</p><p>Refusing to accept this, Sebastian stows away on a rescue mission undertaken by the pilot Pierre (Thierry Neuvic), naturally bringing Belle along for the ride.</p><p>The formula works, so why change it? Nicolas Vanier, who directed the 2014 Belle and Sebastian, has been replaced this time round by the Canadian journeyman Christian Duguay, who's probably best-known for the 1995 sci-fi B-movie Screamers. But even the most sensitive viewer would be hard put to detect a directorial signature.</p><p>In its way, the film is a perfect object, delivering exactly the kind of reassuring family entertainment the publicity would lead you to anticipate. For dramatic purposes the plot introduces various threats, implicitly acknowledging the horrors of the off-screen war and building to a genuinely suspenseful climax with the characters trapped by a forest fire. A degree of ambiguity surrounds Pierre, who may or may not be Sebastian's father, while further adult realities are hinted at with the introduction of the teenage Gabriele (former child model Thylane Blondeau) who's forced to disguise herself as a boy for self protection.</p><p>But none of this seriously threatens either the innocence of the protagonists or the more conscious simplicity of the film itself. If you're fond of dogs, children, Alpine scenery, or the French, the fantasy retains a good deal of charm - enough, perhaps, to make up for the lack of anything resembling an original idea.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-79271107</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5K4K-6NT1-DYTG-2330-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"449\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"07\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>July 2, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000523</classCode><className>DOGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A2EX</classCode><className>ORPHANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UR5</classCode><className>SCIENCE FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000061</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp; ACTRESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A7R6</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT PILOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000061</classCode><className>AIRCRAFT ACCIDENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A305</classCode><className>ALPS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Exact details about the update are not known at this stage. According to Express[1], the 'Battlefield 1' Winter Update could see the return of Ribbons, which is a way of promoting team work. Collecting a Ribbon will net players 500XP in multiplayer. The update may also come with a lot of fixes and tweaks for weapons, vehicles and the Spectator mode. A full list of expected Winter Update patch notes is available in the Express report. DICE has promised fans a 'strong' update and a hefty changelog. 'Battlefield 1' 'They Shall Not Pass' DLC is releasing in March. The 'Battlefield 1' 'They Shall Not Pass' DLC will have four new maps, new vehicles, Trench Raider Elite Class, Frontlines game mode and the French army, writes PlayStationLifestyle[2]. EA and DICE are also bringing HDR support on PS4 Pro/Xbox One. EA has also revealed map details and two of maps tease environmental effects such as thunderstorm and forest fire. This is totally new to the 'Battlefield 1' multiplayer and provides an exciting to the series, writes iDigitalTimes[3]. DICE has revealed 'Battlefield 1' details on Verdun Heights, Fort De Vaux, Soissons and Rupture. Players will likely get a chance to fight in the massive forest fires created by the Battle of Verdun. Players will have to fight for domination in the uphill battle towards the massive fortresses of Verdun. The Fort De Vaux map seems like a completely indoor map and the first engagement during World War 1 takes place inside the fort, in the dark underworld of Fort de Vaux. Here, French and Germans fight viciously with flame throwers, guns, grenades and bayonets. The Soissons Map shows the beautiful French countryside in the early hours of a hot summer day. While the war rages on, there is also a thunderstorm brewing. One of the biggest tank assaults of World War 1 takes place in this part shown by the map as the French 10th Army moves to take back Soissons using their powerful Saint Chamond tanks. The 'Battlefield 1' Rupture map takes the French army through poppy-growing battlefields where wreckage from previous tank battles is evident. &lt;blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\" data-lang=\"en\"&gt;&lt;p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"&gt;Stay tuned.

Two hundred employees, including some who had worked on a similar salvage operation after the Ash Wednesday fires in South Australia, have been operating around the clock, at 10 times the normal work rate for three months. \"\"It's a $10 million operation worth $40 million in revenue from salvaged logs to the government and around $400 million more to the industry.

How else can anyone honestly describe the state of British politics? The UK is, if truth be known, currently a nation that resembles little more than a vast community of sleepwalkers who don't seem to know exactly where they are going or why.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some might argue against me. The future for them is clear. They're on their way to the sunlit uplands delivered by a bold independent state made \"Great\" again in a post-Brexit era. \"Dream on\" is the only thing I can say to these somnambulistic visionaries. If we are honest, the big red battle bus was a devious lie on wheels designed to fuel resentment at \"them\" for how they treated \"us\".</p><p>And \"them\" and \"us\" has, since June 2016, become the two-tone <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/brexit-identities-how-leave-versus-remain-replaced-conservative-versus-labour-affiliations-of-british-voters-110311\">defining narrative</url> of British politics. You are \"with us\" or \"against us\", you are \"in\" or \"out\", you are \"friend\" or \"enemy\", you are \"black\" or \"white\". Even the kids in my children's playground can see how ridiculous this is. Politics, like everyday life, operates in shades of grey (more than fifty or so I am told). It goes wrong. It is messy. It limps along because there are no simple answers to complex problems and anyone that tells you that there are is a liar.</p><p>And yet the British people have allowed their political system to descend into a state of play that exists somewhere below the political maturity of the playground.</p><p>As someone who has dedicated his career to promoting the public understanding of politics and therefore has on more than one occasion been forced to defend the behaviour of politicians (often in spite of themselves) I find it almost impossible to defend the behaviour not so much of Britain's politicians but of its political leaders.</p><p>The true insight of Brexit is that the country's political leaders cannot lead.</p><p>Brexit may therefore be little more than a symptom of a deeper and more dangerous democratic malady. I cannot help but think how David Cameron feels when he looks back on his <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/speeches/eu-speech-at-bloomberg\">Bloomberg speech</url> in January 2013. The moment that marked the beginning of the end for Cameron now looks to have ignited a political forest fire that shows no sign of abating.</p><p>Poor leadership puts the party above the nation. Think <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/having-divided-and-conquered-nigel-farage-makes-a-perfectly-timed-exit-62012\">Nigel Farage</url>,       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/treachery-trust-and-the-tories-how-michael-gove-sank-boris-johnson-61722\">Michael Gove</url> and       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/boris-johnsons-leadership-speech-how-to-understand-what-he-was-really-up-to-at-party-conference-104219\">Boris Johnson</url> - all blowing on the fire to further their own ambitions with very little thought to the long-term consequences for the country. And where were the leaders on the other side who were willing or able to mount a passionate defence of the EU and a worldview vision with the UK at its core? It was, if truth be told, a poor fight that was dominated by fairy tales, fig leaves and promises that were quickly retracted within hours of the result becoming clear.</p><h>Who's in charge here?</h><p>But my argument is not about Brexit. It is just a hook on which to hang a simple question: where have all the leaders gone?</p><p>Leadership is defined by an ability to listen, to build teams, to understand and respect opposing views, to inspire and offer hope, to look beyond today and tomorrow and to present a uniting vision of a positive future.</p><p>Leadership is hard and it is lonely. No leader can please everyone all of the time. This is just the hard, grown-up reality of politics. No one becomes a politician to be loved and if they do they are destined to be disappointed. And yet British politics seems to be defined by the existence of disappointed democrats who yearn for some form of resolution, for clarity, for closure. What this requires is mature and confident political leadership and yet maturity and confidence appear to be in short supply.</p><p>Theresa May appears to define flexibility as a weakness. Her claim to being \"a bloody difficult woman\" has now become her Achilles's heel. She lacks the emotional intelligence to engage with members of her own cabinet and party, let alone the broader public.</p><p>Jeremy Corbyn appears afflicted by an inability to outline a clear position on anything and his refusal to <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/jeremy-corbyn-whats-really-happening-when-he-says-no-to-brexit-talks-110071\">engage in talks</url> with the government undermines his credibility as leader of the opposition. Belligerence on both sides benefits no one. It has left the nation adrift, rudderless and desperate not for a \"strong\" or \"heroic\" leader but simply one with the ability to look beyond \"them\" and \"us\", to step out of the playground and offer instead a more honest and balanced account of the scale of the Brexit challenge as it currently exists.</p><p>The challenge for both party leaders, but particularly for the prime minister, is that being honest risks splitting both parties. But that is leadership. Sometimes leadership is about admitting defeat and looking for <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/what-this-brexit-debacle-shows-us-about-the-uks-broken-political-system-108650\">fresh ways</url> to make tricky decisions. It is about putting the interests of the nation above the party. Sometimes being a good politician may involve making unpopular decisions. But where are those brave enough to grasp the nettle? Where have all our political leaders gone?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Matthew Flinders does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUK-110405</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUK2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V8D-PVF1-JB75-90M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-07-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"850\"/><timeReceived>2:21 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United Kingdom</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7117\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>January 24, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001346</classCode><className>POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001293</classCode><className>PARKS &amp; PLAYGROUNDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000A0IC</classCode><className>BORIS JOHNSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DH1G</classCode><className>NIGEL FARAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>PE0009WI7</classCode><className>DAVID CAMERON</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST00099QF</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They had already been pushed within an inch of their lives. They're in real strife,\" he said.</p><p>The Wollemi National Park, stretching from the Hunter to the Blue Mountains, has more than 300 native species of mammals, reptiles, frogs and birds. Yengo National Park is home to a similar number.</p><p>Both national parks are part of the Greater Blue Mountains World Heritage Area. The brush-tailed rock-wallaby is a high priority for conservation management in both parks.</p><p>The NSW government is spending $100 million over five years to save threatened animals and plants from extinction from 2016 to 2021 under its Saving Our Species program.</p><p>Mr Faulkner said the bushfires had put species under further pressure. In some places, the fires had annihilated their habitat.</p><p>\"I have empathy with government departments. The fires are still burning and staff and resources are committed to those fires,\" he said.</p><p>\"Human life, infrastructure and stopping the fires from burning is the priority. But what about the wildlife? So much has been lost already and it won't come back without help.\"</p><p>He said a mass-scale combined effort was \"needed now, not later\".</p><p>\"Many of the species affected were already at risk of extinction, such as koalas, brush-tailed rock-wallabies, turtles, quolls and platypus.\"</p><p>He said the effects of the fires on the largely unseen platypus population would be severe.</p><p>\"People will say bushfires happen and it's natural. Sure, but what about the catastrophic nature of them?</p><p>\"If it was just these fires and this drought, sure, but you've got all the other compounding effects these species were already suffering.\"</p><p>The country is in the midst of a wildlife catastrophe.</p><p>\"Australia had the worst mammal extinction rate on Earth long before this fire and drought,\" he said.</p><p>The threatened tiger quoll was another species that the fires would have hammered.</p><p>\"This entire fire range is tiger quoll habitat. They will have been annihilated.</p><p>\"You're talking probably 50 to 100 endangered species that have been severely impacted.\"</p><p>Some of the other threatened species known to live in the national parks include the squirrel glider, grey-headed flying-fox, regent honeyeater, grey-crowned babbler, speckled warbler, brown treecreeper, broad-headed snake, black-chinned honeyeater, masked owl, barking owl, turquoise parrot, east-coast freetail-bat, black bittern and brush-tailed phascogale.</p><p>The NSW Office of Environment said many wildlife species can endure fires \"by maintaining populations in refuge areas or habitats which have not been recently impacted by fire\".</p><p>\"The severity of the current bushfires combined with ongoing drought will have an impact on wildlife, including threatened species,\" a department spokesperson said.</p><p>\"The extent of the impact will depend on the intensity of the fire and will vary from location to location.\"</p><p>The spokesperson said the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Service backed \"licensed wildlife rehabilitation groups and individuals with funding and support during the search process [for affected wildlife]\".</p><p>It added that it worked with the \"many dedicated wildlife hospitals, carers and rehabilitation centres to care for any injured or displaced wildlife\".</p><p>Aussie Ark and Australian Reptile Park staff have assessed drought- and fire-affected areas in the greater Barrington region.</p><p>\"The results witnessed by staff were devastating. The wildlife organisations had to relocate 50 endangered Hunter River turtles from dried up waterways,\" Mr Faulkner said.</p><p>\"Ten platypus were found and transferred, with five requiring veterinary care.\"</p><p>They also monitored and provided food drops for brush-tailed rock-wallabies and assessed the possibility of emergency intervention for the critically endangered Manning River turtle.</p><p>\"Food drops and artificial water stations should happen. This has been well trialled before in areas affected by fire,\" he said.</p><p>\"There really needs to be a bigger response, but it's needed now. In six months time, they're all dead.\"</p><p>He said some animals would survive the fires and drought, but they still faced the \"massive problem of feral pests\".</p><p>\"Can you imagine how much easier they will be for foxes and cats to hunt?</p><p>\"The animals are exposed and vulnerable. That's what's happening now.\"</p><p>He said the wildlife crisis needs \"a thousand champions\" from public-private partnerships, corporations, government, philanthropic and conservation groups and the community.</p><p>He said the focus over the summer should be on areas where water had dried up.</p><p>\"I don't think we can plan on it raining,\" he said.</p><p>He said the fires had caused a \"catastrophic loss of biomass\" for many common species.</p><p>\"Where [for example] do the honeyeaters go? What do they eat? Everything is displaced,\" he said.</p><p>He said this catastrophic loss would have a \"compounding effect\".</p><p>\"I view it like a tide. The tide is coming, whether it's climate change, pollution, feral pests, fire or drought.</p><p>\"Every time the animals poke their heads up for a breath of air, bang, another wave hits them.\"</p><p>He wonders whether the forests and species will be able to recover. He was particularly concerned that rainforests and so-called \"wet forests\" had burned in northern parts of the state.</p><p>\"We've lost Antarctic beech forest. It's Gondwanian. It's cool temperate forest,\" he said.</p><p>These ancient world-heritage areas stretch in pockets from the Barrington Tops to the Gold Coast. They are the last remnants of the supercontinent Gondwana that broke up about 180 million years ago. Their ecology has been likened to the time of the dinosaurs. Usually these forests are too wet to burn. But sections in northern NSW and southern Queensland burned in the recent fires, highlighting the threat of climate change.</p><p>These areas are home to half of Australia's plant species and a third of its birds and mammals. They help protect dozens of threatened species.</p><p>He said these types of forests were \"not fire resilient\".</p><p>\"When they die, they die.\"</p><p>The Barrington Tops world heritage area has, so far, escaped fire. The Aussie Ark wildlife sanctuary is also in the Barrington Tops. The non-profit organisation establishes predator-proof and fenced sanctuaries for threatened species such as the Tasmanian devil, eastern quoll and long-nosed potoroo. A koala sanctuary is planned to be established.</p><p>Mr Faulkner is worried about fire threatening Aussie Ark's species.</p><p>\"We are in a really complementary spot, on the north-west side of the Barringtons. Fire kind of has to start on us to reach us,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's very unlikely to blow our way. There were four fires up there threatening the Barringtons just weeks ago. They were well controlled. It's largely been unscathed.\"</p><p>This was partly down to luck, he said, which \"makes the protection of critical habitat all the more important\".</p><p>He said the same type of fires won't happen again next year because \"there's nothing left to burn\".</p><p>\"But the wildlife and people are suffering. The Earth is suffering. This doesn't end when the flames go out,\" he said.</p><p>\"What is the response from governments?\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MATLHS-doc78m7ync6chk125o2j6qv</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MATLHS2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XVP-KJN1-F0J6-J168-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">437521</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1394\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Maitland &amp;

But she didn't always believe it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I was taught I could be whatever I wanted if I worked hard,\" she explains over a coffee at her local Jan Juc cafe.</p><p>\"But there are so many professions in which women still aren't visible in leadership positions.</p><p>\"It's one thing to be told you can do something, it's another thing to actually see other women doing it.\" Now 31, the Community Engagement Ranger is one of 95 women from around the world selected to travel to Antarctica as part of Homeward Bound, a unique initiative which aims to heighten the visibility, influence and impact of women making the decisions that shape our planet.</p><p>\"When I found out I'd been chosen I was so shocked,\" she says. \"This is a dream come true for me.\" The program, which runs for 12 months and culminates in the epic voyage down south late next year, develops leadership skills and an understanding of climate change science through a series of workshops both in the lead up to the trip and while surrounded by icebergs, penguins and whales in Antarctica.</p><p>The women, who all represent one of the five STEMM fields (science, technology, engineering, mathematics or medicine), will have the chance to see first-hand the influence of human impact on the environment and the global-scale change needed to reverse it.</p><p>\"I believe women are needed in leadership roles in order to help provide the solutions to the problem of climate change.</p><p>\"And this program is empowering those women, because mother nature needs her daughters now more than ever.\" From a young age, Lily was drawn to nature and conservation, spending family holidays by the ocean's edge climbing trees, camping and hiking through the bush.</p><p>Inspired by fellow female nature-lovers, she became enthralled with Dian Fossey and Jane Goodall.</p><p>\"I was obsessed with apes; I wanted to study primatology,\" Lily says. \"And here were some women who were leading their fields in science. I really looked up to them.\" But in regional Victoria, it was harder for Lily to find role models. \"There weren't a lot of women working in field roles outside of metropolitan Melbourne; there still aren't,\" she explains.</p><p>Lily studied a Bachelor of Science majoring in Conservation of Australian Wildlife. She completed her honours in fire ecology and also did a Masters in Teaching.</p><p>It was while working as a forest fire fighter, battling bush blazes during the deadly Victorian summers, that she began to experience the misconceptions and imbalance of gender in these types of fields first-hand.</p><p>\"When I would tell some people what I did, they would say 'what do you mean you're a firefighter? You're a girl!'\" Lily says.</p><p>\"I'd have to explain to them that it's not all about brute force.\" While working in the remote community of Maningrida in Australia's Northern Territory, she again sought strong, compassionate female leaders to inspire her - and found them.</p><p>\"I spent some time with the female elders,\" she says. \"They really showed me how important having strong male and female leaders is for a community.\" Now a Community Engagement Ranger with Parks Victoria, Lily combines her passion for conservation and education to inspire other women and young girls to care for nature and become change-makers in the fight for the environment.</p><p>But there's still a long way to go for female leaders, explains Lily, not just in science but all fields.</p><p>\"Despite making up 45 per cent of the global workforce, women are globally underrepresented in leadership positions,\" she says.</p><p>\"Female leaders are still labelled as bossy, mean and aggressive and continue to be asked whether they're planning to have a family or not in job interviews.\" \"I also think it's a bit of a female trait to underestimate our own value. \"Despite being in a leadership position now, I still recognise that in myself.\" This self-doubt is one of the main reasons Lily is looking forward to her Homeward Bound journey.</p><p>\"Aside from getting to travel to Antarctica, I think meeting all these other like-minded, inspiring women in STEMM industries is going to be a huge boost for me,\" she says about the other participants from around the world as well as from Victoria, including Zoos Victoria Reproductive Biologist Dr Marissa Parrot and CSRIO Research Scientist Samia Elfekih.</p><p>\"I think these women are going to show me I can do more than I ever thought possible.\" When it comes to climate change, though, Lily has no doubts. Something needs to be done in Australia.</p><p>\"I think there's been total inaction and a big part of that is the current leadership we have and the lack of value they're placing on the planet,\" she says.</p><p>\"Scientists know we are really messing this up but that message just isn't getting through to the people who make decisions.</p><p>\"Part of what Homeward Bound aims to do is empower the whole population to push the government to make the environment a priority.\"Lily is currently raising money for her Antarctica trip, which is self-funded.

nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tathra: </emphasis>Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has activated the national disaster emergency relief scheme after a fire ripped through the Bega Valley, devastating hundreds of residents in the small community of Tathra.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It will never be the same again,\" said one resident of 26 years, Renata Boulter.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">House were reduced to shells in the town on the NSW south coast, leaving 69 completely destroyed and locals in emergency accommodation at Bega Showgrounds.</p><p>Mr Turnbull pledged to investigate local concerns that they got no warning from emergency service broadcasts, with a dozen residents holed up in Bega telling Fairfax Media they received no notification before police and the Rural Fire Service arrived at their door screaming for them to evacuate.</p><p>Megan Morrison, who has lived in the town for 18 years, took her teenage son, two dogs and five guinea pigs with her as she saw the flames rising above her roof.</p><p>\"The police pulled up at our house and yelled get out of here!\" she said, \"People didn't realise it was time to get your s--- together and go.\"</p><p>The fire's speed took emergency services by surprise, with a gust of wind taking the blaze up the gully and straight into town, tearing through houses just two blocks west of the town's main street.</p><p>Gas bottles exploded across a row of eight houses near Ocean View Terrace, turning a row of sea-facing homes into an inferno.</p><p>While many homeowners said they had insurance, the town's renters were left wondering if they would be able to recoup any of their losses.</p><p>\"I know three friends who don't have any, they are stuffed,\" said Ms Morrison.</p><p>Local MP Mike Kelly, Home Affairs Minister Peter Dutton and Emergency Services Minister Angus Taylor moved on Monday to declare residents would be eligible for the national disaster relief scheme, after the scale of the damage became apparent.</p><p>\"While houses can be replaced, lives can't,\" Mr Turnbull said after speaking to residents suddenly made homeless and inspecting the damage in Tathra.</p><p>Ms Boulter, who has been stranded in Bega for 24 hours, said the only way to check if her house was still standing was to continually ring her phone at home.</p><p>At 5pm it was still ringing through, but \"the hardest thing is not knowing what you have lost,\" she said.</p><p>The NSW Premier, Gladys Berejiklian, said she was \"confident that every effort was made to tell people at the right time,\" after hearing criticism of the emergency warning system at the Rural Fire Service briefing centre.</p><p>The area is a well-known reception blackspot, raising questions over the reliability of services in emergency situations, which increasingly rely on smart-phone communication.</p><p>The nearby mobile tower, which already functions poorly, was one of the first pieces of infrastructure destroyed.</p><p>Mr Kelly, who has long had concerns about the area's coverage, told Fairfax Media he was working to get a new Telstra service tower up and running as soon as possible.</p><p>Fire Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons said there was only 100 metres between the fire missing the town all together and the one that destroyed 69 homes.</p><p>He said the random nature of the fire was the result of embers raining down on gardens, homes and even the sand dunes.</p><p>\"Something worked to keep everyone alive,\" said Commissioner Fitzsimmons. \"We are still not counting bodies, or life-threatening injuries and for that we should be forever grateful.\"</p><p>Mr Fitzsimmons said the hundreds of residents that remain sheltered at the Bega Showground evacuation centre would not be allowed to return as long as serious risks remained in the area.</p><p>\"We are particularly mindful of the amount of asbestos floating around,\" he said.</p><p>Local NSW member Andrew Constance said the damage caused to the town was \"heartbreaking''.</p><p>\"We are not out of this emergency yet,\" he said, after working through the night with residents.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology said the forest fire danger index \"was the highest on record for March for most areas of the NSW south coast from Nowra southwards, as well as far east Gippsland and parts of the Monaro\".</p><p>Mr Turnbull said he was \"disappointed the Greens would try to politicise an event like this,\" after Greens leader Richard Di Natale earlier said the conditions were caused by climate change.</p><p>More than 10 fires remained uncontained on Monday night, but showers should bring relief to emergency services on Tuesday when residents are hoping to be allowed back in.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

We have done all our preparation, including upgrading access tracks, removing what was mainly illegally dumped rubbish and advising our forest neighbours. We're now just waiting for favourable weather.</p><p>\"We expect the burn will take several days to complete, but we may need to return a few times to complete the entire burn if we don't get a stretch of good weather. If we don't get the ideal conditions, we may need to reschedule some or all of the work until spring.</p><p>\"While Forestry Corporation fire fighters will carefully monitor all controlled burns to ensure they stay within cleared containment lines, we do ask people to pay attention to any signs in the forest or instructions from staff and stay away from any burning or recently burnt areas for their own safety.</p><p>\"Information about the progress of the burn will be available through the Rural Fire Service's Fires Near Me website and app.\"</p><p>Forestry Corporation is responsible for more than 2.2 million hectares of native and planted forests and has been formally involved in fire-fighting in NSW for almost 100 years.</p><p>For more information about hazard reduction burns, contact the Forestry Corporation Wauchope Office on 02 6585 3744 or visit the Rural Fire Service's Fires Near Me website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me\">www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PORMAC-6k28gt07lfc1hiq9h8fp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PORMAC2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FRX-XK61-JD34-V08T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385972</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Port Macquarie News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>April 15, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

I made it very clear that I wanted this to be a commission for the people, I wanted to have the broadest possible terms of reference and that's what we put through the Parliament,'' Mr Brumby said.</p><p>In his opening, Mr Rush said the McArthur Forest Fire Danger index had predicted February 7 would be the worst fire danger day ever in Victoria.</p><p>According to the index a figure of 50 was considered ``extreme'', but on Black Saturday it ranged between 120 and 180.</p><p>In such catastrophic conditions normal warnings became useless.</p><p>``The risk that the index indicated carried with it the potential of a fire that could not be fought,'' he said.</p><p>Mr Rush said that the first issues considered by the commission would be the warnings and the ``stay or go early'' adopted across Australia.</p><p>An expert will give evidence to the commission that people have no knowledge of the triggers of when to leave early and when it is too late to leave.</p><p>Mr Rush said the maximum intensity that a forest fire can be controlled is expressed as 4000 kilowatts per metre.</p><p>On Black Saturday the intensity reached 100,000 kilowatts per metre.</p><p>``Not only the intensity of the fire, the heat of the fire, but its speed was phenomenal,'' Mr Rush said. ``Fire spotted kilometres ahead, fireballs seemingly of atomic force came before the fire.</p><p>``Such fires create their own weather and are beyond the most sophisticated attempts to control them.''</p><p>Mr Rush said the primary concern of the commission would be to make recommendations that save lives.</p><p>He said charred paddocks were already turning green and rebuilding had started but it was the enormous human cost that must be the priority.</p><p>``The permanent scarring of individuals, the loss of families and communities, is something that can never be replaced or rebuilt,'' he said.</p><p>Mr Rush said fuel reduction would also be a major issue in a complex permit system.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML-20090421-1-011-889810</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VH0-HJX1-2RYX-10T6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"559\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - First with the news Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 21, 2009 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001849</classCode><className>WITNESSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DL3J</classCode><className>INTERIM MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We have done all our preparation, including upgrading access tracks, removing what was mainly illegally dumped rubbish and advising our forest neighbours. We're now just waiting for favourable weather.</p><p>\"We expect the burn will take several days to complete, but we may need to return a few times to complete the entire burn if we don't get a stretch of good weather. If we don't get the ideal conditions, we may need to reschedule some or all of the work until spring.</p><p>\"While Forestry Corporation fire fighters will carefully monitor all controlled burns to ensure they stay within cleared containment lines, we do ask people to pay attention to any signs in the forest or instructions from staff and stay away from any burning or recently burnt areas for their own safety.</p><p>\"Information about the progress of the burn will be available through the Rural Fire Service's Fires Near Me website and app.\"</p><p>Forestry Corporation is responsible for more than 2.2 million hectares of native and planted forests and has been formally involved in fire-fighting in NSW for almost 100 years.</p><p>For more information about hazard reduction burns, contact the Forestry Corporation Wauchope Office on 02 6585 3744 or visit the Rural Fire Service's Fires Near Me website at<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me\">www.rfs.nsw.gov.au/fire-information/fires-near-me</url>.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PORMAC-6k2booztxncapzkb8fp</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">PORMAC2015</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5FRX-XK61-JD34-V06B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">385972</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-04-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"402\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2015 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Port Macquarie News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2015\"><dateText>April 15, 2015 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

I can't say in all truth what it was, but the investigator nailed down where it started and it may have been embers or a cigarette butt,\" Mr Sproule said.</p><p>\"Two days prior to that I had just done the induction for the Makers' Workshop, so in my front shed I had the 94 completed ukulele kits ready to go.</p><p>\"I was having a power nap, it was a hot day, the fires in the area were so bad it was so smokey everywhere and so we were all indoors with the doors closed.</p><p>\"I heard a crack and a bang of the fire - that is what alerted me, and I went, 'That's a fire!' And I sat up and my daughter stormed into the room and said, 'Dad, the shed is on fire!\"'</p><p>Mr Sproule watched on helplessly as all his preparation for the exhibition - his time, love and care put in to creating the instruments - went up in flames.</p><p>He lost a total of 94 completed ukulele kits as well as specially designed ukuleles and priceless rare wood, instruments and tools.</p><p>Mr Sproule had spent about 10 weeks preparing the kits and each one was valued at $249.</p><p>\"There is something about a man in his shed. I know what it is like as a man to make something from scratch with your hands,\" Mr Sproule said.</p><p>\"I wanted to take a product, for example timber, from the cradle to the grave. That process has taken me 12 years to find out how to luthier.\"</p><p>A spokesperson for the University of Tasmania Makers' Program said Mr Sproule was due to display his wares last week until his stock was destroyed in the bushfire.</p><p>\"The university is keen to do whatever we can to support him to re-establish his studio practice, and eagerly await his return to the Makers' Program,\" the spokesperson said.</p><p>Mr Sproule is hoping to get back to work creating new instruments for the exhibition and is thankful the fire didn't spread further.</p><p>\"I am so impressed with our volunteer firefighters; they were just fantastic, they really stopped a forest fire at my place.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>SETBACK: Craftsman Duncan Sproule with a couple of ukuleles he managed to save before a bushfire destroyed his workshop at Preolenna.

largest sheep sale in recent years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An estimated 17,000 sheep went under the hammer on Tuesday at the Cooma Saleyards.</p><p>Some livestock commentators described it as the largest yarding since 2007.</p><p>Cooma-Monaro Shire mayor Dean Lynch says the deteriorating conditions for livestock and ongoing fires are putting many graziers on edge.</p><p>\"We are running out of feed again [so] for most producers it's a worrying time,\" he said.</p><p>\"We are quite privileged here where we probably haven't experienced the dry conditions up until now.</p><p>\"I have seen times a lot tougher here than at the moment, it is not panic stations.\"</p><p>Cooma grazier Jan Sands says it is a worrying time for producers.</p><p>\"If we don't get the winter break now we won't have the feed and then we will be fighting the snow to try and feed sheep,\" she said.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology says the Cooma region has recorded the driest start to summer since December 2002 and January 2003.</p><p>On Saturday the town recorded its warmest February day with 38.6 degrees.</p><p>Overall the region is experiencing the fourth-warmest start to summer since 1973.</p><p>A forest fire north of Cooma has also burnt 2,000 hectares in recent days.</p><p>As surface water evaporates, survival now lies underground.</p><p>Mr Lynch says while Monaro is not officially in drought, it is adding its voice to changes to drought relief.</p><p>\"I don't believe that welfare is the answer in drought times,\" he said.</p><p>\"I believe the government should put processes in place to enable farmers to conserve and make money during the good times.\"</p><p>Ms Sands says she would like Federal Agriculture Minister Barnaby Joyce to visit the Monaro region.</p><p>Senator Joyce has been touring Queensland and NSW properties visiting drought-affected farmers.</p><p>\"Come down and see us during winter and see how bad it is for us down here on the Monaro,\" she said.</p><p>While fear of a return to drought looms large, the weather bureau's three-month outlook has equal odds for drier or wetter conditions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata
