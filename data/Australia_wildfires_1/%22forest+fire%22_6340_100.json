Please be very cautious.\"</p><p>Elsewhere, about 2,000 people were evacuated from hotels and homes near the popular beaches of Tarifa in the southern region of Andalusia.</p><p>The wildfire broke out near where a similar blaze forced evacuations earlier this month.</p><p>\"We managed to save the residential area at the very last second,\" said Antonio Sanz, the Andalusia region's interior minister.</p><p>In the northwestern region of Castile and Leon, dozens of blazes were reported, including one threatening Las Medulas, a UNESCO World Heritage site known for its ancient Roman gold mines.</p><p>The head of the regional government of Castile and Leon, Alfonso Fernandez Manueco, vowed \"to act quickly and generously\" once the fire is over to restore the site \"to its full glory as soon as possible\".</p><p>In neighbouring Portugal, firefighters battled three large wildfires, with the most serious near Trancoso in the centre of the country.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>Source: Weyerhaeuser's, 10-Q filing dated July 25, 2025, available at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000095017025098794/wy-20250630.htm\">https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/106535/000095017025098794/wy-20250630.htm</url> and Weyerhaeuser's website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/\">https://investor.weyerhaeuser.com/</url>.</p><p>SECTION 5 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>5.1 3-DAY: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN</p><p>WY dips 1.3% on firm volume 1.3 times average.

Monday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The four-year-old Romanian boy died days after being found unconscious in the family's car in Sardinia.</p><p>The boy was airlifted to a Rome hospital but died of irreversible brain damage, the hospital told AFP on Monday.</p><p>The news came as Italy's health ministry issued a red alert warning for seven major cities, including Bologna and Florence.</p><p>Some 11 Italian cities are on red alert for Tuesday, and 16 cities on Wednesday, while around 190 firefighters and the army continue to tackle a wildfire on Mount Vesuvius that caused the closure of the national park to tourists.</p><p>Wildfires damaged a UNESCO World Heritage-listed site in northwestern Spain and forced evacuations in three Balkan countries as high temperatures fanned by strong winds left parts of Europe in flames.</p><p>Spanish firefighters struggled to contain a wildfire that damaged a Roman-era mining site in Las Medulas and prompted hundreds of residents to evacuate.</p><p>High temperatures and winds of up to 40 kilometres per hour (25 mph) created \"many difficulties\", said Juan Carlos Suarez-Quinones, the Castile and Leon regional environment minister.</p><p>\"We will not allow people to return until safety in their communities is absolutely guaranteed,\" he told reporters, estimating that about 700 people had been displaced.</p><p>Four people, including two firefighters, suffered minor injuries, he added.</p><p>The blaze broke out on Sunday near Las Medulas, an area famed for its striking red landscape.</p><p>Spain has been in the grip of a heatwave for the past week, with temperatures nearing 40C in many areas and fuelling wildfires.</p><p>Castile and Leon alone has seen 13 fires in the past three days, according to Suarez-Quinones, who said that some were believed to have been deliberately started.</p><p>In neighbouring Portugal, firefighters were battling three large wildfires in the centre and north of the country.</p><p>People were evacuated from dozens of homes in the Balkans as firefighters battled blazes in Albania, Montenegro and Croatia, where red alerts were announced.</p><p>In Albania, hundreds of firefighters and soldiers had subdued most of the nearly 40 fires that flared up in the last 24 hours, according to the defence ministry, but more than a dozen were still active.</p><p>Fires continued to burn in the southern coastal area of Finiq, around 160 kilometres south of the capital, where about 10 people were evacuated and several homes were razed on Sunday night, according to local media.</p><p>Since the start of July, nearly 34,000 hectares (84,000 acres) have been scorched nationwide, according to the European Forest Fire Information System (EFFIS).</p><p>Police allege that many of the blazes were deliberately lit, with more than 20 people arrested in recent weeks.</p><p>Just outside the capital of neighbouring Montenegro, where temperatures soared to 40C, fire crews managed to save dozens of homes when a blaze broke out in inaccessible terrain on Monday, the commander of the Protection and Rescue Service, Nikola Bojanovic, told media.</p><p>In Croatia, around 150 firefighters also spent the night defending homes from a blaze near the port city of Split.</p><p>In the northwestern Turkish province of Canakkale, more than 2,000 people were evacuated and 77 people received hospital treatment for smoke inhalation after several fires broke out around the tourist village of Guzelyali, authorities said.</p><p>Several homes and cars caught ablaze, according to images shown on Turkish media, while more than 760 firefighters, 10 aeroplanes, nine helicopters and more than 200 vehicles were deployed to battle the flames.</p><p>Turkey had just experienced its hottest July since records began 55 years ago.</p><p>Temperature records were broken in at least four weather stations in southern France, as the government called for vigilance.</p><p>The southwestern city of Bordeaux hit a record 41.6C while all-time records were also broken at meteorological stations in Bergerac, Cognac and Saint Girons, according to the national weather service, Meteo France.</p><p>The heatwave, the country's second this summer, began on Friday and was forecast to last possibly until August 19 or 20.</p><p>On Monday, 12 French departments were placed on red alert, the country's highest heat warning, with four more expected on Tuesday.</p><p>Spanish firefighters struggled to contain a wildfire that damaged the Las Medulas Roman-era

But the update shows the $250m is spread out over four years, with just $50m a year allocated to \"supporting our emergency services and volunteers\", with no detail on whether the funds will be spent on the CFA and VicSES or other emergency services.</p><p>Mr Barnett said the government had rolled out a series of confusing figures, such as the promise to spend $70m on \"rolling fleet\" replacement. \"That's $10m a year for CFA ($40m), and $7.5m for SES over four years ($30m).\" On other occasions the Treasurer and Minister have inflated the \"rolling fleet\" investment to $110m by adding another a $40m allocated to FRV trucks, at a rate of $10m/yr over four financial years.</p><p>\"Talk about how many ways can you spin a single depressingly tiny figure,\" Mr Barnett said.</p><p>Meanwhile analysis of the tax take, based on Ms Symes' May 30 gazette, shows half the $1.54bn tax will go to Fire Rescue Victoria, while seven other government agencies share in a $391m slice of the pie.</p><p>Under the FSPL, only the CFA and FRV could be funded using ratepayers' levy contributions.</p><p>But the new ESVF Act has allowed the government to use the 2025-26 tax take to fund 43.3 per cent of its agencies budgets, allocating: $174m to Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p>$107m to Triple Zero Victoria.</p><p>$78m for the Emergency Management Operational Communication Program. $12.2m to Emergency Recovery Victoria.</p><p>$11m to Emergency Management Victoria.</p><p>$8.8m for the Emergency Alert Program.</p><p>$174,973 to the State Control Centre.</p><p>VOLUNTEERS' SLICE 2025-26 allocation of $1.538 billion in Emergency Services Tax: Just 20 cents in the dollar goes to CFA volunteers 50% Fire Rescue Victoria 25% Government services 20% Country Fire Authority 5% Victorian State Emergency Service Source: VictorianGovernment</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-8e80278661fe11f08877a1278d0d2b3257d80343b8df527d2e4140218602bddb</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GB4-8N93-RS24-G071-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"570\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 23, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp;

this financial year, with VicSES's picking up less than 5c in 100c.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Premier Jacinta Allan and Treasurer Jaclyn Symes have repeatedly stated their emergency services tax on all household and businesses 2025-26 rate notices would deliver \"a massive funding boost for new trucks, equipment and technology\" for both volunteer services.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But on the ground, volunteers say they are being short changed, gaining less under the $1.54 billion Emergency Services Volunteer Fund taxation scheme than they did under $1 billion Fire Services Property levy it replaced.</p><p>Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria chief executive Adam Barnett said \"despite documenting a record tax hike under its new Emergency Services Tax, less of that money is making its way to CFA than ever before\". </p><p>Former Treasurer Tim Pallas told Parliament's Public Accounts and Estimates Committee last year the CFA's forecast budget for 2024-25 was $337.6m.</p><p>Yet at the end of May this year Ms Symes signed a government gazette that stated $312m of the tax would be used to cover 95 per cent of the CFA's 2025-26 budget, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/politics/emergency-service-chaos-cfa-frv-and-vicses-budgets-cut-by-165m/news-story/dcdbb45810994ae89d63dd795846d786\">bringing the total allocation to $328m - equal to a $9m cut</url>. </p><p>Ms Symes, the Premier and Emergency Services Minister Vicki Ward have denied the cutback, but have refused to reveal the CFA budget allocation when repeatedly questioned by Parliament's Public Accounts and Estimates Committee.</p><p>Ms Ward told PAEC in June \"that would have been a conversation between Treasury and the CFA\".</p><p>Ms Allan told PAEC there was funding \"from other parts of government that goes into our emergency services\", such as $250m announced in last December's budget update.</p><p>But the update shows the $250m is spread out over four years, with just $50m a year allocated to \"supporting our emergency services and volunteers\", with no detail on whether the funds will be spent on the CFA and VicSES or other emergency services.</p><p>Mr Barnett said the government had rolled out a series of confusing figures, such as </p><p>the promise to spend $70m on \"rolling fleet\" replacement.</p><p>\"That's $10m a year for CFA ($40m), and $7.5m for SES over four years ($30m).</p><p>On other occasions the Treasurer and Minister have inflated the \"rolling fleet\" investment to $110m by adding another a $40m allocated to FRV trucks, at a rate of $10m/yr over four financial years.</p><p>\"Talk about how many ways can you spin a single depressingly tiny figure,\" Mr Barnett said.   </p><p>Meanwhile analysis of the tax take, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gazette.vic.gov.au/gazette/Gazettes2025/GG2025S269.pdf\">based on Ms Symes' May 30 gazette</url>, shows half the $1.54 billion tax will go to Fire Rescue Victoria, while seven other government agencies share in a $391m slice of the pie.</p><p>Under the FSPL, only the CFA and FRV could be funded using ratepayers' levy contributions.</p><p>But the new ESVF Act has allowed the government to use the 2025-26 tax take to fund 43.3 per cent of its agencies budgets, allocating:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">$174m</emphasis> to Forest Fire Management Victoria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">$107m</emphasis> to Triple Zero Victoria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">$78m </emphasis>for the Emergency Management Operational Communication Program. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">$12.2m</emphasis> to Emergency Recovery Victoria.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">$11m</emphasis> to Emergency Management Victoria.</p><p><emphasis

)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Firefighters battled blazes across Turkey on Monday as the country sweltered in a summer heatwave across much of the Mediterranean, with wildfires leading to at least 14 deaths in the country in the past week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Around 20 villages have been evacuated, officials said, and more than 3,500 people forced to leave their homes.</p><p>\"We are burning up, we don't even know where to go anymore,\" Asmin Gezginci, 24, said while returning from a park to her home in the Kurdish-majority southeastern city of Diyarbakir.</p><p>Temperatures had already soared to a record high of 50.5 degrees Celsius (123 Fahrenheit) on Friday in Silopi, two hours from Gezginci's home.</p><p>According to weather forecasts, the heatwave will continue this week with temperatures of 40C to 45C in the central Anatolia region and 45C to 50C forecast in the southeast on Tuesday.</p><p>On Monday, local authorities in Diyarbakir warned residents about temperatures \"four to six degrees above seasonal norms until August 2\".</p><p>In the city, the thermometer was already showing 45.4C at midday, an AFP journalist saw.</p><p>The heatwave has exacerbated forest fires on the dry ground that have spread rapidly in windy conditions.</p><p>Firefighters tackled blazes around Bursa in the northwest on Monday, the country's fourth-largest city and a major industrial centre, for the third consecutive day.</p><p>Their efforts were hampered by strong winds fanning the flames, according to Agriculture and Forestry Minister Ibrahim Yumakli.</p><p>Some residents used tractors to transport water tanks, while television images showed others rushing toward the blazes with bottles of water in their hands.</p><p>But the intensity of a fire in Karabuk in the north has diminished, and a fire in Kahramanmaras in the south is now \"under control\", Yumakli said.</p><p>\"Given the size and intensity of the fires, the state's ability to respond quickly to such disasters is sometimes limited,\" he acknowledged.</p><p>\"If there is wind, there are no planes, and it takes hours, even days, for you to take control,\" he said.</p><p>In recent days, 19 villages had to be evacuated in the Safranbolu region in the north, and more than 3,500 people around Bursa.</p><p>In a televised speech after a weekly cabinet meeting, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said 96 percent of the fires were caused by human activity such as cigarette butts and picnic fires.</p><p>There were also a few cases of sabotage, he said.</p><p>\"Let us not forget that this is a war, a defence of our green homeland, against this insidious enemy,\" Erdogan said.</p><p>\"We are doing what is necessary, and we will continue to do so.\"</p><p>Last week, a wildfire killed at least 10 forest workers and rescuers fighting a blaze near Eskisehir in western Turkey.</p><p>A firefighter battling the flames died of a heart attack on Saturday.</p><p>Three more people died Sunday in an accident involving a water tanker truck that was used to battle a blaze, Bursa authorities said.</p><p>According to Erdogan, more than 3,000 fires have broken out since the beginning of summer, and authorities warn the situation will remain critical until October.</p><p>A UN report on desertification worldwide estimates that 88 percent of Turkey's territory is at risk: rainfall is expected to decrease 30 percent by the end of the century, while temperatures are expected to rise by 5C to 6C compared to the averages recorded between 1961 and 1990.</p><p>Across the Aegean Sea in Greece, where blazes have ravaged homes and sparked evacuations across the country this summer, firefighters worked Monday to contain outbreaks after bringing dozens under control over the weekend.</p><p>Even as the heat wave gripping the country began to ease, a new forest fire broke out near the university campus east of Athens, in the municipality of Zografou.</p><p>According to firefighters, 65 firefighters, 20 vehicles, seven helicopters and six planes were mobilised to contain the flames.</p><p>Greece has endured heatwave conditions for a week, with temperatures passing 40C in many areas.</p><p>And on the Iberian Peninsula, four Spanish planes joined more than 250 Portuguese firefighters battling a blaze Monday in an isolated mountain region near their border, authorities said.</p><p>The blaze in north Portugal's Viana do Castelo district was spreading in two directions and difficult to tackle because of the strong winds, civil protection chief Marco Domingues said.</p><p>One firefighter has been injured.</p><p>Authorities have put much of northern and southern Portugal on the highest alert for wildfires because of high temperatures and strong winds.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.ibtimes.com.au/turkey-battles-wildfires-heatwave-grips-med-1859861\">Link to the original

The donated land, which connects the Row River and Lower Brice Creek areas, will serve as the site for a new RRFR emergency substation facility for the Row River Rural Fire Protection, aimed at improving wildfire response times. This announcement comes on the 7th of October, 2025, reflecting Weyerhaeuser's ongoing commitment to community and environmental responsibility.</p><p>RRFR is an Oregon 501(c)(3) nonprofit that provides support for fire and emergency services in the Row River Valley, a rural area outside Cottage Grove that experiences high wildfire risk each summer. Historically, this region has not had rapid access to city fire department services. Weyerhaeuser noted in a media release that rural fire protection districts often operate with limited resources and are frequently the first responders to wildfires in remote or hard-to-reach areas across Oregon.</p><p>Lyndcy Patrick, land use manager at Weyerhaeuser, stated, \"Thriving, resilient communities are vital to the well-being of our employees, our neighbors, and the places where we live and work in Oregon. By supporting organizations like RRFR, Weyerhaeuser can make a real difference in wildfire response and help ensure these first responders can keep our communities and forests healthy.\" This donation follows a $25,000 grant Weyerhaeuser awarded to RRFR in 2023 through its Giving Fund to support infrastructure costs for the new fire facility.</p><p>The new Disston Substation will be a satellite fire station equipped with a fire truck and water tender. This facility is expected to significantly enhance emergency response times in Dorena, Culp Creek, and surrounding areas. Kathleen Istudor, Executive Director at RRFR, expressed gratitude, stating, \"We can't thank Weyerhaeuser enough for this generous donation and their support for the strength and resilience of rural communities.</p><p>Press Release article 2 of 17, 342 words </p><p>October 07: Weyerhaeuser's $1 Million Commitment to Buckhannon Signals Long-Term Strategy</p><p>BUCKHANNON, W.Va.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments.

Other proposed cuts include 34 workers in the conservation regulator, 36 in infrastructure and resources, and 20 in policy and planning.</p><p>The department said it had not reviewed its operations since 2017 and that its role changed when the Parks Victoria fire program was transferred to DEECA, and since the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/it-s-like-we-don-t-exist-timber-towns-grapple-with-log-ban-20230524-p5db03.html\">ban on native timber logging</url>.</p><p>The department, which will finalise the restructure this month, also has a role managing the bird flu outbreak and responding to floods and storms.</p><p>Parks Victoria is also separately in the early stages of a possible restructure.</p><p>A government spokeswoman said the 54 new forest firefighter roles at FFMVic would be funded through a $36.9 million investment, and that $20 million would upgrade critical forest fire emergency equipment.</p><p>\"Our capacity to deliver bushfire management works or respond in an emergency has not changed - there is no decrease in the number of field staff under these proposed changes,\" she said.</p><p>DEECA deputy secretary Kelly Crosthwaite said it was working through feedback on the proposed operating model that would \"deliver value for taxpayers and make sure we have the right people working on the right things\".</p><p>\"No frontline firefighting roles are being reduced - in fact we're adding more full-time operational roles - and our incident management capacity and regional presence will be maintained. Victorians can be assured we'll continue to protect communities and the things they care about from bushfire risk.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Emergency Services Minister Jaclyn Symes said Victoria should prepare for an early start to the fire season in the west of the state after a dry winter. </p><p>She said the rest of the state could be described as a normal fire season but that this could change if Victoria didn't get much rain by January.</p><p>Symes said a wild hail storm in Casterton in Victoria's west on Wednesday night was an example of localised weather events becoming more frequent and severe with climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Start the day with a summary of the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=am&amp;utm_source=EditorialArticle&amp;utm_medium=ArticleText&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletters\">Sign up for our Morning Edition newsletter</url>.</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DEECA says no frontline firefighting roles are being reduced under its planned restructure.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SYMRLD-p5kgnpsmh</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SYMRLD2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D6N-JPX1-JBJ7-N3W5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404053</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM UTC</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

Given some field staff roles were also being cut, the union has asked for a breakdown to get a better understanding of total new jobs.</p><p>Lead organiser Ross Kenna said the AWU was considering lodging a dispute with Fair Work.</p><p>The CPSU has already done so, with a hearing listed for Friday. That union, which claimed the department had failed to meaningfully consult on the changes, also said its members would be disadvantaged by their existing work shifting into lower-paid field positions.</p><p>The forest fire operations team - where 118 jobs could be lost - \"delivers integrated land and fire management activities across state forests\", according to department documents.</p><p>As part of FFMVic, the division also undertakes \"bushfire management across all public land in Victoria, and supports other Class 1 and Class 2 emergencies\", which have the potential to be or are deadly.</p><p>Consultation documents circulated to staff in August - also obtained by The Age - acknowledged that cutting this division \"may reduce ability in the short to medium term to contribute to sector-wide [emergency management] arrangements\".</p><p>This was especially true for cross-district taskforces, particularly non-fire emergencies and incident management team roles in which DEECA is not the control agency. \"However the seasonal [emergency management] workforce framework will help mitigate this risk.\"</p><p>The document said the change would streamline planning and result in better integration of forest and fire management.</p><p>All up, the bushfire and forest services group will drop from 1925 staff to 1717. Other proposed cuts include 34 workers in the conservation regulator, 36 in infrastructure and resources, and 20 in policy and planning.</p><p>The department said it had not reviewed its operations since 2017 and that its role changed when the Parks Victoria fire program was transferred to DEECA, and since the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/politics/victoria/it-s-like-we-don-t-exist-timber-towns-grapple-with-log-ban-20230524-p5db03.html\">ban on native timber logging</url>.</p><p>The department, which will finalise the restructure this month, also has a role managing the bird flu outbreak and responding to floods and storms.</p><p>Parks Victoria is also separately in the early stages of a possible restructure.</p><p>A government spokeswoman said the 54 new forest firefighter roles at FFMVic would be funded through a $36.9 million investment, and that $20 million would upgrade critical forest fire emergency equipment.</p><p>\"Our capacity to deliver bushfire management works or respond in an emergency has not changed - there is no decrease in the number of field staff under these proposed changes,\" she said.</p><p>DEECA deputy secretary Kelly Crosthwaite said it was working through feedback on the proposed operating model that would \"deliver value for taxpayers and make sure we have the right people working on the right things\".</p><p>\"No frontline firefighting roles are being reduced - in fact we're adding more full-time operational roles - and our incident management capacity and regional presence will be maintained. Victorians can be assured we'll continue to protect communities and the things they care about from bushfire risk.\"</p><p>On Thursday, Emergency Services Minister Jaclyn Symes said Victoria should prepare for an early start to the fire season in the west of the state after a dry winter. </p><p>She said the rest of the state could be described as a normal fire season but that this could change if Victoria didn't get much rain by January.</p><p>Symes said a wild hail storm in Casterton in Victoria's west on Wednesday night was an example of localised weather events becoming more frequent and severe with climate change.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Start the day with a summary of the day's most important and interesting stories, analysis and insights. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theage.com.au/newsletter-signup?newsletter=am&amp;utm_source=EditorialArticle&amp;utm_medium=ArticleText&amp;utm_campaign=Newsletters\">Sign up for our Morning Edition newsletter</url>.</emphasis></emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>DEECA says no frontline firefighting roles are being reduced under its planned restructure.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WATDAY-p5kgnpwatoday</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WATDAY2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D6N-JPX1-JBJ7-N3WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">404062</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><timeReceived>8:30 AM UTC</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

No, we're not talking dancing girls sashaying through the silverware, instead we are watching a highly animated - and somewhat hapless - chef who is just 6cm tall. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, relax, neither was I until I attended the Le Petit Chef experience at DoubleTree by Hilton Hobart's Leatherwood restaurant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Created in Marseille, France in 2010, Le Petit Chef is a unique 3D video installation that brings your table to life, with each course following the adventures of a tiny chef. Your plate is part of the performance space and \"ingredients\" are flung onto the crockery by the chef as he gardens, fishes and manages to start a forest fire. Each course is then realised by a real-life chef - in our case, Nathan Chilcott who heads up the Leatherwood team.</p><p>While the menu is set by Le Petit Chef, the dishes are open to interpretation by the restaurant's chef and, as the experience is available in more than 100 locations around the world, the final dishes are many and varied.</p><p>We begin with a caprese salad - after Le Petit Chef has battled a mole in his garden. Confit tomatoes capture the flavour of summer, even in winter, and a marinated mozzarella is mild and flavourful. An olive crumb is a nod to the garden's soil and adds a lovely salty hit.</p><p>Given the nature of the experience, it's a set menu with vegetarian and children's options available. The classic and vegetarian menus are $149 per person and the junior menu (ages 6-12) is $89 per person. You're welcome to Leatherwood's wine list or can choose matched wines from cricketer Ricky Ponting's label for an additional $50 per person.</p><p>Once Le Petit Chef has successfully fended off an octopus attack (I promise, this will all make sense once you're there!) we enjoyed a Tasmanian bouillabaisse full of mussels, scallops and calamari paired with a thick slice of toasted sourdough dripping with garlic butter. The soup was beautifully flavoured with a hint of saffron - a traditional ingredient in this classic dish that (just like Le Petit Chef) originated in Marseille.</p><p>Our two mains take Le Petit Chef's directions and give them a Tasmanian and Australian twist with a kunzea-marinated chicken breast served with potatoes, beans and a richly flavoured jus. A perfectly cooked beef striploin sits alongside saltbush potato gratin and delicate baby carrots.</p><p>Everything is beautifully executed and the meal is worthy of standing on its on merits. However, by the sound of the squeals of delight coming from the children seated behind us, the addition of Le Petit Chef is making the restaurant experience both delicious and memorable.</p><p>This unique experience will be at Leatherwood until January and available to up to 16 diners per evening on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Given the nature of the technological logistics of the experience, I'd recommend a booking of even numbers.</p><p>Dessert is a snowy experience for Le Petit Chef and we enjoy it as a dreamy scoop of Valhalla ice cream with dark chocolate ganache, crunchy peanut brittle and delicate shards of meringue dusted with dehydrated berries.</p><p>Le Petit Chef is a delight for children and adults alike and if you're looking to introduce your smalls to restaurant dining, this could be a great way to do it - there wasn't an iPad or screen in sight!</p><p>LE PETIT CHEF @LEATHERWOOD DoubleTree by Hilton 179 Macquarie St, Hobart Opening hours: Thurs, Friday, Sat: 6pm On the menu: Caprese salad, bouillabaisse, kunzea-marinated chicken breast, grilled striploin, ice cream with chocolate ganache</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-6d6f9aac5b8411f0a8cf19e472795d2e403c318dcb6fb877a26fc98aa9a6491a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HBTMRC2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G7S-KXS3-RRVF-22CG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><edition>TasWeekend Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 12, 2025 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC00059LB</classCode><className>WINE.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS445320 BEER, WINE, AND LIQUOR RETAILERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS424820 WINE &amp;

No, we're not talking dancing girls sashaying through the silverware, instead we are watching a highly animated - and somewhat hapless - chef who is just 6cm tall. If you're not sure what I'm talking about, relax, neither was I until I attended the Le Petit Chef experience at DoubleTree by Hilton Hobart's Leatherwood restaurant. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Created in Marseille, France in 2010, Le Petit Chef is a unique 3D video installation that brings your table to life, with each course following the adventures of a tiny chef. Your plate is part of the performance space and \"ingredients\" are flung onto the crockery by the chef as he gardens, fishes and manages to start a forest fire. Each course is then realised by a real-life chef - in our case, Nathan Chilcott who heads up the Leatherwood team.</p><p>While the menu is set by Le Petit Chef, the dishes are open to interpretation by the restaurant's chef and, as the experience is available in more than 100 locations around the world, the final dishes are many and varied. </p><p>We begin with a caprese salad - after Le Petit Chef has battled a mole in his garden. Confit tomatoes capture the flavour of summer, even in winter, and a marinated mozzarella is mild and flavourful. An olive crumb is a nod to the garden's soil and adds a lovely salty hit. </p><p>Given the nature of the experience, it's a set menu with vegetarian and children's options available. The classic and vegetarian menus are $149 per person and the junior menu (ages 6-12) is $89 per person. You're welcome to Leatherwood's wine list or can choose matched wines from cricketer Ricky Ponting's label for an additional $50 per person. </p><p>Once Le Petit Chef has successfully fended off an octopus attack (I promise, this will all make sense once you're there!) we enjoyed a Tasmanian bouillabaisse full of mussels, scallops and calamari paired with a thick slice of toasted sourdough dripping with garlic butter. The soup was beautifully flavoured with a hint of saffron - a traditional ingredient in this classic dish that (just like Le Petit Chef) originated in Marseille. </p><p>Our two mains take Le Petit Chef's directions and give them a Tasmanian and Australian twist with a kunzea-marinated chicken breast served with potatoes, beans and a richly flavoured jus. A perfectly cooked beef striploin sits alongside saltbush potato gratin and delicate baby carrots. </p><p>Everything is beautifully executed and the meal is worthy of standing on its on merits. However, by the sound of the squeals of delight coming from the children seated behind us, the addition of Le Petit Chef is making the restaurant experience both delicious and\u00a0memorable. </p><p>This unique experience will be at Leatherwood until January and available to up to 16 diners per evening on Thursdays, Fridays and Saturdays. Given the nature of the technological logistics of the experience, I'd recommend a booking of even numbers. </p><p>Dessert is a snowy experience for Le Petit Chef and we enjoy it as a dreamy scoop of Valhalla ice cream with dark chocolate ganache, crunchy peanut brittle and delicate shards of meringue dusted with dehydrated berries. </p><p>Le Petit Chef is a delight for children and adults alike and if you're looking to introduce your smalls to restaurant dining, this could be a great way to do it - there wasn't an iPad or screen in sight!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">LE PETIT CHEF @ LEATHERWOOD</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">DoubleTree by Hilton</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">179 Macquarie St, Hobart</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Opening hours: Thurs, Friday, Sat: 6pm</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On the menu:</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Caprese salad, bouillabaisse, kunzea-marinated chicken breast, grilled striploin, ice cream with chocolate ganache</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HOMEOL-62b7f279d526e3fc6dfacea43d2169ca</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOMEOL2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G7T-FYH3-RTHY-R3B9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472254</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"608\"/><timeReceived>7:00 PM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Burnie News Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"45C8\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 11, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC00059LB</classCode><className>WINE.COM INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS445320 BEER, WINE, AND LIQUOR RETAILERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS424820 WINE &amp;

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 5 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>5.1 Rank in the bottom 21% by Relative Valuation in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"280\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">P/E * P/NTA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">129.71</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 21%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings Yield %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 10%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Price/Earnings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">67.9</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 4%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>5.2 Rank in the bottom 17% by Price Performance in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_10\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"296\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">PV1000 [1 yr] $</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">803</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 17%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Rel Strength 6 mo</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 14%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>5.3 Downtrend</p><p>Today's Volatility:</p><p>The 6% premium to 12-month low of $23.71 against the 23% discount to high of $32.59 suggests the stock continues to push for new lows. </p><p>Beta &lt; 1 combined with price fall.

her as she lay unconscious before police officers shot him dead inside a house in the Yarra Ranges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The siblings' mother called police to a house on the Warburton Hwy at Yarra Junction about 5.30pm on Wednesday after a fight broke out at the property.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eastern Region Assistant Commissioner Russell Barrett, who attended the \"dynamic\" and \"traumatic\" scene late on Wednesday, said two officers arrived to find the 45-year-old man strangling his unconscious sister in a bedroom.</p><p>Assistant Commissioner Barrett said they tried to subdue the man by tasering him three times, but were forced to shoot him when he would not let go of his 48-year-old sister, whose arm had been severed above her elbow.</p><p>Paramedics tried to revive the man, but he died at the scene.</p><p>The woman remained in a coma with life-threatening injuries on Thursday morning.</p><p>Assistant Commissioner Barrett said the woman's arm had been partially severed before police arrived.</p><p>Investigators found a sword at the house and will determine whether it was the weapon the man used to attack his sister.</p><p>Assistant Commissioner Barrett said the siblings' mother warned them about the fight unfolding inside the house before they stepped inside.</p><p>He said he stood by the action taken by the senior Constable and leading senior Constable to shoot the man, saying the woman could have been killed if they hadn't.</p><p>The officers involved were distressed after the incident, describing their actions as \"brave\" and \"entirely appropriate\", he said.</p><p>\"It's tragic - it's a graphic scene,\" he said.</p><p>\"This is every police officer's nightmare.</p><p>\"No police officer wants to take these actions.</p><p>\"They've acted entirely appropriately and followed their training.</p><p>\"Our hearts go out to the family.\"</p><p>Assistant Commissioner Barrett said the man had a history of mental health issues and was known to police because of his condition.</p><p>How many people were inside the family home when the fatal fight broke out and how many shots the officers fired will be central to the investigation, which will be overseen by homicide detectives and the force's Professional Standards Command - standard practice for police shootings.</p><p>Forensic specialists spent Thursday morning combing the property for evidence.</p><p>Assistant Commissioner Barrett said the ordeal unfolded over the course of about four minutes, describing footage from the officers' body worn cameras as extremely graphic.</p><p>The pair's mother was taken to hospital for assessment but was not injured during the fight.</p><p>It remained unclear whether the man was under the influence of drugs when police arrived.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria contractor Ian Polkinghorne was staying at a neighbouring bed and breakfast when the incident took place on Wednesday afternoon.</p><p>\"The only thing I really heard was a dog going off (and) losing its nut at one stage,\" he told the Herald Sun on Thursday morning.</p><p>\"I thought it was a bit strange, a bit of a different bark than normal.</p><p>\"I heard sirens, but thought it might have been a car crash, then walked outside to take the bins out and saw cop cars, ambulances and the helicopter, which flew over and rattled the shit out of the joint.\"</p><p>He added while he didn't hear any shots, it wasn't uncommon to hear guns being fired around Yarra Junction.</p><p>\"Every now and again you hear deer hunters fire a gun and you can hear them even with the TV on ... but they use much bigger guns than the police.\"</p><p>Mr Polkinghorne said he had been staying at the accommodation located on Warburton Hwy for work for two years and had seen police at the property where the incident took place multiple times.</p><p>\"I believe there have definitely been problems there before,\" he said.</p><p>\"Every now and again you see the cops there and you just know something weird is going on.\"</p><p>The retired firefighter said the incident didn't worry him personally but his thoughts were with the victim and officers involved.</p><p>Long-time local Brian, who owns 3 Kings Bed &amp; Breakfast, told the Herald Sun his family had lived a few doors down from the Warburton Hwy property for 25 years and had noticed some unusual behaviour from the people living there.</p><p>\"I knew (the man) had issues because there had been an episode prior,\" he said.</p><p>\"We would see him walking up and down the driveway and say g'day but he was a quiet, more solemn type of person.</p><p>\"You just knew that all was not well and the fact that the police had attended the home previously, you knew that there were issues.\"</p><p>Brian said the news shocked the tight-knit community in Yarra Junction.</p><p>\"This stuff happens all the time, every day, everywhere, no doubt, but when it happens in a small town of 1600 people you tend to be shocked and surprised by it,\" he said.</p><p>\"We have never felt personally threatened or concerned for our own safety at any stage, just more sad than anything else.\"</p><p>Another 49-year-old man was also at the home during the fatal shooting, but was uninjured during the ordeal.</p><p>Anyone who witnessed the incident or with further information is urged to contact Crime Stoppers on 1800 333 000 or submit a confidential report online at <url

They are based on my own very considerable experience in forest management as well as careful consideration of both their research and the much wider body of Australian bushfire science.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Published peer-reviewed research referred to by these academics does not necessarily correlate with undeniable facts or logic when it comes to establishing sensible fores fire management policies. There is a very strong body of existing knowledge about forest fire management in Australia, much of which is based on decades of on-ground research trials and the analysis of outcomes from major bushfires.</p><p>A few new research papers, none of which have been published in recognised fire science journals, should not be the sole determinant of radical changes in forest fire management in Australia. To do so would put both communities and the environment at serious risk of major harm from future intense bushfires that will ravage through unmanaged forest landscapes.</p><p>Experienced forest firefighters will tell you that 'lived experience' is very important in determining how to reduce risks of bushfires and how to be more successful in putting them out when they occur. For example, a research paper might show that a prescribed burn conducted 8.5km away from houses only had a limited effect on reducing the risk to those houses being destroyed by a bushfire burning under catastrophic fire weather conditions.</p><p>However, lived experience will tell you that the same prescribed burn could be very effective in enabling a large scale backburn to be conducted safely and thereby in reducing the spread of a bushfire burning under more moderate conditions that could have otherwise impacted on houses when conditions worsen.</p><p>Lived experience also deserves to be considered in situations where it contradicts the findings of published research. For instance, in the 2003 Canberra bushfires, the relatively small lightning caused bushfires burning in a large National Park, where no logging had occurred, could not be controlled at relatively moderate levels of fire danger, because of the excessive fuel loads in those forests as a result of prescribed burning being excluded for decades. Those bushfires went on to claim four lives and destroy more than 500 houses in and around Canberra.</p><p>There are significant flaws in the logic and analysis of some of the published research that is used by these academics to lobby for radical changes in forest and fire management strategies. Many of these flaws have been raised in published critiques of the original research papers.</p><p>Nevertheless, these academics just dismiss these criticisms and continue to publish inaccurate findngs from their own research. For instance, in their response to my critique of their research, they again state that \"logged forests burning under moderate fire weather conditions still burnt at greater severity than intact forests burning under extreme conditions\" quoting their research (Lindenmayer et al. 2022b).</p><p>However, that quoted article was a short response to a critique of their claims made in an earlier two-page published article. In neither of these two articles did the academics publish their own empirical data to justify their often-repeated claim about the impact of logging on bushfire severity.</p><p>Strategically implementing more active management of native forests is the only feasible way to reduce the impacts of the increasing occurrence of severe bushfires. I strongly believe that it would be unreasonable for governments to make important bushfire policy decisions on the basis of a  few new published research articles without a proper consideration of the alternative evidence.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">About the author:</emphasis> Dr Tony Bartlett AFSM has worked in Australian and international forestry for close to 50 years, and has worked in various forestry roles for the Commonwealth, ACT and Victorian government.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Related stories:</emphasis><url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/03/25/burning-off-the-answer-to-intensity/\">Burning off the key to intensity</url>; <url normalizedValue=\"https://arr.news/2025/04/15/disturbance-and-fire-risks-the-science-clearly-shows-logging-and-burning-makes-forests-more-flammable-david-lindenmayer-philip-zylstra/\">Disturbance and fire risks: the science clearly shows logging and burning makes forests more flammable: David Lindenmayer, Philip Zylstra</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARRNEW-221410</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARRNEW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FWT-73C3-RVGB-M2B7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484198</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"712\"/><timeReceived>9:24 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Acquisdata Inc.

I don't feel safe and I certainly don't trust them to burn safely.''</p><p>Ms Pulis said wildlife populations in the area were still recovering.</p><p>\"We went through the fires five years ago and now we see this - it's really worrying. </p><p>\"I hope this doesn't get out of control.</p><p>\"The habitat is extremely young - five years only of growth.''</p><p>Forest Fire Management announced it would burn off 26,404 hectares in the coming five to 10 years around the upper reaches of the Nicholson River in the Yowen-Burrun State Forest.</p><p>The Herald Sun was told the initial target area would be just 300 to 500 hectares but this week's announcement was for an area more than five times that.</p><p>Ms Pulis said the timing of the burn-off also meant many animals such as snakes were hunkering down for the winter and would be caught by the flames.</p><p>\"We have some many species here including the Powerful Owl. The impact is immeasurable. </p><p>\"It is far too soon to burn such critical habitat for bush fire survivors, their off spring and the sanctuary's released animals.''</p><p>FFMV regional manager Peter Brick said the area was impacted by uncontrollable fires in 2020 and in 2007.</p><p>\"To reduce the risk of this happening again it is critical we seize every available opportunity.</p><p>\"The Marthavale - Barmouth Spur fuel reduction burn will be delivered over a five to 10-year period to provide community and environmental protection against bushfire.</p><p>\"Reducing bushfire risk to Victorian communities and the environment is our priority and we do it through the delivery of low-intensity fire, mechanical treatments and responding to emergencies when they occur.\"</p><p>But Shelly Nundra from Gippsland Community Fire Watch described the planned burn-off as \"obscene\".</p><p>\"We just can't trust FFMV to light fires and contain them after the recent Wonnangatta escaped plan burn debacle.''</p><p>Last month fires raged for days in nearby Wonnangatta Valley, triggered by Forest Fire Management burns that got out of control.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

When combined with the government's statutory obligation of 10 per cent, the CFA's total 2025-26 budget rises to $328m - down from $370m in 2023-24.</p><p>Ms Symes' office told the Opposition in March the 2024-25 figures were unavailable, but did supply the 2023-24 allocations instead.</p><p>The gazette also reveals VicSES' budget has been slashed from $85.2m in 2023-24 to $76.8m 2025-26.</p><p>Fire Rescue Victoria is facing the steepest cut, with funding set to drop from $961.4m last financial year to $846.4m in 2025-26.</p><p>Opposition emergency services spokesman Danny O'Brien said the figures \"reveal the lie behind this new tax - it was never about supporting emergency services, it was always about the government trying to plug holes in the budget\".</p><p>When questioned about the cuts this week, Ms Symes office said there were no cuts and \"these incorrect claims are another example of repeated, deliberate misinformation by the Weekly Times.</p><p>\"The gazetted figures are based on an estimated forecast of base funding and do not include all funding provided to emergency services.\" However, the publication of the gazette has left emergency services scrambling for answers. CFA sources said they were still waiting on clarification from Treasury.</p><p>Volunteer Fire Brigades Victoria chief executive Adam Barnett said \"it leaves CFA planning in chaos, unable to order new trucks and secure builders for stations\". Even Forest Fire Management Victoria - responsible for bushfire response and fuel reduction on public land - has had its funding cut, from $431m in 2023-24 to $401m in 2025-26.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-6e3e72a83ff711f0bfc56e1ac3f2b8762e0939f310c3089819f930cd2a4d3e94</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYN-PNC3-SC5B-K0NC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"346\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>WeeklyTimes Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 4, 2025 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009ERN</classCode><className>TREASURY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N922160CC</classCode><className>FIRE DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DN66</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS REGULATION &amp; POLICY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST000DSAS</classCode><className>DISINFORMATION &amp; MISINFORMATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000218</classCode><className>BUDGETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000CTLO</classCode><className>BUDGET CUTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009ERN</classCode><className>TREASURY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 5 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>5.1 Rank in the bottom 13% by Relative Valuation in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_8\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"288\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"240\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Price/Earnings</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">45.4</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 13%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings Yield %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.2</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 10%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>5.2 Rank in the bottom 16% by Price Performance in the NYSE market</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_9\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"336\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"208\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Description</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Value</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Rank</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">PV1000 [1 yr] $</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">779</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 16%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1-month Price Change %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-7.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 13%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Rel Strength 6 mo</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">In Bottom 8%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>5.3 Downtrend</p><p>Today's Volatility:</p><p>The 3% premium to 12-month low of $23.71 against the 26% discount to high of $33.04 suggests the stock continues to push for new lows. </p><p>Beta &lt; 1 combined with price fall.

There was so much smoke in the air, flying in was not an option. Aircraft were grounded.\"</p><p>Mr Sharp said officers were kept busy landing supplies and Forest Fire Management Victoria firefighters onto beaches in the remote Croajingolong National Park via Mallacoota Inlet.</p><p>\"Not even the Navy could get in,\" he said.</p><p>\"Our vessels provided the necessary shuttle service between offshore vessels and onshore landing points, whether they be the wharf, a jetty or one of the beaches.\"</p><p>Awarded with a National Emergency Medal for his role as a fisheries officer in the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, Mr Sharp said fisheries officers had a long history of helping out in major natural disasters since the 1950s.</p><p>He said it was unfathomable that the Victorian Fisheries Authority (VFA) had stripped its officers of their duties to \"respond to an emergency\" as of Friday, June 13.</p><p>It comes amid statewide controversy over the government's new Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund and whether it would deliver value for rural ratepayers, or subsidise Fire Rescue Victoria service provision to urban areas and Melbourne.</p><p>The VFA replaced the state's 73 fisheries officer jobs with 36 engagement officers.</p><p>In May, retired fisheries manager Mike Hosking said inland fisheries officers would be impacted by having fewer staff on the ground for joint operations .</p><p>\"It's all about the state government being broke and needing every department reduced by 40 per cent,\" he said. \"It's a crying shame; we've spent so much time bringing fisheries back from the brink.\"</p><p>Former Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police Kel Glare, his Community Advocacy Alliance and more than 12,900 Victorians have so far signed an online petition for an inquiry into the fisheries authority because the restructure had gone ahead without that risk assessment.</p><p>Mr Sharp said a rumoured merger of the VFA with the Game Management Authority might salvage some enforcement clout from the sacking of almost half the state's fisheries officers, but it would not make up for a ban on the remaining officers responding to emergencies. </p><p>He said that while there were some synergies between the organisations, staff numbers had been decimated. \"It's smoke and mirrors,\" he said. \"What few fisheries officers who were left would then be expected to be running around the mountains chasing spotlighters.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/9jp2tjuwKpcNcyMwTq82JY/d8ca25a2-4609-466f-bdb6-e10bb9a0f3c5.jpeg\">Recently retired Wodonga-based senior fisheries officer Greg Sharp says it's unfathomable that the Victorian Fisheries Authority (VFA) has stripped its officers of their duties to \"respond to an emergency\".

Every evening before my light was turned out, he read me a story about a hobbit who left his comfortable burrow to journey to the Lonely Mountain. Searching for gold at the mountain's roots, talking to eagles, scaring wolves off by starting a forest fire, tricking a dragon: these were the tales he read to me.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We lived in a granite house on the western edge of Aberdeen. Mum planted rhubarb and runner beans in the garden. Summer holidays meant going to Aviemore, in the lap of the Cairngorm mountains. We'd stay in a wooden chalet, where knots in the pine planks looked down at me like the eyes of owls. We'd always walk near the gentle hill of Craigellachie, fledged with silver birches. I learnt to recognise the mountains: Braeriach with its three scooped-out corries, Cairngorm scarred with ski runs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dad knew how to disappear. Some weeks, he'd leave before dawn to take the helicopter out to the North Sea oil platforms. During summer weekends, he'd vanish for the summits of those rounded Cairngorm hills. One day, he marched in through the door with his muddy boots still on, and hoisted his battered blue Berghaus backpack onto the kitchen table, grinning:</p><p>I've got a surprise for you.</p><p>What is it?</p><p>He hefted out a football-sized lump of mountain quartz and put it on the table in front of me. It shone white as a glacier.</p><p>Dad's \"Munro Book\" was a gift from my mum, given shortly after I was born. It was always referred to as the Munro Book, never by its title, and it detailed all of Scotland's peaks over 3,000 feet high - first charted by the tweedy Victorian baronet, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.muchbetteradventures.com/magazine/sir-hugh-munro-history-scotland/\">Sir Hugh Munro</url>. Getting to the top of all 282 of them is a popular challenge for hikers. For dad, it was an obsession.</p><p>Dad was a hillwalker, but the Munro Book was written by mountaineers. It contained sentences such as: \"A pleasantly airy scramble, for which some might prefer the security of a rope.\" (I only ever saw Dad attempting a climbing wall once, when the two of us clambered up - and slithered off - orange and green plastic holds at a gym in Scotland.)</p><p>He never acquired the paraphernalia that winter hikers (or walkers who fancy themselves as climbers) accumulate: crampons, ice axes, ropes, the ironmongery of nut-keys, hexes and cams. However, he did claim that he scrambled up Ben More on the Isle of Mull via a route he termed \"the wrong one\". It was one of his favourite stories.</p><p>The Munro Book shared bookshelves with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mountaincraft and Leadership</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Pennine Way</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The South Downs Way</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Northern Fells</emphasis>, and 30 battered, pink Ordnance Survey maps in miles and feet.</p><p>From the age of nine, dad dragged me out with him. At first, I'd whine about the mud and midges. Later, I felt my heart lifting when I reached a cairn and could see as far as Mull and Skye. I learnt to name the whaleback of Ben Nevis.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The Insights section is committed to high-quality longform journalism. Our editors work with academics from many different backgrounds who are tackling a wide range of societal and scientific challenges.</emphasis></p><p>Dad kept a weather-eye on the forecasts. His kit list included: cheese-and-pickle sandwiches; an itchy wool balaclava; a Berghaus waterproof; a survival blanket; a map, compass and GPS; spare batteries in case the ones in the GPS went flat; a second compass, in case the first compass malfunctioned; and the phone number of Mountain Rescue. All of this was crammed into the ancient blue rucksack.</p><p>Dad's love of the outdoors developed alongside his work as an oil reservoir engineer. There are North Sea oilfields named Everest, Banff, Cairngorm and Munro. And the ease with which Dad read charts of mountains and valleys deep below the sea translated into the mathematical precision with which he navigated with map, compass and GPS.</p><p>When I was old enough to read for myself, I read The Hobbit and longed to journey through the Misty Mountains: \"The mountain smoked beneath the Moon ... The trees like torches blazing bright.\" I'd never seen a forest fire, but even in rainy Scotland, there were signs that blazes were becoming more frequent. Just south of Loch an Eilein (the loch with the island), you came across bunches of strange brooms and paddles by the path: fire beaters, in case the heather caught alight. Aviemore was a busy ski resort in winter, but the snowline was inching higher and higher up the mountains. </p><p>I never worried about Dad. Even when he grumbled about tightness in his chest before his last holiday in the Cairngorms, it never occurred to me that the path could run out so soon.</p><h>Peak oil</h><p>Mountains rise skywards when one of Earth's plates collides against another. Deep in the guts of great ranges, rocks fold and buckle. Ancient seabeds, turned to stone, are heaved upwards. The same rock-fold, the anticline, can forge mountains and harbour oil.</p><p>The Rockies stand on the <url normalizedValue=\"https://carnegieendowment.org/research/2015/01/the-abundance-of-oils-in-the-water-stressed-rockies?lang=en\">largest reservoir of untapped shale oil in the world</url>. The richest oilfields west of Russia are near the Carpathians. Iran's oil and gas deposits lie at the feet of the Zagros, the high range that transects the country from north-west to south-east. North Sea oilfields are named for Highland mountains: Beinn, Schiehallion, Foinaven.</p><p>I look up a 3D schematic of an oil deposit, not unlike <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/336209735_SPE-196730-MS_Integrated_Reservoir_Characterization_and_Simulation_to_Optimize_Recovery_from_a_Mature_Carboniferous_North_Sea_Gas_Field_with_Water_Influx\">the one pictured below</url>. It reminds me of a miniature massif: oil and gas seeping upwards through rock, resembling ice-falls in reverse. In place of a summit scarved with cloud, there's a pointed deposit of trapped methane gas.</p><p>The next zone down, where a mountain's glaciers would be, is an area on the diagram that is coloured green, showing oil. I look at a seismology map - the kind Mum used to work on in Oman. This time, the image shows a vertical cross-section through layers of rock. Its contours are shallower - more hillock than Himalayan peak. I think of knolls and hill forts - Arnside Knott on the Lancashire coast, or Torside on the shoulder of Bleaklow in the Peaks. </p><p>Mountains and petroleum share a similar vocabulary. Exploration, frontiers, surveying. I look at graphs of peak oil production and note coincidences with the so-called golden age of mountaineering. 1854-1865: the dawn of a prolific decade of Alpine mountaineering, the time of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/from-the-archive-blog/2015/jul/14/matterhorn-first-ascent-whymper-1865\">Edward Whymper and the Matterhorn disaster</url>. 1859: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.asme.org/topics-resources/content/drake%E2%80%99s-oil-well-started-a-revolution\">the drilling of the first oil well</url> by the Pennsylvania Rock Oil Company in Titusville. The 1950s and '60s saw western companies exploiting deposits in the Middle East and South America, leading to my grandfather's time working in Venezuela and Iran. Expansion to the Earth's highest peaks; drilling into its rocky depths. </p><p>Richard Bass, the first man to climb the \"Seven Summits\" - the highest peaks on each continent - ran a Texan oil-and-gas business. Black gold funded Bass's Snowbird ski resort in Utah. The first rope access workers on North Sea oil platforms were climbers and cavers.</p><p>Many of dad's friends found that a youthful passion for rock climbing gave them an intimate knowledge of the character of different kinds of stone, or that reading maps translated easily into mapping the deep layers of Earth's bedrock. For a geology or engineering graduate with an enjoyment of adventure and a love of travel, a career in oil exploration was an exciting and well-paid career path. </p><p>But expanding oil frontiers and summiting the world's highest peaks bring similar controversies. It is no coincidence that mountaineering exploits and oil extraction share common ground with colonialism, foreign control, nation-building and struggles for self-rule. Local and Indigenous people are determined to protect their land, or want a stake in the wealth of an industry whose history is mired in colonial exploitation.</p><p>I think of the far-north of Canada and Alaska - of Athabasca people either fierce in their resistance to the incursions of oil companies under the ice, or wanting their fair share of the industry's colossal profits. Sherpas, Sherpanis and Nepalis reclaiming Mount Everest after decades of western exploitation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cm2y70xknnyo\">smashing</url> the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/mount-everest-woman-climber-record-nepali-phunjo-lama/\">time records</url> for summit successes. </p><p>Murky soot and <url normalizedValue=\"https://theconversation.com/microplastics-have-even-been-blown-into-a-remote-corner-of-the-pyrenees-115503\">tiny microplastics</url> from the oil industry touch even the shining Alpine summits that I love. They taint the high snows of Everest. The cataclysmic impact of fires, blowouts and everyday fossil-fuel burning strips them of their ice. Oil is there in the mountains of plastic waste I saw on the outskirts of Himalayan towns. And perhaps the most explosive place where fossil fuels meet mountains is Azerbaijan's Yanar Dag, which dad visited in 2002 on the back of a drunken horse.</p><h>Mountain of Fire</h><p>Nightfall in the countryside near Baku. The horses hung their heads in the stalls. Bahram the guide poured beer on their oats. They shook themselves awake, started munching. Dad hauled himself into the stirrups and thudded into the saddle like a sack of gravel: \"Don't drink and ride!\" The horses began the slow plod uphill.  </p><p>Rocks and thirsty thorn-scrub. A wooden bridge over a parched river. Bahram paused, dismounted, lit a cigarette and flicked the ash towards the riverbed. It touched off flame.</p><p>Wink of fire through twilight. Whiff of gasoline on the breeze. Flames surged from a blackened fissure in the rocks. <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yanar Dag</emphasis> means Mountain of Fire. This fissure has burned for 3,000 years at least. People raised temples where priests tend eternal fires. Did fires like this inspire Zoroastrianism, one of the world's most ancient faiths? I look up the prophet Zarathustra, glance through Nietzche's imagining of his words. I read about Zoroastrian fire rituals and trial by flame. I read about sacred fire, symbolising the light of the deity and the illuminated mind. </p><p>Dad worked in the Caspian region when I was a teenager, flying to Baku for one week every month. He admired the Flame Tower skyscrapers, relished lamb-and-rice <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">plov</emphasis>. Deals were toasted with copious quantities of vodka. I heard about Shah Deniz, the King of the Sea, a gargantuan gas field under fathoms of rock and water.</p><p>Dad longed to hike the ochre-red foothills of the Caucasus, and loved spinning yarns about \"Hell's Doorway\", the crater over a natural gas deposit that burst into flames after a Russian drilling rig collapsed. At garden parties for his colleagues back in the Home Counties, I met Bahram and Mehtab, their daughters Farah and Donya.</p><p>The Caspian seabed was tough drilling. One of Dad's Azeri colleagues showed me a map of the bedrock, riddled with faults. Dad enjoyed the reservoir engineering challenge this posed, in much the same way he relished building Meccano or getting my second-hand Scalextric cars to work.</p><p>Forty-eight billion barrels lie under the world's largest inland water-body. The Caspian is split into four basins; the most southerly is the deepest, divided from the others by the Apsheron Ridge. This anticline linked to the Caucasus Mountains spans the entire Caspian from Baku to Turkmenistan. The Caspian <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.britannica.com/place/Caspian-Sea/Geology\">was formed by a complex interplay</url> of plates shifting and rifting. </p><p>One of the greatest hazards for oil exploration in the region - apart from the earthquakes - are the mud volcanoes. Found near petroleum deposits and mountainous regions, these bizarre formations belch up methane, creating mucky splatter cones. They may bubble up under a body of water, or erupt on land. The rounder ones on land are known as \"mud domes\"; the flatter ones are sometimes referred to as \"mud pies\".</p><p>Dad loved telling stories about them. Soviet scientists wanted to predict their habits, proposing that variable water levels in the Caspian, and even sunspots, might trigger their eruptions. Mud volcanoes are found in the Carpathians, the Caucasus, California, and even in the Gulf of Mexico. Dashli Island in the Caspian Sea is one giant mud volcano which exploded near an oil platform in 2021, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S007832342200046X\">erupting flames 500 metres high</url>. </p><p>The Caspian region is one of the oldest oil-producing areas in the world. Troops of the emperor Cyrus the Great used Baku's oil as an incendiary weapon. Caspian oil lit the way for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920410500000759\">Alexander the Great's soldiers</url>. Medieval Arab historians and travellers noted the region's dependence on oil for heating and trade. An inscription from 1593 commemorates a manually-dug oil well near Baku.</p><p>Baku has been an oil town for centuries. An enterprising Azeri merchant <url normalizedValue=\"https://jpt.spe.org/azerbaijan-the-land-of-unquenchable-fire\">drilled two oil wells in the Caspian in 1803</url>, likely the world's first offshore extraction, although a storm made short work of them in 1825. Robert Nobel arrived in Baku in 1873, tasked with finding walnut trees for wood to build rifles for the tsar's army; instead, he decided to buy an oil refinery. Grainy sepia images of Russian oil production show forests of wooden derricks. In 1898, Franco-Russian filmmaker Alexandre Mishon filmed gushers and blowouts. Russian production of Azeri oil was the most prolific petroleum source on the planet from 1899 to 1901. </p><p>Azerbaijan is the birthplace of many innovations: the first mechanically drilled oil-wells, the first pipelines, the first tankers. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, competition for oil production partnerships in newly independent Azerbaijan was intense. A <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lrb.co.uk/the-paper/v46/n21/peter-geoghegan/short-cuts\">deal with BP in 1992</url> began three decades of exploration and drilling. The offshore platforms became enormous: photos show helipads, flarestacks, workers' quarters, tangles of pipework. As the shallower oil reserves were exhausted, drilling became more ambitious. The Deepwater Gunashli platform began to pump petroleum from 175 metres below the water's surface. </p><p>After \"peak oil\" - the height of demand and production - economists predict that we are entering <url normalizedValue=\"https://mondediplo.com/openpage/a-tough-oil-world\">the age of \"tough oil\"</url>. Deep water, distant locations, greater danger. The oil reserves that dad and his colleagues explored were already becoming increasingly hazardous and hard to reach.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">This article was a runner up in The Conversation Prize for writers, run in partnership with Faber and Curtis Brown.</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yvonne Reddick receives funding from a Leverhulme Trust International Fellowship, hosted at UCLA.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONUK-250943</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONUK2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6GC9-38X3-S9PF-50B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463594</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-07-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2313\"/><timeReceived>1:54 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - United Kingdom</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7117\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"07\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>July 28, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DBMJ</classCode><className>OFFSHORE OIL &amp;

Comprised of mature, highly productive timberlands, the acreage will be well-integrated with existing Weyerhaeuser timberland and mill operations in North Carolina, will expand the company's footprint into attractive markets in southeastern Virginia and will offer substantial alternative value opportunities. The acquisition is expected to deliver immediate and sustained portfolio-leading cash flows within the company's Southern Timberlands business.</p><p>Key attributes of the acquisition:</p><p>Located in strong and growing sawlog and fiber markets in the U.S. South Primarily fee ownership with 81 percent planted pine acreage, strong site productivity and favorable all-weather logging operability Mature planted pine age class expected to produce an average annual harvest of 7.4 tons per acre (or 860,000 tons) over the first five years Expected to deliver an average annual timber free cash flow yield of 5.1 percent over the first five years Significant optionality to capture additional upside from real estate, natural climate solutions and natural resource opportunities \"These are exceptional timberlands, and we're excited and well-positioned to capitalize on this unique off-market opportunity,\" said Devin W.

The demand for sawlogs within our Timberlands segment is directly affected by domestic production of wood-based building products. The strength of the U.S. housing market, particularly new residential construction, strongly affects demand in our Wood Products segment, as does repair and remodeling activity. Seasonal weather patterns impact the level of construction activity in the U.S., which in turn affects demand for our logs and wood products. Our Timberlands segment, specifically the Western region, is also affected by export demand and trade policy. Japanese housing starts are a key driver of export log demand in Japan. The demand for pulpwood from our Timberlands segment is directly affected by the production of pulp, paper and oriented strand board (OSB), as well as the demand for biofuels, such as wood-burning pellets made from pulpwood. Our Timberlands segment is also influenced by the availability of harvestable timber. In general, Western log markets are highly tensioned by available supply, while Southern log markets have more available supply.

This investment is projected to expand engineered wood products capacity by 10 million cubic feet, positioning Weyerhaeuser to seize greater market share in the growing housing sector. While the long-term growth and revenue potential align with favorable housing trends, the funding approach-whether via existing cash or external financing-could pressure short-term liquidity or increase debt levels.</p><p>Shareholder Value Enhancement Through New $1 Billion Buyback Program</p><p>Following completion of a prior program, management authorized a new $1 billion share repurchase initiative in May 2025. This move underscores confidence in company valuation and enhances earnings per share by reducing outstanding shares. While the initiative aligns with the shareholder return framework targeting 75-80% of Adjusted FAD, it reflects a strategic trade-off by potentially limiting capital allocation flexibility during potential market volatility.</p><p>Maintaining Dividend Stability Amid Economic Challenges</p><p>Weyerhaeuser continues its cash dividend framework, targeting a 75-80% payout of Adjusted FAD, and has paid $304 million in 2025 dividends thus far. The year-to-date payout decline-due primarily to an absence of supplemental dividends in Q1-highlights the company's adaptability to fluctuating cash flows. For income-focused investors, this consistent dividend policy provides predictability, though variability in Adjusted FAD may influence future distributions.</p><p>Strengthened Liquidity with an Updated Credit Facility</p><p>The company amended and restated its revolving credit facility in June 2025, increasing capacity to $1.75 billion and extending maturity to 2030. This ensures access to substantial liquidity without current borrowings, providing operational flexibility while reducing refinancing risks during economic uncertainty. The alignment of covenant compliance further supports Weyerhaeuser's credit profile.</p><p>Capital Optimization through Debt Repayment and Refinancing</p><p>Management refinanced maturing debt by repaying $210 million in debentures while issuing a $300 million senior unsecured term loan maturing in 2030. This strategic action reduced the weighted average interest rate, trimming interest expense by $2 million year-to-date, while preserving $592 million in cash and full credit availability. For investors, this showcases disciplined capital allocation, though possible fluctuations in interest rates remain a key consideration.</p><p>Focused Capital Investments to Drive Operational Efficiency</p><p>Excluding the Monticello project, management outlined $400 million in planned 2025 capital expenditures, with $200 million deployed so far. This includes both Timberland and Wood Products maintenance expansions designed to sustain production efficiency. Despite a year-over-year increase, such investments affirm a long-term strategy to sharpen competitiveness-though revenue pressure could strain cash flow in adverse market conditions.</p><p>Expansion into Carbon Markets to Capture Sustainability Growth</p><p>Weyerhaeuser progresses in leveraging its natural climate solutions, capitalizing on the growing demand for carbon credits and renewable energy. By positioning itself within key sustainability sectors, management aims to unlock new revenue streams while aligning with global decarbonization goals. Though regulatory adjustments and market development require monitoring, this initiative offers potential upside for forward-looking investors.</p><p>Unlocking Value Through Strategic Divestitures</p><p>The announced sale of a wood products manufacturing facility (pending regulatory approvals) reflects Weyerhaeuser's strategy to streamline operations and optimize its asset base. If successful, this move could free up cash for reinvestment in higher-margin opportunities and improve overall profitability. However, pending closures introduce timing uncertainties for short-term financial performance.</p><p>Timberland Acquisition to Strengthen Strategic Resource Base</p><p>Management advanced a timberland acquisition that remains subject to regulatory approval. This investment supports long-term timber supply needs for the Timberlands segment while positioning the company in tightening log markets. The targeted synergies enhance revenue potential, though integration risks and upfront costs require careful oversight.</p><p>Operational Efficiency Improvements Amid Inflationary Pressures</p><p>Initiatives to restructure manufacturing processes and reduce costs address inflation-driven challenges related to raw materials, energy, and labor. By improving cost structures, Weyerhaeuser aims to mitigate margin compression and enhance profitability. Successful implementation will be key, especially given labor market constraints influencing production continuity.</p><p>Proactive Risk Management for Contingent Liabilities</p><p>Reserves for litigation and environmental responsibilities demonstrate management's financial diligence in safeguarding against operational uncertainties. By maintaining adequate coverage for contingent liabilities, Weyerhaeuser bolsters its balance sheet resilience. However, potential over-reserving may tie up capital unnecessarily and requires vigilant management assessment.</p><p>Prioritizing Workforce Stability Amid Labor Market Tightness</p><p>Recognizing a 4.1% unemployment rate as a constraint, Weyerhaeuser focused on hiring and talent retention across its segments. Stability in workforce availability ensures operational continuity and supports management's strategic initiatives. However, rising labor costs remain a potential margin-pressure risk-a critical area to monitor for sustained profitability.</p><p>SECTION 5 TODAY'S BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>5.1 PAST WEEK: MODERATE MOMENTUM DOWN</p><p>WY decreases 3.2% on average volume 1.1 times average.

how the megafires that tore through Australia's forests in 2019-2020 impacted animals and plants.</p><p>\"The reality of those megafires is that they burnt more than 10 million hectares,\" said lead researcher Professor Don Driscoll, from Deakin University.</p><p>\"This tragedy prompted a massive research effort to understand how one single fire season affected the biodiversity of those animals and plants, including why some species declined, while others increased after the fires.\" The world-first research gathered and analysed data of more than 1300 animal and plant species over three years, including frogs, reptiles, birds, mammals, insects, land snails and plants.</p><p>Importantly, the results depended strongly on the condition of the land before the fire - especially how frequently it had been burned before the megafires.</p><p>The researchers found 55 per cent of species declined after the 2019-20 fires - either because they were less abundant overall or occupied fewer sites.</p><p>Species in areas exposed to frequent or recent past fires struggled the most, while sites that had experienced three or more fires in the 40\"preceding years experienced declines up to 93 per cent larger than sites not burnt or burnt once over the same period.</p><p>\"These findings have profound implications for how Australia manages its natural environments,\" Prof Driscoll said.</p><p>\"Authorities often use frequent fuel-reduction burning to prepare for bushfires - however our findings suggest this primes ecosystems for major disruption when the next wildfire hits.\" The research team said a rethink of bushfire management was urgently needed. \"Bushfire management agencies aim to reduce fire risks through frequent fuel-reduction burning,\" Prof Driscoll said.</p><p>\"This involves deliberately burning blocks of native vegetation at relatively short intervals, to reduce flammable materials such as plants, fallen branches, logs, twigs, leaves and bark.</p><p>\"Our research suggests this practice, which increases fire frequency, may create larger disruptions to eco-systems when big bushfires occur.</p><p>\"Even if a bushfire is not particularly severe, the harm to plants and animals can be extreme when sites have been burnt three or more times over 40 years, or within the 10 preceding years.</p><p>\"So frequent fuel-reduction burning, combined with any other preceding bushfires, condemns many plants and animals to large, potentially catastrophic declines in the next bushfire.</p><p>\"Fire managers should protect remaining unburnt patches after fire, rather than the current practice of burning them, to prevent later flare-ups. \"At the end of the day, the alternative fire management approaches we suggest will likely fail if climate change continues unabated.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Salvation Army, Society of St Vincent de Paul - delivering food and emergency medicine to householders stranded by flood waters in and around Shepparton and Tatura.\"</p><p>Mr Sharp said Fisheries Officers also provided essential assistance during and after the January 2020 Mallacoota bushfires, which destroyed 123 homes.</p><p>\"In the immediate aftermath of the 2020 fires, the only road into Mallacoota was utterly impassable: littered with debris and lined with scorched trees ready to shed limbs at the slightest breeze,\" Mr Sharp said.</p><p>\"It was therefore necessary for Fisheries Officers - in Kevlacat patrol vessels - to ferry supplies, personnel and essential equipment into the town by sea from Lakes Entrance. There was so much smoke in the air, flying in was not an option. Aircraft were grounded.\"</p><p>He said personnel ferried in and out by Fisheries Officers included Country Fire Authority relief crews and Forest Fire Management Victoria firefighters.</p><p>\"Not even the navy could get in. Our vessels provided the necessary shuttle service between offshore vessels and onshore landing points: whether they be the wharf, a jetty or one of the beaches,\" Mr Sharp said.</p><p>\"Of course, our people did just not turn up after the event. They went in while the fire was still raging, to engage in a daring race against time, to capture and evacuate by sea many critically endangered eastern bristlebirds nesting in the paths of approaching fire fronts.\"</p><p>The Community Advocacy Alliance is calling for a parliamentary inquiry into the organisational restructure of the VFA.</p><p>CAA chair, former Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police, Kel Glare, dubbed the restructure as a \"cost-cutting exercise\" which would \"severely erode\" the state's regulatory enforcement capabilities.</p><p>\"Many recreational and professional fishers remember how a lack of enforcement previously devastated fisheries that were stripped bare by unlawful fishing activities, sometimes by (criminal) gangs. In times past, we nearly lost our crayfish industry through a lack of enforcement. Public oyster rocks at Mallacoota were regularly stripped bare of oysters. More recently, the pillage of scallops devastated Port Phillip Bay, which we understand has mainly recovered due to enforcement.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/249918491/77af7a21-fb2a-4d12-ab97-46f9a0c6e8b3.jpg\">Premier Jacinta Allan in Ballarat for a drought taskforce roundtable.

Aircraft were grounded.\"</p><p>Mr Sharp said fisheries officers ferried personnel, including Country Fire Authority relief crews, to allow them to mop up after the major firefight.</p><p>Officers were kept busy landing supplies and Forest Fire Management Victoria firefighters onto beaches in the remote Croajingolong National Park via Mallacoota Inlet.</p><p>\"Not even the Navy could get in,\" he said. </p><p>\"Our vessels provided the necessary shuttle service between offshore vessels and onshore landing points, whether they be the wharf, a jetty or one of the beaches.</p><p>\"Of course, our people did not just turn up after the event.</p><p>\"They went in while the fire was still raging, to engage in a daring race against time, to capture and evacuate by sea many critically endangered eastern bristlebirds nesting in the paths of approaching fire fronts.\"</p><p>Awarded with a National Emergency Medal for his role as a fisheries officer in the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, Mr Sharp said fisheries officers had a long history of helping out in major natural disasters since the 1950s.</p><p>He said it was unfathomable that the Victorian Fisheries Authority (VFA) had stripped its officers of their duties to \"respond to an emergency\" as of Friday, June 13.</p><p>It comes amid statewide controversy over the government's new Emergency Services and Volunteers Fund and whether it would deliver value for rural ratepayers, or subsidise Fire Rescue Victoria service provision to urban areas and Melbourne.</p><p>\"At the moment, the government is using farmers to prop up its emergency budget,\" Mr Sharp said.</p><p>\"Then on the other hand, they're taking away the staff who have the capability to respond in an emergency.\"</p><p>The fisheries authority on May 20 confirmed, in response to a Freedom of Information request, that it had adopted its 2025 workplace changes, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bordermail.com.au/story/8896327/north-east-fishers-condemn-victorian-fisheries-authority-shake-up/\"> under which fisheries officers were axed and replaced with half as many fisheries engagement officers, </url> without a risk assessment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.bordermail.com.au/story/8975495/victorian-fisheries-at-risk-as-state-government-enacts-shake-up/\"> The VFA replaced the state's 73 fisheries officer jobs </url> with 36 engagement officers.</p><p>In May, retired fisheries manager Mike Hosking said inland fisheries officers would be impacted by having fewer staff on the ground for joint operations and also by the risks associated with one-person stations.</p><p>\"It's all about the state government being broke and needing every department reduced by 40 per cent,\" he said.</p><p>\"It's a crying shame; we've spent so much time bringing fisheries back from the brink.\"</p><p>Former Chief Commissioner of Victoria Police Kel Glare, his Community Advocacy Alliance and more than 12,900 concerned Victorians have so far signed an online petition for an inquiry into the fisheries authority because the restructure had gone ahead without that risk assessment.</p><p>Mr Sharp said a rumoured merger of the VFA with the Game Management Authority might salvage some enforcement clout from the sacking of almost half the state's fisheries officers, but it would not make up for a ban on the remaining officers responding to emergencies.</p><p>He said that while there were some synergies between the organisations, the staff numbers had already been decimated.</p><p>\"It's smoke and mirrors,\" he said.</p><p>\"What few fisheries officers who were left would then be expected to be running around the mountains chasing spotlighters.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://cdn.newsnow.io/9jp2tjuwKpcNcyMwTq82JY/d8ca25a2-4609-466f-bdb6-e10bb9a0f3c5.jpeg\">Recently retired Wodonga-based senior fisheries officer Greg Sharp says it's unfathomable that the Victorian Fisheries Authority (VFA) has stripped its officers of their duties to \"respond to an emergency\".

But, as the state's bushfire season wraps up and fire restrictions start to lift, the agency warns that unseasonably warm autumn weather over the Easter long weekend could increase the risk from campfires.</p><p>FFMVic chief officer Chris Hardman said his organisation has responded to almost 300 incidents involving campfires this season, including an illegal campfire that sparked the massive Grampians bushfire: \"When a fire is detected, (rappel firefighters) will fly up in a helicopter and they'll drop out \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 on ropes to the forest\".</p><p>Bryan Rees is FFMVic's senior aviation operations officer and has been involved in the program for its full 40 years. He said the rappel firefighters were \"quiet achievers\" .</p><p>\"There's no big noise about the fires that they work on because they do their job. They get them out and they go home .\" Rappel firefighters are some of the most experienced in the state, all starting as general firefighters before taking to the sky. FFMVic is ramping up to start recruitment of seasonal firefighters in July, ahead of the next fire season.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-6e4ad0b619c811f08414c7ef59306a17cb22252753892b3e01b95dbd741f5575</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERSUN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FKF-3V53-RWYV-91DG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-16</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"236\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>HeraldSun Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"04\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>April 17, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"60\"><className>Rotorcraft</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDI1Rjc4RTRCNEEyNEFEMjlCMTVGODg5OTg3NTZFQzE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkEyRTREQTdBRjkzNDE5OTk4ODAzMEY5MDkzRjlGRTE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DTIO</classCode><className>FIRE MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A3I2</classCode><className>EXTREME SPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000D1BY</classCode><className>EXECUTIVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DSFP</classCode><className>AVIATION INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
