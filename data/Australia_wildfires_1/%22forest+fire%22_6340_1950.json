nitf:lede=\"true\">A girl who wanted to bring a smile to people's faces by recreating a portrait of RFS Cobargo captain Mark Ayliffe has helped raise thousands of dollars at auction.</p><p>Ten-year-old Briella Perriotte from Campbelltown asked her mother for a copy of the photo taken by The Australian's Sean Davey during Prime Minister Scott Morrison's visit to Cobargo so she could paint a version of it herself.</p><p>She said she felt compelled to help in some way.</p><p>\"I wanted to give the people who saw it a bit of hope, even if it was just a smile for one second,\" Briella said.</p><p>\"I wanted them to feel happy again.\"</p><p>After spending a few days painting the portrait, Briella approached her mother, Connie Perriotte, with the final piece and asked if she could sell it.</p><p>\"She wanted me to try and sell it for her for $2 so she could donate that money to the firefighters,\" Ms Perriotte said.</p><p>Ms Perriotte decided to share the image on her Facebook account where her friends on social media suggested she auction the painting off instead.</p><p>'Hopefully it helps'</p><p>The painting was auctioned off last night and sold for $1,300 with the funds going to Cobargo's Fire Brigade.</p><p>Copies of the original have also been sold for a total of $680, with $130 of that going to the Cobargo Fire Brigade as well.</p><p>The remainder of the funds went to bushfire-related charities of the buyer's choice.</p><p>In total, nearly $2,000 was raised - a steep jump from an initial $2 selling price.</p><p>The young artist hoped the funds will help support firefighters.</p><p>\"I just hope it will make a bit of a difference, even if it's a small change,\" she said.</p><p>\"Like getting them new shoes or more masks.\"</p><p>The Perriottes had no previous connection to Cobargo, but they wanted to help the town after it was severely impacted by the Badja Forest fire.</p><p>\"It's been really overwhelming and amazing this past week,\" Ms Perriotte said.</p><p>\"Hopefully it helps make some kind of a difference and it helps the people of Cobargo and surrounding areas know that the outside world know and that they do care.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

Barwon South West public health unit director Eugene Athan said anyone who was not feeling well should stay home. </p><p>\"People gathering for New Year's Eve celebrations should follow CovidSafe principles when out and about, like hand hygiene, checking-in, keeping 1.5 metres from others when possible, and importantly, staying home if feeling unwell,\" Prof Athan said. </p><p>Police Minister Lisa Neville urged revellers to behave responsibly.</p><p>\"After another challenging year, many Victorians are looking forward to ringing in 2022 - and we want everyone to do it in a safe way, whether you're in the CBD, on holidays and camping trips in regional Victoria, or at home with family and friends,\" she said. </p><p>Geelong hots up for New Year's weekend</p><p>Geelong residents will endure sweltering conditions on the final day of 2021, with the mercury tipped to hit 37C.</p><p>The predicted temperature is set to rival the city's hottest day of 2021 back in January, when the gauge reached 37.1C.</p><p>Firefighters are warning people living in or travelling to regional areas to monitor fire conditions.</p><p>The mercury is expected to hit 35C on New Year's Day, before dropping to 27C on Sunday. </p><p>Victorians are urged to keep an eye on Fire Danger Ratings, which currently forecast very high ratings across much of the state throughout the long weekend.</p><p>The Bureau of Meteorology predicts severe heatwave conditions across the entire state from today until Saturday, with the heatwave conditions remaining in some areas until Monday.</p><p>CFA chief officer Jason Heffernan said with temperatures expected to reach high 30s in many areas, combined with hot and dry winds, Victorians had to be prepared for fire.</p><p>\"A wet winter and spring is now behind us, and December has been very dry in large parts of Victoria,\" he said.</p><p>\"On hot, dry and windy days like the ones we are expecting this weekend, anyone in regional areas of Victoria, and even on the metropolitan fringe, needs to stay alert to conditions, make sure they have downloaded the VicEmergency app and stay informed.</p><p>\"For anyone planning to travel this weekend, it's really important to make sure you know which fire weather district you will be in and travel through.</p><p>\"You also need to look at the Fire Danger Ratings daily and if the Fire Danger Rating is Severe, reconsider your need to travel. Don't travel to areas with an Extreme or Code Red Fire Danger Rating.\"</p><p>Acting Fire Rescue Commissioner Gavin Freeman said grassfires posed a particular risk this summer, after a wet spring resulted in significant grass and scrub growth.</p><p>\"Grassfires can move at speeds of up to 25km per hour and jump highways,\" Acting Commissioner Freeman said.</p><p>\"Avoid any fires along your planned route by setting up 'watch zones' in the VicEmergency app before you leave, to receive updates about any nearby incidents.\"</p><p>With many Victorians camping or visiting national parks this long weekend, Forest Fire Management Victoria chief fire officer Chris Hardiman also urged campers to be mindful of conditions and take care.</p><p>Unattended campfires should be reported to 136 186, bushfires should be reported to triple-0. On days of a Total Fire Ban, campfires are not allowed and should be reported to triple-0.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au\">www.coronavirus.vic.gov.au</url> for information on up-to-date information on how to stay COVIDSafe,\" he said.</p><p>\"Check the weather at your destination before you leave home and consider rescheduling your visit if it coincides with stormy weather or times of high fire danger, Mr English said.</p><p>\"Prepare for visitor limits and book before you leave home. When you arrive at your campsite, be aware of your surroundings and camp at least 20 metres from any stream, lake or reservoir.</p><p>FOR ALL YOUR BREAKING NEWS, CLICK HERE</p><p>\"Trees can drop limbs, or entire trees can fall, without warning so do not set up your tent or park your car under trees. Be careful when picnicking near or under trees also. Observe all warning signs and stay well away from trees that appear to be dead or have dead branches.</p><p>\"Make sure you keep 1.5 metres away from other campers and campfires, the length of a sedan car is a good way to mark the distance.</p><p>\"All native plants and animals are protected. Do not cut down or damage standing trees or vegetation and please don't feed wildlife.</p><p>\"Always let someone know before you go. You can visit the Victoria Police website for a trip intention form in case of an emergency.\"</p><p>Mr English said it was also important to take all fire precautions seriously, especially after last year's horror bushfire season.</p><p>\"Know the campfire safety rules before you head out and stick to them. In national and state parks, campfires and barbecues may only be lit in the designated fireplaces provided and you must bring your own firewood.</p><p>\"Campers in state forests must build a trench at least 30 centimetres deep around campfires and can collect fallen wood less than a metre in length for their use.</p><p>CHECK OUT LOCAL SPORTS NEWS HERE</p><p>\"All campfires must never be left unattended and need to be extinguished with water, not soil, as fires can still smoulder under soil. If a fire is cool to touch, it is safe to leave,\" he said.</p><p>\"It is illegal to light a campfire on a day of Total Fire Ban, when fires are likely to spread rapidly and be difficult for firefighters to control. Before lighting a campfire, campers must check if a Total Fire Ban is in place, via:</p><p>the VicEmergency website - <url normalizedValue=\"https://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond\">https://emergency.vic.gov.au/respond</url>/ the VicEmergency App the VicEmergency Hotline - 1800 226 226 Mr English also pleaded for campers to keep our national parks clean and pristine.</p><p>\"Keep our state forests and national parks as beautiful as you find them by not littering. There are usually no bins, so ensure you take your rubbish home - whatever you bring in to the forest, you must take out,\" he said.</p><p>Under the Forest Act 1958, on-the-spot fines of $496 can be issued to people breaching campfire safety rules.

nitf:lede=\"true\">A girl who wanted to bring a smile to people's faces by recreating a portrait of RFS Cobargo captain Mark Ayliffe has helped raise thousands of dollars at auction.</p><p>Ten-year-old Briella Perriotte from Campbelltown asked her mother for a copy of the photo taken by freelance photographer Sean Davey during Prime Minister Scott Morrison's visit to Cobargo so she could paint a version of it herself.</p><p>She said she felt compelled to help in some way.</p><p>\"I wanted to give the people who saw it a bit of hope, even if it was just a smile for one second,\" Briella said.</p><p>\"I wanted them to feel happy again.\"</p><p>After spending a few days painting the portrait, Briella approached her mother, Connie Perriotte, with the final piece and asked if she could sell it.</p><p>\"She wanted me to try and sell it for her for $2 so she could donate that money to the firefighters,\" Ms Perriotte said.</p><p>Ms Perriotte decided to share the image on her Facebook account where her friends on social media suggested she auction the painting off instead.</p><p>'Hopefully it helps'</p><p>The painting was auctioned off last night and sold for $1,300 with the funds going to Cobargo's Fire Brigade.</p><p>Copies of the original have also been sold for a total of $680, with $130 of that going to the Cobargo Fire Brigade as well.</p><p>The remainder of the funds went to bushfire-related charities of the buyer's choice.</p><p>In total, nearly $2,000 was raised - a steep jump from an initial $2 selling price.</p><p>The young artist hoped the funds will help support firefighters.</p><p>\"I just hope it will make a bit of a difference, even if it's a small change,\" she said.</p><p>\"Like getting them new shoes or more masks.\"</p><p>The Perriottes had no previous connection to Cobargo, but they wanted to help the town after it was severely impacted by the Badja Forest fire.</p><p>\"It's been really overwhelming and amazing this past week,\" Ms Perriotte said.</p><p>\"Hopefully it helps make some kind of a difference and it helps the people of Cobargo and surrounding areas know that the outside world know and that they do care.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

I hope those baby birds grew quickly enough to fly out of the area before fires wiped out the forests and the communities which wanted the fuel load in their local area to be -reduced.</p><p>The NYT also published another Damien Cave article headlined \"How Rupert Murdoch is influencing Australia's bushfire debate\". He quoted the usual whining green-left critics who claimed the \"Murdoch media\" (this newspaper is part of the News Group) was diverting attention from climate change.</p><p>Yesterday, The Australian newspaper, the flagship of News' papers, was still doing a better job at informing the public than the NYT or the ABC or the Nine media and commercial television. It had several news items on the current state of the battle to quell the blazes and on its Opinion pages it carried an article written by Lyndon Schneiders, a long-term environmentalist and former national director of the Wilderness Society.</p><p>It's a thoughtful piece. Read it.</p><p>I hold the Wilderness Society and other environmental groups responsible in large part for permitting the build-up of the extraordinary fuel loads in the national and state parks which, along with the prolonged drought, contributed to explosive force of this season's bushfires.</p><p>The newspaper's coverage also -included a really wide-ranging and carefully researched article by Claire Lehmann reprinted from Quillette, which should be compulsory reading for those interested in factual material on the science behind weather, climate and bushfire prevention.</p><p>My point, however, is that it is the much-maligned Murdoch media ritually slammed by green-left ecoactivists that is offering intelligent and diverse views on the nature of bushfires and not the NYT and its Fifth Column associates in the \"woke\" Australian media.</p><p>They want only to point to climate change as the sole cause. This was driven home by the rabid questioning of Prime Minister Scott Morrison over the recent days in Canberra and elsewhere.</p><p>On Friday, an AAP reporter pointedly asked: \"Prime Minister, do you expect fire emergencies of this magnitude to become more common in the future with climate change?\" A TV reporter then asked: \"Do you accept that community sentiment has changed and shifted somewhat on -climate change, that some that perhaps didn't want more action maybe do because of the bushfire season, and will you consider perhaps bringing back the National Energy Guarantee, something that you were a big supporter of, or something similar?\" Michael Rowland from the ABC's 7.30 show aggressively interrupted the PM on Thursday with assertions such as: \"Do you accept there's a need given the disproportionate impact these fires are having on Australia compared to other countries, there is a need for the government to do more in upping its emissions reductions target?\" Kim Landers of the ABC's AM program pushed the same line asking Mr Morrison: \"On climate change, who's telling you that the target of -reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 26 to 28 per cent by 2030 is still good enough?\" With the follow-up: \"Doesn't the scale of the disaster -require some sort of recalibration?\" As if altering the truly insignificant 1.3 per cent of carbon dioxide Australians contribute to the 3 per cent of carbon dioxide contributed by human beings to the .04 per cent of carbon -dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere would save a single twig.</p><p>Wildfire has been an important process affecting the Earth's surface and atmosphere for more than 350 million years and human societies have coexisted with fire since their emergence.</p><p>As was pointed out in a recent Royal Society paper: \"Many consider wildfire as an accelerating problem, with widely held perceptions both in the media and scientific papers of increasing fire occurrence, severity and resulting losses. However, important exceptions aside, the quantitative evidence available does not support these perceived overall trends. -Instead, global area burned appears to have overall declined over past decades, and there is increasing evidence there is less fire in the global landscape today than centuries ago.\"Less hysteria, more science - and we might get somewhere.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-163b5d02340711eaad3b1c0523e52cddcf86fb941ee46a76217e39bbf0c64965</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DAITEL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYN-KTF1-JD3N-52D7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"925\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Telegraph Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 12, 2020 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>CC000264I</classCode><className>FAIRFAX MEDIA LTD</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511120 PERIODICAL PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>NAICS511110 NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC8999 SERVICES, NEC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>SIC2721 PERIODICALS: PUBLISHING, OR PUBLISHING &amp;

It is the world's first portfolio-scale TCFD reporting tool covering counterparty company assets.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 XDI analyzed 1.8 millions assets associated with 1,800 listed companies in the US, Canada, Europe, Africa, the UK and Australia against climate risk hazards including flooding, coastal inundation, heat, drought and forest fire. XDI's data and analysis are the basis for the physical risk quantification in the new framework launched in London today.<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"XDI now offers the finance sector the most comprehensive climate risk assessment available in line with TCFD physical risk reporting,\" said XDI CEO Rohan Hamden. \"The new tool allows investors and potential buyers to carry out detailed analysis on companies and their assets independently.\"<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"The ability to assess a company's climate risk independently is a game-changer. A company can no longer hide risk and potential costs of impacts from extreme weather,\" Hamden said. \"Our new framework means that those who haven't assessed and reported climate risk are vulnerable in a market where detailed, counterparty assessment is now being carried out.\"<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 \"We at XDI hope the new framework will provide a more objective understanding of business climate risk and show that independent climate analysis -- not just self disclosure -- is now possible,\" Hamden said. \"Investors like L&amp;G can now undertake climate change risk analysis across a target company's assets anywhere globally.\"<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Background: XDI:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"http://xdi.systems\">http://xdi.systems</url>/ Legal &amp; General Investment Management:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.lgim.com\">https://www.lgim.com</url>/ Baringa Partners:       \u00a0    <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.baringa.com/en\">https://www.baringa.com/en</url>/<br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0 Contact: Rohan Hamden, CEO, XDI: +61 (0) 422 394 679, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:rohan@xdi.systems\">rohan@xdi.systems</email> Blair Palese, XDI Communications: +61(0) 414-659511, <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:blair@xdi.systems\">blair@xdi.systems</email><br/><br/>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0SOURCE: XDI<br/><br/><br/><br/>ASIANET<br/><br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MPRW-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MPRW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YDK-DF61-JC0X-K121-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">293804</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-03-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"437\"/><timeReceived>1:47 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Australian Associated Press Pty.

It revealed that he and partner Kayla are expecting their third daughter \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 The gender reveal evoked wild celebrations from Boyd and his teammates.</p><p>No senior staff were privy to the plan.

Minutes later, they were scrambling to put out a fire. Now they could be liable for the costs of putting out a blaze that raged across nearly 40 square kilometres.</p><p>Guardian headline, June 29: I started the \"gender reveal party\" trend. And I regret it.</p><p>Please explain: In 2008, while pregnant with her eldest child, Bianca, Jenna Karvunidis threw a party at which she announced the baby's sex by cutting into a cake filled with pink icing. She wrote about the event on her blog, and her post went viral. Soon \"gender-reveal parties\" became a massive trend, one that has come to involve increasingly extravagant choreographed \"reveals\" and sometimes even deadly stunts. One such party led to a 47,000-acre wildfire in Arizona; another involved explosives that killed a soon-to-be grandmother.</p><p>Karvunidis on Twitter, September 8: I'm getting a lot of hateful messages about the gender reveal party that set California on fire yesterday. Could we just stop having these stupid parties and then the problem would solve itself? Thanks.</p><p>Former Sharks captain Paul Gallen: They were woeful this year the Broncos, they really were. It's embarrassing for a club like that, the way they've ended up. The Darius Boyd gender reveal, I actually had - at the time, or even the next morning - no issue with it; \"What's everyone going on about?\" But the fact that the club didn't know, that was an error. That was a real error, whether it was by Darius or the playing group, whoever it was, to not allow the club and all the rest of the staff to know what was happening is a huge error.</p><p>And a \"unnamed Broncos legend\": What has become of this club? Having a gender reveal after winning the wooden spoon? This club has lost all sense of reality. They are a joke.</p><p>Pedestrian, again: This year's Broncos are officially the worst team in the club's 22-year history, so there'll probably be some big changes coming.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-992f0ada012311ebb3cb49e60e390d3919305a9983880b23bbf2a37bbecce736</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y7-J0R1-JD3N-51MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-09-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"535\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"29\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 29, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000126</classCode><className>ATHLETES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp; RECREATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001970</classCode><className>TRENDS &amp; EVENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009SE3</classCode><className>STADIUMS &amp; ARENAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001366</classCode><className>PREGNANCY &amp; CHILDBIRTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp; MESSAGE BOARDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009RD1</classCode><className>INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST0009REC</classCode><className>BLOGS &amp; MESSAGE BOARDS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX016</classCode><className>BRISBANE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>GS118</classCode><className>ARIZONA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

latest victim of the blazes in Victoria.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bill Slade, 60, was working on containing a fire in the Anglers Rest area near Omeo when he was killed by a falling tree.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"This is a significant loss for the Forest Fire Management Victoria family and for the Victorian community as a whole,\" Chris Hardman, chief fire officer at Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV), said.</p><p>Mr Slade worked for 40 years in firefighting and with Parks Victoria and he battled the Ash Wednesday bushfires in 1983.</p><p>He is survived by his wife Carol, daughter Steph and son Ethan.</p><p>Victoria Police will investigate the matter and prepare a report for the coroner.</p><p>\"Bill was a much-loved colleague, friend and member of the Wonthaggi community,\" Matthew Jackson, the chief executive of Parks Victoria, said.</p><p>\"He will be sorely missed by Parks Victoria, and our thoughts are with his family, wife Carol, children Ethan and Steph and colleagues and community during this deep tragedy.\"</p><p>Mr Jackson said Mr Slade was a field services officer at Parks Victoria who had mentored many of his colleagues.</p><p>\"At 60 years of age, working as an arduous firefighter, Bill has been one of our most experienced, long-serving and fittest firefighters,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Jackson said he had the \"privilege\" of honouring Mr Slade for his40 years in the field late last year.</p><p>Garry Cook, deputy chief officer at the CFA, said the news was going to be tough on a lot of people.</p><p>\"Everybody goes out to work and to protect lives and property and we want everybody to come home, and when somebody doesn't it's tragic news, it's very, very sad,\" he said.</p><p>\"We feel for the family, we feel for the colleagues, and we feel for everybody in the emergency services sector who are really feeling this tragic loss today.\"</p><p>Those sentiments were echoed by Victorian Premier Daniel Andrews, who sent his condolences to Mr Slade's family and his colleagues.</p><p>\"[He] was muchloved and he will be missed,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think this shows us this is still a very, very dangerous environment.\"</p><p>It takes the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2020-01-08/bushfires-death-toll-rises-in-victoria/11852752\">state's bushfire death toll to four,</url> including Mat Kavanagh, another FFMV employee who was killed in a road crash on Friday, January 3.</p><p>Mr Kavanagh was remembered for his \"friendly and welcoming nature, his passion for the environment and nature and his love of fly-fishing\".</p><p>Authorities said he was doing the \"incredibly critical work\" of putting out unattended fires on the day he died.</p><p>Buchan man Mick Roberts was the first victim of the bushfire emergency, while Maramingo Creek timber worker Fred Becker was confirmed dead last weekend.</p><p>Premier heads to fire grounds</p><p>Mr Andrews travelled to Orbost and met up with ADF crews working to clear trees from the Princes Highway around Bellbird Creek.</p><p>He announced a $14.4 million program to help every person affected by the fires to get the information and services they need to recover and start rebuilding their lives.</p><p>The money will be used to provide financial counselling, personal support and mental health assistance.</p><p>\"I don't want them [fire victims] to have to wade through endless paperwork,\" he said.</p><p>\"We need to make sure we are providing that dedicated support to make this difficult process as easy as it possibly can be.\"</p><p>Fire investigations</p><p>Mr Andrews also announced that the Inspector-General of Emergency Management, a body set up after Victoria's 2009 royal commission into bushfires, would be conducting an investigation into the fires still burning in Victoria's east and north-east.</p><p>Prime Minister <url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-12/bushfire-royal-commission-proposal-to-go-to-cabinet-morrison/11860954\">Scott Morrison is considering establishing a royal commission into the fires.</url></p><p>Mr Andrews said he discussed the idea with Mr Morrison and that he expected the royal commission would probably be more focused on a nationallycoordinated effort to fight fires.</p><p>Hundreds of homes have been destroyed during the crisis, and more than 1.3 million hectares of land has been burnt.</p><p>Milder conditions this week have granted a reprieve for firefighters and emergency authorities, but huge blazes continue to burn in East Gippsland, the Upper Murray area and the state's Alpine region.</p><p>The CFA's deputy chief officer, Stephanie Rotarangi, said the next three or four days will be crucial.</p><p>\"We are still seeing high levels of [fire] activity in the north-east and here in Gippsland. However, we'll be out there backburning and looking to consolidate those [containment] lines,\" she said.</p><p>Humanitarian packs a 'boost' for firefighters, evacuees</p><p>Charity group Operation Angel has travelled to the Tallangatta relief centre to hand out humanitarian packs to firefighters.</p><p>Organiser Jacqueline Pascarl said the firefighters were often mobilised at short notice.</p><p>\"They haven't got toothbrushes, deodorant, ladies don't have sanitary items, hair ties. So this is a boost. They're all really happy to receive them,\" she said.</p><p>The charity has assembled more than 10,000 packs in ziplock bags, each containing a personal message from a child expressing their gratitude for the work being done by firefighters.</p><p>\"It's been extraordinary. We've had hundreds of people every day turning up at our centre to donate or volunteer, car-loads full,\" Ms Pascarl said.</p><p>The packs also include donated cutlery.</p><p>\"We also have people bringing their metal cutlery to us from their chic dining rooms saying we have a dinner party once a year if we're lucky,\" Ms Pascarl said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCPNW-TOPNWS11860722</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCPNW2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XYK-F5K1-JBF5-T486-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300224</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"897\"/><timeReceived>10:55 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Premium News (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37478\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 11, 2020 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia:VIC:Omeo 3898</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Shepparton 3630</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Wodonga 3690</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Mildura 3500</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Horsham 3400</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Bendigo 3550</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Ballarat 3350</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Warrnambool 3280</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Sale 3850</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Australia/VIC/Melbourne 3000</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents:Fires:Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Death</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp;

It revealed that he and partner Kayla are expecting their third daughter ... The gender reveal evoked wild celebrations from Boyd and his teammates.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">No senior staff were privy to the plan. Hence why Morris said:</emphasis></p><p>I was embarrassed and disgusted by the gender reveal and celebrations post-match.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pedestrian, Saturday:</emphasis></p><p>While this was pretty tame as far as gender reveals go - it didn't spark a massive, deadly forest fire ... management at the club were not impressed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">ABC News headline, September 8:</emphasis></p><p>Gender reveal party sparks large Californian wildfire after pyrotechnic device ignites dry grass</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What happened?</emphasis></p><p>On Saturday morning an expectant couple trekked to El Ranch Dorado Park, a popular hiking spot in California, to document a stunt revealing the gender of their unborn baby. Minutes later, they were scrambling to put out a fire. Now they could be liable for the costs of putting out a blaze that raged across nearly 40 square kilometres.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\"/></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Guardian headline, June 29:</emphasis></p><p>I started the \"gender reveal party\" trend. And I regret it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Please explain:</emphasis></p><p>In 2008, while pregnant with her eldest child, Bianca, Jenna Karvunidis threw a party at which she announced the baby's sex by cutting into a cake filled with pink icing. She wrote about the event on her blog, and her post went viral. Soon \"gender-reveal parties\" became a massive trend, one that has come to involve increasingly extravagant choreographed \"reveals\" and sometimes even deadly stunts. One such party led to a 47,000-acre wildfire in Arizona; another involved explosives that killed a soon-to-be grandmother.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Karvunidis on Twitter, September 8:</emphasis></p><p>I'm getting a lot of hateful messages about the gender reveal party that set California on fire yesterday. Could we just stop having these stupid parties and then the problem would solve itself? Thanks.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Former Sharks captain Paul Gallen:</emphasis></p><p>They were woeful this year the Broncos, they really were. It's embarrassing for a club like that, the way they've ended up. The Darius Boyd gender reveal, I actually had - at the time, or even the next morning - no issue with it; \"What's everyone going on about?\" But the fact that the club didn't know, that was an error. That was a real error, whether it was by Darius or the playing group, whoever it was, to not allow the club and all the rest of the staff to know what was happening is a huge error.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">And a \"unnamed Broncos legend\":</emphasis></p><p>What has become of this club? Having a gender reveal after winning the wooden spoon? This club has lost all sense of reality. They are a joke.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pedestrian, again:</emphasis></p><p>This year's Broncos are officially the worst team in the club's 22-year history, so there'll probably be some big changes coming.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AUSTOL-1c4ad5b9b59241a9297e6bdb26fd2ee4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AUSTOL2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:60Y7-H0Y1-DY66-53PX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">472302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"519\"/><timeReceived>2:00 PM AEDT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian Online</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"464E\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>September 28, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>real error</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>United States of America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>stupid parties</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>North America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>gender reveal party</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>worst team</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Paul Gallen</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>gender reveal</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>popular hiking spot</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Karl Morris</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>massive trend</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>hateful messages</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Arizona</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>pyrotechnic device ignites</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Californian wildfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Darius Boyd</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>straight loss</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>California</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>ABC News Inc.</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>square kilometres</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>football field</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Wide World</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>reveal stunt</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Northern America</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>hide</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Cowboys</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>gender-reveal parties</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Kayla</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sports headline</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>device ignites dry</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>wooden spoon</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>eldest child</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

nitf:lede=\"true\">THE mountain above the Clarke family's bone dry cattle farm in the state's central west burned like a Roman candle on Christmas Day.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The flames threatened to deliver the coup de grace to a beef cattle family financially and spiritually wounded by three \"hellish\" three years battling the state's worst ever drought.</p><p>But helicopters, fireys in their trucks and backburning by farmers stopped the flames just as they charred some of his fencing and threatened far worse, and now widespread, soaking rain has spurred new growth in the paddocks and new hope in his heart.</p><p>Jono Clarke, 29, will spend this week turning a lush green rye grass crop into hay bales.</p><p>It will take six years to breed enough cattle to -replace the cows Mr Clarke sold during the drought, but the sight of green grass is all the motivation he needs to stage a comeback.</p><p>Most of the state is in the early stages of drought recovery and the climatic outlook is currently optimistic for July and August, according to the NSW Department of Primary Industries (DPI).</p><p>The drought could be over with widespread rainfall across NSW this winter. \"We're on our way out of drought,\" Mr Clarke said.</p><p>\"In the past year so many farmers have been so miserable because for a long time there was no end in sight, but to finally have rain is really encouraging.\" At the depths of the drought late last year, the Clarke's 1215ha property near Mudgee was in the path of the biggest forest fire to have started from a single ignition point in Australian history.</p><p>The fourth generation -cattle farmer sat stunned as reports filtered through of the Gospers Mountain fire jumping containment lines from the Wollemi National Park towards his farm and young family.</p><p>\"It was a mental month, the Gospers Mountain fire just kept jumping containment lines in a dramatic fashion and I though we were buggered,\" he said.</p><p>\"The fire on the mountain was blazing hot and the flames were sky high. \"Thankfully we kept it back with three helicopters, 11 RFS fire trucks and a few local farmers who back-burned.</p><p>\"A few months later and we're cutting hay.\" Despite promising signs for a profitable winter harvest in NSW this year, 90.8 per cent of the state is still in one of the three drought categories and widespread winter rainfall remains crucial.</p><p>Farms in the state's far west, southeast and parts of the Northern Tablelands are still gripped by intense drought, without any significant relief from the devastating drought.</p><p>\"While early drought recovery is under way in many regions, the situation remains complex and a 'watch and monitor' status is still -advised,\" a DPI spokesman said. \"May conditions continued recovery in many areas, however the possibility that this is a false recovery cannot be ruled out.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

nitf:lede=\"true\">BUREAUCRACY burnt up 85 per cent of Victoria's fuel load management budget in 2018-19, leaving just $18.2 million for on-ground work to curb the risk of fire in the lead-up to this summer.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria's 2018-19 annual report shows just 15 per cent of the $121.6 million spent on fuel management in 2018-19 went into on-the-ground burning or removing dangerous fuel loads across 130,000ha.</p><p>The remaining $103.4 million was spent on \"indirect\" costs, which FFMVic's report describes as covering \"business management, capability, engagement, equipment and infrastructure, operational planning, resource management, monitoring, plus evaluation and reporting\".</p><p>The fact that 85 per cent of fuel management spending went into policy, paperwork, preparation and indirect management in 2018-19 sits in stark contrast to previous years, when $40-$50 million was spent on fuel reduction burns.</p><p>Past FFMVic reports show that in: 2017-18 No report was available, with just 74,728ha treated. 2016-17 $40.4 million was spent on direct and $67.9 million on indirect fuel management (125,052ha treated).</p><p>2015-16 $44 million was spent in direct and $88.9 million was spent on indirect costs (197,940ha treated).</p><p>2014-15 $50 million was spent in direct and $63 million was spent on indirect costs (234,614ha treated).</p><p>One of Australia's leading former fire chiefs said the small spend on \"actually walking into the bush and striking a match\" showed the Government and its bureaucrats were \"tying themselves up in knots with endless planning, rather than getting on with the job.</p><p>\"It's time for bold action, rather than constantly undertaking community and media engagement, planning and biodiversity work,\" he said.</p><p>Opposition Emergency Services spokesman Brad Battin said with just 15 per cent of the hazard reduction budget going to protecting communities and 85 per cent in reporting and planning, it was no wonder fuel loads across Victoria were at extremely dangerous levels.</p><p>\"(Premier Daniel) Andrews' cuts to hazard reduction burns put Victoria at a higher risk of major fires this season.\" FFMVic Chief Fire Officer Chris Hardman said \"the fact is, it is harder and harder to find enough days for safe and effective planned burning\".</p><p>The revelation that so little was being spent in on-the-ground fuel reduction comes as Mr Andrews refuses to release maps showing the build-up of fuel loads, for fear they could be used by arsonists.The Premier's claim has been branded \"ludicrous\" and \"a load of rubbish\" by leading bushfire scientists.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

This marked the beginning of understanding of the nature of the mysterious ''nervous fluid''. It was only in the 20th century that the electrochemical nature of the nerve impulses was attributed to the electrical activity of billions of nerve cells.</p><p>Nerves behave as small circuits that follow the same physical rules of electric circuits that run our appliances. Cell membranes of nerve cells have evolved the ability to keep separate electrically charged atoms called ''ions''. Batteries (Volta invented them) also keep electric charges separate, preventing the movement of charges. Thus nerve cells, muscle cells and heart muscle cells are mini batteries. To keep these batteries charged, living cells utilise the energy that is generated from the burning of fuel (food) with oxygen (just like in a combustion engine). This energy keeps the batteries charged.</p><p>When resting, cells remain charged, but when the circuit is open, a rapid, small current flows across the membrane. This triggers similar events in the adjacent bit of the same nerve cell membrane and it becomes a nerve impulse that spreads like a forest fire along the filament (called nerve fibre or axon). It carries this signal a long way, say from brain to any muscle. Nerve impulses last a few thousandths of a second and can travel tens of meters per second. Billions of nerve cells work together, driving complex activity from controlling walking, remembering an episode in life, recognising a face, imagining music or mathematics, talking, listening, or having feelings. There is nothing in our mental activities that is not based on this incredible electrochemical machinery.</p><p>Million of nerve cells work in synchrony, with tiny electrical signals (less that one 10th of a volt). These can be detected in the brain using electroencephalography, electrocardiography in the heart muscle, and electromyography in other muscles.</p><p>A telling analogy is to imagine a situation in which all 7.7 billion humans were to chit-chat on their mobiles at the same time. This gigantic complexity would be much less than the connections of the 100 billion neuron that goes on in our brains! No wonder the mere possibility of reading the mind is still far away.</p><p>Before we knew about electrochemical phenomena it was thought that the mind was made of other stuff - thinking stuff that does not belong to this world. Now we know that mind and spiritual life are complex but natural electrochemical phenomena.</p><p>The Fuzzy Logic Science Show is 11am Sundays on 2xx 98.3FM.</p><p>Send your questions to <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:AskFuzzy@Zoho.com\">AskFuzzy@Zoho.com</email> Twitter @FuzzyLogicSci Podcast FuzzyLogicOn2xx.Podbean.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-doc7a3owisi7lcuzy1zgko</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YMW-7GB1-JD34-V0SN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-04-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"457\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty.

At a public meeting in Ocean Grove last month, Forest Fire Management Victoria said it intended to spend $30,000 to mulch a 40m strip on Grubb Rd to mitigate the fire risk.</p><p>But Ms McArthur questioned the effectiveness of mulching.</p><p>\"Having visited the site myself, clearly a machine is being used to smash some sticks on the ground, trample native grasses, smash logs and knock off tree branches,\" she- said.</p><p>\"It was a curious definition of mulch but was also -extremely problematic as it did not involve removing any of the 'mulched' or dead timber.</p><p>\"The supposed mulching clearly does nothing to reduce fire risk while damaging remnant vegetation.</p><p>\"How is a $30,000 expenditure on mulching going to save the lives of Ocean Grove residents in the event of a fire?\" Bushfire scientist David Packham, who received on OAM in 1991 for his service to bushfire management, said mulching was \"barely better\" than doing nothing.</p><p>\"Any fire on a catastrophic day that started, especially -towards the northern end of that reserve, would just totally overwhelm it and dump massive quantities of fires, very similar to what happened at Mallacoota,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Packham said he did not agree with Emergency Services Minister Lisa Neville, who stated the 5 per cent hazard reduction target each year was not achievable, and Victoria was burning smarter.</p><p>\"That is absolute nonsense because in WA we achieved very quickly around 15-20\"per cent,\" he said. \"They are right. They can't achieve it because they don't know what they're doing.\" Mr Packham said climate change was irrelevant to the fire problem Victoria faced.</p><p>\"I've done the calculations. I reckon the possible warming over the last 100 years of about 1C would make about 3 per cent difference to the intensity of the fire,\" he said.</p><p>A Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning spokesman said mulching was the most effective way to reduce risk in the reserve.\"Mulching reduces fuel, like grass and smaller logs on the ground, and means we have positions in the reserve from where to contain fires if they were to happen,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ECHOAU-154777804b8311eaadf6a0eb46625834a28e0028b7eba4a0bd5f52e68b31164a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ECHOAU2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y63-PRD1-F0JP-W15K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463781</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-11</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"405\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Echo (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Echo Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 12, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS8F</classCode><className>LAND CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001669</classCode><className>TALKS &amp; MEETINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>ST00097CH</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The -extent of devastation, the duration of devastation, it has been extraordinary,\" Dr Finkel said.</p><p>\"The link between climate change, a rising number of forest fire danger days and our season of bushfires is clear.\" Addressing the National Press Club in Canberra on Wednesday, Dr Finkel declared hydrogen could be Australia's \"hero\" fuel source to help confront the impacts of climate change and build an industry capable of creating thousands of jobs.</p><p>He warned the only way to meet the country's future energy needs without sacrificing standards of living or undermining the economy was an orderly transition to \"clean electricity\".</p><p>\"Let's assume that with solar, wind and natural gas, we will achieve a reliable, low-emissions electricity supply. Is this enough? Not really,\" Dr Finkel said. \"We still need a high-density source of transportable fuel for long-distance, heavy-duty trucks. We still need a means to carry clean -energy from one continent to another. Enter the hero: hydrogen.</p><p>\"By producing hydrogen from natural gas or coal, using carbon capture and permanent storage, we can add back two more lanes to our energy highway, ensuring we have four primary energy sources to meet the needs of the future - solar, wind, hydrogen from natural gas, and hydrogen from coal.</p><p>\"We have the potential to be one of the top three exporters of clean hydrogen, to create an exemplary safety track record, thousands of new Australian jobs, especially in regional areas, and billions of dollars in economic growth between now and 2050.\" Dr Finkel said he was \"technology neutral\" and refused to be drawn on the merits of subsidising new coal-fired power stations.</p><p>He said HELE coal stations generated 700kg of carbon emissions per megawatt hour of electricity produced, similar to the average emissions of the overall electricity network.\"To be a low-emissions contributor in the future, we need more than just that coal plant - ideally we'd have some kind of means for dealing with the carbon dioxide that is generated,\" Dr Finkel said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-438fb3c84d3611ea9640909e6d42cd1e8ae1f642ec0ab697844cebc39a371fa8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y68-PFT1-F0JP-W535-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-02-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"411\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><edition>Australian Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"02\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>February 13, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NATIONAL PRESS CLUB</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

Victorian forests and campgrounds last weekend.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning (DELWP) reported \"87 unattended or abandoned campfires\" throughout the state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The department's conservation regulator office said 32 fires were found in Gippsland, 28 in the Hume region, 19 in the Grampians and eight in the Barwon South West region.</p><p>Officers handed out 68 infringement notices, 50 verbal warnings and 19 official warnings over the past weekend for a range of offences, including unattended campfires and off-road driving.</p><p>A department spokesperson said that was a huge increase on previous weekends and coincided with new-found freedoms for Melburnians, as well as the continued freedom for regional Victorians following the lifting of coronavirus restrictions.</p><p>The spokesperson said authorised officers \"observed or [spoke] to\" more than 4,500 visitors in forests and campgrounds last weekend.</p><p>That figure was about 6,400 for the previous six weeks in total.</p><p>'It's just staggering'</p><p>Firefighters were furious after three unmonitored campfires escaped and began spreading in the Shepparton region last weekend.</p><p>\"They've lit this big fire in green grass and it's just totally surrounded by green grass and they've just left it going,\" Goulburn region Forest Fire Management duty officer Bruce Wehner said of one blaze.</p><p>\"It was always going to get away.</p><p>\"It's just staggering when you see it, that someone would do that.</p><p>\"This one ... was actually quite serious.</p><p>\"I think often these people that have left probably don't even know actually that they've created a wildfire.\"</p><p>Country Fire Authority Commander Peter Bell said \"about 12 to 15 campfires [were] left going after last weekend\" at Ulupna Island, on the Murray River near Cobram.</p><p>\"People are basically careless - they think they've put it out and they haven't put it out,\" Mr Bell said.</p><p>\"A fire like that around a parks area can escape and cause significant concern to volunteers and to everyone.</p><p>\"It's not good at all.\"</p><p>'Legally responsible'</p><p>Brian Hamer, DELWP's manager for the conservation regulator in the Grampians region, said things were only going to get worse.</p><p>\"This comes on the back of a total fire ban day that was declared in the Mallee on Sunday,\" he said.</p><p>\"So it's a timely reminder for the community that we are now in the summer period and in amongst that high fire danger period.</p><p>\"The more people that are in the state forests, the more risk there is for fire ignition points.</p><p>\"If you light a campfire, you are legally responsible for ensuring that it's safe, does not escape, and is completely extinguished before you leave.\"</p><p>DELWP's chief conservation officer Kate Gavens said the number of unattended campfires was a worry.</p><p>\"We know that 10 per cent of our bushfires are caused by bushfire negligence so it's really important that people follow the rules in relation to campfire safety,\" Ms Gavens said.</p><p>\"[Our officers] are certainly really concerned.</p><p>\"They know we've got a big summer ahead of us.\"</p><p>Victoria Police launched Operation Safeguard this week will focus on intentional and recklessly lit fires across the state.</p><p>On-the-spot fines of up to $496 can be issued to people who breach campfire safety rules.</p><p>Lighting a fire during a total fire ban can attract a $39,652 fine or two years in jail or both.</p><p>Recklessly or intentionally causing a bushfire can result in up to 15 years imprisonment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

It is ineffective to attempt to water bomb a large fire out.</p><p> \"The time to attack a fire is before it starts, with prevention and hazard treatments, and soon after while the fire is small in area, with aggressive, land-based attack.</p><p> \"Forest fires require a lot of work on the ground to remove fuels so that the fire is actually stopped from moving by a mineral earth break.</p><p> \"These are often enlarged using back-burns to remove fuel between the active fire edge and the constructed fuel break. Most people do not see this work on the ground take place.</p><p> Mr Gordon said a greater focus on year-round land management would ensure those equipped with the specialised skill set and resources to fight forest fires could mount timely and informed attacks on any new fire fronts.</p><p> \"The IFA/AFG are calling for an adequate network of fire access tracks and strategic fuel breaks to be maintained on Fraser Island to support safe burning operations and wildfire response and the establishment of an annual prescribed burn target,\" he said.</p><p> \"This burn target should be based on recommended fire regimes, cultural burning requirements and principles and should be somewhere in the vicinity of 15,000 hectares annually.</p><p> \"We also recommend an independent review of the effectiveness and efficiency of firefighting machinery and air fleet in comparison with fireline maintenance and wildfire mitigation activities.</p><p> \"In Queensland, the immediate priority for future management should be on other extreme risk localities around the state, where the next fire disaster is more likely. This includes adequate fireline network design and maintenance, widespread burning involving Traditional Owners where possible, and adopting traditional burning design methods.</p><p> \"This will require a commitment from all levels of Government to better fund and resource active forest management and fire management programs across the state, in accord with COAG's Bushfire Management Policy Statement for Forests and Rangelands.</p><p> \"Active management is integral to reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfire events, which is more important than ever as Australia faces hotter and drier conditions as a result of climate change.\"</p><p>Key recommendations from IFA/AFG's submission:</p><list><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>  An adequate network of fire access tracks and strategic fuel breaks should be maintained to support safe burning operations and wildfire response.</p></bodyText></listItem><listItem><label>\u2022</label><bodyText><p>  Sufficient management controls should be in place to manage backburn risks, and the policy of remote approval should be abandoned in favour of authority for backburn approval remaining with the local, competent and qualified Incident Controller.

Roads between Genoa and NSW, and Genoa and Mallacoota, were open only to local residents and authorised personnel.</p><p>A spokesman for the state's incident control centre said efforts to completely reopen the stretch of highway between Cann River and Genoa, near Mallacoota, had been hampered by recent storms which had caused \"significant tree and debris impacts\".

He goes way into the future and finds lovely, simple people who know nothing of technology. They do not read; they do not raise crops. Instead, they are fed by another group of humans who live underground. Later the scientist learns that the underground humans eat the folks who live on the surface.</p><p>The scientist destroys the underground compound, saves a woman he loves, and returns to the present. He tells people about his experiences, but no one believes him. Then he leaves the present to return to the future forever, to join the woman he saved. The scientist's housekeeper sees that he has taken three books with him, but she does not know which three.</p><p>The ending of the movie raises the question of what three books we would take with us to help form a good, sustainable civilisation. I do not know what books I would take. Maybe \"how to\" books. I thought about that question recently when I made a list of items I would take with me if bushfires burned me out of my home city, Armidale.</p><p>I have fleeing on my mind as a result of watching a documentary titled Fire in Paradise. It is about a forest fire that burned a city in California to the ground in no time at all. My list for fleeing includes passport, electronic tablet and charger, and precious documents such as immunisation records. Also on my list: water and medication.</p><p>When I mentioned my list on Facebook, one of my pals in another city told me to put shoes on the list. She said she has seen many people fleeing in thongs or barefoot. If I have to flee a bushfire, I also will take my high-quality air-purification mask - I aim to breathe while fleeing.</p><p>One more item on my list: I will take my car - because I am self-insured for damage to the car and because the car is as reliable as can be. Also, I like that car - I call her Silver Girl. Of course, I will take family members. And anyone who seems left behind. Until the car is full. That is my list for fleeing.</p><p>What would you pile in the car if you had 15 minutes before a fire came? Pets? What else?</p><p>John Malouff is an Associate Professor at the School of Psychology, University of New England.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ARENWS-doc790mb8g1s2f1jjuq1ev9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ARENWS2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y2N-TBR1-JD34-V4P1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">386164</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"366\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Fairfax Media Publications Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Area News</publicationName><edition>Print Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 27, 2020 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp; BROADCASTING &amp; WEB SEARCH PORTALS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>FB (NASDAQ)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Cinematic art</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Strange</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Author</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001299</classCode><className>PASSPORTS &amp; VISAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX002120</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009P1Y</classCode><className>SOCIAL SCIENCE EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"59\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp; OPINIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001299</classCode><className>PASSPORTS &amp; VISAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX002120</classCode><className>PSYCHOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp; UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

houses, sheds, a school, powerlines and water supply as well as the expanding development east of Springs Road, where many houses have been built since FFMVic last conducted a controlled burn in the area in 2008.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Typically FFMVic tries to conduct burns in forested areas every 10-15 years.</p><p>FFMVic's Springs road planned burn operation officer, Don Coutts, said the fuel reduction burn was a high priority as fuel loads were \"very high\" prior to the burn, with the main objective to reduce them to \"low to moderate\" to reduce the impact if a bushfire was to take hold and to make it easier for firefighters to control.</p><p>\"We're trying to burn the surface fuels along with the bark - we want to get 50 per cent of the bark burnt because that's what causes spotting when we get a wildfire and it also increases the intensity of the fire,\" he said.</p><p>Almost 50 FFMVic staff assisted with the fuel reduction burn - from Ballarat, Beaufort to Horsham, Cavendish and Edenhope - with support from CFA's Glen Park fire brigade.</p><p>The fire was ignited by hand, with a mixture of drop torches and matches.</p><p>\"We space the fires out about 25 metres apart so we get low-fire intensity and then hopefully those ignition points will join together during the next few hours,\" Mr Coutts said about 2pm.</p><p>Meanwhile, firefighters patrolled the area to ensure the fire did not escape and to keep an eye out for dangerous trees that looked likely to fall.</p><p>The burn was expected to finish around 8pm, though larger debris such as logs were expected to continue smouldering during coming days.</p><p>While the weather was perfect for burning on Thursday - a mild day with low winds and sun - a first attack dozer and large tanker were on scene to ensure a fast response if the fire did escape.</p><p>Crews patrolled the area overnight and will return to black it out and make the area safe on Friday, ahead of a cycling event this Sunday which will go through part of the area.</p><p>\"We'll make sure we treat any hazardous trees and anything else that can cause an incident on the day,\" Mr Coutts said.</p><p>With rain forecast on Saturday, any remaining smouldering should be eliminated though smoke may persist until early next week and people are asked to avoid the area.</p><p>The La Nina weather conditions, which have brought significant rainfall during the last few months, and a relatively quiet summer allowed FFMVic to begin its planned burning schedule weeks earlier than normal.</p><p>\"We had a relatively quiet summer this year and ideal conditions so we are making the most of it,\" Mr Coutts said.</p><p>\"The good conditions that we've got now are providing a really good window of opportunity to carry out a lot of our burns which have been hard to get to over the last few years because of the hot and dry weather and huge fires that we've had and sent resources to.\"</p><p>Larger scale burning is expected to increase in coming weeks.</p><p>Grampians Region Deputy Chief Fire Officer, Tony English, said it had been an excellent season for FFMVic so far.</p><p>\"We commenced burning in February and have now delivered several important burns at places like Daylesford, in the Wombat State Forest, Mount Lonarch, Macedon and the Brisbane Ranges National Park,\" he said.</p><p>\"We will continue burning if conditions allow in autumn in the Ballarat region.</p><p>\"In the Wimmera, we will also see a large program commence as the weather cools.</p><p>\"Late autumn and winter burning are a feature of our approach in places like the Grampians National Park.</p><p>\"Importantly, burning is supported by a growing program of removing fuel loads using mowing, slashing and mulching.</p><p>For example, we do extensive work to remove weeds such as gorse and broom in areas close to townships throughout the year.\"</p><p>Mr Coutts said FFMVic had communicated well with residents in the area and the community was supportive of the activity.</p><p>Stay informed about Planned Burning: ffm.vic.gov.au/plannedburn or call the VicEmergency Hotline on freecall 1800 226 226.

Crisp said he had attended the funeral which was a \"fitting tribute\" to a wonderful life.</p><p>\"Our thoughts and condolences go to David's widow, Judi, and family, given this tragic set of circumstances for someone who was working to keep our community safe,\" Mr Crisp said.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV) chief fire officer Chris Hardman described Mr Moresi as \"a pillar

Mat Kavanagh, 43, and Bill Slade, 60, were killed while on the job this bushfire season.</p><p>Mr Hardman said it had been \"a very difficult year\" for the organisation.</p><p>\"I think it's

So far at least 90 people have reportedly died as a consequence. Natural hazard expert, Ant\u00f3nio Bento-Gon\u00e7alves, provides insights into wildfires in Algeria and what must be done to manage them better.</emphasis></p><h>How often do wildfire incidents take place in Algeria and which areas are most affected?</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In recent years major fires, with devastating consequences, have occurred in various parts of the world. This year the Mediterranean region was affected by heatwaves between July and August which caused major fire incidents in several countries including Greece, Turkey, Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria. </p><p>I've carried out <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296939491_Forest_fires_in_Algeria_Occurrences_causes_and_prevention\">research on wildfires</url> in Algeria and looked into what causes them. </p><p>In Algeria, forests and scrubland occupy a total area of around 4 million hectares. This makes a huge part of the country susceptible to fire. For instance, between 1876 and 2005 (the longest complete data series) it's estimated that <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296939491_Forest_fires_in_Algeria_Occurrences_causes_and_prevention\">almost</url> 40,000 hectares burned each year, representing approximately 1% of all existing woodlands of the country. </p><p>Over a period of 25 years, from 1985 to 2010, Algeria recorded 42,555 fires that burned <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.openedition.org/mediterranee/6827\">a total area of</url> 910,640 hectares. </p><p>The municipalities (known as \"wilayas\") most affected are in the North - the most forested parts of the country - and in the West. These areas are more populated, hilly (with steep slopes) and a pronounced Mediterranean climate - a very dry and hot season in summer, but sufficiently wet in winter to allow for rapid vegetation growth.</p><h>What causes them?</h><p>Wild fires spread the fastest in places that are hard to reach and in the right conditions. Large parts of Algeria tick these boxes.  With very limited access and steep slopes, detection and effective first intervention by firefighters is very difficult. In addition there's usually very dry undergrowth and forests are composed of flammable species.</p><p>Added to this, Algeria's forested areas are subject to multiple human pressures which create conditions that are favourable to the spread of fires. These include the the use of fast-growing but more flammable forest species or the frequent use of fire for pasture regeneration. In addition, having long periods of hot and dry weather increase fire risk. </p><p>Forest fires in Algeria were <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/325258786_Wildfire_risk_and_its_perception_in_Kabylia_Algeria\">historically</url> caused by people. However, <url normalizedValue=\"https://journals.openedition.org/vertigo/15462\">recent official information</url> on the causes of fires is characterised by high rate of fires of \"unknown origin\", representing between 40% to 70% of all fires. Essentially, we know they'll be caused by people, but there's no specific data on what activity that caused them or motivations behind them.</p><p>Why do we not know? This is related to difficulties in monitoring by the <url normalizedValue=\"http://iii-med.forestweek.org/content/general-directorate-forestry-government-algeria\">General Directorate of Forests</url>. Between 1980 and 2000, when the causes of fires of unknown origin were higher, this was due to instability. Algeria had a civil war that lasted from 1991 to 2002 and prevented government agencies, including the Directorate of Forests, from working properly. This <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296939491_Forest_fires_in_Algeria_Occurrences_causes_and_prevention\">made it difficult</url> to have a good understanding of what caused the fires. </p><h>How are they managed and are there prevention measures in place?</h><p>Generally, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/296939491_Forest_fires_in_Algeria_Occurrences_causes_and_prevention\">policies put in place</url> to combat forest fires are organised around several points: information and education of the population, development and maintenance of rural and forest areas, surveillance of wooded areas, and improvement of the means of fire fighting. </p><p>However, not knowing exactly what type of human activity causes the fires limits what can be done to prevent them. Instead, policies tend to be more reactionary - they focus on dealing with fires when they break out. </p><p>In recent years, public authorities <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.uc.pt/fluc/nicif/riscos/Documentacao/Territorium/T24_Artg/T24_Artg13.pdf\">strengthened</url> the resources of the General Directorate of Forests for the prevention and fight against forest fires. In particular, by acquiring first intervention equipment, such as forest fire trucks, preparing more aircraft for firefighting, and a radio network for rapid communication in the event of fire outbreak. </p><p>In addition, more collaborative work is <url normalizedValue=\"https://publications.jrc.ec.europa.eu/repository/handle/JRC122115\">being done</url> in the region to improve intervention and surveillance. </p><h>What else can be done to better prepare and manage wildfires in Algeria?</h><p>Policies to prevent and protect against forest fires have been implemented gradually since the 1980s, but the country faces many challenges in effectively rolling them out. </p><p>Algeria is a huge country - with a size <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1207844/largest-countries-in-africa-by-area/\">exceeding</url> 2.38 million km2, it's the biggest country in Africa. With a massive territory to manage, all actions - to prevent, to detect and to fire fight - aren't enough. Operations are <url normalizedValue=\"https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5909104\">also very complex</url> due to the very uneven, hard to access, terrain.</p><p>There's also a high population density around and inside the forest massifs. This means its hard to control the actions that people take which are a fire hazard.</p><p>Added to this, forestry officials lack authority and resources to perform their duties. </p><p>To effectively combat fires, there must be political, social and economic stability in the country. And the causes of the fires must be clearly known. Without this, it's impossible to win the battle against forest fires. </p><p>There is, however, hope. New technologies, such as Remote Sensing and Geographic Information Systems, could improve data acquisition and thus the prevention of fires. </p><p>Other actions that must be taken include; the strengthening of education and awareness-raising and improvements in the equipment used to monitor, detect and fight forest fires. </p><p>Finally, policymakers must focus on strengthening cooperation and mutual assistance between all the Mediterranean countries. Fire knows no borders and no single country is capable of having all the necessary resources.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ant\u00f3nio Bento-Gon\u00e7alves does not work for, consult, own shares in or receive funding from any company or organisation that would benefit from this article, and has disclosed no relevant affiliations beyond their academic appointment.</emphasis></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CONAFR-166944</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CONAFR2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63H6-N941-JB75-94KX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">463585</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"983\"/><timeReceived>2:42 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 The Conversation Media Group Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Conversation - Africa</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7045\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 1, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001922</classCode><className>ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>GC345</classCode><className>ALGERIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC360</classCode><className>MOROCCO</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC328</classCode><className>TURKEY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GC319</classCode><className>GREECE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

who died while working to create containment lines in East Gippsland.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">David Moresi, 69, was a contractor working at the Gelantipy fire when he <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.abc.net.au/news/2019-12-02/firefighter-dies-in-east-gippsland-when-vehicle-rolls/11755358\">died as a result of a vehicle rollover on November 30 last year</url>.</p><p>Mr Moresi was working with colleagues using bulldozers to create containment lines for the W Tree section of the fire.</p><p>He was flung from his vehicle during a rollover at the end of a shift.</p><p>He died at the scene.</p><p>Authorities confirmed today his death would be added to the official fires death toll, which now sits at five.</p><p>Emergency Management Commissioner Andrew Crisp said he had attended the funeral which was a \"fitting tribute\" to a wonderful life.</p><p>\"Our thoughts and condolences go to David's widow, Judi, and family, given this tragic set of circumstances for someone who was working to keep our community safe,\" Mr Crisp said.</p><p>Forest Fire Management Victoria (FFMV) chief fire officer Chris Hardman described Mr Moresi as \"a pillar of the community\" and a \"dedicated educator\".</p><p>\"He loved the bush, he inspired so many people to be in the great outdoors.\"</p><p>Mr Hardman said Mr Moresi was an \"inspirational human being\" who had supported the building of schools overseas, including in Thailand.</p><p>Mr Moresi is survived by his wife Judi and children Kelly, Luke and Nathan.</p><p>Mr Hardman said Mr Moresi taught his \"many grandchildren\" to shoot, hunt and fish and was building the \"bushmen of the future\".</p><p>\"We do have a debt that the community can never repay,\" he said.</p><p>FFMV employees Mat Kavanagh, 43, and Bill Slade, 60, were killed while on the job this bushfire season.</p><p>Mr Hardman said it had been \"a very difficult year\" for the organisation.</p><p>\"I think it's important just to reflect on the significance and the contribution and the sacrifice paid by these people to help protect our community,\" he said.</p><p>Buchan man Mick Roberts and Maramingo Creek man Fred Becker also died during the fires.</p><p>The bushfire crisis raging across the state has destroyed nearly 300 homes and continues to threaten lives and properties.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"/news/2020-01-15/melbourne-air-quality-could-return-to-hazardous-bushfire-smoke/11867796\">Smoke from the fires has blanketed much of the state</url>, prompting health warnings as the air quality dropped.</p><p>Authorities have used milder conditions this week make inroads on containing the huge blazes in East Gippsland and the north-east, but there are concerns storms could create hazards for crews on the firegrounds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier
