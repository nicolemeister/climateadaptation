The sky still appears moody after a stormy day. A</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">stately, silvery shape, the 240-tonne Hindenburg airship glides 60m</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">above New Jersey about 7.21pm. In a six-knot wind, the zeppelin is</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">attempting its first \"high landing\". The crew throws the spider</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">lines out, preparing for mooring. The gigantic ship nearly three</p><p>football fields in length would slowly be winched down . . .</p><p>IF you think you know exactly what happens next, Addison Bain has a</p><p>surprise for you.</p><p>Six decades after the infamous Hindenburg disaster, when 36 of 97</p><p>aboard died in the horrific blaze that halted rigid-airship travel,</p><p>Bain has revealed a stunning new explanation for what started the</p><p>fire.</p><p>Bain, a recently retired engineer and manager of hydrogen programs who</p><p>spent more than 30 years at NASA, recently ended several years of</p><p>scientific sleuthing work for the reason behind the disaster.</p><p>He combed thousands of pages of original testimony and materials at</p><p>four archives in the United States and one in Germany, he interviewed</p><p>survivors and airship experts and, ultimately, tested original</p><p>materials from the model LZ-129 Hindenburg and its contempories.</p><p>Contrary to what investigators ruled at the time, asserts Bain, the</p><p>fire did not start with free hydrogen lit by natural electrical</p><p>discharge or sabotage.</p><p>The hunt for the truth about Hindenburg began in the late 1960s for</p><p>Bain, who was working on a hydrogen safety manual for NASA. Bain</p><p>recalls how he read the literature on hydrogen.</p><p>\"Invariably,\" he says, \"the topic of Hindenburg would come up. At</p><p>the time, I didn't think a lot about it.\"</p><p>Over the years, however, as he continued his NASA work on hydrogen</p><p>systems, the references began to accumulate in his mind.</p><p>\"What I was starting to notice was that the authors were</p><p>inconsistent,\" he says. Hydrogen detractors said the gas was so</p><p>flammable it killed everyone on Hindenburg, which was not true: about</p><p>one-third of those aboard died.</p><p>\"On the other hand, hydrogen promoters rubbished safety concerns and</p><p>claimed that those who perished did so only because they jumped from</p><p>the burning airship, which also was not true.</p><p>\"I thought, 'wait a minute! Where are they getting their</p><p>information'?\"</p><p>Bain had also seen the famous photos of Hindenburg's bright,</p><p>blistering, hot fire and knew that hydrogen did not burn that way.</p><p>A hydrogen fire radiates little heat and is barely visible to the</p><p>unaided eye.</p><p>As a hydrogen expert, he knew that the pure gas does not explode. That</p><p>was enough. He donned a pair of protective gloves, and lost himself in</p><p>decades-old original documents in Washington's National Air and Space</p><p>Museum.</p><p>His research soon became something of a obsession.</p><p>He speculated that, perhaps, some of the airship's materials had</p><p>played a role in ignition. But, maddeningly, he could not find the</p><p>exact formulations used.</p><p>\"I had the idea of the problem, but needed enough evidence to back up</p><p>my story,\" Bain says.</p><p>That was as far as he went, until 1994, when he ran into Space Shuttle</p><p>technician Richard van Treuren, at a conference on hydrogen. Van</p><p>Treuren was a self-avowed \"helium head\" and member of the airship</p><p>aficionados' group called the Lighter-Than-Air Society, in Akron,</p><p>Ohio.</p><p>Through van Treuren, Bain learnt that pieces of Hindenburg's skin</p><p>still existed. Bain went throughout the US to procure them, also</p><p>spending hundreds of dollars buying original materials, books and</p><p>papers.</p><p>\"What I was trying to find out,\" he says, \"was what did they use</p><p>specifically in the coating?\"</p><p>Hepburn Walker, who had been stationed at Lakehurst in the early</p><p>1940s, was among those with pieces of Hindenburg. Walker had found</p><p>them in the soil. Another sample, a part of the swastika painted on</p><p>Hindenburg's side, was kept in a safe by Cheryl Gantz, head of the</p><p>Zeppelin Collectors Club in Chicago.</p><p>Materials in hand, Bain headed to NASA's Materials Science Laboratory</p><p>at nearby Kennedy Space Centre. Over the next 14 months, he carefully</p><p>laid out a systematic testing protocol involving about 14 researchers</p><p>who volunteered their spare time to assist in what became known as</p><p>Project H.</p><p>What was in that fabric? An infra-red spectograph and a scanning</p><p>electron microscope provided, respectively, the chemical signatures of</p><p>the organic compounds and elements present.</p><p>A startling variety of highly flammable compounds proved to have been</p><p>added to the cotton fabric base.</p><p>\"They used a cellulose acetate of nitrate as a typical doping</p><p>compound, which is flammable to begin with a forest fire is a</p><p>cellulose fire,\" says Bain.</p><p>\"OK, you coat that with cellulose nitrate nitrate is used to make</p><p>gunpowder.</p><p>\"And then you put (on) aluminium powder. Now, aluminium powder is a</p><p>fuel used in the solid rocket boosters on the Space Shuttle.\"</p><p>The wood spacers and fibrous ramie cord used to bind the structure</p><p>together, along with the silk and other fabrics in the ship, also</p><p>would have added to the fuel-rich inferno. Even the duralumin support</p><p>framework of Hindenburg's rigid skeleton was coated with lacquer,</p><p>ostensibly to protect it from moisture.</p><p>In a flame test, a fabric section ignited and burnt readily. The arc</p><p>test, in which 30,000 volts were zapped across a piece of fabric</p><p>several centimetres along, was even more revealing.</p><p>\"Poof, it disappeared. The whole thing happened faster than I can</p><p>explain it,\" Bain says. \"I guess the moral of the story is, don't</p><p>paint your airship with rocket fuel.\"</p><p>However, Bain is quick to point out it is not that the Germans and</p><p>other airship and aircraft makers of the era were simply foolish in</p><p>doping the fabric the way they did. They had a number of technical</p><p>problems to solve using the materials of the time.</p><p>The cotton or linen fabric skin was swabbed with the chemicals to make</p><p>it taut and reduce flutter for aerodynamics, and then painted with the</p><p>reflective red iron oxide and aluminium so the sun's heat would not</p><p>expand the gas in the cells, to help prevent gas escaping.</p><p>\"I'm not saying hydrogen didn't contribute to the fire,\" adds Bain.</p><p>It is, after all, a fuel, he notes and one he is hoping will develop</p><p>into a replacement or supplement to natural gas.</p><p>\"But it was a fuel-rich fire already, the hydrogen just added to</p><p>it.\"</p><p>Decades of speculation about the causes behind the start of the</p><p>zeppelin fire are academic, he says. All have blamed hydrogen, with</p><p>various ideas about how the gas became free and ignited.</p><p>One popular theory has it that a wire punctured a gas cell. Bain finds</p><p>this doubtful.</p><p>\"If that happened, it should have occurred during one of the final</p><p>manoeuvres.\" But, he says, the ship was stationary for four minutes</p><p>before fire was evident.</p><p>What about the possibility of loose hydrogen from the vents? Hydrogen</p><p>was released to help maintain level flight, and others have theorised</p><p>that a valve may have stuck open.</p><p>Bain says Hindenburg had an excellent venting system, with vents</p><p>between cells that measured about 60cm high and 200cm wide.</p><p>If hydrogen accumulated difficult to imagine for the lightest</p><p>element, which has the greatest dispersal rate in the universe why,</p><p>he asks, were none of the fires observed at the vent sites on top of</p><p>the ship?</p><p>What is perhaps most stunning about Bain's research is that what he</p><p>has discovered comes 60 years after some German airship experts</p><p>already knew it. While visiting an archive in Germany, he copied two</p><p>1937 letters, handwritten in German, that had not been seen by earlier</p><p>investigators.</p><p>Their contents were revealed to Bain only after he returned to Florida</p><p>and had them translated. They were written by an electrical engineer</p><p>named Otto Beyerstock, who had incinerated pieces of Hindenburg fabric</p><p>during electrical tests conducted at the behest of the Zeppelin</p><p>company.</p><p>In the notes, Beyerstock testily dismissed the idea that hydrogen</p><p>could have started the fire, stating that it could only have been</p><p>caused by the fabric's flammability in a charged atmosphere.</p><p>\"I beg you to kindly inform me about the corrective measures to be</p><p>taken or that have already been taken,\" Beyerstock wrote to Zeppelin.</p><p>\"They knew,\" Bain says simply.</p><p>But soon after the Hindenburg disaster, and probably because of it,</p><p>the great zeppelins were removed from service.</p><p>None of what Bain has learnt has diminished his admiration for the</p><p>engineering achievement in creating the great airships.</p><p>\"With all due respect,\" he says, \"the Germans did a fantastic job.</p><p>\"I admire their technology.</p><p>\"It was just an unfortunate little flaw, just like the flaw on</p><p>Titanic and the flaw in Challenger,\" he says, referring to the</p><p>\"unsinkable\" ship's sulphurous, brittle steel and the Space</p><p>Shuttle's O-ring both of which failed under prevailing weather</p><p>conditions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV9801241044305916</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEADVERTISERLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4597-JG90-0197-D34P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1414\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Advertiser</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"01\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>January 24, 1998, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002021</classCode><className>SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001963</classCode><className>SAFETY, ACCIDENTS &amp; DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DP5A</classCode><className>PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DROP</classCode><className>PROTECTIVE CLOTHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST000DN68</classCode><className>SPACE PROGRAMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N712110MM</classCode><className>MUSEUMS &amp; GALLERIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DROP</classCode><className>PROTECTIVE CLOTHING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Up to 99 per cent of NSW bushland has not been burnt for decades. That means there is plenty of fuel, made all the more dangerous by the El Nino effect and recent sweltering temperatures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Most of the State's 70,000 fire-fighters are readying for the worst, with the Commissioner of the NSW Rural Fire Service, Mr Phil Koperberg, warning: \"We must be prepared and vigilant.\"</p><p>On a sobering note, the commissioner said it was not a question of whether we'll have fires; we always have fires. Nor was it a question of how many, although a great number of fires would spread resources and tire out fire crews.</p><p>\"It's not about the size of individual fires, either, though this increases the work load upon firefighters,\" he said.</p><p>\"Principally, it's about how intense the fires will be.</p><p>\"High temperatures, low humidity and high fuel levels produce high-intensity fires. If strong winds drive these intense fires, then the potential for people and their property to be threatened also intensifies.\"</p><p>Mr Koperberg was keen to remind people that the disastrous fires of January 1994 ravaged just 1 per cent of the NSW land mass. \"People forget that much of NSW has not been subject to high-intensity fires for many, many years.\"</p><p>Although it's too early to predict the likely seasonal outcome, dangerous weather conditions and high fuel levels mean that, for 99 per cent of the State, only a spark is required to deliver fires of high intensity.</p><p>Most firefighters spoken to by The Northern Herald are fearful of a torrid time ahead, but hopefully not as disastrous as the 16 days of January 1994 when the State was ablaze with 800 fires across 800,000 hectares, many deliberately lit.</p><p>Black January resulted in the loss of 208 houses, the deaths of two fire-fighters and one resident directly. A fourth death was indirectly attributable to the fires. In many eyes, we were lucky. It could have been much worse. The USA National Fire Protection Association was predicting a loss of 2,000 NSW homes via its computer modelling.</p><p>We've In the event, the Deputy State Coroner, Mr John Hyatt, conducted an exhaustive inquiry into the bushfires. After 12 months of hearings, he recommended the establishment of a Rural Fire Service (formerly the NSW Department of Bush Fire Services) with a single chain of command and a standard set of operational procedures.</p><p>The new service was delivered with the proclamation of the Rural Fires Act 1997 on August 31. In summary, the act established the Rural Fire Service and defined its functions. It also set universal standards for safety, training, equipment and procedures across the service.</p><p>The act established the responsibilities and accountabilities attached to everyone in the service from the commissioner down, while defining the role of local councils in the service's management. It ensured that all involved in the delivery of fire protection were shielded from legal liability for any task executed in good faith.</p><p>Mr Koperberg has hailed what he terms \"the new era of fire-fighting in NSW,\" claiming it will guide the service through the next century.</p><p>Meanwhile, a crucial factor in the future management of high-intensity summer bushfires in NSW and elsewhere - understanding just how fires behave - has become the subject of an innovative, six-year study in Western Australia.</p><p>Project Vesta involves the expertise of the CSIRO and Western Australia's Department of Land Conservation and Land Management (CALM), and has the backing of the Australasian Fire Authorities Council. The project will also involve scientists from Canada, NSW, South Australia and Victoria.</p><p>Vesta aims to build on existing knowledge offire behaviour to develop a standard system topredict accurately the spread and intensity of bushfires. Knowledge gained from the study willhelp determine the hazards in different types offuel and enable more accurate mapping of the threat of wildfires to towns and environment.</p><p>The CSIRO's head of Forestry and Forest Products, Dr Glen Kile, said that during the devastating 1994 NSW bushfires the blazes spread much faster that predicted by the standard McArthur Forest Fire Danger Metre, widely used in south-eastern Australia</p><p>to predict fire behaviour via fuel, topographical and weather indicators (particularly wind strength).</p><p>\"The more accurately wildfire behaviour can be predicted, the more effective fire-control measures can be,\" he said.</p><p>Experimental four-hectare plots in various locations will be scientifically torched to measure how the fires' rates of spread are influenced by wind speed and the amount and type of fuel. Some of these sites have not been burnt for two decades and have a massive build-up of leaves and dry twigs - the flash fuels for wildfires.</p><p>Detailed measurements of the structure, arrangement and distribution of the various fuel components in the plots have been analysed and recorded by a team of scientists during the past 19 months. Their analyses indicate that a practical system to identify fuel structures can be developed for dry eucalypt forests and woodlands throughout Australia, with likely application overseas.</p><p>Back in the Crossland Road fire-tower, at Galston, brigade Captain Bill Lea, 41, a decorated former professional firefighter, and his small team of volunteers stand guard to protect a large slab of Sydney from bushfires.</p><p>As smoke billowed from the foot of the Blue Mountains the other day, Captain Lea, Ken Turnidge and Mary Laws - all volunteers - spotted it first from 20 metres above the treetops, raising the alert.</p><p>\"We've caught quite a few fires. Even in 1994 when one memorable big blaze blew up at Arcadia and set off towards Hornsby, we were able to get crews on the road before it was reported fromelsewhere,\" Captain Lea said.</p><p>This month, the unique tower celebrates its 20th anniversary as an invaluable fire-fighting centre. THE former NSW Electricity Commission left it for the Galston brigade when local power lines were rerouted. The volunteers built a three-metre by three-metre watch-house on top, with a map table in the centre. A telescopic rifle sight is used to pinpoint distant smoke. Weather-reading instruments and radios linked to the fire-control network are solar powered.</p><p>From the tower top, the 360-degree view takes in the lower mountains, the Central Coast and most of Sydney's North Shore.</p><p>\"It's the only one in the northern part of Sydney,\" Captain Lea said. \"There was a tower at Berowra, but it rusted out and another old one at Terry Hills is no longer manned.\"</p><p>The watchtower is only staffed on days of total fire bans, critical periods when fires can spread quickly. There have been amusing moments in such times of tension, such as a year or so ago when the tower volunteers started calling smoke sightings but the smoke kept moving on, quickly.</p><p>\"It took us a little while to realise it was the 3801 steam train moving up the northern line to Hornsby,\" Captain Lea laughed. \"It gives us the horrors.\"</p><p>While the advantage of fire-towers is their ability to sight smoke long before the hundreds of calls from the public begin rolling in, the problem at Galston is that the crews can't get a second sighting to triangulate the co-ordinates, or pin down the exact distance to fires.</p><p>\"We can get a rough bearing, but not get the distance, so we need a second tower in the Hills up around Berowra. We're hoping Hornsby Shire Council will do it, but we've got to find a proper site. Transfield has already offered us a good deal on a tower.\"</p><p>There is another problem. Understandably, many volunteers refuse to climb the tower's dizzying heights.</p><p>\"They start climbing, then chicken out. From then on, they only fight fires from the ground,\" Captain Lea said. MR Turnidge, a nurseryman, was stuck in the tower one afternoon for many hours during a fierce electrical storm after a southerly struck. He sheltered as lightning bolts crashed all around, the fearsome wind bringing down trees everywhere. He was not deterred.</p><p>The Galston Brigade has 12 volunteers, but needs 20 more to fully staff the watchtower. The attrition rate, thanks to everyday jobs pressure, is high, at about 30 per cent a year. So plenty of new recruits are always required.</p><p>Potential volunteers can ring Bill Lea during office hours on 9651-4600.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>TWO ILLUS Smoke detector . . .

The place to be is up on those hills there,\" says McBain, motioning across the river to the western edge of the Rockies. \"The view from up there would be spectacular.\"</p><p>Anyone overhearing this conversation about the aesthetics of fire could be excused for mistaking these men as pyromaniacs.</p><p>Yet, they are among the world's most accomplished fire-fighting strategists, out on a reconnaissance mission at the end of another long day battling America's worst bushfires in more than a century.</p><p>Fire is their obsession. They live it, and try not to breathe it. They respect it, sometimes even marvel at its ferocious beauty.</p><p>But their objective is to control it. \"The fire's just doing what a fire's meant to do,\" says Strand, his gaze remaining glued to the smoke rising from the mountains in this stunning corner of north-western Montana.</p><p>\"We've got to try to corral it up into the wilderness where it won't threaten any homes, and let it burn there for a few weeks until the snows come.\"</p><p>Strand is a fire behaviour analyst from neighbouring Washington State. His job is to study the new fires and report back to the central command on what they are likely to do over the ensuing days.</p><p>McBain, the fire management officer for the Hunter Region, is one of 82 Australians who have been flown in by the US Government to help co-ordinate the effort against the line of fires that has scorched the American West for the past four months.</p><p>Behind the wheel of the car is Paul de Mar, the fire prevention manager for NSW State Forests and team leader of the Australian and New Zealand contingents in this multi-national firefighting force.</p><p>\"I guess `firefighting' is not quite the term for what we are doing,\" de Mar says as he turns the car back down the smoke-filled valley towards the central camp.</p><p>\"It is more `fire management'. You can't hope to put them all out. There are too many of them and they're too big.\"</p><p>There are many lessons to be learnt from the American experience, de Mar says, some good, some not so good.</p><p>There has been very little \"controlled burning\" in American forests over the past 10 years while foresters, environmentalists, loggers and governments have debated the pros and cons of the practice. That has allowed forest \"fuels\" pine needles, branches and undergrowth to build up to unnatural levels, just waiting for a dry season like this to explode into flames.</p><p>\"It's part of our European heritage that we think all fire is bad and has to be put out straight away,\" de Mar says. \"But the Aborigines and the American Indians know that forests need fires to keep fuels down and maintain their ecosystems. Believe it or not, fires can be good.\"</p><p>There have been more than 2,000 fires in this part of Montana since mid-July. Few have been good.</p><p>The total across the US this year is fast approaching 70,000, a staggering figure that has stretched even this country's massive firefighting resources to breaking point. More than 2.2 million hectares of land has been destroyed in six States, with Montana and neighbouring northern Idaho and Wyoming hit worst.</p><p>There is no official cost of damage yet, but the firefighting bill alone is believed to be about $US500 million ($873 million) and growing at a rate of $US16 million a day.</p><p>Eleven firefighters have died, dozens of houses have been lost and an area larger than the State of Massachusetts destroyed.</p><p>More than 25,000 firefighters are in the field, including two army battalions and another three on the way, protecting dozens of communities threatened by the flames.</p><p>The Australians and 11 New Zealanders have been brought in to lend much-needed management-level assistance.</p><p>They are being spread across Montana and Idaho, sleeping in tents in mountain camps similar to the one outside the village of Troy, where de Mar, McBain and Strand are headed.</p><p>The trio arrive back in time for the nightly planning meeting to discuss strategies for the following day's efforts.</p><p>The area they are covering is mostly national forest and wilderness, home to a host of wildlife from grizzly bears and cougars to caribou and deer.</p><p>Karel Zebjrlik has been managing a team of 40 firefighters working the flank of a blaze that has been threatening to crawl down the mountain towards a small farming community. \"It's pretty hilly where I come from,\" says Zebjrlik, an operations forester from Wauchope.</p><p>\"But I've never seen anything like this. These hills go straight up. It just kills you going up and down them all the time.\"</p><p>Dean Anderson, the State Forests regional manager at Bathurst, says he finally got to speak with his wife on the phone. The camp is four hours' drive from the nearest city, Missoula. There are no mobile phone towers in sight and the few land lines are unreliable.</p><p>\"They made an announcement at my five-year-old's school during assembly the other day that his dad was over in America fighting the big fires,\" Anderson tells his mates.</p><p>\"The poor little bloke just burst into tears. He's seen the footage on TV of trees exploding in great bursts of flames and thinks I'm standing underneath them. He thinks I'm going to die.\"</p><p>The firefighters were pleased to find that the American system has a heavy emphasis on safety. The moment the fires even look like getting out of control, all ground crews are withdrawn and air support is called in to water bomb the flames.</p><p>There are 18 Australians in this camp, helping to co-ordinate 480 firefighters and control 46 individual fires. They have been working 14-day shifts of anywhere between 12 and 18 hours and will continue to do so for another three weeks. None of them need rocking to sleep at night.</p><p>It is below freezing as the next day breaks. The temperature on the mountains will rise to 36 degrees Celsius by mid-afternoon, searing the ridges where the fires are at their worst and slowly baking the firefighters inside their flame-resistant suits.</p><p>Montana prides itself on being Big Sky country. It is an expansive State of wide open plains, vast farms, Indian reservations, and \"dude ranches\" where Wall Street cowboys can fulfil their John Wayne fantasies on horseback and sleep out on the prairies, beneath the stars.</p><p>But the big sky has been hardly visible where the Australians have been. To them, it has looked more like Big Smoke country.</p><p>Gary Berndt, the commander of operations at the Troy camp, says the Australians have already left a strong impression on their American counterparts with their insight, their willingness and their infectious good humour.</p><p>\"They are just excellent, well-trained, go-get-'em firefighters,\" Berndt says.</p><p>Berndt is discussing the day's strategy with Roger Armstrong, a typically laconic fire manager with the Department of Conservation and Land Management in Bunbury, Western Australia.</p><p>\"We call our approach here MIST,\" says Berndt. \"That's Minimum Impact Suppression Tactics, meaning we try to control the fires with the least possible disturbance to the forests, the private lands and the community.</p><p>\"I guess our equivalent, to put it colloquially,\" says Anderson, \"is `grab it by the throat and bash the snot out of it'.\"</p><p>After the morning briefing, Armstrong heads back up the mountain where a West Australian colleague, Kevin White, is leading a team of 20 Mexican firefighters mopping up the flanks of one of the larger outbreaks.</p><p>\"I think we've got it fairly secure down here,\" says White, indicating a fresh fire trail dug by hand between the smouldering trees and a creek dividing the forest from farming land. \"But it is going to keep burning up top in the wilderness, particularly if the wind gets up. It's going to shoot over the ridge and head back down the other side. We've got to watch that.\"</p><p>On the other side of that ridge, Paul McBain is working with a local forestry manager, Steve Prieve, marking a new fire break to stop the flames sneaking back into the valley. \"We've got to keep it above the houses,\" McBain says. \"You can't beat the fire. You've just got to try and out-think it.\"</p><p>A smile breaks through his dirt-covered face. To the suitably obsessed, fires aren't just spectacular to watch they're smart, too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUS: Firing line ... damage to Montana is huge.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yi4vk4fcbc1b80m69cg</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8B-H140-TXN5-R1B8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2000 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>August 26, 2000 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Usa</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents And Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

Something is terribly wrong here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To get into the forest the killer would have had to drive through several kilometres of felled pine forest that looks like a wasteland.</p><p>It's clear the killer knows this forest well. Perhaps he chose it for its macabre names on orienteering maps such as Executioner's Drop, Sick Man, Ugly Man, Knapsack Gully and Miner's Despair.</p><p>The only sounds in this place come from the largest police operation Australia has ever seen as more than 300 police scour the forest for more remains, and dozens of detectives hunt for clues.</p><p>It's clear the killer knows the forest well as it's easy to get lost in the maze of firetrails and rugged bush tracks that shoot off in every direction, some simply petering out at dead-ends before fading into the spindly scrub.</p><p>It was at four such spots that the backpacker killer snuffed out seven young lives, six of them in frenzied knife attacks. Some blows were so hard they snapped bones and left scars found on the skeletons years later.</p><p>From the bodies found so far - and police fear there are more in the forest- it appears the killer's sick mind has concocted a chilling ritual, played out time and again over the past three years.</p><p>His first known victims were Melbourne teenagers Deborah Everist and James Gibson, both 19. They were last seen alive on December 29, 1989, at a backpackers' hostel in Surry Hills. They planned to hitchhike north to a festival at Nimbin.</p><p>Two weeks later, Gibson's bag was found at Galston Gorge, near Hornsby, slashed and with the name labels cut off. The two were reported missing on January 15 and a week later Gibson's camera was handed in by someone who had found it at the gorge.</p><p>Almost three years later, on October 1 this year, a bushwalker stumbled across their skeletal remains at Belanglo.</p><p>They were 1km from where the first pair of hitchhikers were found dead 12 months before - 22-year-old British backpackers Joanne Walters and Caroline Clarke.</p><p>They were the last known victims of the killer. They disappeared in April, 1992, and were last seen hitchhiking at Bulli Pass. Reported sightings of them at Bowral were discounted by police last week. In both cases, the couples were found about 100 metres apart.</p><p>The four bodies were laid out as though for a sick ritual. Animals had disturbed some of the bones, but it appears in each case the killer had laid their hands behind their backs.</p><p>In each case, the killer had flayed into them with a knife, stabbing them repeatedly. The only difference - and police say this is crucial - is that Caroline Clarke had been shot several times through the head with a .22 rifle. It was, one said, as if she had been used for target practice.</p><p>The bodies of Clarke and Walters were placed under a rock ledge and loosely covered with sticks and brush.</p><p>But Gibson and Everist were placed in what appeared to be a bizarre bush coffin. Both lay beside a log, with branches and sticks laid over them like a tent.</p><p>It appears some people may have had picnics over the years, not knowing they were just metres from the graves. The charred remains of campfires were found near several of the bodies and it is possible, police said, the killer may have camped there himself.</p><p>Four weeks after the discovery of the Melbourne couple's bodies, police found the remains of Simone Schmidl, 21, a backpacker from Regensburg in Germany. Her body was 5km from the first two killing sites and she was laid out in almost identical fashion.</p><p>Schmidl was last seen alive in January, 1991, as she left Sydney to hitchhike to Melbourne to meet her mother, who was flying in from Germany. She never made it.</p><p>Again, her body was laid out as if for a ritual presentation - face down, arms and legs stretched out, and covered with bush.</p><p>Then, last Thursday, police found what they expected - the sixth and seventh victims - missing German backpacker Gabor Neugebauer, 21, and his girlfriend, Anja Habschied, 20. They were last seen alive on Boxing Day 1991, leaving a Kings Cross backpackers' hostel to hitch to Darwin via Adelaide.</p><p>Again, the bodies were face down. They were 80 metres apart. Again, they were covered in a bush coffin. This time, their bodies were separated by a trail.</p><p>Again, there were signs somebody had visited the spot in the past few years. There were signs of a picnic and somebody had chopped wood just metres away from Habschied's body.</p><p>Officially, police say they are only certain that Walters and Clarke were alive when they were taken into the forest. But all indications are that the other victims were also brought to their execution alive.</p><p>Speculation is high that the victims were drugged and then driven into the forest. One theory is that the killer attacked one victim while they were still drugged or unconscious and then used the other for sport.</p><p>Superintendent Clive Small, officer in charge of the operation, said the placing of the bodies followed a deliberate pattern. They are all about 40 metres from a fire trail or tracks on the fringe of the pine forest.</p><p>Police believe the killer is likely to be a local who knows Belanglo well and always returns there, like a wolf to its lair.</p><p>Some experts believe the killer subconsciously wants the bodies found, perhaps to act out some imagined ritual.</p><p>Could the killer be laying the bodies out in a pattern that could only be seen on a map or from a helicopter, perhaps that of a box or a satanic sign?As four of the victims disappeared around Christmas, perhaps it was some sort of bizarre Christmas \"present\" left near a forest of Christmas trees?</p><p>The only things the victims had in common were that they all disappeared on school holidays and while hitchhiking. They were healthy, fit, attractive young people. Several of the women had striking resemblances to each other.</p><p>Police are combing through hundreds of other missing persons reports, some going back to the mid-1970s, to see if there is any sign they too could have fallen victim to the backpacker killer.</p><p>Police are also examining unsolved murders of several other hitchhikers. In September 1991 Dianne Pennachio disapppeared from Bungendore. Her body was found two months later in Tallganda State Forest, near Queanbeyan where she lived, in a similar condition to those found in Belanglo 120km away. Her body was 10 metres off a forest fire trail, face down and covered in loose scrub. She had been sexually assaulted before being knifed to death. It has been impossible to tell if the Belanglo bodies had been sexually assaulted.</p><p>The manhunt for the killer is now national, with Supt Small's taskforce examining several unsolved killings of hitchhikers in other States, especially in Queensland where several hitchhikers disappeared and were murdered in the 70s and 80s.</p><p>So far it appears the backpacker killer has not struck since April 1992. There may have been periods before when he lay dormant.</p><p>It may be the killer has found a new dumping ground since the bodies of the British backpackers were found in September last year. It may also be the killer's rest time is coming to an end and he is ready to strike again.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Two Illus: WORST FEARS REALISED: The grave site of German backpacker Anja Habschied.

This true account of the man employed by the Kremlin as Josef Stalin's personal movie projectionist is certainly powerful, but it is anything but romantic or uplifting. Indeed, like many of director Andrei Konchalovsky's previous films, it is profoundly unsettling.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Konchalovsky's main theme is the mass psychology of Stalinism in Russia from the 1930s to the 1950s. He takes a completely opposite tack to the recent video release Stalin, starring Robert Duvall.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead of showing the leader as a monster and the people as oppressed victims, he offers us a hero, Ivan Sanshin (Tom Hulce), who is wildly enamored of \"the Master\", seeing him as a benevolent savior. The film delves fearlessly into the irrational passion underlying Ivan's (and a nation's) fervent ideological belief.</p><p>Outside the paranoid labyrinth of the Kremlin, we follow the course of Ivan's marriage to Anastasia (Lolita Davidovich). Once Ivan unflinchingly avows that he loves Stalin more than he loves her, the film plunges these characters into a horrendous erotic nightmare involving the sinister KGB chief Beria (Bob Hoskins). As in Konchalovsky's Maria's Lovers, the traumas of political history are seen to cause gross sexual dysfunctions in intimate life.</p><p>The Inner Circle is, in the most unrestrained and complex way, a melodrama. Whether Konchalovsky's characters are heading for salvation or damnation, they are driven, obsessed, unmoored. The actors (especially Hulce) give performances that border on the grotesque _ yet this is of a piece with the overall melodramatic style. Constantly alternating moments of crushingly dull alienation and frantic, desperate emotion, the film ensures that there is no neat reassurance or resolution for the viewer. No wonder this fine, often brilliant movie escaped a proper cinema release.</p><p>ARTICLE 99 (M, Columbia-TriStar), by contrast, offers a slick and simplistic treatment of a divisive social issue. Directed by Howard Deutch (Pretty In Pink) and scripted by Ron Cutler, the film dramatises the plight of Vietnam veterans faced with a bureaucratic ruling that effectively denies their rightful claim to medical aid.</p><p>While full of colorful sidebar characters in wheelchairs or sick beds, the story concentrates on two doctors: a righteous rebel (Ray Liotta) who has for years flaunted hospital rulings, and an incoming rookie (Kiefer Sutherland) who would rather go by the book. Before building to an extravagant inmates-and-staff-versus-police-state finale, the film finds space in its jittery mosaic for romantic sub-plots involving Kathy Baker and Lea Thompson.</p><p>Although the material is handled with undoubted skill by Deutch, the final result is gratingly superficial and forgettable. Whenever the film gets anywhere near the wasteful tragedy of death through official negligence, it speeds off into supposedly riotous scenes that desperately imitate similar set-pieces in MASH or Good Morning, Vietnam. And when it reaches the ultimate political crunch, the movie opts for commonsense consensus rather than actually daring to challenge the established system.</p><p>Loaded Weapon 1 (PG, Roadshow) is a National Lampoon production that religiously follows the formula of broad, comic pastiche introduced by Flying High 13 years ago. A popular movie genre is sent-up as if by wisecracking 12-year-olds high on `Mad' magazine: all elements of the original are derided whether they deserve it or not, and not even the corniest gag or pun is excluded. Meanwhile, familiar actors from film or TV join in the fun either by mugging outrageously or playing everything with an absurdly straight face.</p><p>The target here is essentially the buddy cop action films of recent years, with the Lethal Weapon movies, obviously enough, serving as prime material. But there are also fleeting excursions into the neighboring thriller genre for parodies of Basic Instinct and The Silence of the Lambs. For some reason, there's even a Wayne's World take-off included. Emilio Estevez hams, Samuel L. Jackson stays cool, and many stars make cameos at varying degrees of comic conviction.</p><p>FROM here onwards, it's a week of telemovies and more telemovies.</p><p>Obsessed (M, Roadshow) is a rather engaging vehicle for Shannen Doherty of 90210 fame, casting her in a role reminiscent of the heroine in Clint Eastwood's Play Misty For Me. Doherty becomes wildly involved with a man 40 years her senior (William Devane, doing his Jack Nicholson mannerisms). If the soft focus love scenes between these two aren't freaky enough for you, Doherty's subsequent description of their relationship as \"spiritual\" and \"beyond sex\" surely clinches the unnatural horror of it all.</p><p>This woman, you see, is obsessed. In movie logic, this means that she wants by any means necessary to possess her \"free spirit\" of a guy, moving into his pad without asking, bothering him with phone messages day and night when she paranoiacally suspects infidelity and, eventually, taking to highly demonstrative acts of vengeful passion when he tries to end the affair. It's a gripping tale, less for its psychological insight than for the fact that the crazy femme fatale is far more admirable than the dour daddy-substitute.</p><p>Lethal Error (PG, Applause) was originally titled Mother's Day, which more suitably fits its unusual premise. For it is less a thriller about a young man (Malcolm-Jamal Warner from The Cosby Show) wrongly accused of murder and drug dealing than a domestic melodrama detailing the loving faith and perseverance of his mother (Denise Nicholas).</p><p>Just as The Inner Circle reworks elements from Hitchcock's Notorious, this film is enlivened by its borrowing of a major premise from The Wrong Man.</p><p>VIDEO watchers know that Bram Stoker's Dracula is soon on its way, if only because of the flurry of releases trying to hitch a ride on this promotional tidal wave before it hits shore: last week the Roger Corman production Dracula Rising, and now a version of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (PG, Roadshow) starring Patrick Bergin as the mad scientist and Randy Quaid as the pathos-ridden monster.</p><p>Producer-director-adapter David Wickes is a specialist in stuffy period dramas that have a sensational element, such as Jekyll &amp; Hyde and Jack the Ripper (both starring Michael Caine). Here, the horrific and cruel elements of the Frankenstein story are downplayed in favor of mildly philosophical soliloquies on science or art, and curt observations on the frailty of civilised society. Wrapping the tale in a framing narration set in the Arctic, Wickes emphasises the doppelganger link between Bergin and Quaid, but generates few sparks, either of a visceral or intellectual nature.</p><p>FIRESTORM: 72 Hours in Oakland (M, Entcorp) is, like most disaster movies, essentially a soap opera, which is not in itself an insult.</p><p>Characters of many different persuasions _ black, white, Asian, crippled, discontent _ are introduced in bland vignettes while, unbeknown to them all, a forest fire leaps into being. The spectacular, prolonged blaze that ensues guarantees that each person must learn to let go of their unfinished business and start anew _ or cling to the past and perish. LeVar Burton (from Star Trek: The Next Generation) and Jill Clayburgh star in this pretty dull soap, overly punctuated by clumsy TV zooms into burning tree branches.</p><p>A re-release, very far from telemovie land, deserves special mention: Wim Wenders' 1977 film The American Friend (PG, Entcorp). Adapted, like Hitchcock's Strangers on a Train, from a novel by Patricia Highsmith, it circles the strange and ambiguous relationship between a quiet picture framer (Bruno Ganz) and an underworld hitman (Dennis Hopper). Although the plot has all the narrative and moral elements of a thriller, Wenders abstracts the proceedings into a disquieting, attenuated mood piece.

We are recommending the immediate inclusion of the whole of Point Nepean on the new federal Australian heritage list as an iconic place of this very old - and very young - country.</p><p>Peter Holloway, president, Mornington Peninsula Branch, National Trust of Australia (Victoria)</p><p>And thanks to the fighters</p><p>Congratulations and salutations are the order of the day. But in the euphoria of the announcement that keeps Point Nepean in public hands, let's never forget the victory belongs to the tireless efforts of hundreds of people who gave their time, expertise and hard work to save this most precious natural and historical icon.</p><p>Let's not forget, either, that the Federal Government and its cronies were more than willing to let our land pass into the hands of private developers and were popping champagne corks just months ago. It was the tenacity of the community that refused to give in that kept the issue alive.</p><p>It appears Flinders MP Greg Hunt was worried about his seat - he had good reason to be. The wave of community concern was enormous and would have drowned him. But now he has been thrown a lifebuoy.</p><p>As we accept the anonymous (and excruciatingly well-timed) $10 million dollar gift, let us look very carefully at the processes put in place by the Government in the establishment of a trust. Let us make sure that the trust truly represents the community passion for the point.</p><p>Jane Barrington, Portsea</p><p>What guarantee?</p><p>The good news is that Point Nepean won't be going to the developers. The bad news is what guarantee do we have that the issue hasn't been put on the backburner? If the Howard Government is re-elected and runs true to form, it will be back on the market. Why wait five years before handing Point Nepean to Victoria when no such delay applied to the similar heritage site in Sydney?</p><p>Maybe Howard should reassure Victorians by saying it will \"never, ever\" be sold. I'm sure that will set our minds at ease, just like his words on the GST, Medicare and the children overboard.</p><p>Geoff McQuinn, Morwell</p><p>An election loser</p><p>When Mark Latham announced Labor would give Point Nepean back to Victoria if it won next year's federal election (The Age, 11/12), I thought it would put the cat among the pigeons.</p><p>It did not take long for the Liberal Party's backroom boys to realise they were on a large loser, so they corrected their mistake very quickly. I wonder how long the $10 million offer has been on the table. Was it before Latham made his announcement?</p><p>Neville Wright, Kilcunda</p><p>Release all the detainees</p><p>The spirit of Christmas, as well as ordinary compassion, demands action to end the continuing horror of the refugees. So many Australians feel diminished and ashamed, and call for intervention by the minister on humanitarian grounds. If there are no terrorists among the hundreds of refugees still behind barbed wire, their continued detention offends against many of the very principles that most Australians uphold and take pride in, best summed up in the basic principle of a \"fair go\".</p><p>The women and children (94 in detention centres in Australia, 90 in Nauru) have not committed any crime. They should be released immediately, subject to any appropriate conditions. If any refugees cannot physically be returned to their homeland (parts of Afghanistan, for instance, seems as dangerous as ever), they should not be imprisoned indefinitely but released while their applications are reconsidered. Many would make very good Aussie citizens.</p><p>Let us press for a Christmas gesture that would make us proud to be Australians.</p><p>Sir Rupert Hamer (former premier of Victoria), Kew</p><p>Don't listen to the minister</p><p>Immigration Minister Amanda Vanstone tells us that the demonstrators on Nauru are not our problem. They are economic migrants, she says. How does she know this if she hasn't heard their stories? The vast majority of Afghan asylum seekers assessed onshore were found to be genuine refugees. So why are all the people on Nauru economic migrants, and not genuine refugees like their countrymen? Surely they were fleeing their country for the same reasons.</p><p>Minister Vanstone, you might fool some of the people some of the time by your smears. But not all of us are that gullible.</p><p>Ann de Hugard, Castlemaine</p><p>Not much insight</p><p>Surely this story on the $7000 first homebuyers grant to the rich and famous (The Age, 19/12) is small-minded thinking by small-minded people. Million-dollar houses attract about $100,000 GST, less the grant, with $93,000 going to the Government. A $300,000 house attracts $30,000 GST, less the grant, with $23,000 going to the Government. It costs more to police it.</p><p>If this is the extent of the Productivity Commission's research, somebody help us. House costs are inflated by excessive state taxes, expensive dirt and the four/five bedroom mansions that couples think they must have to keep the children they can't afford to have.</p><p>John Lord, East Brighton</p><p>Capital gains is the problem</p><p>Negative gearing has existed for a long time, but the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount was brought in by the Federal Government only in September 1999. Since then, house prices have risen by an enormous amount.</p><p>It is the interaction of the two that provides the opportunity for investors to reduce their tax burden. Negative gearing is used to convert income from rental property into capital gain on the value of property. It was always likely that the 50 per cent capital gains tax discount would lead to tax minimisation by the conversion of income into capital gain. The Government was warned of that before it introduced the capital gains tax changes.</p><p>There is no justification for capital gain to be taxed at a lower rate than ordinary income. The 50 per cent discount is unfair, and largely benefits high-income earners. It should be abolished, and the capital gains tax regime that existed before September 1999 should be restored.</p><p>Gavin Porter, Sunbury</p><p>ENTER challenge</p><p>A suggested alternative headline to your article (The Age, 18/12) on the VCE results: \"Western and northern metropolitan schools achieve best VET options.\" It is about time the assumption that ENTER scores are the only measure of success is challenged.</p><p>Kate Rhodes, executive officer, Banyule Nillumbik Local Learning and Employment Network, Lower Plenty</p><p>Board reforms 1</p><p>Lucy Abbott of Hamilton (16/12) makes a valid point in her criticism about the throwaway line by Andrew Slutzkin of the Rural Doctors Association that hospital boards without doctors are \"essentially good at organising the chook raffle each year\" (The Age, 15/12).</p><p>However, Lucy Abbott, Hamilton is a rural city with a larger pool of able citizens willing to commit to the huge amount of unpaid time and effort that being a member of a hospital board and its multiple committees entails. Smaller towns such as Cohuna or Rochester or Terang have a much smaller number of available citizens, some of whom may be already on other community boards of management.</p><p>By the time Health Minister Bronwyn Pike eliminates doctors, nurses, lawyers and \"tinkers and tailors\" with alleged conflict of interest and warns off others, \"the chook raffle\" looks the best option.</p><p>When is the Bracks Government going to similarly \"reform\" the 15-member boards of state schools, which have five teachers (employees of the Education Department) as full-voting members?</p><p>Dr Peter W. Graham, Cohuna</p><p>Board reforms 2</p><p>Well done, Andrew Slutzkin, for your criticism of the new policy to ban doctors from appointments to the hospital management boards. We agree this is another step to remove the autonomy of local boards. Surely it is up to boards to approve or disapprove of doctors being members.</p><p>However, we disagree that boards without doctors are only \"good for organising the chock raffle\". We are country GPs and until this policy change, have been members of boards for more than 10 years. We have worked with many people from diverse backgrounds with great skills in essential areas such as planning, finance, legal issues and personnel management. At board meetings, we all recognise these strengths and have the utmost respect for each other's knowledge. This has led to a very successful hospital with a fine track record.</p><p>Rural communities are proud of their hospitals - let them choose who should serve on their board.</p><p>Drs David Iser and Philip Worboys, Foster</p><p>Air-con is not the answer</p><p>Another record power consumption day for Victoria (The Age, 18/12). Every hour at 8500 megawatts peak power output releases about 10.2 million kilograms of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere. For the day, something approaching 100 million kilograms were released just for Victoria.</p><p>Hot conditions combined with extensive marketing are driving air-conditioner sales like never before. This is leading to even higher carbon dioxide emissions which, as now generally agreed, are causing the hotter conditions. We are in a self-amplifying loop.</p><p>The solution is not in air-conditioners but in properly designed houses and buildings. Unfortunately, with no incentives, it is far easier and cheaper to install an air-conditioner into a poorly designed and insulated building - witness the new city apartments and ever increasing sprawl of new houses with little regard for heating or cooling.</p><p>Matthew Harrison, Elwood</p><p>Armchair view of the fires</p><p>In dismissing broad-scale fuel reduction burning, Gavan McFadzean (Opinion, 15/12) demonstrates a knowledge of forest fire that appears to be limited to boiling a billy. How or why fires get into national parks is irrelevant, whilst McFadzean's use of historical comparisons of fire severity are invalid in view of the different social circumstances and today's advanced technological fire-fighting methods. What is important is the ability to minimise the threat to forests and the community by reducing fuels and being able to respond to bushfires.</p><p>Contrary to McFadzen's assertions, the timber industry has sought only to maintain access to Victoria's forests, but its exclusion from the minority of areas where it is still permitted to operate would remove the only substantial source of non-government funding as well as much of the motivation to maintain vehicular access, conduct hazard reduction activities, and maintain workforces capable of fighting bushfires.</p><p>McFadzen's denial of the importance of these activities is based on an idealistic view of forests separated from human disturbance. Perhaps if he and other armchair critics spent a summer working among the heat, smoke and flames they would appreciate their critical importance.</p><p>Mark Poynter, Doncaster East</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CARTOON by PETTY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P0N-K0W0-TXN5-S2P2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yietfqnot01dpxemaug</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2003</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1901\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2003 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"12\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>December 20, 2003 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp; COMMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001454</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712120GM</classCode><className>HISTORIC DISTRICTS &amp; STRUCTURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712120MM</classCode><className>HISTORIC SITES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST00098X3</classCode><className>CUSTOMS &amp; CULTURAL HERITAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp; PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST0008X7K</classCode><className>INDIGENOUS PEOPLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001106</classCode><className>MEDICARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST000DMQO</classCode><className>MEMORY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001454</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712120GM</classCode><className>HISTORIC DISTRICTS &amp; STRUCTURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N230000CC</classCode><className>CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N712120MM</classCode><className>HISTORIC SITES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N237200CC</classCode><className>LAND SUBDIVISION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001455</classCode><className>REAL ESTATE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N236100CC</classCode><className>RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009S2V</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000A2W7</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001106</classCode><className>MEDICARE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It really does.\" A HOBART LANDMARK AT THE It was Autumn 1995. A canoe bark birch had died suddenly.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Being autumn, leaves fall off anyway, but the leaves fell off just a bit too quickly,\" Dr Bedford said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"The staff noticed it and said: 'that's not autumn, that's death.' \" Armillaria had caught hold. Described as an underground bushfire, the deadly fungal disease has spread to 10% of the gardens and threatens the survival of the Tasmanian icon.</p><p>Dr Bedford is now a man on a mission, but his opponent _ the horticultural equivalent of cancer _ is ominous.</p><p>Armillaria has the experts baffled. Like cancer, there is no cure. All you can do is chop out the affected areas and hope for the best.</p><p>The severity of the infection has shocked garden staff.</p><p>Many trees have already been killed by the infestation.</p><p>First detected in the gardens in 1994 in one tree in an isolated area of the main lawn, staff mistakenly thought quick action had halted its spread.</p><p>\"We thought we had it under control,\" Dr Bedford said. \"What we didn't know was that there was another much larger site in the gardens that had it.\" Dr Bedford was so fearful of the aggressive disease that one of the first questions he asked garden staff upon his appointment in October 1993 was: where is the armillaria and phytophthora (another root rot disease)?</p><p>\"I was expecting to find it, but I was not expecting to find that it covered such a large extent of the gardens,\" he said. \"I was devastated because it is a very major problem.</p><p>\"It spreads in roots under the ground, and in a small thickly-planted gardens like this where the roots intersect, it just keeps going.</p><p>\"My experience of armillaria in the past had been like a spot fire, a spot infection. One tree would die and it wouldn't affect the trees around it. It was sad, but it wasn't an absolute disaster. But what I found here was so different because it was trees going one after the other.</p><p>\"Here it's reached that forest fire stage where it's wiping out everything in its path.</p><p>\"Unless we can find a way to stop the fungus, we will eventually lose the gardens _ the whole lot. It's as basic as that.\" For the staff who have cared for the plants for years, the outbreak is having a strong personal impact. Some say the death of a tree is like the death of an old friend.</p><p>\"It concerns me greatly because although I know we have done all that is humanly possible, it does give you a somewhat fatalistic feeling,\" Dr Bedford said.</p><p>\"You say 'what am I directing here _ the death of the gardens or living gardens?' It's lovely being part of a botanic gardens normally because you are a part of life, of ongoing life. This massive death and potential for even more is depressing.</p><p>\"I don't think people really appreciate just how serious it is because the gardens look so good on the surface.\" The Mercury Save the Gardens Appeal will be officially launched at the gardens' Tulip Festival tomorrow.</p><p>With the fight ahead huge and expensive, Dr Bedford sees the appeal as the difference between life and death.</p><p>Money raised will be used to employ a plant protection officer and a team of experts to tackle the disease, start an extensive research and mapping program, and develop a long-term proactive strategy for the health of the gardens.</p><p>\"We would be able to start fighting it on a number of fronts at once,\" Dr Bedford said. \"At the moment we can only do one at a time.</p><p>\"We would excavate the centres of infection that we knew of and dig trenches to quarantine areas, so we knew we had a chance of keeping the disease out of other sections.</p><p>\"If money was no object, we would have laboratory facilities and dedicated scientific and technical staff. We could start looking at factors to inhibit the growth of the fungus.</p><p>\"I can see ways to go that we cannot possibly do without the resources. We don't know the whole answer, but if we had the resources we could make a start.\" So far, gardens staff have tried several methods to contain the outbreak.</p><p>A 150-year-old cork oak, said to be the oldest, biggest and best in Australia, has had infected roots severed _ costing $50,000 so far.</p><p>While it appears healthy at the moment, staff say it's a matter of \"wait and see\".</p><p>The stumps of other infected trees have been fumigated with a chemical. While scientific literature says this method should work, it hasn't at the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens. Management is seeking approval to use stronger concentrations of the chemical.</p><p>Elsewhere, stakes have been driven into the ground to map the extent of the armillaria fungus, dying when they touch an infected root.</p><p>Little else can be done without further funding.</p><p>\"Money can help because we have to do something about it _ we can't just say 'we've got this disease and we're going to die',\" Dr Bedford said.</p><p>\"Instead of focusing on the death, we can focus on life.</p><p>\"We believe we can protect the gardens from diseases if we have the resources. Yes, we will lose trees _ there are trees that are already infected that can't be saved _ but if we get the money we can work to stop that going any further.</p><p>\"If we don't get the money we will lose the gardens. There will be nothing here.</p><p>\"This is an opportunity for the community to do their bit. They say they love the gardens, this is their chance to show it.\" And the gardens are certainly worth saving.</p><p>Established in 1818, they are the second oldest in Australia and recognised as the nation's best cool climate gardens.</p><p>The most visited site in Tasmania, it attracted 330,000 people last year and is worth more than $5 million to the economy annually.</p><p>Tourists who visit the botanical gardens stay one day longer in Tasmania than those who don't visit the gardens, each spending an extra $600 in the state.</p><p>An integral part of Tasmania's heritage and beauty, it is home to more than 6000 exotic and native plant species and has had an unbroken history of convict labour since 1818.</p><p>\"We are a core part of the Tasmanian tourism offering,\" Dr Bedford said.</p><p>\"And in a cultural sense, botanical gardens are the spirit of a place. It's because of the peace, the serenity, the beauty of the incredible plant diversity. We re-create that feeling of nature, of the natural beauty of the world.\" His vision of the ideal gardens is to establish annex sites throughout the state (the Tasmanian botanical gardens is believed to be the only one in Australia without annexes), a visitor centre, active horticultural research and conservation programs, strong education programs and proactive disease management.</p><p>He says one of the saddest moments in the gardens' recent history was the loss of its scientific heart, the herbarium, to the Museum and Art Gallery several years ago.</p><p>With a PhD in botany from the University of Sydney, Dr Bedford came to the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens after 13 years at Sydney gardens.</p><p>He is not backwards in coming forward when it comes to defending the gardens, fighting for funding, and chewing politicians' ears.</p><p>\"I care very deeply about the gardens and their role in society,\" he said.</p><p>\"I think it's only appropriate that the director of a botanic gardens makes it clear just how important a place like this is.</p><p>\"It would be a big error on my part or the part of any director to sit quietly by and watch their gardens decline or die.\" And although, like cancer, there is no cure for armillaria, Dr Bedford says the community should not feel helpless.</p><p>\"Some people who have cancer can live for many years and be happy and healthy,\" he said, \"and the same goes for these gardens. We may never fully eradicate armillaria, but if we work on it we'll be able to keep our botanic gardens going nonetheless. That's what I am convinced of.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOBARTMERCURYLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:459J-F2D0-0197-T01F-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1328\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"09\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>September 28, 1996, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000248</classCode><className>CANCER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST0008X56</classCode><className>MOLDS &amp; FUNGI</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DSDJ</classCode><className>FUNGAL DISEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712130GM</classCode><className>BOTANICAL GARDENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D890</classCode><className>HORTICULTURE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GX460</classCode><className>HOBART, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GS008</classCode><className>TASMANIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Down came Gallagher's tattered Eureka Stockade flag along with its barbed wire-encircled flagpole.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The wire was apparently a legacy of BLF-Australian Workers Union demarcation disputes in the 1970s when the wags from the AWU made a practice of stealing the trusty ensign.</p><p>Former Gallagher lieutenant turned whistle-blower, Victorian Trades Hall Council industrial officer Brian Boyd, was on hand to souvenir the flag.</p><p>WILD ABOUT RUPERT</p><p>OPTUS Vision boss Geoff Cousins returned to work yesterday fighting fit after a week bushwalking in the Tasmanian wilderness, which caused him to miss <person><nameText>Rupert Murdoch </nameText></person>in Sydney last week.</p><p>But Cousins was particularly cranky about comments made about him by Murdoch, whose Super League continues to flounder in the courts.</p><p>Murdoch told one of his News Ltd papers on the weekend that Cousins, who is on the board of Kerry Packer's Publishing and Broadcasting Ltd, was \"a Packer man in every way\" and implied that Packer had influence on Optus Vision beyond PBL's 5 per cent stake.</p><p>\"To suggest that I am 'a Packer man in every way' calls into question my ability to discharge my fiduciary duties to all shareholders of Optus Vision, and I regard those comments by Mr Murdoch as misleading and defamatory,\" Mr Cousins said in a statement.</p><p>DIGGING THE DIRT</p><p>THE Health Department of Western Australia is running its first ever \"fly survey\" amid rising concerns over infestations of the blood-sucking stable fly in the Gingin Shire, north of Perth. Media hacks who get involved cannot say they haven't been warned. \"As part of the survey, participants will be collecting fly maggot samples from a range of potential breeding sites. Media are welcome in the field,\" say the organisers.</p><p>HAPPY TO BE HOME</p><p>WAS the new boss of AMP's Retail Financial Services, Ray Greenshields, protesting just slightly too much when yesterday he insisted, \"I didn't have to have my arm twisted\" in order to come back to Australia?</p><p>As AMP's man in London, he was responsible for establishing its global investment operation, called AMP Asset Management.</p><p>After accumulating a pool of $40 billion from worldwide investors over the past five years, it could be seen as a bit of a comedown to be charged with firing up AMP's mums and dads division back home. But he insists he lined up with competitors both inside and out of AMP for the job. He takes over from Phil Twyman, who resigned last September. Greenshields protege Tony Watson takes over in London.</p><p>WHAT A CARVE UP!</p><p>AN ANTI-RAT drive in Shenzen, China, has apparently backfired due to the high market rates being paid for rat tails, AFP reports. Apparently the plan to kill 150,000 rats, with five yuan (90c) payable per rat's tail, caused an outbreak of rat tail docking rather than rat elimination. One street cleaner who set eight rat traps in sewers said he caught 52 rats but only 10 of them had tails.</p><p>PRU'S VALUE FOR MONEY</p><p>WITH one bound they were free. Well, a bit anyway.</p><p>Michael Milne's home-shopping group, International Media Management, has done a deal with Prudential Asset Management Asia Ltd and other investors that will see IMM's interest in unlisted group The Value Network cut from 59 per cent to 7.4 per cent.</p><p>In exchange for control, Prudential will inject \"approximately $30 million in equity capital\", as a statement from IMM to the ASX put it yesterday.</p><p>Good news for TVN's creditors, who had been getting used to the idea that payment was a long way off. One creditor told us he had been paid 15 per cent of money owing yesterday with a promise of full payment within two to four weeks, subject to FIRB approval.</p><p>But only average news for IMM shareholders, since the 59 per cent stake in TVN is understood to be IMM's sole asset of any significance.</p><p>So now IMM, which has been suspended for a week at its own request, has a market capitalisation of $8.19 million and 7.4 per cent of TVN, which imputes a value of more than $100 million for TVN.</p><p>TVN will have to throw in an awful lot of steak knives to reach that sort of value.</p><p>A LOT TO DIGEST</p><p>PROOF that Melbourne has become a can-do city like Sydney: many members of Melbourne's business community are forking out $150 a head for a breakfast on Friday, the day before the State election, to raise money for Open Family, a charity for street kids.</p><p>The breakfast will take place at Max's Restaurant at The Hyatt where IBIS's Phil Ruthven and BRW's Bob Gottliebsen will be peering into the crystal ball.</p><p>Guests will get \"politics, elections, consumer and business confidence, the economy, soft and hard industries, interest rates, and the Asia Pacific and global outlook - plus prospects of corporate profitability\".

BTR had already sold its Slazenger sporting goods operation, among others, and the admittedly (by BTR) \"little and lonely\" petrochemical operations looked like the next course.</p><p>The speculative embers flared into a forest fire when BTR Australia chief executive Philip Aiken made an appearance in Taiwan - for an unrelated reason.</p><p>As with all good rumours, there was even a fancy price mentioned, this time $US900 million. \"That'd be great. I'd sell it tomorrow for $US900 million,\" Aiken said yesterday.

As the election campaign</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">enters its last week, much of the political fisticuffs have centred on</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">such issues as the Budget deficit, forward estimates and Treasury</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">costings. Voters have been forced to endure a deluge of economic</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">argument on the merits of each side's big spending promises and</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">whether they can responsibly pay for them. They've had to grapple with</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">such heady subjects as the starting point for the 1996-97 Budget</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">deficit, the forecast headline inflation rate and falling growth</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">impact on the Budget's bottom line.</p><p>These intricate budgetary details, and others, have been enough to</p><p>make the average merchant banker's head spin let alone the average</p><p>voter. A street poll will quickly reveal besieged voters in many seats</p><p>cannot even name their candidates or sitting member without trying to</p><p>make sense of the finer points of budgetary number crunching.</p><p>So will five weeks of carping about the size of the starting point of</p><p>the underlying deficit win any votes? Or has the in-depth economic</p><p>debate been a massive turn-off for the average voter, who may not know</p><p> or care about the difference between the current account deficit,</p><p>the Budget deficit and foreign debt?</p><p>A political hornets' nest has been stirred up over whether the major</p><p>parties will be able to keep the Commonwealth out of the red whichever</p><p>one wins government on March 2. The avalanche of election promises</p><p>from Labor and the Coalition has kept the economic boffins of both</p><p>parties burning the midnight oil in an attempt to find holes in their</p><p>opponent's spending pledges.</p><p>To date, the Coalition has announced a whopping $6.3 billion of</p><p>campaign promises over three years, funded by a controversial $6.3</p><p>billion spending-cuts program and about $2.6 billion of revenue</p><p>measures. The big-ticket pledges include a $2.7 billion family tax</p><p>package, $1 billion in private health incentives, $400 million in</p><p>capital gains tax breaks and $195 million for Pacific Hwy funding. The</p><p>Opposition Leader, Mr Howard, has also released a raft of lesser</p><p>spending items designed to stimulate small business. On a separate</p><p>spending sheet, the Coalition says it will privatise one-third of</p><p>national telecommunications carrier Telstra for about $8 billion, with</p><p>$1 billion used for an environmental package.</p><p>On the other side of the political ledger, Labor has unveiled its own</p><p>ambitious $3 billion package of spending measures. Labor's big</p><p>spending priorities will see the Government outlay close to $1 billion</p><p>over three years on health, $439 million on an innovation package and</p><p>$347 million on the environment. To fund the program, Labor says it</p><p>will raise $2.4 billion in three years from simply closing a tax</p><p>loophole applying to 100 of the country's richest people. A clampdown</p><p>on a research and development tax concession will yield another $727</p><p>million.</p><p>Since the campaign began, the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, has</p><p>consistently argued the Coalition's brand of pork-barrelling politics</p><p>will reward Australia with an enormous deficit. But Mr Howard has hit</p><p>back, claiming his promises are based on the Government's budgetary</p><p>projection of an underlying surplus in the 1996-97 financial year.</p><p>MR Howard has argued that if the Coalition's promises are unable to be</p><p>kept, it will be because Labor has refused to reveal how far it has</p><p>allowed Australia to slip back into deficit. If the latest Government</p><p>projections are correct, he says the Coalition will return a surplus</p><p>next financial year and keep all its promises, including no new taxes</p><p>or tax hikes.</p><p>The fiscal debate reached a new high this week when the Finance</p><p>Minister, Mr Beazley, told his department to cost the Coalition's</p><p>promises. Mr Beazley assured voters a huge $3 billion hole existed in</p><p>Mr Howard's $6.3 billion pledges. An outraged Opposition claimed</p><p>caretaker conventions dictated departments be non-partisan during</p><p>campaigns. And Mr Howard wanted to know why couldn't the Finance</p><p>Department produce updated Budget projections under Labor if it was</p><p>able to run its calculators over Coalition spending promises. This</p><p>would clear up all the confusion about where Australia was heading</p><p>fiscally and allow for responsible spending pledges, he told</p><p>reporters.</p><p>But many believe the wrangling over the size of the deficit which</p><p>has received enormous media coverage has left most Australians</p><p>behind. And economists with a good understanding of the political</p><p>arena say the in-depth fiscal debate has done little to lift community</p><p>knowledge.</p><p>EXPERTS say an economically literate electorate would have been</p><p>outraged at signs the Government was sinking back into the red late</p><p>last year. When the Treasurer, Mr Willis, released the mid-year review</p><p>of the Budget in December it showed only an unexpected, early State</p><p>debt repayment from Victoria kept the Commonwealth from sinking back</p><p>into deficit.</p><p>This raises an important question: why has the issue remained so</p><p>visible if it has already slipped past a bewildered voter?</p><p>The answer, according to both parties, is simple. It's all about</p><p>credibility.</p><p>The detail of the economic debate may have gone above the heads of the</p><p>average voter but there is one side of economics they understand well</p><p> interest rates. Voters are aware of the nexus between high</p><p>government spending, high mortgages and taxes. The more government red</p><p>ink, the less likely a cut in rates or a fall in taxes. That puts a</p><p>whole new onus on the believability of grand political spending by</p><p>both parties. And both, predictably, insist they can deliver.</p><p>But Labor Party pollsters believe they have identified a wide streak</p><p>of disbelief in the community when it comes to the economic vision</p><p>espoused by Mr Howard. And the ALP strategists have determined the</p><p>best way to get that message across is to constantly put the blowtorch</p><p>on the Coalition's promises.</p><p>\"The average person does understand Budget deficits and interest</p><p>rates,\" one senior ALP adviser says. \"And the Coalition for months</p><p>has been making such a big deal about delivering a Budget surplus. We</p><p>knew they were up against it.\"</p><p>The ALP believes the fiscal debate had been kept alive because the</p><p>Keating Government wanted to keep tabs on all the spending promises</p><p>the Coalition made from the outset.</p><p>But the Coalition contends it has been the impetus behind the fueling</p><p>of the fiscal forest fire. And Liberal Party strategists are adamant</p><p>the ALP has left itself wide open to attacks on credibility after a</p><p>series of broken tax and privatisation promises.</p><p>\"Labor and Paul Keating have a serious credibility problem when it</p><p>comes to taxes, jobs and the Budget,\" says its director, Mr Andrew</p><p>Robb. \"They won't throw open the books so they have something to hide</p><p>there.\"</p><p>The Democrats offer a different view but credibility still forms the</p><p>centrepiece of its perspective. Leader Senator Kernot says the</p><p>community has become disinterested and lost in a haze of cynicism</p><p>because both parties embarked on such an audacious park-barrelling</p><p>exercise four weeks ago.</p><p>EARLY in the campaign, Senator Kernot said the party which made the</p><p>least spending pledges would win on March 2. It was her belief the</p><p>more parties promised, the less they were believed. If that axiom</p><p>proves correct, Mr Howard's team can look forward to another term</p><p>warming the Opposition benches in the House of Representatives.</p><p>But Mr Sol Leibovic, of the polling organisation Newspoll, says voters</p><p>do not necessarily want to understand the debate, they only want to</p><p>know the leader of their choice can. \"I really believe people would</p><p>like to vote for the side they think has the best vision and is going</p><p>to do the best job for the country,\" he says. \"I think the</p><p>Australian electorate actually wants the leadership of the party to</p><p>know where to take the country, to know the detail. They want to feel</p><p>confident that those in charge do know the detail.\"</p><p>By continuing to kick the economic debate along, both sides are</p><p>attempting to deliver that confidence and deliver the king-hit which</p><p>will see them win next Saturday, he says. From that perspective,</p><p>polling shows more voters trust Mr Howard, although Mr Keating's firm</p><p>leadership style has gone down well.</p><p>\"Either side can win,\" predicts Mr Leibovic. \"I think it will come</p><p>down to the last couple of days. It wouldn't surprise me if the</p><p>Coalition won easily (but) it wouldn't surprise me if Labor won.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV9602242026112951</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEADVERTISERLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4593-BY10-0197-D4TT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1401\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Advertiser</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1996 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"02\" year=\"1996\"><dateText>February 24, 1996, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000246</classCode><className>CAMPAIGNS &amp; ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000551</classCode><className>ECONOMIC NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp; ECONOMIC INDICATORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CW</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BUDGETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001333</classCode><className>PLATFORMS &amp; ISSUES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CZ</classCode><className>ELECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002003</classCode><className>ELECTIONS &amp; POLITICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000913</classCode><className>INFLATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLC5</classCode><className>PRIVATE HEALTH CARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009ERN</classCode><className>TREASURY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001390</classCode><className>PRIVATIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001426</classCode><className>PUBLIC DEBT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001812</classCode><className>VOTERS &amp; VOTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000437</classCode><className>CURRENT ACCOUNT BALANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000691</classCode><className>FAMILY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000680</classCode><className>EXTERNAL DEBT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000DOZ5</classCode><className>TAX BREAKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX001688</classCode><className>TAXES &amp; TAXATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000218</classCode><className>BUDGETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CUSY</classCode><className>BUDGET DEFICITS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CW</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BUDGETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLC5</classCode><className>PRIVATE HEALTH CARE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009ERN</classCode><className>TREASURY DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001693</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N517000CC</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0008XRM</classCode><className>TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

We need something that is beautiful, not something dark and charred, something to help us remember who those children were, not how they died.\" - Jenny Lloyd-Morgan, psychologist</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It's a black hole that has a stranglehold on people's emotions, on the town's ability to move on.\" - Bill Trevor, Childers mayor</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Thirty years a social worker and you would think I'd know better. But I can't look at that building now. I walk past it with my head down.\" - Shirley Maisey, director of the Childers Neighbourhood Centre</p><p>IT's been 12 months since an early morning inferno took the lives of 15 young backpackers and left 69 others shivering on the street in little more than their underwear. But trauma still grips the little rural town of Childers as if the catastrophe happened only yesterday.</p><p>Like most of the town's 2200 residents, those first called out to confront the tragedy in the chaotic dark hours of June 23 last year cannot get the deaths out of their minds.</p><p>Their fears and frustrations, anger and misplaced guilt -- this was proudly the safest of communities, especially for the young -- centre on \"the black hole\", the burnt-out Palace Backpackers Hostel where death visited with frightening speed and no warning.</p><p>As far as is known since a coronial inquiry has been delayed, it was here about midnight that a fire began in a downstairs TV room, volatile, unburnt gases drifting up to accumulate beneath the roof where, inevitably, they \"crowned\" like a forest fire.</p><p>But the building remains much as it was when the last flames died out, rubble and soot and ash-filled; ugly, melted pipes bending at crazy angles over what was a temporary morgue.</p><p>It is an accusation, a gap in the fabric of life itself. More than 6000 cars and trucks a day drive past it through an avenue of leopard trees, a soft interlude in the Bruce Highway. Townspeople hurry by, looking elsewhere.</p><p>Oh, there is life all around it. As they have for generations, the great canefields which surround Childers show promise of a bumper crop in the next few months. Between them, the rich, red volcanic soil each week is being stripped of hundreds of thousands of tonnes of tomatoes, capsicums, avocados, zucchinis and snow peas.</p><p>It is this $100 million a year industry which for decades has lured foreign backpackers to Childers, to work brutally hard for up to $11 an hour as pickers and field hands for a few days or weeks then move on, pockets filled, to continue their adventurous travels.</p><p>Although few were to be found there this week, they are still coming. There will be an influx this week, hopefully a dozen or so of the 69 injured and perhaps a few relatives of the 15 dead according to mayor Bill Trevor, to attend next Saturday's commemorative service in the town's Cultural Centre.</p><p>There, accompanied by prayers and hymn singing, a few low-key speeches and a mixing of townsfolk, backpackers, emergency service personnel, volunteers from the churches and service organisations, tears long dried in all likelihood will flow again.</p><p>This should be closure, says Trevor, or at least a major step in the healing process. But across the road is the stark, haunting reminder of the past, the blackened facade of the Palace, empty windows like eye sockets in a skull, behind them nothing but blue sky.</p><p>After the fire, the council tried to buy the hostel, Trevor says. Along with grants of about $300,000, came $75,000 from the State Government towards costs. The British government gave $29,000 and $50,000 came from Canberra. But the previous owners sold privately to a Gold Coast developer, who in turn has been seeking interest-free government loans. Through letters hand delivered by Premier Peter Beattie to Prime Minister John Howard, Childers asked for a grant of $1.3 million to turn the hostel into a memorial.</p><p>Continued Page 28</p><p>A hole in the heart of Childers</p><p>From Page 27</p><p> Although by this week nothing had been heard, Trevor says that $700,000 now would be enough to buy the front of the building from the developer, turn the upstairs into an art gallery memorial and downstairs into an information bureau. A modern hostel, possibly with a memorial garden, would be constructed at the rear.</p><p> \"We have come so far. What hurts is that in so many ways these kids were our kids. They tended to replace our own youngsters of about the same age who, like so many from country towns, move to the cities for education or jobs,\" Trevor says.</p><p>\"We have stayed in touch with most of them, even to the point now of still paying for the counselling in places like England and Western Australia of those most affected. Some keep coming back . . . from Hawaii, New Zealand, Britain, wherever . . . They tell me they see Childers not so much as where the fire happened but as a second home.</p><p>\"We have had the parents of the dead, trying desperately to come to terms with their loss. One mother said she made the journey to gain a vision not of where her son died but of the fields where he worked and the friends he made.</p><p>\"The thing is we need a symbol as the focus for the love and respect we feel for the children we lost and it can only be as a replacement for that black building.\"</p><p>The Cultural Centre is where director of the Childers Neighbourhood Centre Shirley Maisey, psychologist Jenny Lloyd-Morgan and director of the Childers Information Centre Nancy Calder, turned up in the pre-dawn of that awful morning 12 months ago.</p><p>Each instinctively claimed or was assigned a key role in the immediate crisis management. They call themselves the \"old fossils\" but their far-from-old arms, around weeping kids or kids in deep shock, were not fossilised arms.</p><p>This week in the centre, as in so many other gatherings in Childers, their minds went back to the beginnings. As they talked it was obvious that their recall was disjointed, like the tragedy itself:</p><p>Maisey: \"I lost a daughter when she was 28, so I know that you never really get over things like this. The awful reality was that in the blink of an eye 15 young people we like were gone and 69 others were lost in horror even as we cuddled them.</p><p>\"My horror began when the phone rang at 4.30am and I think it was three days before I got home for a small rest. The mayor kept saying to helpers who were inundating us, 'if you need anything just see Shirley'.</p><p>\"I am trained in crisis, thought I knew how to deal with it and get out. But it turns out that none of us knew.</p><p>\"I know I will never be the same again. I don't think we will ever have closure. It is not guilt but we keep asking, 'Why us?' If the kids had all been from Childers it might have been different, but these were from around the world and suddenly we were surrogate mothers with arms around those special 69. All we could do was try to make things better.\"</p><p>Lloyd-Morgan: \"I was put in charge of counselling but in those first days all you could do was settle the kids, comfort them and the emergency workers who were in as much stress, make sure the survivors felt safe and connect them with family. This was an entire community in shock.\"</p><p>Calder: \"I kept looking around the room, my mind continually asking, 'who's missing?' The lists were a mess. There were seven kids who had lost their glasses and could not see. The rest had nothing -- no money, no credit cards. They were cold and wet and did not know where their friends were.</p><p>'WE HAD to find food for them, for the SES, the firemen and the police and the volunteers -- 1400 meals a day for 14 days. The Fruit and Vegetable Association did the meals at night, the Lions Club did breakfast.</p><p>\"Food arrived by truck and car. Little old ladies walked in with cakes, farmers with their produce. It was sorted by the Red Cross, the CWA and the churches. It became a seamless flow.</p><p>\"The shock began to go after the memorial service on the third day and I came back to find two boys kicking a football around in the hall and I thought 'Thank heavens something is normal. We are going to be all right'.\"</p><p>Calder: \"Some have told me that they would leave us with memories of hard work, of heat, sweat, flies, cold beer and storms. But they have kept coming back. They have a bond with this little town, see it as a second home. It is going to be a difficult commemorative service.\"</p><p>Lloyd-Morgan: \"Yes, we have come a long way, but that black hole is a barrier to integrating the life of the community so that we can go on. You see it and think that 15 people died there in the smoke and the rubble.</p><p>\"It is not a memorial. We need something that is beautiful, not something dark and charred, not a stone or a plaque somewhere. It has to be something to help us remember who those children were, not how they died.\"</p><p>What these women do not say, but Trevor does, is that a memorial will not be the end of the ordeal.</p><p>There is the trial later this year of Robert Paul Long, 38, who has been charged with setting the fire and murdering two of the victims, 27-year-old West Australian twins Kelly and Stacey Slarke. He remains in custody contesting the right to have the trial held elsewhere.</p><p>The inquest into the disaster will follow, the Coroner having adjourned his inquiry to ensure that Long gets a fair trial.</p><p>Like most Australian towns, Childers is unused to tragedy on this scale. With luck and a little governmental generosity, the black hole in the town's heart soon will disappear. But full healing promises to be a long night.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML0106161027557434</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIERMAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44DT-W970-015G-Y391-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1582\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Courier Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"06\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>June 16, 2001, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>CHILDERS NEIGHBOURHOOD CENTRE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DBBS</classCode><className>BACKPACKING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000696</classCode><className>FARM LABOR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DRMO</classCode><className>SOCIAL WORK</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N923120MQ</classCode><className>CORONERS COURTS &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000696</classCode><className>FARM LABOR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001174</classCode><className>MOTOR VEHICLES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In these modified sheds - \"sweatboxes\" - our state teachers are charged with the responsibility of imparting knowledge, morals and a love of learning to about 27,000 state school students.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Comparing this with the millions of dollars offered to wealthy schools to further existing excellent, sometimes lavish, facilities and accommodation (all to the good) must tell us something of the reasons parents often choose, at great personal expense, to send their children to private schools. It seems there is a paucity of thinking and lack of vision by those in government.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Owen Dingle, Rosanna</p><p>As shameless as Gareth</p><p>For some years, the back window of my car carried the message \"But it's not our oil, Gareth\". This sticker also showed a map of the Timor Gap. On the departure of Senator Evans, I substituted the still current message \"Timor Gap . . . Oil Piracy\".</p><p>Notwithstanding your editorial (The Age, 13/8), the sticker will remain affixed until Australia unequivocally releases to East Timor its just entitlements to the oil in its sea. Alexander Downer's condescending and grasping behaviour is as shameless as that demonstrated by Gareth Evans.</p><p>Jill O'Brien, Kew</p><p>Spurious concerns</p><p>As an ecologist, I found some of Tony Cutcliffe's comments (Opinion, 13/8) rather disturbing. We have not lost forever 20,000 hectares of alpine ash. Ash forests, like many others, have been burnt and regenerated for millenniums, and somehow, miraculously, managed to do so without our superior brand of management. We should not pretend that what is clearly a disaster for humans is somehow a disaster for nature.</p><p>If the Stretton Group is concerned with community safety, the quality of drinking water or the protection of timber resources, then it should simply say so, because these are indeed important considerations. But please don't hide behind spurious ecological concerns.</p><p>Arn Tolsma, Box Hill North</p><p>What will another inquiry achieve?</p><p>Re Tony Cutcliffe's article: how many inquiries do we need before The Eureka Project and the Stretton Group get the answers they want to hear?</p><p>The Council of Australian Government's report on bushfire mitigation and management is imminent, the Victorian Government has issued its report of the inquiry into the 2002-03 Victorian bushfires, the House of Representatives Select Committee has released its report, and the Victorian Auditor-General's report on fire prevention and preparedness became publicly available last year. Now we have calls for a coronial inquiry into the fires. But what will another inquiry achieve?</p><p>If their claims and demands are to be taken seriously, it is important that groups such as The Eureka Project and the Stretton Group are themselves subject to scrutiny. What are their agendas? What stakes do they have in the management of our public lands? Who is it that they represent? They could begin answering these questions by revealing their sources of funds.</p><p>Josh Whittaker, Caulfield</p><p>The real problem</p><p>The problems of Victoria's under-resourced forests and national parks have essentially been created by the ideological opposition of some to the use of trees for wood, and their creation of damaging public perceptions that are out of proportion to reality.</p><p>The closure of local timber industries dramatically impacts on forest fire management by removing the source of substantial non-government funding that has always paid for key activities such as fuel reduction burning and road and track maintenance.</p><p>It also removes from the forest, government and industry personnel who have traditionally been at the forefront of firefighting efforts.</p><p>A coronial inquiry into the 2003 bushfires will only benefit sensible forest and fire management if it results in a rigorous public examination of green, anti-forestry campaign messages, motives, and methods. Only this can stem the growth in misinformed community sentiment that makes it politically expedient for governments to further exclude wood production and create more national parks.</p><p>Mark Poynter, Doncaster East</p><p>Profiting on death</p><p>My wife died recently, and in the process of getting her affairs in order I telephoned Altitude (Westpac) and Qantas to transfer her frequent flyer points to me, only to discover that they are forfeited on her death. This is disgraceful. I am only talking some 50,000 points, so it's no big deal. Keep them by all means, but my gorgeous wife made a point of buying on her credit card to build up these points - and they profit on her death? They should be ashamed of themselves.</p><p>Cliff Ellen, Rye</p><p>So where's the justice?</p><p>I am a registered midwife and the mother of two children aged nine and four. Last year my husband endured months of chemotherapy to treat bowel cancer. He died in March this year.</p><p>I spent last year caring for the kids and my husband, working casual shifts, and searching for a non-shift-work job that would enable me to keep my family fed and clothed. During this time the Government, through Centrelink, paid my husband $4000 as a sickness benefit. I have recently been informed that I have to pay $2000 of this back to Centrelink.</p><p>Richard Butler is getting a payout of $650,000 after 10 months' work. Where is the justice in all of this?</p><p>Jennifer Carr, Ocean Grove</p><p>Don't forget Darfur</p><p>The Australian Government has responded generously to the plight of the people of Darfur in Sudan. It is equally critical that Australia takes a leading role to ensure, as the UN Security Council has demanded, that the Government of Sudan puts an immediate end to the human rights abuses being perpetrated by the Janjaweed militia. UN Security Council Resolution 1556 describes the situation in Sudan as constituting a threat to international peace and security and to stability in the region.</p><p>As a party to the Genocide Convention, Australia should exercise its diplomatic influence both directly with the Government of Sudan and with other governments to mobilise an appropriate international response. The Australian Government should provide whatever support is needed and requested by the African Union to maintain its international monitors and sustain protection forces if they are deployed.</p><p>As an election campaign approaches, it is possible that political and public interest in Darfur might dissipate, if not disappear. Australia should not be silent in the face of this unfolding catastrophe. We, through our elected representatives, must take what action we can to respond swiftly to limit what in Sudan may be characterised as genocide. This is an opportunity for Australia to re-establish itself as a country prepared to stand up for issues of human rights.</p><p>Associate Professor Mike Toole, centre for international health, Burnet Institute; Bebe Loff, human rights and bioethics unit, Monash University;</p><p>Professor Kim Mulholland, centre for international child health, Melbourne University; Associate Professor Peter Deutschmann, Australian International Health Institute, Melbourne University</p><p>Oil wars</p><p>Please, Mr Howard, when you're deciding which country to invade next, could you make sure you don't pick an oil supplier? At more than $1.20 a litre, petrol is fast becoming an unaffordable luxury for many of us. I don't think we could cope with the price rise if you and Mr Bush destabilise another oil-producing country.</p><p>Michelle Wood, Wagga Wagga, NSW</p><p>Medicare muddle</p><p>The Government's new policy to pay more to doctors when they bulk-bill health care (or concession) card-holders or children under 16 is doing so much harm to the general society. Now many doctors are refusing to bulk-bill people who do not have a health care (or concession) card.</p><p>The vast majority of middle-class, hard-working Australians fall into this category. It is the tax paid by these industrious people that supports the health-care facility. But, unfortunately, the new policy has deprived them of the one benefit they enjoyed before - access to medical benefits.</p><p>Rebecca Jacob, Oakleigh</p><p>A waste of public money</p><p>I'm recovering from a nasty \"bug\" that resulted in me taking two days off work to huddle in bed feeling horrible. Under my employment award, I must supply a medical certificate if I have more than one day off sick. The consequence is that, having almost recovered, and hence feeling near enough well enough to get out of bed and drive, I have no option but to visit a GP at the expense of the public purse and waste their time and mine for the sake of bureaucracy.</p><p>When I lived in the United Kingdom, there was no requirement for sick folk to worry about medical certificates unless they were off work for more than a week. There seemed to still be adequate systems in place to ensure workers weren't shamelessly rorting their employers.</p><p>I imagine some GPs value the system for the easy money it brings them. But don't we have a system stretched to the limit, with doctors unable to give patients the time they need?</p><p>My trip to the doctor yesterday felt like nothing more than a ridiculous charade, demeaning to both of us and a waste of public money. (Yes, I went to a bulk-billing practice).</p><p>Isn't it time to review this ridiculous policy?</p><p>Mark Allen, Bentleigh East</p><p>Misplaced priorities</p><p>John Howard is so terrified of gays and lesbians he has dropped anti-terrorist measures to pass his ban on gay marriage (The Age, 13/8). He seems to be frantic to get the election under way, perhaps even while the Olympics is on: that way, he thinks, the real campaign will be shorter, because everyone will be watching Thorpe and Klim and company. That means he would evade the full scrutiny that would expose his shortcomings.</p><p>But there are a whole load of bills Howard wants to get passed, just in case he loses. Must have something for his legacy. What's more important? Already he has amended the FTA to incorporate changes he thinks might invalidate the whole deal, giving the Opposition everything it wants. Now he's so panicked, he has dropped anti-terrorist legislation to make time to go queer-bashing. He thinks we are more of a threat than al-Qaeda!</p><p>He is willing - according to what he has said about his anti-terror measures - to leave Australia dangerously exposed, solely, but has the time to ban gay marriage.</p><p>Doug Pollard, Eltham North</p><p>Mocking marriage</p><p>\"The proposed ban on homosexual nuptials promotes intolerance.\" This is just a sample of the absurd propositions put forward by those promoting the never-ending gay agenda. However, this is not a claim by radical gay advocates, it is an extract from The Age editorial (13/8).</p><p>Marriage, by design, was never intended for same-sex couples and no one has questioned this until recent developments overseas. The Federal Government, with the support of the Labor Opposition, is merely confirming what the vast majority of Australians have always understood marriage to be: the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others. How this can be interpreted as \"promoting intolerance\" is beyond the understanding of rational thought, yet it seems today that the more ridiculous the proposition, the more plausible it becomes.</p><p>Besides, there is considerable division within the gay community on this matter, as those who want to be accepted as \"queer\" do not want to be in a relationship that mimics heterosexuals. This is a dilemma, which some gays fear exposes the many in their ranks who are \"closet\" heterosexuals.</p><p>To accept gay marriage is to mock marriage and make it meaningless.</p><p>Peter Coventry, Keilor Lodge</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>CARTOON BY PETTY</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P0N-K0M0-TXN5-S1T2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-50hi27z7adsjrsg1ju2</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2004</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2004 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"08\" year=\"2004\"><dateText>August 16, 2004 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Education Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDkzNUEzQzFBNEZBNEFBREIxNDM5MTc1MUU5QjI4MTY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Age</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6REY0NjE3OTkzMzQ5NDA3RkIyNDVBMjlDRDczRENBQkU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzIyNDE4RDQ5NkNGNDBDREFBNzc3QkJBRjdERDlCQ0Y</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Family Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEI4M0U5Qzg3RTk0NDdBRUJGNDRGNkZEQkU3RDdFNDU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Same Sex Marriages</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MzhFNUU2MUZFRjJCNEFDQjg3ODk1N0NCRjgzQTA4MUE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzlENkE4OENDOTNFNDg1RUEyNzBBMzcyQkE4MjM0Q0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>STX001022</classCode><className>LETTERS &amp;

Residents are about to find out what this means for them and their property prices.</p><p>\"The psychological impact of buying something that is `bushfire prone' will affect values,\" says Max Fragar, the vice-president of the Planning Institute and who works as a consultant in the Blue Mountains. \"It will also mean increased costs of development, increased insurance.\"</p><p>The new \"bushfire prone\" designation will appear on the section 149 certificates issued by the council when a property is sold, just as it does if a home is on a floodplain or an area prone to subsidence.</p><p>Building on some blocks may be restricted altogether, depending on the terrain. On others, with slopes of up to 18 degrees, there are requirements for buildings to be set back as far as 70 metres from the bush. This will most likely affect property developers who had hoped to either subdivide rural areas or build medium-density units in areas such as North Turramurra.</p><p>But it may affect individual home owners too, who plan to build afresh.</p><p>The new rules are contained in Rural Fire Service guidelines \"Planning for Bushfire Protection\", which came into effect on August 1, and Australian Standard 3959, covering buildings. The maps of bushfire-prone areas are the mechanism that applies the laws to particular properties. As the bushfire season takes hold again, several Sydney councils are racing to get their maps into law. Four rural councils, including Blue Mountains, have already had their maps approved.</p><p>But with only a few months of experience of the new laws, the Planning Institute is warning that the system is too broad-brush and is inefficient. It has warned of wholesale sterilisation of land within and around Sydney because of the setback rules.</p><p>In built-up Sydney the new rules are more likely to manifest as higher building costs, limitations on the type of design and materials that can be used and delays while development applications are submitted to the Rural Fire Service.</p><p>\"People buying bushland blocks and wanting to build an environmentally sensitive house are going to have to build heavier houses,\" said Pittwater Council's general manager, Angus Gordon.</p><p>One planning consultant, who asked not to be named, said a client had been refused a wooden deck around the pool even though it was well separated from the house. The client must now look at alternative materials that are non-combustible and more expensive.</p><p>Such stories are not unusual. The Rural Fire Service has already agreed to join a taskforce that will review the implementation of controversial new legislation.</p><p>But, according to PlanningNSW, the legislation itself is not up for grabs; only its administrative workings will be reviewed.</p><p>In the meantime, the exercise of identifying the individual properties which are subject to the new laws is well under way.</p><p>Ku-ring-gai Council will consider its map (reproduced on the cover of News Review) next week at an extraordinary general meeting. The map will then go on public exhibition for comment, but it is unclear whether the lines on the map are able to be altered unless the RFS agrees. An estimated 12,000 homes are affected one third of all houses in Ku-ring-gai municipality.</p><p>Predictably, the Ku-ring-gai map includes large parts of North Turramurra and other areas which abut the Ku-ring-gai National Park. But it also includes some surprising areas, such as the heavily treed \"bush school\" in suburban Wahroonga and the houses in a 100 metre buffer zone around the school.</p><p>Ku-ring-gai mayor Ian Cross, whose own property is designated bushfire prone, says he's supportive of the new rules (although he won't be voting next week because of a potential conflict of interest).</p><p>\"What we are looking to do is still have the amenity of living close to the bush, but make it a safe amenity,\" he says.</p><p>But like all new laws with the best intent, problems are emerging.</p><p>Pittwater's Angus Gordon says his council one of the first to put an interim map in place is sending 50 development applications a month to the Terrey Hills office of the Rural Fire Service.</p><p>\"They are good guys but they are being buried under the workload,\" Gordon says. More complex multiple-dwelling proposals have to go to the RFS head office in Rosehill.</p><p>Pittwater Council is facing a particularly interesting problem. It has already notified 12,800 residents that they are in a bushfire hazard area, based on an earlier map produced to plan for a bushfire emergency in Sydney's most northern peninsula. But the new bushfire-prone map, which brings into play the new design laws, covers a much smaller area.</p><p>Gordon says the new map eliminates large areas adjoining what he calls \"suburban bushland\", and retains only the areas which adjoin the larger areas of bush.</p><p>\"Some protective measures would be useful for these suburban areas. We need lesser criteria for suburban areas which are not as heavily treed,\" he says.</p><p>Pittwater Council has notified the RFS that it intends to stick with the earlier map until the RFS can reassure it that council will not be liable for loss or damage in the areas which have been dropped from the new map.</p><p>It has also raised concerns about the apparent contradictions between the Threatened Species Act which protects habitat and the bushfire legislation.</p><p>\"It leaves a lot of confusion for residents and planners,\" Gordon says.</p><p>Pittwater has gone as far as to suggest the State Government should have a land repurchase plan where it wants to realise the objectives of both acts. But such a move would cost millions in an area like Pittwater, where property land values alone often exceed $1million.</p><p>Sutherland Shire Council, which covers the southern perimeter of Sydney, has more experience than most in dealing with bushfires and protecting property. It has learnt the hard way, having lost houses and lives during the 1994 bushfires and again at the start of this bushfire season.</p><p>As a result it has developed its own planning and building codes for the urban interface.</p><p>\"We have a grading system at the interface and it depends on how close to the perimeter the property is as to what is required,\" says John Brunton, the council's director of environmental services.</p><p>He says that the RFS approach relies too heavily on setbacks and that research by Sutherland in conjunction with the CSIRO has isolated \"fairly precisely where setbacks won't work in the shire\".</p><p>But the Rural Fire Service has asked the council to simplify the maps for the purposes of working out which properties will be subject to the state-wide rules and the RFS approval process.</p><p>\"We would prefer it if the RFS recognised our own in-house expertise [rather than taking over the process],\" Brunton says.</p><p>Sutherland is planning to lodge its maps with the Rural Fire Service before Christmas, and they should be on exhibition in the new year.</p><p>While there are downsides for residents, the new bushfire laws appear to have brought one win in Ku-ring-gai: a halt to the hated SEPP 5 developments, medium-density developments for the over 55s.</p><p>Following a massive community campaign, by the residents of North Turramurra and which received support from broadcaster Alan Jones, the Planning Minister, Andrew Refshauge, and the Rural Fire Service Commissioner, Phil Koperberg, visited to see what</p><p>the fuss was about.</p><p>Within hours the entire peninsula had been declared a SEPP-5 free zone because of the difficulties of evacuation if the surrounding bushland went up in flames.</p><p>The large blocks along Bobbin Head Road had been a favourite for these over-55 developments and angry developers are still contemplating whether they have any legal rights to compensation.</p><p>Although legislation is still to come, the Land and Environment Court has rejected several applications on bushfire safety grounds.</p><p>So far it is the councils with experience of bushfires who have raced ahead with their bushfire mapping. But as this week has proved, councils like Ryde, which include areas like the Field of Mars common, will need to consider similar exercises.</p><p>Meanwhile, for those would-be renovators in the bushland suburbs, a word of warning. Finding a planner who has time to give advice is a challenge in itself.</p><p>BUILDING IN THE BUSH</p><p>Construction in areas prone to bushfires must meet the following guidelines:</p><p>* Maximum distance between bush and house depends on the slope of the land. The steeper the slope, the faster and more ferocious a fire can be.</p><p>* Ridgetop sites and sites on steep slopes should be avoided, particularly if they have northerly to westerly aspects. Sites on slopes steeper than 18 degrees are considered too dangerous.</p><p>* Every home should be separated from the bush by at least an access road or reserve. It is not acceptable to expect a neighbouring landowner, such as the National Parks and Wildlife Service, to provide these asset protection zones.</p><p>* There should be two ways to access every home and the roads should be at least eight metres wide, with limited use of speed humps or chicanes.</p><p>* Concrete-slab construction should be used in preference to raised floors. Homes should be built near entrances to blocks, rather than set back.</p><p>* Battleaxe blocks and scattered subdivisions are not permitted.</p><p>* Wire screens may be required on all windows, to prevent ember attack if the windows smash during fire.</p><p>* Guttering must have leaf screens.</p><p>* Use of wood as a building material may be restricted, depending on site.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUS: The battle front ... establishing a dividing line is proving the struggle.

He thought September 11 would be a day like any other. He was wrong</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My life was spared by 11 minutes. On September 11, I escaped from the North Tower at 10.18am. The building collapsed seconds before 10.29am.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I owe my life to three things: a tie; a Port Authority Police officer; and the architects who designed the World Trade Centre in such a way as to ensure it remained standing long enough to allow an estimated 25,000 people to escape.</p><p>When the first of two 767s hit the twin towers at 8.46am, I was at my desk on the 68th floor, in the public affairs department of the New York Port Authority.</p><p>I had been working for nearly two hours, and had just finished a phone call to a colleague at Newark International Airport.</p><p>I stood to stretch my legs and was nearly knocked to the floor by the impact of the first plane.</p><p>I heard a loud thud, followed by an explosion. The building felt like it swayed about 10 feet to the south. It shuddered back to the north, then shimmied back and forth.</p><p>Out the window I saw a parabola of flame fall towards the street, followed by a blizzard of paper and glass.</p><p>Then I heard two sounds: sirens on the street and phones ringing across the 68th floor - calls from reporters wondering what had happened.</p><p>I ran to the office of my department director, Kayla Bergeron.</p><p>Within a few minutes, we gathered the staff, threw files into our bags, and prepared to evacuate.</p><p>Ana Abelians, a member of our staff, said two media calls were holding. I replied: \"You get one, I'll get the other one, we'll get rid of them and get the hell out of here.\"</p><p>I picked up the phone. \"Greg Trevor here.\"</p><p>\"Hi, I'm with NBC national news. If you could hold on for about five minutes, we're going to put you on for a live interview.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry, I can't. We're evacuating the building.\"</p><p>\"But this will only take a minute.\"</p><p>\"I'm sorry, you don't understand. We're leaving the building right now.\"</p><p>He seemed stunned. \"But, but, this is NBC national news.\" (Apparently, I didn't have to risk my life for the local NBC affiliate, but no sacrifice was too great for the national news).</p><p>I said \"I'm sorry\" once more, then hung up.</p><p>For more than an hour, we joined thousands of other people who patiently descended the emergency stairwells.</p><p>All we knew was a plane had hit the building. It didn't make sense. How could a plane hit a 110-storey building on such a clear day?</p><p>I tried to call my wife, Allison, several times by cell phone, but couldn't get through.</p><p>Fortunately, I reached my colleague, Pasquale DiFulco, through my pager.</p><p>Pasquale, who was on vacation and was watching CNN, called Allison to let her know I was safe. He also used his pager to tell us what was really going on.</p><p>9:32am Pager message from Pasquale:</p><p>AA 676 from boston crashed into 1wtc. fbi reporting plane was hijacked moments before crash. saw second plane crash live on cnn into 2wtc. Bush just made announcement possible terrorist attck.</p><p>9:36am At least 1000 injuries - cnn.</p><p>9:41am Fire at the pentagon.</p><p>9:43am Message to Pasquale: Oh Christ.</p><p>9:43am Message from Pasquale: Pentagon and white house being evacuated.</p><p>9:46am Fire on mall in</p><p>washington.</p><p>9:49am Faa closes all flights nationwide.</p><p>9:52am Plane hit pentagon.</p><p>9:54am Capitol treasury also evacuated.</p><p>Despite this news, our long walk in search of safety remained calm and orderly.</p><p>Every few floors we would stop, move to the right of the stairwell and make room for injured people walking down - and firefighters and Port Authority Police officers running up.</p><p>Then we reached the fifth floor just before 10am. We heard a loud rumble. The building shook violently. I was thrown from one side of the stairwell to the other.</p><p>We didn't know it at the time, but the South Tower had just collapsed.</p><p>Our stairwell filled with smoke and concrete dust. Breathing became difficult. The lights died. A steady stream of water, about</p><p>four inches deep, began running down the stairs.</p><p>It was as if we were wading through a dark, rapid river - at night in the middle of a forest fire.</p><p>The smartest decision I made that day was to wear a tie. I put the blue tie over my nose and mouth to block the smoke and dust.</p><p>Someone yelled that we should put our right hand on the shoulder of the person in front of us and keep walking down.</p><p>We descended one more flight, to the fourth floor, when I heard someone say: \"Oh s-, the door's blocked.\"</p><p>The force from the collapse of the South Tower had jammed the emergency exit. We were ordered to head back up, to see if we could transfer to another stairwell.</p><p>Now we were wading against the current of that dark, dirty river. Others were still trying to walk down. People were starting to panic.</p><p>For the first time, I was afraid we wouldn't make it. I whispered a quick prayer: \"Lord, please let me see my family again.\"</p><p>I closed my eyes and made mental pictures of my family's faces: Allison's beautiful brown eyes; our five-year-old son Gabriel's deep blue eyes and dimples; our two-year-old son Lucas's blond ringlets.</p><p>I remember thinking: Their faces will keep me calm, and if I die, they will be the last thing on my mind.</p><p>During this ordeal, Pasquale sent me a series of frantic pager messages that did not get through.</p><p>10am Message from Pasquale: Please tel me u r ok Please respond. Another explosion at wtc.</p><p>10.02am Part of 2 wtc has</p><p>collapsed. Is evryone ok???</p><p>10:06am Plwesse repsond.</p><p>10:12am Where are you? 2 wtc just collapsed???</p><p>I don't know how many minutes it took for emergency workers to clear the exit.</p><p>But when they did, thank God police officer David Lim was there.</p><p>David is a K-9 officer whose partner, Sirius, was killed in the attacks. He was later trapped in the rubble for five hours.</p><p>David had the presence of mind to figure out a way to get us all turned around and headed back downstairs. Over and over, he shouted: \"Down is good! Down is good!\"</p><p>When I heard that, I shouted \"Down is good!\" up the stairwell. Like an echo, I heard others shout \"Down is good!\" up the line.</p><p>Now we darted down the stairs as quickly as possible.</p><p>The emergency exit led to the mezzanine level of the North Tower. We walked several hundred feet to a glass door that led outside.</p><p>The mezzanine was filled with concrete dust. It felt like we were walking through a huge, dirty snow globe that had just been shaken.</p><p>It was even worse when we walked outside.</p><p>The plaza was a minefield of twisted metal, covered by a layer of dust several inches thick. I am grateful for that dust, because it means I didn't see any bodies.</p><p>As we were leaving the building, my pager buzzed with a message from Al Frank, a reporter with the Newark Star-Ledger who has covered the Port Authority for years.</p><p>10.17am Message from Al Frank: are you okay?</p><p>I replied a minute later.</p><p>We're out of the building. Everyone is fine.</p><p>Relieved but fatigued, we sprinted up Church St and headed north.</p><p>I looked back. The upper third of the North Tower was on fire. There was so much dust, I couldn't tell the South Tower had collapsed.</p><p>It was then we heard an NYPD officer shout: \"Run for your lives!\"</p><p>We ran north for several blocks. We felt a deafening rumble, followed by a thick cloud of black smoke and brown dust.</p><p>When we finally out-raced the cloud, we had almost reached the Holland Tunnel. I was standing next to co-worker John Toth, who was limping with a bloody knee.</p><p>\"John, are you all right?\"</p><p>\"They're gone, Greg.\"</p><p>\"Who's gone, John?\"</p><p>\"Not who. Both towers, they're gone.\"</p><p>I didn't believe him. Then I looked back to where the twin towers should have been. All I saw was smoke and sky.</p><p>We walked the remaining blocks to the mouth of the Holland Tunnel. Military jets flew overhead.</p><p>Our clothes, hair and faces still covered with dust, we crammed into Port Authority Police cars, which took us to our temporary offices in Jersey City.</p><p>My personal recovery has been steady in the months that have followed.</p><p>Our department worked out of Jersey City for two months - at first, in rotating 12-hour shifts. As we mourn the loss of 75 friends and colleagues, we have answered the deluge of questions from media around the world - about security, the recovery and our own experiences.</p><p>I returned to Ground Zero four days after the attacks. The experience was unnerving and humbling. I looked up at the hole in the sky where our offices used to be and thought about how easily we could have been trapped up there.</p><p>I still feel waves of sadness, thinking about the loss and the suffering.</p><p>I think about the 37 Port Authority Police officers and commanders who died helping others escape - particularly Captain Kathy Mazza, the first woman Commandant of the Port Authority Police Academy.</p><p>She led a group of Police Academy instructors into the North Tower a few minutes after the first attack. Most didn't make it out.</p><p>Kathy, a former nurse and one of the finest people I've ever known, was the first female Port Authority Police officer in the department's 73-year history to be killed in the line of duty.</p><p>Sometimes when I'm walking down a street, I stop, take a deep breath of clean air and remember those frightful minutes when we were denied this pleasure.</p><p>My thighs ached for four days from the stairwell evacuation. My wife says my skin was dull gray for the first two days.</p><p>In mid-December, I was in bed for a week with pneumonia - a condition caused in part by the stress and exhaustion from September 11 and its aftermath.</p><p>Therapy has been very helpful. It has shown me that I am in the middle of a long journey. Some days I make a lot of progress; other days I stand still.</p><p>My goal is to get as far down the road as possible. But no matter how far I go, I know that there's no way I'll get back to September 10.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHS0209081N04526027</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYHERALDSUNLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46PH-YDB0-015G-T033-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1644\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Sunday Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>September 8, 2002, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>WORLD TRADE CENTRE MOSCOW JOINT STOCK CO\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>\u00a0WORLD TRADE CENTRE IN LONDON LTD\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926120GM</classCode><className>AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N922120QM</classCode><className>POLICE FORCES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X0L</classCode><className>PORT AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N541310MM</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DRLI</classCode><className>BUILDING COLLAPSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>ST0008ZF6</classCode><className>INTERVIEWS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N926120GM</classCode><className>AVIATION ADMINISTRATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0008X0L</classCode><className>PORT AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>N541310MM</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURAL SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>N488100CC</classCode><className>AIRPORTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST0008X6A</classCode><className>NETWORK TELEVISION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>GX622</classCode><className>NEWARK, NJ, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Stars Rob Lowe and James Spader Opens today at Hoyts cinemas ROB Lowe has complained that his private business should be just that. He was cranky about the huge fuss made over the videotape he shot of a sex session he had in 1988 with two women.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But just when you feel sorry for the schmuck he comes out with a movie which features guess what?- the videotaping of the hero having sex, and a later (gratuitous) shot of Lowe in bed with two women.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It makes you suspect that Lowe doesn't mind his private life being public entertainment, as long as there's something in it for him - like publicity.</p><p>Still, there's more to this movie than publicity. It's a thriller that starts easily, turns engrossingly nasty and then ends lamely.</p><p> Michael Boll (James Spader) is making a mint as a market analyst, and is attached to the standard blonde fiancee you know he won't end up marrying.She's one problem - the other is Patterson, a nasty rival at work.</p><p> Spader is just as annoyingly effective as he was in sex, lies and videotape in convincing you through his sighs and quick-dying smiles that this is a guy short of guts.</p><p> But one day he's rescued from a bar-room brawl by Alex (Rob Lowe), a sparkly-eyed nightclub sort who owns a naughty-boy smile.</p><p> He turns out to be a yuppie Mephistopheles to Boll's Faust. At first he just gives Boll spine to take the fight up to Patterson, and then helps him pick up a girl.</p><p> Then Alex's help gets more serious. Boll doesn't want to be married? - showing the fiancee's family a compromising video fixes that.Patterson? Alex fixes him up, too.</p><p> At first this sudden freedom - from the worry of pleasing people, from morality - intoxicates Boll.Alex has given Boll what he wants, with Boll barely questioning the shoddy means.</p><p> Then comes the horrible climax of the movie, a truly awful murder.But just when the movie gets down to bare knuckles, it starts to lose its punch.</p><p> From now on it's a hide-the-body kind of suspenser, with a conventional finish.</p><p> The earlier rotten behavior of superyuppie is excused, letting Boll off pretty lightly and leaving us only mildly satisfied.</p><p> Always (PGR) Directed by Steven Spielberg. Starring Richard Dreyfuss and Holly Hunter Opens today, Russell STEVEN Spielberg is probably as close to God as you can get in Hollywood. When you direct and/or produce seven of the top 20 grossing films of all time you won't find many people arguing with you.</p><p> Which may explain why his latest film as director, Always, has several miscalculations which make it less effective than it deserves to be. Has Spielberg got anyone who dares tell him when he's gone wrong?</p><p> But first the plot, borrowed from the Spencer Tracy war film A Guy Named Joe.</p><p> Pete (Richard Dreyfuss) is a pilot in a forest fire-fighting outfit.He's a daredevil, flying on instinct, which worries the heck out of his girlfriend, Dorinda (Holly Hunter).</p><p> But when it comes to telling Dorinda that he loves her, he's a coward. But wouldn't you know it, just when he's agreed to get a safer job and he's about to tell Dorinda he loves her, he gets called out to drop fire-retardant on another fire - and dies.</p><p> From then on he's an invisible spirit, charged with helping another - but goofier - fire-fighting flyer called Ted (Brad Johnson). When Pete speaks, his words pop into Ted's brain as if they were his own thoughts, his instinct. Trouble is, Ted is in love with Dorinda. He's the one that can break through her grief, but Pete the invisible spirit is having trouble letting his girl go. He can put ideas into Dorinda's mind, too, so being that close to the girl he loves drives him crazy.</p><p> It's sentimental, it's obvious. But it's good lump-in-the-throat stuff for all that.</p><p> This makes it even more frustrating when Spielberg makes some obvious miscalculations that ultimately make the film much weaker than it could have been.</p><p> For one, Brad Johnson, a tall and handsome rodeo cowboy, looks stunned by this chance to act in his first major film. This wooden Indian would never be able to fully take over Pete's role in Dorinda's life, which isn't the point of the movie at all.</p><p> Then there is Audrey Hepburn's appearance as a sort of angel who tells Pete to help his rival.The angel is called Hap, which sounds like Hep and only makes this angel seem like nothing so much as Audrey Hepburn herself, offering advice from the hereafter.</p><p> And lastly, there's a messy confusion in the plot, which has Ted determined to fly back to his unit to be with Dorinda, even though there's no way he could know she had just been signed up there.</p><p> Thanks to these flaws, you'll need just the one handkerchief.</p><p> The movie at least has some big effects which help make it better than, at heart, it is.</p><p> Nightbreed (M) Written and directed by Clive Barker. Stars David Cronenberg, Craig Sheffer, Anne Bobby Now showing at Hoyts CLIVE Barker has given us a horror story with a twist - it's the humans that give the shocks, and the beasties that turn out to be the victims.</p><p> Boone (Craig Sheffer) has nightmares of monsters at a place called Midian. He confesses them to his psychiatrist, Decker (David Cronenberg), who speaks in a weird monotone so that you know from the start he's up to no good. Decker convinces Boone (but not the audience by a long shot) that he is living out his sick fantasies by carving up the locals.</p><p> Eventually he manages to trick the police into killing the gullible Boone, but not until Decker has seen the monsters of his dreams.</p><p> Boone, of course, comes back to a form of life, and from then on he's in charge of protecting the monsters from the likes of Decker and a mad local police chief.</p><p> If you like a plot that sounds like this, you will like Nightbreed, because it's handsomely filmed and has an interesting parade of monsters. It also has a \"message\" - that if there's anything more frightening than a monster, it's what a human will do when he sees one.</p><p> The film finishes with a scene which quite clearly shows we are going to have to sit through another round of this.</p><p> Let's Get Lost (M) Directed and produced by Bruce Weber. Starring Chet Baker, his third wife and ex-girlfriends Now showing at the Kino THIS over-long black-and-white documentary started out as a tribute to one of the greatest jazz trumpeters, Chet Baker. Trouble is, as the film-makers follow the haggard wreck that was Chet Baker in 1987, the last year of his cruddy life, they find that the man is a liar, a wreck, a junkie, a ruined talent, a wife-beater, a sponger, and a father who turned his back on his children.</p><p> Baker's mother chats happily on camera about her son's huge talents, but she can barely stop from crying when she is asked if he is a disappointment to her.</p><p> At the end of the film, director Bruce Weber tells a spaced-out Baker on camera that seeing him has been a great disappointment to him, too. A year later Baker jumped out of a hotel window.</p><p> This mildly interesting film is less about Baker's life than it is about how a huge God-given talent can sometimes be stored in the ugliest of containers.</p><p> END OF STORY</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Chet Baker, one of the great jazz trumpeters</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERALDLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49M5-J4T0-01S8-D42T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1193\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Herald</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1990 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"04\" year=\"1990\"><dateText>April 12, 1990 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001182</classCode><className>MURDER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008WSQ</classCode><className>MOVIE REVENUES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A4UK</classCode><className>MOVIE RELEASE DATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>ST000DIFJ</classCode><className>NIGHTCLUBS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0008WSQ</classCode><className>MOVIE REVENUES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>PE000DKOL</classCode><className>ROB LOWE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>PE000DM6I</classCode><className>HOLLY HUNTER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>PE0009TQX</classCode><className>STEVEN SPIELBERG</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

If the fuel is carefully managed, it could be expected to average less than a quarter of the neglected fuels we currently suffer.</p><p> That means the fire intensity would be about one-sixteenth and the flame heights and rate of spread would be much less damaging. These are facts of physics.</p><p> During the time we were developing prescribed burning from aircraft, I asked all the forest fire controllers in Australia what the minimum area that must be prescribed burnt to achieve a healthy forest.</p><p> The answers were between 10 and 20 per cent. The 1.05 per cent that was burnt would, as Mark Stone said, have made no difference.</p><p> The decision to token-burn is really a decision to replace frequent mild fire with an infrequent intense fire, with much different results.</p><p> We have been warned yet again by the Gippsland fires of what destruction to forest health, water supplies, the timber industry and rural production can result from this neglect of our dry, fire-loving forests.</p><p> I hope we do not have to wait until Melbourne's forests, population and water supplies are destroyed before we seek an effective forest fuel policy.</p><p>David Packham,</p><p>Traralgon</p><p>Sheer luck, not firebreaks</p><p>I HAVE seen for myself the massive devastation from the bushfires in the Omeo region and beyond.</p><p> I have watched video footage of the fires as they swooped through open grazing land; smelled the stench of the hundreds of stock and wildlife still waiting to be buried; stared at their exploded bodies from the intensity of the heat of the blaze.</p><p> How can Joan Webster (WT, Feb 26) even suggest 20m firebreaks prepared around haystacks?</p><p> These fires jumped 500m breaks and fence posts were burnt so completely that the hole was ready for a new post.</p><p> Some 87 bulldozers worked for three weeks, day and night, putting in firebreaks, yet each one of them was \"jumped\".</p><p> No matter how prepared you were, the only survival hope for this particular \"red beast\" was sheer luck.</p><p> Not many people had it.</p><p>Dianne Carroll,</p><p>Yarragon</p><p>Put a lid on all this silly talk</p><p>SO the Victorian Government is still serious about charging for the rain that falls on farmers' land that fills the dams they have paid for.</p><p> Farmers, tell them you don't want rain to fall on your land under those conditions.</p><p> Make them put a roof over you or drop this idiotic idea.</p><p>David Stuart,</p><p>Dromana</p><p>Windmill now a safer option</p><p>I WISH to reply to criticism of the windmill safety platform I built (WT, Feb 19).</p><p> First, the platform weighs about 145kg -- the same as a couple of average-sized men.</p><p> Mr Wallace (WT, Feb 26) is concerned that it should be able to support much more than that. However, the other consideration is wind load, as the platform is edge-on to the wind.</p><p> It has made things much easier and safer for me.</p><p> Mr Barkla (WT, Mar 12), however, has completely missed the point.</p><p> When I am working on the original working platform, I have the comforting knowledge that if I slip I will hit the safety platform, not the ground.</p><p> Two more points: first, the gap in the safety platform has a lid; secondly, the photo was taken on a perfectly still day and the person was only in it to show proportion.</p><p> Two years ago, a storm damaged the tail. I was able to remove the tail, lower it to the ground, repair it and replace it on the windmill without the aid of a set of rope blocks.</p><p> I did this job in about six hours by myself. I was 70 years old at the time.</p><p> Another advantage is that tools can be lifted without them getting tangled in the steelwork of the tower.</p><p> I can access the platform, either by the original steps on the mill post to the inside, or by an outside ladder concreted to the ground at its base.</p><p> Having a safety platform doesn't mean you can throw away your safety harness -- one complements the other.</p><p> With our windmill, which is a 3m Alston on a 10m tower, I was able to put the platform less than a metre below the original working platform.</p><p> As the safety platform is two metres square, the wheel size affects that distance.</p><p> My only experience in this field is with our own mill, which we erected 18 years ago.</p><p> I have no formal qualifications, but I have worked with steel most of my life and have absolute confidence in our mill.</p><p>Jim Bennett,</p><p>Yea</p><p>Rain dance hit a raw nerve</p><p>HEARTY congratulations to every woman who took time out to attend the Ouyen rain dance.</p><p> Thanks, too, to the Ouyen committee and those who helped make the event happen.</p><p> Thanks to Helen Healy, the event's manager, and to Lyn Healy, for uttering the first words that set the whole thing alight.</p><p>Deborah Pezet,</p><p>Wistow, SA</p><p>Separate the single desk</p><p>TWO things are clear following AWB Ltd's round of pre-AGM forums.</p><p> First, it is not prepared to entertain debate on Australia's grain marketing arrangements and, secondly, it will not relinquish the single desk.</p><p> AWB Ltd's hypocrisy during these meetings has been insulting to growers.</p><p> The examples I bring are:</p><p> Andrew Lindberg's claim that the commissioning parties of the Kronos and Accenture reports have a vested interest in changes to the single desk.</p><p> AWB Ltd's continued and tiresome repetition that these organisations seek the end of the single desk. (As if AWB Ltd doesn't have the strongest vested interest in maintaining the status quo!)</p><p> Can AWB Ltd point to any sentence of the Kronos report that calls for an end to single-desk arrangements?</p><p> It cannot, because it says nothing about it.</p><p> The Grain Growers Association, which commissioned the Accenture report, has also explicitly supported the single desk in its own documentation.</p><p> The reports instead recommend changes to improve grower returns -- again, AWB Ltd has not attempted to refute this.</p><p> An important step in achieving these changes is separating the single desk from AWB Ltd and any other commercial interests. There are valid models for an independent single desk. It is the key to improving grower returns and industry efficiency through greater competition.</p><p> If AWB Ltd is truly operating the supply chain at the lowest possible cost, an open market should hold no fears for it.</p><p> AWB Ltd's reluctance to even entertain debate on the proposal prompts the question: what does it have to fear from competing to provide services to an independent single desk?</p><p> Another question AWB Ltd needs to answer is that, if growers want an independent single desk, will AWB Ltd give it back to them?</p><p> AWB Ltd needs to be part of the debate rather than ignoring the fact that it is occurring all over Australia.</p><p>Sue Rana,</p><p>executive officer,</p><p>United Grower Holdings Ltd</p><p>Time to stop the rhetoric</p><p>RECENTLY, I attended one of the AWB Ltd grower meetings, at Young in NSW.</p><p> It did not take long for many of those in attendance to be reminded that, indeed, the old Australian Wheat Board is definitely dead and buried. Unfortunately, for those growers left in the wheat industry, in its place is the new corporate structure, AWB Ltd.</p><p> Had I known this meeting was to be the most staged, controlled propaganda event I have ever witnessed, I would have done what most other growers did and stayed at home.</p><p> Constructive debate with farmers angry over AWB Ltd's management of the single desk was not allowed.</p><p> Nor was the exploration of grower problems in the local area (as was advertised).</p><p> An interesting statement at the meeting from chief executive officer Andrew Lindberg was that the new corporate structure is possibly costing wheat growers $9.33 a tonne more than when the single desk was controlled by the Australian Wheat Board.</p><p> Saying that it's just the way it has to happen may be music to your ears if you are an AWB Ltd shareholder living in Toorak, but not so good if you are a pool participant living in the wheat belt.</p><p> If Andrew and AWB chairman Brendan Stewart are fair dinkum about increasing grower returns, they should stop the rhetoric and open up the supply chain to the national pool.</p><p> That way, pool services could be satisfied by the cheapest qualified supplier.</p><p>Grant Holland,</p><p>Grenfell, NSW</p><p>The cedars of Dartmoor</p><p>YOUR story on the Dartmoor tree sculptures (WT, Feb 19) called the trees western cypress.</p><p> In fact, they are not cypresses (family Cupressaceae), but true northern hemisphere cedars (family Pinaceae).</p><p> It's confusing: among the several genera of the Cupressaceae some are called cypresses and some cedars.</p><p> But none of the species of the genus Cedrus, true cedars, are ever called cypresses.</p><p> The trees at Dartmoor have the characteristic upright, barrel-shaped female cones of the genus Cedrus.</p><p> They are almost certainly either the deodar (Himalayan cedar), Cedrus deodara, or the Atlas cedar, Cedrus atlantica, of the north African coast.</p><p>Peter Tyler,</p><p>Illowa</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WKT0303191016877015</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WEEKLYTIMESLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:485D-J3G0-015G-V4HG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1962\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Weekly Times (Australia )</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Nationwide News Pty Limited  All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>March 19, 2003 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX000621</classCode><className>GENETICALLY MODIFIED CROPS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F8W</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL BIOTECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000186</classCode><className>BIOTECHNOLOGY &amp;

The Biggest Horse in the World had been no bigger than an English shire. And the Biggest Alligator was a submerged brown lump that could have been, and quite possibly was, dead. So far, the attractions at the Central Washington State Fair _ an odd mixture of carnival, fun fair and agricultural show _ had been distinctly underwhelming.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But then I pushed open the flap of the steer tent and found myself confronted by this enormous thing _ as big as a bus, with horns like trees. The steer was several metres high, and it towered over me. I felt like a character in a Disney fantasy gone wrong. The animal kept lunging its horns around, one massive hoof pawing the dirt. It was, naturally, a very small tent _ and the only way out was past the steer. I managed it in a single, heart-stopping lunge, bursting into the sunlight with relief. The ticket taker laughed as I reeled away.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I needed a drink, but this was hard to get. In the beer tent, a strange man with eyes many centimetres apart asked what I wanted.</p><p>\"What beers do you have?\" \"Depends. What you want?\" \"Well, what have you got?\" \"Depends. What do you want?\" Dear God, I thought, we're going to be here all day. I also thought: there's no getting away from it; that steer, this place, these people are weird.</p><p>For respite, we drove out of Seattle on the Cascade Loop, the scenic highway that circles Washington State _ the small, diverse pocket of land between California and Canada with microclimates that sustain snow-capped mountains and lush vineyards; semi-dessert, scrubland, even an equatorial rain forest.</p><p>Seattle, the capital, is also a mixture; a rough-and-ready port that has recently succumbed to (some) gentrification. It speaks volumes about Seattle that two of its most illustrious residents should be yuppie computer wunderkind Bill Gates and eccentric cartoonist Gary (`The Far Side') Larson. The place attracts odd characters of all kinds. Ferries honk and moan in mist-filled Puget Sound; Mount Ranier stands like a sentinel a few kilometres from town.</p><p>The term \"Skid Row\" was coined in Seattle, and the city is still famous for its beer and bars. Also for the inhabitants, bums included.</p><p>The downtown panhandlers approach you directly, requiring eye contact, demurring politely if money is refused.</p><p>Jimi Hendrix was another native of Seattle, and the city has some great music bars. At the Central Bar in Pioneer Square, a grossly overweight guitarist called Fat Jake was belting out `I Jus' Wanna Make Love To You', with maximum sleaze hanging on every word. Given Jake's appearance, I would have thought the song an unwise vehicle for his talents, but Jake, like his audience, evidently didn't give a damn. Seattle is that kind of place.</p><p>To the north east the road winds up into the Cascades, a dazzlingly pretty range of mountains, dotted with small lakes of milky glacial blue. We passed quintessential American small towns with names like Concrete and Marblemount; at Winthrop a hand-written sign next to the cash register read \"No out-of-town checks.\" Just up the road was the Sun Valley Lodge, a resort with spectacular views over the mountains.</p><p>We took an outside jacuzzi, warm despite the howling gale, and rode mountain bikes down impossible gradients, yodelling.</p><p>Heading south down Route 97 the landscape underwent a costume change, becoming flatter, dustier and drier. Indeed, we could see a small forest fire in the distance, and then, almost unbelievably, we hit a sandstorm. The harsh beige particles whipped against the car windows, but the engine, mercifully, kept going. Ten minutes later we were back in bright blue sunshine again; and all this in the space of 50 kilometres.</p><p>We arrived in Yakima just as the State Fair was getting under way.</p><p>After my experiences with the steer, I needed some alternative entertainment, and I found it in the substantial form of country singer Wynona Judd, performing live to an open-air audience. Wynona is one of those rhinestone-clad Country women who Take No Nonsense from Men. Her band had an Aramani-clad guitarist, with whom Wynona flirted outrageously. \"Life's too short\", she told the audience, \"to waste time working with ugly men.\" Cheers all around.</p><p>The next day was the day of the Yakima Sunfair parade.</p><p>These parades are really a celebration of American middle-class values, a ritual reassurance that all is still well in the Land of the Free. So first there's a riding display by the local motorcycle cops; followed by the appearance of the doe-eyed beauty queen and her acolytes; then floats from local businesses (Big Bob's Hardware Store _ You Can't buy Better!); finally a few civic dignitaries and the odd politician cadging votes. What's actually on \"parade\" is the town itself.</p><p>Heading north-west, we followed the fast-flowing Yakima river through kilometre after kilometre of bare basalt, grey like a moonscape. Not a house or a tree in sight _ and yet not far south they make excellent local wine. At Roslyn the rain came down in torrents, and we stopped for lunch at the Brick Tavern, the oldest working tavern in the state.</p><p>A good American bar is the best bar in the world. The Brick had an old mahogany counter imported from England in the 19th Century. There was a wide range of beer; pool tables; a shuffle board; three silent televisions tuned to the football game; and a good jukebox. Locals came in out of the rain, shaking themselves like dogs. We spent two hours in the Brick without realising it.</p><p>Outside it was still raining, and we toiled up towards Snoqualmie Pass through thickening mist. When we emerged on the other side, the rain let up long enough to show that this really was `Twin Peaks' country; a landscape of brooding, cloud-topped mountains; wooden houses; logging trucks; with a small railroad running next to the highway.</p><p>Finally we pulled off the Interstate and drove down a deserted country road into the town of North Bend _ `Twin Peaks' itself.</p><p>There's usually something corny about tracking down location sites, but not in this case. With or without the TV series, North Bend would be marvellous. Mount Si's eponymous twin peaks stand over the town, lost in cloud. North Bend itself is a tiny grid of one and two- storeyed houses. On Main Street, pick-up trucks stand parked outside hunting stores; men in checked shirts jump down from diesel trucks and dash indoors out of the rain. In North Bend there is only one place to dash into, and that's the Mar-T cafe _ also known to `Twin Peaks' aficionados as the \"Double-R Diner\".</p><p>The owner of the Double R (sorry, the Mar-T) is Pat Cokewell, a former head waitress there. One day in 1989 a location scout arrived on Pat's doorstep and announced that director David Lynch (of whom Pat had never heard) was considering using the town and her diner in his forthcoming TV series. Two weeks later the scout was back with good news, and Twin Peaks (sorry, North Bend) was never the same again.</p><p>Or so you might think. In fact, the remarkable thing is how little North Bend has changed. More than that, David Lynch actually drew on the character of the town itself _ improvising scripts to include the locals, switching locations at their suggestion, taking details from the town and adding them to his story. `Twin Peaks' grew out of North Bend, not the other way round.</p><p>The Mar-T still has the leatherette stools and strip lighting it has had for 30 years. A signed photo of Special Agent Dale Cooper, alias actor Kyle MacLachlan (himself a local boy, from Yakima) is the only evidence of the series. Pat, a friendly woman in her 40s, has had to increase her production of Agent Cooper's favorite cherry pie (another Mar-T original, co-opted into the `Twin Peaks' story by Lynch) 20 times over; and once a year the town hosts a `Twin Peaks' festival, with the first prize of dinner at the cafe.</p><p>Otherwise, she has made no concession to the diner's new-found fame.</p><p>In the town itself, too, the only sign of showbiz silliness is the `Twin Peaks log' on sale at the souvenir shop for a costly $US7.50 ($A11).</p><p>Over at the Double-R though (sorry, the Mar-T), Pat has refused to put up her prices. The diner's breakfast special, a gargantuan plate of eggs, hash browns, sausages and beans for a mere $US3.50 ($A5), must be one of the cheapest meals in Washington State. Coffee, naturally, is included. Oh; and it's damn fine coffee, too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P7G-XXT0-TXN5-S1R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yhoz04627suwkpzfd9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1992</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1426\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1992 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"1992\"><dateText>December 5, 1992 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000068</classCode><className>ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001695</classCode><className>CIRCUSES &amp; CARNIVALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DLBO</classCode><className>CARTOONS &amp; COMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><classCode>GX518</classCode><className>SEATTLE, WA, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><classCode>GS163</classCode><className>WASHINGTON, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS120</classCode><className>CALIFORNIA, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Angus Sly is checking traps to see if he's caught a particularly aggressive intruder.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Angus Sly</emphasis>: This is one of our traps, so the mosquitoes at night will be attracted to the carbon dioxide, come in closer, be attracted to the light, and as they come in towards the light the fan will suck them into this holding container.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: This trap is designed to mimic human breathing. It expels carbon dioxide, and the fan circulates the air. To a mosquito looking for a blood meal, this trap acts just like its prey, and that's us.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Angus Sly</emphasis>: As you can see, we got a few mosquitoes last night.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: A hundred or so in there by the look of it. What sort of species do you think they might be, those ones?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Angus Sly</emphasis>: Having a quick look at them there's a few <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes vigilax</emphasis> which is a salt marsh mosquito. It's a bit hard to see in the light.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: No <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Angus Sly</emphasis>: I hope not.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis> is also called the Asian tiger mosquito, and no one wants to see it in these traps. It's one of the world's most invasive pests, a vicious biter that researchers are calling 'the barbecue stopper'.</p><p>\u00c2 The Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has sentinel traps at 84 ports around Australia, and it's on high alert for the barbecue stopper. Angus Sly says once every couple of months one or two of these mozzies are caught flying around a port.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Angus Sly</emphasis>: Darwin has predominantly been the location where we've been getting most of our detections. Each year we seem to be getting at least one or two, sometimes up to four or five in Darwin alone, and our most recent exotic detection was in Cairns at the port there. That was in March this year.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Several arrived in Townsville in a cargo of tyres. Others were spotted in a greenhouse in Melbourne. The Asian tiger mosquito has been spreading through Africa, Europe, the Americas and the Pacific. Its next stop is Australia, and if it slips past this thin line of traps, it could soon be stopping barbecues here. It could also start spreading viruses. At the moment it's helping a nasty virus called chikungunya sweep across the arc of countries to Australia's north.</p><p>Hello, I'm Ian Townsend, and welcome to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Background Briefing</emphasis>.</p><p>The chikungunya virus and the Asian tiger mosquito are a match made in hell, and they're knocking on our door. Increasingly, tourists returning from holidays in places like Bali and Malaysia are bringing the virus home with them. Barbara Rogers came home from Bali three months ago feeling very sick.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barbara Rogers</emphasis>: And I had this bluish-red rash all over me. And it was on my legs and my body and my joints. My ankles were swollen, my wrists were swollen, my elbows, and at that time my hips. And it's like someone has thrown a hand grenade into a very healthy body and walked away to leave me to deal with it. It's bone shattering; that you feel like every bone in your body is broken. You can't take anything. I mean, every four hours I was on Panadol and Nurofen and it didn't even touch the surface of the pain. I mean, if there'd been a box I would have put myself in it at some stage.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Cases like this have become more common in the past six months. Barbara Rogers-or Barbie Rogers as she was known when co-host of the '70s TV quiz show, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Great Temptation</emphasis>-is one of more than 70 people known to have brought chikungunya back since January.</p><p>There's no vaccine or cure for chikungunya. Looking for drugs to treat it is Andreas Suhrbier from the Queensland Institute of Medical Research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andreas Suhrbier</emphasis>: Chikungunya is a Makonde word, that's a native language of Tanzania. If you stand up and try to scrunch yourself into a foetal position with all your joints in your body bent forward, that's what it describes, 'he who is bent up' or 'that which is bent up'. That describes the posture of somebody with chikungunya disease. All their joints hurt so much they're tottering along with all their joints clenched up in a sort of foetal ball. So, yes, not at all pleasant.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Eight years ago this unpleasant disease from Africa met up with that aggressive mosquito from Asia on an island in the Indian Ocean. The chikungunya virus mutated inside the mosquito, and the pair has been on a rampage around the globe ever since.</p><p>At QIMR is Jonathan Darbro who studies mosquito biology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathan Darbro</emphasis>: One amino acid changed into another one, two carbon atoms to be precise, and now it spreads through this <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis> mosquito quite well. And it's a mosquito from south Asia that happened to be in Africa, and this duo then swept through Europe, and so it's globalisation at its finest. So viruses change and people are moving around more and so you're going to get all these new interactions of insects and viruses or just new viruses that you haven't seen before. So I think we'll probably see a few more surprises down the line.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Two years after that surprising mutation in 2005 there was an unprecedented outbreak in Italy. Chikungunya has infected millions of people across India and Asia, and there are now outbreaks in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands. Last week a state of calamity was declared in a town in the Philippines. The Philippines media is reporting spot fires of chikungunya across the country, mixed up with dengue. It's all a bit confusing because it's happening so fast. Dengue and chikungunya start out with similar symptoms; a rash, high fever, aches and pains. The same mosquito can spread them both at the same time. Dengue can kill, but chikungunya causes a debilitating arthritis that can linger for months.</p><p>In Papua New Guinea tens of thousands of people are infected. The PNG Institute of Medical Research is in the Highlands town of Goroka, and its head of environmental and emerging diseases is Paul Horwood.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Horwood</emphasis>: The outbreak here started about three or four months ago towards the start of the year and we're still getting a lot of cases here at the moment. There's still a lot of people present at hospital because they're very concerned that these symptoms they feel, especially the arthritis can be very, very painful and people get very worried. And the hospital really was being overwhelmed by these cases of chikungunya.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: What's it like at the moment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Horwood</emphasis>: We're still getting a lot of cases. At the moment we don't have enough data to be absolutely sure that we are seeing a decline in cases.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: It's a growing health risk for travellers, but most people heading overseas have never heard of this virus.</p><p>The director of infectious disease at the Austin Hospital in Melbourne is Professor Lindsay Grayson.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lindsay Grayson</emphasis>: Every second day now on the internet we have an alert system for any outbreaks around the world, and it's very clear that the sites where chikungunya is increasing is changing very quickly.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: For years, Bali has been a popular holiday spot for Australians and this is where a lot of people are being bitten by mosquitoes and bringing viruses back. Cases of dengue have been rising, but chikungunya is accelerating.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lindsay Grayson</emphasis>: We're looking at any of these diseases where they have a relatively short incubation time that fits in with the flight patterns of travellers, and so for things which have this sort of six to ten day incubation period or even a bit shorter, this is the perfect thing where someone's away for a week, they come back, they're home in six to eight hours from Bali for instance, and then they're presenting a week later with this illness. So it's an important consideration for everyone, particularly GPs, and they now have to think...when they've got a fever in a returned traveller from one of these areas, not only to think of malaria, because that's the thing that can kill you overnight, but also dengue and, to add to that now, chikungunya.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: The trouble is, it's not on the radar of most Australian doctors.</p><p>Barbara Rogers got sick in Bali in March, and a doctor there diagnosed chikungunya. When she came back to Australia, the pain was so bad she went to hospital and told them she had chikungunya, but the doctors who treated her hadn't heard of the disease.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Barbara Rogers</emphasis>: I was in overnight and they did all these tests and they kept coming back to me and saying, 'We can't find anything, we can't find anything, so we'll give you painkillers, painkillers.' Then it got worse and four days later I collapsed paralysed down the left side, and they rushed me into emergency again. And I took a photocopy of the doctor's thing saying what it was. Anyhow, it was interesting because I would say nine out of the ten doctors that came to see me had never heard the word before. Now, wouldn't you have thought they would have either got in touch with Bali or the doctor in Bali or infectious diseases? But they didn't even attempt to do that. I was in for 11 days. And a couple doctors came back to me and they Googled it and they said, 'We've never heard of it before.'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Background Briefing</emphasis> contacted a number of people who've come back to Australia seriously ill with chikungunya, and they all have a similar story; their doctors hadn't heard of it.</p><p>Here's Lindsay Grayson from the Austin Hospital in Melbourne:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lindsay Grayson</emphasis>: That's an important point because particularly if you think of the huge number of people that come back from Bali or Malaysia where chikungunya now is increasingly being reported, or India, there's an important lesson here because GPs previously, a patient who wasn't sick enough to go to hospital they would just do dengue serology. Well, of course that'll come back negative, so it's important that they think to order both tests.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Is there a chance that if it comes back negative for dengue, they're not quite sure what it is, the patient might be over their fever and rash, that they be sent home? Is there a chance that some cases aren't being diagnosed?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Lindsay Grayson</emphasis>: You know, I'm sure that's true, that some aren't being diagnosed. The question is does it really matter? Well, it does because it's always an important part of getting over these illnesses because usually these people are pretty sick by the time we see them in hospital. It's good for them to know, well, actually what you have is chikungunya.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Chikungunya rarely kills, but it can put people out of action for months. They can have trouble typing, sitting, lifting, driving, holding a phone. It can be an economic disaster for families and even entire communities. That's what's been happening overseas.</p><p>Professor Donald Shepard is a health economist at Brandeis University near Boston, and he's speaking via Skype.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald Shepard</emphasis>: We studied dengue in other poorer communities such as Cambodia where people, if they were sick they had to pay out of pocket for treatment, and the burden was quite substantial, pushing people in debt, forcing them to sell livestock and other major assets. And I would expect chikungunya particularly in a poorer community to have very similar devastating impacts.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: That's what's happening in Papua New Guinea, as chikungunya spreads and a silent disaster unfolds.</p><p>Paul Horwood from the PNG Institute of Medical Research:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Horwood</emphasis>: A lot of these people are really on the borderline of being very, very poor and being able to feed their families and put food on the table, and having something like this can really tip them over the edge.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Paul Horwood's based in the highlands town of Goroka, which has a daytime temperature of about 25 degrees all year round. It didn't have many mosquitoes and rarely saw mosquito-borne diseases, until the arrival of the Asian tiger mosquito. Now Paul Horwood is seeing people in the streets crippled with chikungunya.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paul Horwood</emphasis>: It's quite amazing, these arthritic symptoms that you see. You see people that are only 25 years of age walking around on a stick and limping on a stick because they can't walk properly, and it really has had a very large impact, particularly in our workforce, people turning up to work and not being able to walk properly and things like that. So it certainly has had a large impact on the country and also the workforce.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: The strain of chikungunya that mutated in 2005 spreads with alarming speed.</p><p>At the University of Queensland, Nigel Beebe studies mosquito evolution.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nigel Beebe</emphasis>: And that virus, the chikungunya virus that actually moves through <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis> quite quickly, we call it quick chik, and it is actually now moving around the world, and this is what's moving through Papua New Guinea at the moment. So we again should be extremely aware of this because it's quite likely we'll be seeing it in the Torres Strait islands.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: It's the speed of quick chik, combined with the aggressive daytime biting habits of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis>, that's making health authorities in North Queensland very, very nervous.</p><p>When chikungunya broke out on Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean, 270,000 people-nearly a third of the population-got sick. There were 45,000 cases in just one week. Deaths from the virus are considered rare, but several hundred people died in that outbreak.</p><p>As we heard, the Asian tiger mosquito, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis>, is already in Australia, in the Torres Strait, but hasn't yet established itself on the mainland. There's another good vector of chikungunya already in North Queensland, around Cairns. A cousin of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis> called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes aegypti</emphasis> is responsible for a rolling outbreak of dengue.</p><p>Health authorities in Cairns have been on alert for chikungunya since two people with the virus came back from New Guinea in April. The concern isn't just for public health but what an outbreak might do to the local economy.</p><p>Chikungunya researcher Andreas Suhrbier:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andreas Suhrbier</emphasis>: If we get an outbreak here, even a reasonably small one, the tourist cost could be very large indeed. We've seen with SARS in places like Hong Kong, the damage there was really not so much clinical; the damage was to the tourist industry. Foot and mouth disease outbreak in England, yes big damage to agriculture, but the cost to tourism turned out to be much, much larger. So yes, keeping on top of these things and being prepared and controlling them quickly and efficiently is very important for your economy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: It's not just a threat to Australia's top end. The Asian tiger mosquito would be right at home in Melbourne. It likes temperate climates and its eggs can survive frost.</p><p>In Brisbane there is already a colony of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis>, but it's in a secure lab at Queensland Health. The entomologist studying the Asian tiger mosquito for Queensland Health is Andrew van den Hurk.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew van den Hurk</emphasis>: You know, one of the things with <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis> is that it has this amazing capacity, once it gets into a given location it will just spread, you know, human assisted transport, and has the potential to go down as far south as Sydney and Melbourne. And we've been doing experiments with the actual mosquito itself in the Torres Strait; could it actually survive in Sydney or Melbourne? And our experiments suggest that it could.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Asian tiger mosquitoes were found flying around a greenhouse in Melbourne last year. They'd come in from China with lucky bamboo, an indoor plant that grows in jars of water, and had somehow survived three levels of treatment, including fumigation. The mosquito invades countries by stealth, and wherever it goes, from Chicago to Rome, it changes people's behaviour.</p><p>Greg Devine is the head of entomology at the Cairns Public Health Unit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Devine</emphasis>: Interestingly in my own experience in working with colleagues in Rome where they have had incursions of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis> is now very well established in that city which is about a similar climate to Sydney, it has changed the way the people live their lives. I mean, obviously Italians are very used to an outdoor lifestyle, but it has actually changed the numbers of people going through the gates at the botanical gardens and the local cemetery, and all the places that they used to traditionally go on a Sunday are now far less visited because they just haven't had this kind of thing that comes and bites your hands and your face and annoys your kids at one o'clock in the afternoon, that's not a mosquito they've ever been exposed to before. So it really will change people's behaviour.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: People talk about being chased by this aggressive mosquito. When she became sick with chikungunya, Topaz Conway was on holidays in Malaysia.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Topaz Conway</emphasis>: I do remember the culprit because I happened to walk into this part of the forest just in back of the huts where there was a pile of rubbish from the resort where I was staying, and I was standing near that looking at a particular flower on a tree I think it was and suddenly felt like I was getting attacked by an army of mosquitoes and I ran and they literally chased me back to my hut</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Before she fell ill two months ago, author Laura Jean McKay recalls the biting mosquitoes in Bali.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laura Jean McKay</emphasis>: Because I've lived in Southeast Asia a fair bit I'm fairly good with repellent, however I was bitten through clothes.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Do you think they might have got you through the clothes because you had plenty of repellent on exposed parts?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laura Jean McKay</emphasis>: Yes, that's right, I usually put the DEET around my ankles and wrists and the exposed areas but I had a lot of...a few bites on my upper thigh through the sarong or the skirt I was wearing, so I think that's probably where it came from.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: In the US, the Asian tiger mosquito has spread right up the east coast, and is well established in New Jersey. In summer this mosquito can hold people hostage inside their homes.</p><p>Studying the mosquito behaviour is health economist Donald Shepard from Brandeis University in Boston.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald Shepard</emphasis>: The kind of people that would enjoy having a barbecue or sitting in their backyard relaxing or playing with their children, it's limited by this mosquito. So even when there's not a disease that's transmitted by it, which is so far the case in this part of the USA, there's still a burden from this mosquito.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: The more people complain about this annoying mosquito, the more money local governments have to spend trying to control it. Professor Shepard's been looking at the cost benefit of all that expensive spraying. He's asked people in New Jersey how much they're prepared to pay to have one mosquito-free hour back outside in the garden.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald Shepard</emphasis>: They valued those hours at $10.88 per hour. So when you do the math and extrapolate that up it amounted to $291 per person over one season, the monetary value that people would put on being free of this nuisance mosquito.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: How did they come to that particular figure of $10.88?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald Shepard</emphasis>: We used a technique in economics called 'willingness to pay'. We asked people to hypothesise a price for one mosquito-free hour and asked if people would be willing to pay that much, and if they said yes, then through a kind of auction process the amount was raised until one reached statistically the maximum amount that somebody was willing to pay. And the average over this sample turned out to be $10.88 cents.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: That's $10.88 that each household is willing to pay for one mosquito-free hour. If you think of a city with 100,000 people, that's a million dollars for one hour in the backyard. Mosquito control doesn't cost that much, so a fogging campaign in this case is considered value for money.</p><p>Professor Shepard says because the Asian tiger mosquito has such a high economic cost, both as a nuisance and a disease carrier, it's well worth planning ahead for its arrival, much as people might plan ahead for a bushfire season.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Donald Shepard</emphasis>: When we try to take precautions to reduce the risk of a forest fire knowing its devastating cost, in the same way by taking precautions on minimising the kind of environments that promote mosquitoes, we reduce the risk that we have an outbreak that, like a fire, can be costly in terms of monetary cost, in terms of human cost.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: In Queensland, local councils already spend about $10 million a year to control nuisance mosquitoes. That doesn't include the costs of fighting dengue in Cairns, or combating the Asian tiger mosquito in the Torres Strait.</p><p>Greg Devine from the Cairns Public Health Unit:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Devine</emphasis>: And so one of the things that we're looking at in the near future is to get a proper cost benefit analysis of the problem so we can at least then go to state and federal governments and the local councils and say, look, this is what it will actually cost if it becomes a major problem on the mainland. And with that kind of information behind us then it's much easier to go and then ask for further funding.</p><p>The other thing of course is the threat of an actual disease outbreak itself. At the moment <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis> in the Torres is a nuisance issue and not a public health one because so far it hasn't vectored any disease that we know of, but it's very likely that in the future it will, and of course as soon as you actually have a real public health problem then people's wallets tend to yawn open a little wider.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Outbreaks of chikungunya come with a high medical cost and lots of lost work hours, and there's a big social cost too.</p><p>The director of the World Health Organisation's collaborative centre for arbovirus research is John Aaskov, who's also a virologist at the Queensland University of Technology.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Aaskov</emphasis>: I think even more than the economic side is the social side. The disease is most common in the sort of 20 to 45 age group and that's your childbearing age group. Now, if you're a mum and you're working part-time and you've got young kids and you can't open the fridge door and you can't turn a tap and you can't undo the Velcro on the shoes and all this sort of stuff, your life is slower, it's more painful and you've not got anything that you can show anybody to elicit sympathy, you know, you don't get big swollen joints or something. And you find that when you have sore joints you lose mobility and muscle tone, so then anything you do tires you more quickly, so then you stop doing things anyway. And so you get this spiral of loss of fitness and depression and whatever else, and, you know, it's really hard to put a value on some mum trying to manage her household tasks in semi-constant pain, I don't know how you put a dollar value on that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: As John Aaskov says, it's people in their prime who are the hardest hit; people like Laura Jean McKay, who's 35 years old.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laura Jean McKay</emphasis>: I did meet up with my 91-year-old grandmother, who is doing very well, but she does have arthritis, and we met up yesterday for a cup of tea and we were both walking in a very similar way. She's 91, and we had the same gait as we walked along.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: This is why it's important that chikungunya is accurately diagnosed. It can cause arthritic pain for months. People and their employers need to know why they're sick, and that they will eventually get better.</p><p>Laura Jean McKay is an author, and still has trouble typing. She developed a fever at a writers' festival in Bali in May and was told she had dengue. On the flight home she had a rash as bright as sunburn and swollen hands and feet.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laura Jean McKay</emphasis>: So when I came back to Australia I went to a GP who again tested for dengue and it came up negative. And then I went to the infectious diseases ward in Melbourne and they proceeded to do a series of tests, again they diagnosed dengue, and I think that was really just so I could start treating it. But with a bit of Facebook research actually, other friends who'd lived in tropical countries suggested chikungunya, and eventually the infectious diseases unit also diagnosed it as that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: So a friend on Facebook recognised your full-body rash?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laura Jean McKay</emphasis>: Yes, I put up a photograph of this amazing rash and a friend on Facebook said looks like a dengue rash but it also could be chikungunya, and that was the first time I'd ever heard of this, and also I think the first time my GP had ever heard of this. So it's not something that's widely known. In fact a lot of people refer to it as 'chicken dinner' because it's hard to pronounce.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Two days after being bitten and chased by mosquitoes in Malaysia, Topaz Conway came down with a high fever, a rash and aching joints. When she arrived in Brisbane she was so sick she went straight to hospital, where she was told it was probably flu and to go home. The next day she went to a GP.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Topaz Conway</emphasis>: I kept saying, 'But it's not the flu, I know it's not the flu, my joints hurt, there's something wrong here,' and he pretty much did the same thing; take two aspirin, go home, and if you're not better on Monday, come back. So by Sunday I Googled my symptoms and immediately what came up were three things: it was dengue, Ross River or this chikungunya, and it could have been any of the three. So Monday I took myself off to another doctor, asked her to test for dengue and Ross River, she wasn't going to, but then I insisted.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: While waiting for the result, Topaz Conway's pain become so bad that she started asking around for a chikungunya test, and found Andreas Suhrbier at the Queensland Institute of Medical Research.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Topaz Conway</emphasis>: And he immediately said, 'You know, it sounds to me like it's chikungunya,' he said, 'In fact I'll bet you a bottle of whiskey it is.' And so I said, 'Okay, that's great, but what do I do?' And he told me where to go to get the test done and I did that, and sure enough that's what it came back to be.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Chikungunya is like a souped-up version of Ross River virus. They're both alphaviruses, and they both cause a rash, fever, and arthritis that can last many weeks or months. If you've ever had Ross River virus-and 4,000 to 5,000 Australians are diagnosed every year-you'll know how painful that can be. Chikungunya is worse.</p><p>And there's another local alphavirus that's had an unexplained jump in cases lately. There've been 3,000 cases of the Barmah Forest virus in the past six months. We've put some graphs on the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Background Briefing</emphasis> website to show how the incidence of these mosquito-borne diseases has been rising lately.</p><p>All these alphaviruses make people sick in the same way. Andreas Suhrbier:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andreas Suhrbier</emphasis>: There are a very few viruses that cause this kind of protracted disease dominated by these rheumatic symptoms. And why do they do that? Well, the answer is actually reasonably simple; the virus infects cells in the joints, and so the immune response tries to get rid of these infections, and that battle between the virus and the immune system causes inflammation and that causes the disease.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: The painful arthritis lasted nine months for Topaz Conway. She describes what happened when her symptoms vanished briefly during a bout of food poisoning.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Topaz Conway</emphasis>: Suddenly I felt good and it didn't matter that I had salmonella and was vomiting my guts out, it was more I was absolutely ecstatic and almost giddy from not having the pain in the joints. So on day five when all the symptoms of salmonella went away, the pain came back and that's sort of when I lost the plot and told the doctor, 'You can cut off both my arms and legs because I just cannot live with this pain,' and I was dead serious at the time.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: In Victoria, Laura Jean McKay still has arthritis two months after the infected mosquito bit her.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laura Jean McKay</emphasis>: So yesterday I felt really arthritic and found it difficult to walk and I dropped a plate and smashed it on the floor because I couldn't hold it, and then today not so arthritic but my feet are peeling and I feel quite nauseous.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: What do you mean, the skin's actually peeled off?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laura Jean Mckay</emphasis>: The skin's falling off, yes the skin's peeling off, and that's the result of the rash.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Laura Jean McKay's in Melbourne, where so far there are no mosquitoes that could transmit chikungunya. If she lived in Cairns, as opposed to Melbourne, it'd be a different story. A cousin of the Asian tiger mosquito, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes aegypti</emphasis>, has already migrated to Cairns, established itself, and is now endemic in North Queensland. It's responsible for a dengue outbreak that Cairns can't seem to shake. And <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes aegypti</emphasis> is also a really good vector for chikungunya.</p><p>Greg Devine is director of entomology at the Cairns Public Health Unit.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Greg Devine</emphasis>: Certainly in Queensland we need to be alarmed just because we know this is where the viruses do very well. Virus replication is all to do with temperature and it's in these parts of the tropics that the virus can really circulate quite fast. And one of the interesting things about chikungunya and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis> is that it's a very, very fast replication, much faster than we're used to dealing with the old <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes aegypti</emphasis> dengue model, so that makes our job much, much harder. So we need to be looking very seriously for new interventions and, as I say, they are on the horizon.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Australia has kept <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis> off the mainland for more than a decade, but it came to the Torres Strait in 2004. It was thought to have arrived from Papua New Guinea, but DNA testing showed this variant of the mosquito came somehow from Indonesia.</p><p>There are so many ways <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis> can get to the mainland that some researchers worry that it's already here.</p><p>At QIMR is mosquito biologist Jonathan Darbro:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathan Darbro</emphasis>: I think about that actually, I think about that quite a bit. And one nice thing about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">albopictus</emphasis> is that if it was well established, we would know it. It's not shy.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: People would be on the phone saying, 'What are these mosquitoes?'</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Jonathan Darbro</emphasis>: That's right, and as soon as people complain, council guys will go check it out, and everyone in the business is aware of the threat. It might be that a couple...maybe some eggs got through somewhere and there's some larvae, whether or not that gets caught before it goes anywhere or if it becomes the point of establishment, there is no way of saying.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Another worry is that chikungunya could be spread in Australia even without <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis> or <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes aegypti</emphasis>.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew van den Hurk</emphasis>: The interesting thing about <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis> is they called the Asian tiger mosquito because it's got a lot of stripes and things like that on it, but the most distinctive one is this stripe that runs straight down the back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: But its main distinction for the public would be just the fact that when you go outside you're being more viciously attacked than you would normally...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew van den Hurk</emphasis>: That's right, and particularly during the day, which you don't tend to get much in Brisbane. In North Queensland you would because they have <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes aegypti</emphasis>. So it's very distinctive, you can see that white stripe...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Yes, you can see the...it's almost a silver stripe down the back.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew van den Hurk</emphasis>: Yes, so it's quite a spectacular mosquito.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: It is spectacular, isn't it? And there are blobs of silver on its body and at its joints.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Queensland Health recently took a close look at Australian native mosquitoes to see if any of those could be a vector for chikungunya. It turns out that one of the best vectors is a common mosquito called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes vigilax</emphasis>, the salt marsh mosquito which we heard about earlier, caught in a mosquito trap at the Port of Brisbane.</p><p>Queensland Health entomologist, Andrew van den Hurk:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew van den Hurk</emphasis>: One of those is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes vigilax</emphasis> which is the main Ross River vector throughout coastal areas of Australia. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes vigilax</emphasis> comes from salt marshes. So there's times when you get above average high tides or above average rainfall and you'll get plagues of these mosquitoes, and people definitely notice them, and certain suburbs are more at risk. So yes, there are a number, and there's even another domestic species called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes notoscriptus</emphasis>, and this is the one that if you're working out in the garden in the late afternoon heading into dusk or you're out on the veranda having a drink after work, that's the mosquito that will probably be hassling you there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: Researchers also worry about what will happen if the Asian tiger mosquito starts biting marsupials, which are the natural hosts for our native alphaviruses.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andrew van den Hurk</emphasis>: Marsupials are major hosts of Ross River virus, so the question is could they be also hosts of chikungunya, and in all reality we really at this stage don't know that. Having said that, humans are the hosts of chikungunya, so I think there's enough potential hosts here, that's for sure.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: There's no vaccine and no cure for chikungunya, and no specific drug to treat it. Trying to make any new drug from scratch can cost a fortune and take years. Andreas Suhrbier is part of a team looking at treatments for rheumatoid arthritis that could also treat chikungunya in an outbreak.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Andreas Suhrbier</emphasis>: The dogma some years ago was; oh don't be stupid, they are really very different diseases, you know, one is an autoimmune disease and goes on forever, one is a self-resolving viral arthritis, you know, completely different, you'd be nuts to think that there'd be some kind of similarity there.</p><p>So we actually did the experiment, and we got together with Emory University in the USA and we actually did a study trying to work out what the inflammatory signatures in the two diseases are, and we were really surprised. In fact the inflammation in both those have a remarkable level of similarity, and that was an extremely surprising result for us. But it illustrates that at least some of these drugs (we don't know which ones yet) that are being developed for rheumatoid arthritis should also find application in the treatment for Ross River and Barmah Forest and chikungunya et cetera.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: There's research into new ways of attacking the mosquito too. In Cairns, a trial of a bacteria called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wolbachia</emphasis> is helping slow the spread of the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes aegypti</emphasis> mosquito and its ability to transmit dengue. The bacteria could also work with chikungunya inside the Asian tiger mosquito, but that research is still some years away. There are also new insecticides that could better help control <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aedes albopictus</emphasis>, but they haven't been registered in Australia yet.</p><p>How cost effective the mosquito controls we have at the moment will be in controlling any outbreak of chikungunya is a question that bothers virologist John Aaskov.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">John Aaskov</emphasis>: And, you know, if we did get a big outbreak of chik in Cairns or something there would be an enormous political pressure to rush around and do all sorts of things, which in the long-term might not have very much effect at all. And so I think people need to maintain cool heads here. What's it going to cost us in terms of either morbidity or mortality, what's it going to cost us to prevent that, and is that a cost effective use of our health dollar? And so while this is fascinating to me, I'm not the health minister trying to balance a budget, and so we need to keep a sense of perspective in what we are doing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: From the perspective of someone who's had the disease, no price is too high to be able to treat chikungunya and kill the Asian tiger mosquito.</p><p>Topaz Conway:</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Topaz Conway</emphasis>: If hundreds or tens of thousands of people got this it would mean people who couldn't work, couldn't lift their children. You can't lift things, and simple things like if a mother gets it and she can't lift her infant, or I would drop things because literally my wrists would give out. Even getting up off the floor, if I sat down on the floor for any reason, there were times when I had to sort of crawl over to a chair so I could somehow get myself up off the floor. So it isn't a trivial thing, if this were to break out in a major way.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Ian Townsend</emphasis>: <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Background Briefing</emphasis>'s co-ordinating producer is Linda McGinness, research by Anna Whitfeld, technical production by Leila Shunnar,\u00c2 the executive producer is Chris Bullock, and I'm Ian Townsend.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-4823184</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58Y8-BB01-JCM0-6361-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">300228</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-06-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6047\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"07\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>July 17, 2013 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC0007OHJ</classCode><className>AEDES SPA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS531210 OFFICES OF REAL ESTATE AGENTS &amp;

He has been subject to torture and deprivation for over five years, and any way out would have to be better than to continue to endure such barbaric treatment from the US.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vic Adams</p><p>Reid, ACT</p><p/><p>SO, David Hicks has pleaded guilty to a long list of accusations. Gossip as you will about the mechanics and quality of his imprisonment and trial, then sentence him to life imprisonment.</p><p>His fundamental crime had been to show a world of misfits, deviates, potential terrorists and so on, the path to evil -- and that is it quite easy. He has encouraged the enemy within with great publicity. He is a traitor of the first order and the world has traditionally been hard on traitors.</p><p>Geoffrey Sherrington</p><p>Donvale, Vic</p><p/><p>AS David Hicks faces his days in court tonight, I am saddened that he was unable defend himself in an unbiased setting.</p><p>But what worries me even more is that both John Howard and Philip Ruddock claim that this military commission system that permits statements obtained under torture, denies evidence to the defence and removes rights of appeal, is a fair court. This raises the horrifying prospect that they may wish to apply similarly unreasonable standards to terror cases in Australia.</p><p>I can only hope that none of us have to face this Government's rough justice at home or abroad.</p><p>Ben Corry</p><p>Crawley, WA</p><p/><p>IF the US Government has to corrupt its legal and democratic processes to deal with David Hicks, terrorism has won another victory. These acts of corruption do more damage than any terrorist could do to another country. You can only corrupt your own heart and soul.</p><p>Michael Diehl Breen</p><p>Dalton, NSW</p><p/><p>SURPRISE, surprise the David Hicks kangaroo court has thrown John Howard an excuse for his actions in allowing a completely inhuman situation to continue.</p><p>I have more faith in Australians than to think they would accept the guilty plea by Hicks as genuine. Rather, they will see it as a desperate act to free himself from a hellhole.</p><p>As George W. Bush, Tony Blair, and Howard are all on the bottom of the popularity polls, we will thankfully be free of all of them in a year or so.</p><p>Frank Crichlow</p><p>Carrara, Qld</p><p/><p>NOW that David Hicks has pleaded guilty to a serious charge, can the red-faced cheer squad take a rest. He had access to extensive military and civilian legal advice and has chosen not to fight the charge. One must assume his advice was that he would not be acquitted.</p><p>He has embarrassed and made fools of many supporters, so it is understandable that some will continue to keep fighting shadows long after he has given up. To them I say, be more careful next time before tilting at windmills. Anyone caught next to a forest fire with a box of matches and a can of petrol in their hand usually has good reason to feel apprehensive.</p><p>John McLeod</p><p>Sunshine Coast, Qld</p><p/><p>AS feared, the ''trial'' of David Hicks is proving to be an obscene abuse of justice. When a judge has no qualms about sacking defence lawyers but criticises a prisoner's dress sense, you know something is wrong.</p><p>John Byrne</p><p>Randwick, NSW</p><p/><p>ONCE a certain element in our community gets over the shock of a tubby David Hicks, the spin doctors will be working full time to tell us that the poor man had nothing else to do with his time. I'm sure, though that the Left would have preferred a waif-like Hicks. It's all been about an image forced on us when it comes to Hicks: the sweet, smiling boy next door, not the mercenary.</p><p>Jessie Black</p><p>Elwood, Vic</p><p/><p>IF David Hicks can be charged under US federal law for materially aiding terrorists, why are not thousands of US citizens also charged for aiding, supplying and financing the IRA?</p><p>Stan Yeaman</p><p>City Beach, WA</p><p/><p>IF I was locked in a dog box, in solitary, for five years I would even promise to vote for John Howard to get out.</p><p>Kieran Foy</p><p>Flaxton, Qld</p><p/><p>WHEN he returns home, no doubt David Hicks will be offered millions of dollars from TV networks, magazines and book contracts. Hicks should donate all this money to the Australian families of victims of terrorist attacks in New York, Bali and London.</p><p>Michael Burd</p><p>Toorak, Vic</p><p/><p>NOT an awfully difficult choice: plead guilty and get five years and a few months. Plead not guilty and get 20 years.</p><p>Andrew Wyminga</p><p>Bicheno, Tas</p><p/><p>Not every worker benefits from the Work Choices laws</p><p>AS a Liberal-leaning voter, I am not comfortable with aspects of Work Choices. If you are skilled, articulate, have clout and a fair boss, you can negotiate an AWA. If the terms are unacceptable and your skills transferable you can go elsewhere (possibly).</p><p>Even in the present favourable jobs market, this does not apply to everyone. If you are of a certain age (despite the push for older people to keep working), have family responsibilities, and/or live in a small rural town, your choices are limited or nonexistent.</p><p>This is fact, not fear. That dissatisfaction is only now beginning to filter through is because those most affected have the least clout. John Howard should take heed of this.</p><p>Roseanne Schneider</p><p>Yeronga, Qld</p><p/><p>THE much trumpeted employment growth of 2.39 per cent since the introduction of Work Choices doesn't stack up against the 3.9 per cent growth recorded in the year after the introduction of Labor's unfair dismissal laws in the 1990s. Hard to see John Howard or Joe Hockey claiming this growth was the result of the ALP's legislation, so why would anyone take their spin on their IR laws seriously?</p><p>Mr Hockey keeps telling us that the Government is not for turning on its IR laws. Well here's a message for him and his boss -- this voter's not for conning.</p><p>James Wood</p><p>Wagga Wagga, NSW</p><p/><p>DESPITE the scaremongering by unions there have not, as far as I know, been thousands of jobs lost. Wages and conditions have not been drastically reduced. The adjustments that have been made would appear to have been in keeping with the necessary adjustments to keep the economy running and increase overall employment.</p><p>The way the unions and the ALP are arguing suggests that no one should ever lose their job and that wages and conditions should only be adjusted upwards. It seems unlikely that the real world works like that and that those opposed to the legislation are more concerned about themselves than the majority of people who will eventually benefit from keeping jobs in a competitive Australia.</p><p>K.M. Gunn</p><p>Lower Mitcham, SA</p><p/><p>THE support for Work Choices by Peter Hendy comes as no surprise (Opinion, 27/3). It was Mr Hendy, as chief of staff to Peter Reith, who prepared the first tranche of IR legislation back in 1996. The legislation was then defeated because John Howard lacked the numbers in the Senate.</p><p>The comments from Mr Hendy are typical of individuals who are welded to the Liberal Party, are interested in advancing their own interests and care nothing for employee working conditions. The Coalition's IR reforms are all about handing the employers the tools necessary to advance the cause of big business.</p><p>Richard Slater</p><p>Berowra Heights, NSW</p><p/><p>IN his opinion piece on Work Choices, Peter Hendy used the words union bosses no fewer than 16 times. Was he trying to scare me?</p><p>Daryl Poore</p><p>Diamond Creek, Vic</p><p/><p>The Left's lack of outrage</p><p>PETER Tatchell (Cut &amp; Paste, 27/3) has merely scratched the surface of the Left's hypocrisy on human rights, an ingrained inconsistency that dates from the Bolshevik coup d'etat almost a century ago.</p><p>Tatchell's main point concerns the Left's lack of outrage over Robert Mugabe's treatment of the Zimbabwean people, but he could have included the Left's similar apathy toward a whole clutch of other African post-colonial regimes, as well as Burma. Tatchell's exposure of the Left's unwillingness to condemn Muslim repression, racism and sexism will be familiar to The Australian's readership because it echoes the outrage of courageous mavericks such as Pamela Bone and Janet Albrechtsen.</p><p>What Tatchell does not mention is the Left's ancient unwillingness to criticise communist governments, beginning with the Soviet Union, and including today China, Vietnam, Laos and Cuba. He refers to fascist Spain, but fails to point out that some of Franco's most strident enemies in the West were uncritical worshippers of the infinitely worse Stalin.</p><p>The most egregious contemporary example of the Left's silence in the face of denial of human rights is its lack of interest in North Korea, which is simply the world's worst case of totalitarianism.</p><p>Bill James</p><p>Bayswater, Vic</p><p/><p>Europe's 50th birthday</p><p>JUDGING by your disparaging and unnecessary swipe at the EU (Editorial, 27/3), it seems that even the harmless clinking of a few champagne glasses in Berlin to celebrate 50 years of like-minded European commerce is enough to stir up paranoia about old enemies and, heaven forbid, threats to US world dominance.</p><p>Excuse me, but are US-led coalitions of the willing the only ones allowed? Are US-sponsored armies the only ones permitted to be raised? Are US-sanctioned decisions the only ones allowed to be reached? You say that ''a return to the Treaty of Rome's original principles'' is the way forward for Europe. And what would those principles be? Stick to matters of your town square, messieurs, and don't obstruct the star-spangled stranglehold on global political and military policy.</p><p>John Skaro</p><p>South Yarra, Vic</p><p/><p>WHAT planet is Stuart Reid living on? His piece (Opinion, 27/3) on the EU is typical of European self-delusion. It's not a matter of being a Eurosceptic. It's a matter of objective fact. European populations are shrinking at a rapid rate and many will halve with every generation. Their population rates have gone past the point of no return. In failing to have babies, Europeans have committed suicide.</p><p>Whatever goods Europe has delivered, they are only temporary. The diving populations of European nations means that by mid-century most Europeans will be geriatrics and there will be more government handouts than taxes coming in. It won't take young people long to realise that they are paying for their parents' past excesses and exit to the US or Australia. All this makes European socialism unsustainable, and those goods are destined to be withdrawn one way or another. Thus it's not surprising they want to enlarge the EU. Someone has to pay for their largesse.</p><p>Celebrate your anniversary Europe -- enjoy it for what little time it will last.</p><p>Andrew S. Kulikovsky</p><p>Mawson Lakes, SA</p><p/><p>Slave trade myths</p><p>THE notion that the Jacobins of revolutionary France abolished the transport of slaves in 1794, 13 years before the British (L.M. Salter-Duke, Letters, 27/3), is a left-wing myth.</p><p>The convention in Paris on February 4, 1794, declared the universal emancipation of slaves, but did not outlaw the trade. This meant no slaves could be held on French soil, a finding that Lord Mansfield had affirmed was true of Britain 22 years earlier.</p><p>The only effect the Jacobins had on the slave trade was the abolition of the bounty France once paid for the carriage of slaves.</p><p>However, in the Caribbean colony of Saint-Domingue, the Jacobins' revolutionary example sparked a bloody slave uprising. Hugh Thomas in The Slave Trade observes that this was a godsend for slave owners and transporters elsewhere who could point to the chaos and outrages attendant upon the French actions. They thereby helped stave off British reforms that would have otherwise occurred much sooner.</p><p>Keith Windschuttle</p><p>Paddington, NSW</p><p/><p>Sympathy for drug abusers</p><p>THE treatment of AFL players and other sportspeople with drug abuse problems holds up a mirror to the worst of our community responses to the issue. It reflects the sad fact that, in Australia, there is still so much stigma attached to alcohol and drug addiction.</p><p>The stories we see reinforce a negative tragic perspective -- disgrace, annihilation, desperation. Yet, there are many people around the world whose addictions have been resolved. These people bear testimony to the fact that the mental and physical obsession that is addiction can be overcome.</p><p>Watching the media coverage, it is easy to see why people with an addiction feel they must hide, or deal with it behind closed doors. Anyone wrestling with drug dependence should not have to endure public shaming, punishment, ostracism and harassment. This only exacerbates the problem. What is useful in these situations is support, understanding and mentoring by people who have been through similar experiences. This media circus is neither helpful nor compassionate.</p><p>Andrea Travers</p><p>The Recovery Foundation</p><p>Belgrave Heights, Vic</p><p/><p>FIRST BYTE</p><p>Iran may charge Brits as spies, according to your headline (26/3). That this would be a breach of the Geneva Convention is beyond dispute. So where are the howls of protest from the Western press? Where are the protests and condemnation from our self-appointed human rights organisations? Their silence condemns them. Hypocrites all.</p><p>Nathan Potaznik</p><p>Canterbury, Vic</p><p/><p>Just a whiff of Greg Combet MP, and the Prime Minister trots out the union bogeyman. But with conflict of self-interest always possible between employer and employee, and the former considerably advantaged, worker solidarity through union membership is an essential counterweight.</p><p>Barrie Smillie</p><p>Duffy, ACT</p><p/><p>The NSW Liberals will surely use the ABD test (anyone but Debnam) when choosing their next leader.</p><p>Kel Joaquin-Byrne</p><p>Randwick, NSW</p><p/><p>Garry Trethewey (First Byte, 27/3) will have to change his lifestyle, sleep during the day and use his computer in the early hours of the morning. He'll connect in seconds then.</p><p>J. Barathy</p><p>Carrara, Qld</p><p/><p>The most appalling euphemism of all: comfort women for sex slaves.</p><p>Paul Hunt</p><p>Engadine, NSW</p><p/><p>Today, Cricket Australia is preparing for a money-making trip to Zimbabwe which will only line the pockets of the Australian cricketers and send a message of comfort to the oppressive regime of Robert Mugabe. Cancelling this tour will instead send a message of protest at the destruction of democracy in Zimbabwe.</p><p>Isidore Shifrin</p><p>Prahran, Vic</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:letters@theaustralian.com.au\">letters@theaustralian.com.au</email></p><p/><p>LETTERS TO THE EDITOR</p><p>GPO Box 4162, Sydney, NSW, 2001Fax: 02 9288 3077</p><p>Email: <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:letters@theaustralian.com.au\">letters@theaustralian.com.au</email> (no attachments)</p><p/><p>Emails and letters should bear a full postal address and day and night telephone numbers.</p><p>Letters to the Editor of The Australian are submitted on the condition that Nationwide News Pty Ltd as publisher of The Australian may edit and has the right to, and license third parties to, reproduce in electronic form and communicate these letters.</p><p>Letters online</p><p>Letters from this page are published on The Australian's website -- and online readers have the opportunity to add their own comments.

A Canberra fertility clinic claims victimhood at the hands of Catholic hospital owners who refuse it access to facilities to carry out procedures anathema to the Catholic Church (''Catholic hospital shuts out IVF'', 9/1). It would seem that only ''victims'' have rights. And in her opinion piece (''Let's have faith in society and keep God out of it'', 9/1), Pamela Bone positively drools at the prospect of reading more bile-filled books by God-haters such as Richard Dawkins and Christopher Hitchens. She virtually accuses us Christians of child abuse for teaching our children about the God in whom we believe. Pathetically and deceitfully, she paints opponents of cloning for embryonic stem cell research as monsters who care more for the rights of human embryos than for the rights of children with cancer.</p><p>We are all endowed with free will, and Bone has every right to reject belief in God. She does not, however, have any right to pontificate superciliously against sincere people who regard such dubious progressive achievements as abortion and euthanasia as sins against God and man. And, in so doing, she displays not only the arrogance but also the insecurity of atheism.</p><p>Richard Congram</p><p>Carindale, Qld</p><p/><p>FIRST we had David Williamson's secular jihad, now we have Pamela Bone's. Is The Australian becoming the official media outlet for Australian atheists?</p><p>Bone tries to claim the anti-theists are not on a crusade, but any sensible reading of their writings shows they clearly are. The new militant secularists are clearly undertaking a holy war against religion, and they show every bit as much intolerance and bigotry as any religious person ever has.</p><p>Bill Muehlenberg</p><p>Heathmont, Vic</p><p/><p>PAMELA Bone's argument is contradictory. We can only have faith in society if there is an objective order that explains our duty to each other. Religions are just an acknowledgment that there is a creator of that objective order.</p><p>John Smith</p><p>Farrer, ACT</p><p/><p>I HOPE atheist Pamela Bone realises that most Australian theists support her position that religion must be neither suppressed nor promoted by the state. Religion reaches into the realm of the non-obvious, so there are inevitably many versions. On top of that, religious views are often adhered to with great conviction. Conclusion: it's downright dangerous to human welfare to give any denomination the clout of state authority.</p><p>This said, there is no democratic justification to invalidate the vote of an individual citizen or elected politician on the grounds that he or she believes in God. There is nothing intrinsically more legitimate about a preference based on another ideology -- or on nothing at all.</p><p>Philip O'Carroll</p><p>North Fitzroy, Vic</p><p/><p>HEAR, hear, Pamela Bone: God believers do not have exclusive rights to goodness. However, Bone's conclusion that in relation to morals it's better to ''leave God out of it'', is self-defeating from a non-believer's viewpoint. Being a non-believer is a statement that there is no God. To then wonder whether God should or should not be included is irrelevant.</p><p>Brenton Jury</p><p>Paddington, Qld</p><p/><p>HATS off to Pamela Bone for having the guts to stand up for the non-believers who are tired of the politicians who daren't say boo to the fear-laden faithful.</p><p>John Morgan</p><p>Paddington, NSW</p><p/><p>PAMELA Bone makes the surprising statement that Christian evangelism has had a ''long and unimpeded run''. Well, back in the 1950s, Christians were labelled ''wowsers'' and ''Bible bashers'', and in later years Christian principles were rejected by the secular state. It seems to me that society is a much more dangerous place today than it was then, so where is the proof of Pamela's pudding?</p><p>Zillah Williams</p><p>Latham, ACT</p><p/><p>PAMELA Bone, like many atheists, makes the mistake of lumping all religious faiths together in relegating them to the dustbin of history. Clearly, in this age of terrorism, some religious faiths such as Judaism and Christianity are more compatible with contemporary, democratic societies than others.</p><p>She appears to argue that modern technological societies no longer need the survival advantages that religion once conferred on the human species, and that now we know better we can move on and find good, human reasons for the decisions we make.</p><p>However, she does not acknowledge that the development of democracy, freedom and the rule of law arose in societies which practised the Judeo/Christian faiths. How long these principles will survive without the over-arching moral codes which engendered them is uncertain. Yet, if Bone has her wish, sooner or later humanity will find itself without a place to stand in the moral world, merely destined for Darwinian determinism whereby humans are relegated to the natural struggle for survival.</p><p>Jennifer Meister</p><p>Ivanhoe, Vic</p><p/><p>Building costly firebreaks won't stop the big ones</p><p>VICTORIAN Water Minister John Thwaites's proposal to bulldoze hundreds of kilometres of permanent firebreaks around Melbourne's water catchment, in the Otway ranges and along the southern edge of fires now spreading in Gippsland is beyond belief (''Bracks buckles on firebreaks'', 6-7/1).</p><p>Has nobody told him that firebreaks don't stop big fires? They didn't stop them in 1982 and 1983. They didn't stop them in Canberra in 2003, when a fire tornado carried flames for kilometres across almost bare, eaten-out pasture. And they didn't stop the current Victorian fires that jumped over bulldozed easements for power lines.</p><p>Has nobody told the minister how bushfires behave and what can be done about them, or is he listening to the wrong people? Mr Thwaites must understand that forest fires are uncontrollable when they burn heavy fuel loads in hot windy weather and spew burning embers kilometres ahead. What is required is a network of permanent access roads through forests and national parks, built and maintained to standards that allow personnel to work safely and mount aggressive initial attacks on unplanned fires. These roads are also the only firebreak that is necessary to conduct low-intensity prescribed burns for effective fuel-load management across the landscape to minimise the risk of firestorms.</p><p>Mr Thwaites's proposal is hugely expensive and simply won't work. Furthermore, he must recognise that the number of permanent fire fighters in Victoria skilled in forest-fire management is woefully inadequate. His reliance on the goodwill of fire fighters from other states and countries will not stop firestorms happening.</p><p>Athol Hodgson</p><p>Parkdale, Vic</p><p/><p>More to lose than mere face</p><p>ROBERT O'Neill (''Good intentions drain into the sand'', Opinion, 9/1) says that ''Bush had better think hard in the coming months'' about how to avoid total defeat in Iraq. Yes, indeed, and so too should the Democrats. As O'Neill points out, there is a lot more to lose in the Iraq war than merely face. Rather than using Iraq as a political point-scoring exercise, the Democrats should work with President Bush to ensure the best possible outcome, for the sake of both the West and the Middle East. If the West loses in Iraq, the ramifications will be felt throughout the world for many years to come.</p><p>A. Khat</p><p>Ryde, NSW</p><p/><p>IT'S madness. George W.

And yet this age group only represents 14 per cent of Victorian licence holders.</p><p>To obtain my licence three months ago, I was shocked to discover that I was required only to meander my way through slow and quiet residential streets for about 20 minutes. How is this a true examination of whether or not a young person has the necessary skills to survive on our roads? No wonder so many young people are involved in road accidents.</p><p>If Victorian state MPs were serious about reducing the road toll, they would legislate to make the licence test more rigorous. Why not make it necessary for young drivers to sit three or more 30-minute tests, each in different road traffic conditions, so that an examiner can truly gauge the skill of the driver? Or maybe make it compulsory for young drivers to have a minimum of five driving lessons before sitting for their test?</p><p>Legislation that aims to control the way young drivers behave on our roads can only do so much once a dangerously unskilled driver has his or her licence. One measure that would certainly change the attitude of every young driver would be zero demerit points for P-platers in their first year.</p><p>Nothing can be done about the fact that P-plate drivers are the most inexperienced drivers on our roads, but at least some things can be done to ensure that the licence test is sufficiently thorough to force young drivers to fully prepare themselves for their Ps.</p><p>Struan Jones</p><p>Hurstbridge, Vic</p><p/><p>I SUGGEST that for one offence a P-plate driver be required to spend another year as such.

It was a reminder that bushfires would always be a part of life in the ACT but was also eerily reminiscent of the days before the January 18 firestorm when smoke from distant fires was drifting over the city. It had some people wondering if such a disaster could happen again and what had changed in almost four years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Courtroom No 10 in the Magistrates Court building was packed with lawyers, officials, residents and media on Tuesday as Doogan issued her two-volume, 800-page report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There were few surprises in the document.</p><p>Doogan's main findings, including that the then ACT Emergency Services Bureau had failed to aggressively attack the fires when they ignited or warn the community of the growing fire danger, had been key themes right from the opening address of senior counsel assisting, Lex Lasry, to the inquiry in October 2003.</p><p>Former ACT and Commonwealth Ombudsman Ron McLeod had made similar findings in his inquiry into the operational response to the fires issued in August 2003.</p><p>The difference on Tuesday was that Doogan found that senior officials within the ESB and even members of the Cabinet knew there was a risk to the city days before the firestorm but did not warn the public. Those findings appeared to give the greatest satisfaction to the residents who were in the courtroom.</p><p>Finally, here in black and white, in the most uncompromising language, was confirmation of what they had always believed: that those meant to protect the territory had failed in their duty in the most spectacular way.</p><p>As Laurence Buchanan, whose house in Duffy was destroyed in the firestorm, said plainly, \"I lost my home because of the gross failure of the Emergency Services Bureau to warn us.\"</p><p>The Government, led by Chief Minister Jon Stanhope, has categorically rejected Doogan's finding that Cabinet knew Canberra was at risk two days before the firestorm. He reiterated that it acted only according to advice from its emergency services personnel, those expert in bushfire management. But the Government has also steadfastly refused to take any action against those senior officers still working in emergency services.</p><p>Emergency Services Minister Simon Corbell said the officers did their best in trying circumstances. \"I do not believe they are deficient in their duties,\" he said. \"I believe they are very competent and professional officers. They have demonstrated that in their management before and after 2003 and we stand by them.\"</p><p>The Chief Minister told a media conference on Tuesday that on important aspects of the report \"The coroner is simply wrong\".</p><p>It is still chilling to consider the losses from the January 18 firestorm: four dead, 435 injured, 487 homes destroyed, a damage bill of at least $610million.</p><p>In a letter to Corbell reporting her conclusions, Doogan said the failure to warn the community despite senior personnel of the ESB having knowledge that the fires would burn into the suburbs was \"a factor that exacerbated the property losses and resulted in panic and confusion throughout the affected suburbs on the day of the firestorm\".</p><p>\"Frankly, on the evidence before the inquiry, it is a miracle that no more than four people died,\" she wrote.</p><p>Doogan's final report had taken more than three years to complete.</p><p>She had hoped to have it out by the end of 2004 but the inquiry was plagued by stops and starts as witnesses sought legal representation at the last minute, two appeals were made to the Supreme Court, lawyers needed extra time to write submissions and an expert witness suffered a heart attack. When it did come, the report pulled no punches.</p><p>Doogan found senior officers of the ESB had been self-deluded and over-optimistic about their chances of stopping the fires, and had failed to issue direct warnings to the community as the fire risk grew and grew.</p><p>The coroner did not \"question the integrity or honesty of any of the senior officers of the [ESB]\" but rather highlighted \"poor judgment, insufficient knowledge and experience, and an inadequate response to the fires\".</p><p>She denied being engaged in the blame game but acknowledged it was \"often impossible to learn from mistakes made without finding fault on the part of individuals\".</p><p>Five of those individuals former ESB executive director Mike Castle, former chief bushfire control officer Peter Lucas-Smith, then ESB operations manager Tony Graham, then ESB planner Rick McRae and Stanhope himself were all heavily criticised in the report. Each was subject to a Section 55 notice, alerting them before the report was published that they had been the subject of adverse comment and giving them an opportunity to respond. Their explanations did little to temper Doogan's criticism.</p><p>She found there were 15 causes of the deadly firestorm, mostly sheeted home to the ESB.</p><p>The lack of warning, the failure to aggressively attack the three fires when they were ignited by lightning in Namadgi National Park on January 8, the absence of a plan even on January 17 on how to react if the fires did reach the suburbs, the failure to properly use resources from NSW, the failure to inform the Australian Federal Police of the fire risk all contributed to the disaster.</p><p>But there were also other factors which contributed to the ferocity of the firestorm: the extreme drought, overgrown fire trails, heavy fuel loads, limited manpower and resources.</p><p>The inquiry heard evidence from Lucas-Smith that three requests to the Government for additional funding for the ESB in 2002-03 had been refused and overall ESB funding had been reduced.</p><p>And then there was the speed and magnitude of the firestorm. The ESB authorities have always maintained no one predicted anything like that kind of conflagration hitting Canberra on January 18, including a tornado created by the fires with wind speeds of 200km/h.</p><p>Doogan did not accept that the severity of the firestorm could not have been foreseen, saying extreme fire events had been recorded in Australia since at least 1851 and modern-day experts had been warning of such a disaster, apparently to no effect.</p><p>Nevertheless, even CSIRO bushfire expert Phil Cheney, an expert witness to the inquiry, conceded that on January 18 there were times when the firestorm was moving at 20km an hour, \"the fastest documented rate of spread of a forest fire anywhere to my knowledge\".</p><p>ESB planner Rick McRae told the inquiry that about 1pm on January 18 there were indications the McIntyre's Hut fire had moved about 3km overnight. But the fire then \"accelerated quite remarkably\" to cover around 12km in the next two hours to hit Weston Creek just after 3pm.</p><p>Lucas-Smith said of the firestorm, \"I had not experienced anything like that in my over 30 years' experience involved in bushfire fighting\".</p><p>Then there was the role of the ACT.</p><p>The McIntyre's Hut fire, started also by lightning in the Brindabella National Park on January 8, was a major part of the firestorm. It burned for nine days in NSW before hitting Canberra on January 18. Many people were highly critical of the NSW authorities choosing not to directly attack the fire on the first night. But because Doogan is an ACT coroner, she could comment on the fire only once it had crossed the border, and she could make no findings or recommendations in relation to NSW.</p><p>She did find that \"once the fire crossed the border into the Australian Capital Territory, its cause was the NSW authorities' inability to prevent the fire entering the ACT\".</p><p>\"Once the McIntyre's Hut fire in NSW gathered momentum, crossed the border and joined the fires burning in the ACT, it became inevitable that the resultant firestorm would deliver its fury to both rural and urban areas of the ACT, turning some areas into an inferno that firefighters had no way of controlling,\" she wrote.</p><p>Some remain dissatisfied that NSW's role in the fires has not been properly reviewed, suggesting civil action will eventually reveal more.</p><p>Doogan said the issue of warnings was the \"most compelling and emotive\" of the inquiry.</p><p>She was satisfied that on January 16, two days before the firestorm hit the suburbs, \"the cabinet generally, including Mr Stanhope, knew a potential disaster was on Canberra's doorstep but did nothing to ensure that the Canberra community was warned promptly and effectively\".</p><p>Stanhope maintained this week that nothing was said in the cabinet briefing that led him to believe the fires were not under control, that a threat to Canberra was imminent or that warnings should be issued.</p><p>That was despite evidence to the inquiry that Weston and Dunlop were noted as suburbs that would be affected if the fires turned on Canberra.</p><p>Provision for a state of emergency being declared had also been discussed, based on the possibility of fires affecting the Transgrid line in Namadgi and cutting most of the power supply to Canberra.</p><p>Then Emergency Services Minister Bill Wood was also in the cabinet meeting. He went on holidays the next day, January 17. He did not believe the fires would enter the urban areas. \"Had the tone of the briefing been different, I would not have sought leave as I did,\" he said, in a statutory declaration.</p><p>Treasurer Ted Quinlan, who would have filled in for Wood as Emergency Services Minister, was also away on January 17, going to the Australian Open tennis championship in Melbourne after attending the cabinet briefing. As a result, Stanhope became acting Emergency Services Minister on January 17. Quinlan said he believed the message from the cabinet briefing was that \"relatively serious problem [was] facing the territory\", but one comparable to the impact of the December 2001 bushfires, and nothing like the firestorm that arrived two days later.</p><p>Wood, despite being the relevant minister for most of the bushfire campaign, was never called to give evidence at the inquiry. Stanhope said he took \"political responsibility\" for the fires but would not be resigning. He believed Doogan's report was \"good\" and \"very strong\" but not accurate when it came to his actions. \"I am concerned at the focus on certain individuals, and the suggestion that they have to accept blame. I don't accept blame for myself,\" he told 666 ABC radio.</p><p>In her report, Doogan was also satisfied that, by the evening of January 17, the ESB senior officers Castle, Lucas-Smith, McRae and Graham \"were in possession of information confirming what they already believed; namely, the fires posed a serious risk to the edge of Canberra, and the impact was likely to occur within the following 24 hours\".</p><p>By early morning on January 18, the four men \"all recognised the potential for fires to impinge on the urban edge at some time during the afternoon or evening\". Yet there was no warning to the community.</p><p>The officers had \"lulled themselves into a false sense of security\" that because they had stopped fires on the urban edge in December 2001, they could do it again. \"As a result of this self-delusion, they deliberately withheld information from the community in the belief that they would as they had in 2001 stop the fires in the grasslands, and they did not want to alarm the community,\" she wrote.</p><p>The officials involved told the inquiry there were genuine reasons for their actions their predictions of fire spreading to the urban edge discussed in meetings at the ESB were worst-case scenarios, they expected the most dangerous fire day to be Monday, January 20; there was an expectation the fires could be held in eaten-out grasslands; and they believed a forecast for milder weather on the evening of January 18 would aid the firefighting effort.</p><p>While the ESB took measures to warn rural residents on the evening of January 17 about the fires escaping containment lines and threatening property in the Tidbinbilla area, only half on a list of 96 lessees were contacted. Doogan found none of the residents of the Uriarra, Stromlo and Pierces Creek forestry settlements had been warned.</p><p>She was also satisfied a media statement issued by the ESB at 9.50pm on January 17 which warned urban residents only of increasing smoke the next day was \"inadequate and misleading\".</p><p>Lucas-Smith told the inquiry that by 7.30am on January 18 he knew in his \"heart of hearts\" it was inevitable the fires would burn into Canberra's suburbs. A planning meeting at 9.30am had also discussed the potential for the McIntyre's Hut fire to strike an area from Weston Creek to Greenway. ACT Forests manager Hilton Taylor, working in the planning section of the ESB, estimated on the morning of January 18 that the fires could hit the rural-urban interface from Hawker to Weston Creek by 3pm. Operations manager Tony Graham received that information but could not recall why he did not react.</p><p>Doogan was satisfied Taylor's prediction was \"not acted on, nor was it used as the basis for an urgent warning to the community\". The firestorm did hit at 3pm, just 20 minutes after the first emergency warning was broadcast.</p><p>Doogan found planner Rick McRae had used a system to trigger community warnings that was \"seriously flawed and constitutes a dangerous way to operate in an emergency management environment\".</p><p>She made 73 recommendations which the Government has pledged to respond to by February. The one that perhaps has it in the tightest bind is that emergency services be taken out of the Department of Justice and Community Safety and returned to being a stand-alone authority, answerable directly to the minister. The move would take out \"unnecessary layers of bureaucracy\" and reduce the chance of a bureaucrat usually \"with no special knowledge or experience in emergency management\" being in charge.</p><p>At the time of the bushfires, the ESB was part of the department but McLeod later recommended emergency services be run by an independent statutory authority, headed by a chief executive officer. The Government agreed: the authority was created and Peter Dunn was engaged as the commissioner in November, 2003. But in the June budget this year, the Government returned the services to the department, to save more than $2million in administration costs.</p><p>Dunn subsequently resigned.</p><p>Corbell guaranteed the emergency services would retain operational independence. Three of the four arms of emergency services in the ACT are not convinced. Volunteers in the Rural Fire Service and the State Emergency Service and employees of the Ambulance Service have supported Doogan's call for the return of an independent statutory authority. Only the Fire Brigade says the previous Dunn administration did not prove a success.</p><p>As another chapter closes in the bushfire tragedy, Doogan found a comment by Phil Cheney to the inquiry worth repeating in her letter to Simon Corbell .</p><p>Cheney said, \"If similar weather and fuel conditions were to occur in the ACT, and historical accounts indicate this is possible, then a fire starting under extreme weather 40km north-west of Canberra could burn into the suburbs in two to three hours.</p><p>\"It is therefore fanciful in the extreme to imagine that any emergency services organisation is going to stop fires and provide the total protection under these conditions\".</p><p>Corbell says there has been a complete overhaul of emergency services since 2003: extra equipment, additional personnel, funding increased by 40 per cent to more than $60million, fuel-management strategies in place, a cross-border agreement signed with NSW, new communication and weather- monitoring systems installed.</p><p>Corbell was confident that if the Tumut fire earlier this month had threatened Canberra a range of mechanisms would have kicked in to alert residents.</p><p>\"We would have seen a much more coordinated response than we did see in 2003,\" he said.</p><p>Stanhope, meanwhile, did apologise this week to the people of Canberra. \"As the head of government I acknowledge that mistakes and errors of judgment were made in the fighting of the fire,\" he said. \"As head of government I apologise for those mistakes and errors of judgment and feel immense sorrow at the consequence.\"</p><p>He believed the territory had learnt the lessons of those mistakes.</p><p>Phil Cheney can only hope history does not repeat: \"In another 20 years, memories will dull.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-7840660</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4MMP-V1F0-TX4S-M32H-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"12\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>December 23, 2006 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N923120MQ</classCode><className>CORONERS COURTS &amp;

Given questions over the constitutional validity of the Act, it's most likely there will be a repeat of the cycle of claim and counterclaim over the legitimacy of the process until the Supreme Court gives a ruling sometime in 2008 or 2009.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Between 2002 and July this year the Howard Government relied upon legal advice that the original military commissions established by President GeorgeW. Bush were valid. That advice was wrong and the US Supreme Court said so in July. Presumably, the Government has new legal advice saying that the new Military Commissions Act is valid, but what if that is again wrong? The advice needs to be made public so that it can be subject to full scrutiny lest an Australian government sits on its hands once again while an Australian citizen languishes.</p><p>Donald Rothwell</p><p>Professor of International Law</p><p>Australian National University, ACT</p><p/><p>LEIGH Sales (''Why our Gitmo inmate matters'', Opinion, 11/12) omits a key reason why the complex issue of David Hicks does not resonate in middle Australia. Emotions aside, the problem with most arguments about Hicks, on both sides, is that they centre on false assumptions and profound ignorance of the international law applying.</p><p>Whether Hicks can or should be tried or not, by anyone, is a completely separate issue from the undoubted legitimacy of his detention as a captured combatant under that part of International Humanitarian Law known as the Laws of Armed Conflict (based on the Geneva and Hague Conventions).</p><p>However unfortunate for him, Hicks can continue to be legitimately detained until the relevant war ends or he is released earlier on captured combatant parole (like most Italian prisoners of war from 1943 onwards). Such a parole would involve him promising to take no further action as a belligerent, and this being guaranteed and enforced by some recognised international authority. Any violation or renunciation of the parole would mean renewed detention.</p><p>Resolving Hicks's situation really centres on three issues. First, we need to convince the US not to try him under US or international law. This is as much a political and strategic matter as it is a legal one.</p><p>Second, since the US is our ally in the same war, under the Third Geneva Convention we could then negotiate with the US as the detaining power, and the International Committee of the Red Cross as the protecting power, to detain Hicks as a captured combatant in Australia. Whether he can or cannot be tried for terrorism offences under Australian law would not affect this.</p><p>Third, we could negotiate with the US and ICRC about how any subsequent release on parole would be accepted and enforced. Hicks's Australian lawyers have apparently declared he would accept and abide by such a parole.</p><p>Consistent application of the law, not emotion or politics, must govern resolution of this complex issue. But, should the war continue, releasing Hicks on captured combatant parole also offers a political and strategic resolution, as well as a legal one.</p><p>Neil James</p><p>Executive director</p><p>Australia Defence Association</p><p>Canberra, ACT</p><p/><p>LEIGH Sales says ''Australians, in the main, have never been particularly troubled by'' the the US assertion of its right to detain and try David Hicks under a legal process of its choosing. But nowhere in her article does she try to explain why this might be the case.</p><p>Could it be because Hicks was captured fighting for the enemy in Afghanistan in the months following the September 11 terror attacks? Or that Australians have more pressing concerns than the plight of a self-confessed anti-semite and terrorist sympathiser, to say the least? Hicks will get a fair trial one day, but let's not forget that he -- and he alone -- got himself into this situation.</p><p>Lidia Tsen</p><p>Chatswood, NSW</p><p/><p>THE man turned his back on Australia and joined a terrorist organisation that has Australia as one of its targets. I think anybody who joins, supports or finances a terrorist organisation should be declared an outlaw and be deprived of all citizenship rights and protections, and all finances and assets held directly or indirectly be forfeited to the nation.</p><p>C. Morgan</p><p>Acacia Ridge, Qld</p><p/><p>PERHAPS I'm naive, but as David Hicks's alleged offences occurred in Afghanistan, wouldn't it be logical and fair if it could be arranged for him to be tried in Kabul, under Afghani law? Would that satisfy the protagonists both here and in the US?</p><p>Peter Bell</p><p>Camberwell, Vic</p><p/><p>I GUESS that if George W. Bush and John Howard can keep David Hicks in solitary confinement in Guantanamo Bay until he loses the balance of his mind, he will be unfit to stand trial and so it will be unnecessary to prove that he is guity of anything.</p><p>B.A. Welsh</p><p>Tea Gardens, NSW</p><p/><p>Give public schools the freedom to hire and fire</p><p>KEVIN Rudd's vow to raise the standard of schooling is music to my ears (''Rudd puts teachers on notice'', 9-10/12). I have long believed that the greatest defect of our commonwealth is that low-income children are forced into low-achieving schools.</p><p>But can we believe Rudd? Can Labor defy its own unions? Will Rudd have the stomach to replace weak teachers with strong teachers? We are not talking here about merely sacking the few teachers who abuse children. We are talking about replacing teachers who are not confident in literacy, numeracy or effective classroom performance.</p><p>Furthermore, it's a fact of life that good teachers cannot be identified by qualifications alone, nor by any remote-control procedure operated by state education departments.</p><p>The only hope of raising teaching standards in poor suburbs is to give those schools the huge advantage that independent schools have long enjoyed -- self-government, which enables them to employ the best teachers they can get to meet their students' needs.</p><p>Philip O'Carroll</p><p>North Fitzroy, Vic</p><p/><p>NSW can easily match Queensland when it comes to dumbing down science classes (''Pop songs are weird science'', 9-10/12). My Year 7 daughter may not be listening to pop lyrics just yet, but she and her friends are kept entertained during science classes with episodes of Futurama, the TV cartoon series by the creator of The Simpsons.</p><p>I'm impressed that the school managed to change her attitude towards science from fascination into boredom within the first term. How is this possible? Children are natural scientists -- they love exploring and experimenting. Good schools and a good curriculum channel this natural aptitude and make the natural world a fascinating place. Mediocre schools don't expect much from their students and find it easier to stick them in front of a TV screen to watch cartoons. I wonder how many of our potential organic chemists and medical researchers will wither under this inane teaching environment.</p><p>Peter Gibson</p><p>Medowie, NSW</p><p/><p>IT'S high time a federal government demanded ''quality control'' from all education systems and not just public schools. A federal Labor government would of course see that this quality control is matched by a return to much-needed ''quality funding'' of public education by a federal government, will it not?</p><p>Narelle Grant</p><p>Dubbo, NSW</p><p/><p>WILL the ALP's Baldrick please own up. Whose cunning plan was it for Kevin Rudd to curry favour with swinging voters by getting stuck into public education? I mean, if a bloke wanted to vote for a short-arsed, dorky-voiced, teacher-bashing, God-bothering right-winger, don't you think he'd choose the experienced one we've already got?</p><p>Clive Forster</p><p>Coromandel Valley, SA</p><p/><p>Swan stays inside the tent</p><p>SO Wayne Swan remains as Opposition treasury spokesman (''Rudd in push to heal ALP'', 11/12). The same Wayne Swan who said the Government's $600 family benefit payment wasn't real and the same genius who recommended Labor oppose the 2005 budget's tax cuts? Perhaps Kevin Rudd thinks it better that Swan be inside the tent pissing out, than outside the tent pissing in.</p><p>Charles Shavitz</p><p>Brisbane City, Qld</p><p/><p>A REAL opportunity has been missed by new Deputy Labor leader Julia Gillard not being prepared to challenge Deputy Liberal leader and federal Treasurer Peter Costello in a head-to-head contest on economic management issues.</p><p>This is most unfortunate, as voters would be greatly assisted by Gillard being really tested in the treasury portfolio responsibility, rather than industrial relations where the Government has for some time been polling poorly and the ACTU has undertaken most of the public campaigning against the Work Choices laws.</p><p>The next federal election will be largely determined by voters with large mortgages in marginal seats. Whilst Work Choices will attract some interest, the key issues will still be interest rates and economic management.</p><p>Peter Maskell</p><p>Carrum Downs, Vic</p><p/><p>Let foresters, cattle return</p><p>THE Victorian high country bushfires of 2003 and now 2006 can be seen as the logical outcome of four decades of anti-forestry activism (''Fires spreading, fears of worse to come'', 11/12). By locking out the foresters and mountain cattlemen from much of our high country, successive governments have excluded those who have the skills to best care for this country. The ill-equipped National Parks Service does not have the knowledge nor the financial resources to properly maintain these areas. The end result of this community neglect is devastating and all-consuming bushfires that essentially wipe these areas clean of vegetation.</p><p>Given the season, it's akin to the conservation lobby making large purchases on the community credit card and not paying off the monthly interest (undergrowth and fuel). The result is an explosive burgeoning of debt for which the debt collectors (fire) will inevitably demand payment. The cost is born in particular by the communities in these areas and the fire fighters who give up their time to fight them. A more sustainable policy would be to invite the foresters and cattlemen back into these areas so that they can be better cared for.</p><p>Evan Evans</p><p>Lindisfarne, Tas</p><p/><p>I'M at a complete loss to understand why the Australian authorities have not asked Canada for help in fighting the forest fires. In Canada, we have thousands of trained, experienced and skilled forest-fire fighters. Permit me to remind Australians that it's winter here. We are hip-deep in snow. So these folks, male and female, are available.</p><p>It's important to understand that there are effective techniques, developed over decades, for fighting forest fires. Our professionals know these techniques.</p><p>C. Alexander Brown</p><p>Ottawa, Canada</p><p/><p>Not fair to full-time parents</p><p>OFFERING tax deductions for childcare is a ludicrous idea. People who choose to work and use childcare already enjoy a higher disposable income by doing so, compared to those who stay home and care for their children themselves. There is no justification for a tax cut on top of this. In fact, such a concession would actively discriminate against those parents who forgo income to stay home and tend to their children.</p><p>Cameron Martin</p><p>Mayfield, NSW</p><p/><p>TAX breaks for childcare: the concession we have to have.</p><p>Kim Hillier</p><p>Cooktown, Qld</p><p/><p>Iran's provocation to Jews</p><p>WHILE the Middle East rests on a knife's edge, the Iranian Government has sought to further destabilise the situation by hosting a Holocaust conference this week (''Holocaust denier in 'farcical' summit'', 11/12).</p><p>This conference has no serious research purpose but, rather, seeks to offend Israel, Jews worldwide and all civilised, decent people by mocking a tragedy that still lives on in the memories of survivors.</p><p>Iran's President Ahmadinejad has ensured the conference's outcome by prejudging the Holocaust as ''a myth'' on various occasions in the past. His agenda is further exposed by the failure to include one credible historian on the list of invited participants; instead, it boasts discredited Holocaust-deniers such as Australian Frederick Toben.</p><p>At a time when international tensions are already running high about escalating problems in the Middle East, including Iran's efforts to obtain nuclear weaponry, this conference can only be seen as an another act of provocation and brinksmanship. That it's so calculatedly insulting to the memory of the millions cruelly murdered in the Holocaust inflames matters even more.</p><p>Geoffrey Zygier</p><p>Executive director</p><p>Executive Council of Australian Jewry</p><p>South Caulfield, Vic</p><p/><p>Dictatorial double standard</p><p>GOOD riddance to another butcher -- General Augusto Pinochet in Chile.

THE Cold War may be over as peace breaks out all over the globe _ except in Hollywood where the celebrity Divorce Wars continue to rage like a forest fire. Last year there was the battle between Sondro Locke and her superstar lover Clint Eastwood _ and another battle between LA Law's handsome Harry Hamlin and his disenchanted spouse actress Laura Johnson. Now the latest celebrity free-for-all involves the ubiquitous and very rich Donald Trump, and the lady he dumped _ his wife of 13 years, the mother of his three children, Czech born ex-model Ivana. And if one thinks that that bitter-sweet hit movie The War of the Roses, which chronicled the savagery between Michael Douglas and Kathleen Turner as the feuding, fighting Roses in Danny DeVito's hit movie was an exaggeration, one should think again. Life is far worse in reality, say most lawyers who have to separate the warring couples. Author Warren Adler, the man who chanced upon the idea for his bestselling book after meeting a shellshocked, newly-divorced businessman at a Washington cocktail party, noted: \"\"Since the movie came out I have been bombarded with stories of couple whose savagery and bitterness exceeded even what happened to the Roses.\" Attorney Gloria Allred, who has handled some of Hollywood's biggest divorce, added: \"\"Recently, I got involved in a custody dispute over a Rolls-Royce . . . the husband returned the car with all the parts taken out and laid them out one by one on her front lawn.\"</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>Meanwhile, the wars rage unabated _ with millions at stake. Donald and Ivana are providing the latest grist for ravenous readers. It seems that the blonde Ivana signed a pre-nuptial agreement before they wed, and then updated it on December 24, 1987. In it the billionaire indicated he was willing to give her $25 million of his $1.7 billion fortune, plus the family's 45-room mansion in Greenwich, Connecticut, plus $350,000 a year for herself and $100,000 for each of the three children until they are 21. Ivana is being offered a free month at the family's Palm Beach mansion, and if she promises to leave the couple's Trump Tower apartment in New York, he will sweeten the deal with another $4 million. She _ through her bevy of high-priced lawyers _ contends the agreement isn't worth the paper it is written on. In fact, they say, the rules of the marital game have changed because Ivana was responsible for increasing her husband's fortune. The Trump Split is wilder than anything Dynasty or Dallas dreamed up. The twists come fast and furious: Donald has a mistress who is pregnant, the couple may kiss and make up, Ivana is a gold-digger, he is the villain, why, he even made off with some of her jewels. It's the juiciest divorce scandal to come along _ well, since the last one. Not long ago beautiful former Charlie's Angel Jaclyn Smith went to war with her British film-maker husband Tony Richmond. Richmond sought custody of the two children aged seven and three _ as well as support from his wealthy 43-year-old estranged wife. She claimed he was having an affair with a make-up artist. American talk-show host Johnny Carson's right-hand man Ed McMahon is embroiled in a particularly nasty fight with his ex-model wife Victoria. He is claiming she has been sharing her affections with a local cop _ as well as her tennis coach. And in Beverly Hills, LA Law's Harry Hamlin is feuding with his wife over his friendship with sexy actress Nicollette Sheridan. Not long ago, Barbra Streisand's former lover Elliott Gould filed to divorce his 37-year-old wife Jennifer Bogart. Their combat has been particularly brutal: they divorced each other after marrying in 1973 _ a union that lasted less than a year. They remarried three years later, had two children and are now apart. Other combatants going their separate ways include Chips TV star Erik Estrada who has dumped his wife of three years, Peggy Rowe; British heavy metal rocker Ozzy Osbourne who has been barred from contacting his wife Sharon after police charged him with threatening to kill her; and top singer John Cougar Mellencamp, 37, whose wife Vicky wants to end their eight-year marriage. Then there's Bruce Springsteen, who broke up with his actress wife. Tom Cruise and wife Mimi Rogers have split _ and so far, it seems to be amicable _ if there's such a thing. But with Cruise commanding $6 million a film, and the hottest property in Hollywood, there could be disputes when the property is divided. In many cases, couples announce there is no animosity _ but it doesn't take long for the accusations to turn vicious. In the end, no one really wins. The casualties are high, families are left emotionally shattered and the combatants spend millions of dollars to seek an uneasy peace. Last year Oscar-winning actor William Hurt and former dancer Sandra Jennings, the mother of his young son, laid their private lives on the line in a courtroom brawl. But unlike some of the more star-studded celebrity squabbles, Hurt and Jennings were not officially married _ although today couples need not be legally wed for war to flare up. Michelle Triola Marvin sued the late star Lee Marvin in what was the first \"\"palimony\" case. Michelle, now married to actor Dick Van Dyke, won, but her award was merely a token amount. Then there was the case of Clint Eastwood and Sondra Locke, who are still locked in a no-win conflagration after more than a decade together. Eastwood has been through the battlefield before, following his divorce from his long-time wife Maggie. The settlement ran in excess of $25 million _ but Clint thought it was worth it so he could be with Locke, his \"\"great love\". The accusations have calmed in one of the biggest cases involving Steven Spielberg and his beautiful actress wife Amy Irving, who have gone their separate ways. Reports are that Amy emerged with $100 million and is reportedly pregnant to her latest boyfriend, while Spielberg's companion Kate Capshaw _ star of his second Indiana Jones movie _ is expecting the director's child. The settlement didn't break Spielberg, who is worth at least $250 million. But unlike other savage legal battles, the director of ET kept the dispute private behind closed doors. And currently it's all quiet on the western front with Oscar winner Jane Fonda and politician husband Tom Hayden, who are still trying to sort out their financial affairs on the road to divorce. The divorce probably will be swift, but the settlement could take years and the Fonda-Hayden fortune _ reckoned to be around $200 million _ is in the big league. Yet despite the accusations and charges, celebrity divorcees seldom appear in court, even though the law in California says that when a couple splits, their accumulated estate should be split 50-50. Many skirmishes are fought on the sidelines, and can get quite hot and heavy. The Mike Tyson-Robin Givens split was such a case. Theirs was a brutal, no-punches-pulled brawl that got bloodier than some of Mike's championship bouts. It was played out mostly in the newspapers and on TV. Givens claimed she wasn't after the champion's money _ then a month later her lawyer Raoul Felder filed a $125 million libel suit against the champion for lambasting her and her mother in print. A few years ago when talk-show host Johnny Carson's third wife Joanna sued her husband, she asked for $220,000 in support . . . that wasn't $220,000 a year, it was $220,000 a month. The request included such essential expenses as $37,000 worth of jewels 12 times a year. When Joan Collins finally dumped her Swedish manager husband Peter Holm, he tried to grab a chunk of the Dynasty star's millions by demanding thousands in monthly alimony so he could live in the style to which he had become accustomed while married to TV's Alexis Carrington. That one went to court and Holm settled for considerably less. When Sly Stallone's long-suffering wife Sasha, who pre-Rocky had supported him when he was out of work, divorced him, she was understandably anxious to get enough to support herself and her two sons. She ended up with a relatively modest $25 million. Stallone's statuesque second wife Brigitte Nielsen then dumped him, and tried to make off with half of his fortune. She finally settled for a few million.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PIC OF HEAD SHOT OF HAMLIN, SMITH, EASTWOOD, LOCKE AND</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML9003242004P14628</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">COURIER-MAILLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49MB-YGT0-01S8-G24P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1398\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>COURIER-MAIL</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1990 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"24\" month=\"03\" year=\"1990\"><dateText>March 24, 1990 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000693</classCode><className>FAMILY LAW</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"85\"><classCode>ST000DH0Q</classCode><className>AGREEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX001085</classCode><className>MARRIAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp;

When civil government returns to Fiji, as it must, perhaps it should look at following Costa Rica's lead and disbanding the lot.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">John Rice</p><p>Largs Bay, SA</p><p/><p>YOUR reporter in Suva describes people wearing a blue ribbon to symbolise their backing for the deposed prime minister, Laisenia Qarase, following the latest coup in Fiji (''Qarase resigned to hopeless situation'', 6/12). Most people who are wearing the ribbon support parliamentary rule and democracy, rather than Mr Qarase.</p><p>The Blue Ribbon campaign was initiated after the 2000 coup, led by George Speight, when Mr Qarase served as interim prime minister in an unelected government. Women's organisations involved in the campaign have been at the forefront of criticising Mr Qarase's just-ousted government over corruption highlighted in the Agriculture Department scandal; Qarase's failed attempt to include amnesty clauses in the Reconciliation Tolerance and Unity Bill; his opportunistic electoral alliance with Fijian nationalists, some of whom have escaped any punishment for their role in the events of May 2000.</p><p>The revival of the blue ribbon -- the colour of Fiji's flag -- symbolises support for democratic rights, not for one or other politician. The tragedy of Fiji is that civil society groups in the Pacific need year-round support from Australia for their work to promote better governance -- instead, we wait until a crisis erupts and send troops and warships to sit off the coast in futile impotence.</p><p>Peter Burnett</p><p>Fitzroy, Vic</p><p/><p>COMMODORE Bainimarama stages Fiji's fourth coup, basically because he was dissatisfied over the leniency with which the third coup plotters were being treated. And our Prime Minister pooh-poohs the very suggestion we should intervene militarily. Heavens above, as if Australia is the sort of country that goes around invading other countries! It's obviously the season for irony.</p><p>John O'Hara</p><p>Mount Waverley, Vic</p><p/><p>THE military in Fiji launched a coup supposedly because the people who pulled the last coup may be pardoned. What sort of sense does that make?</p><p>It's only the manipulation of a democratically elected parliament by a tinpot wannabe dictator who can't get his own way. It's sad for the people of Fiji.</p><p>Greg Stubbs</p><p>Mooroobool, Qld</p><p/><p>WITH the unrest in Fiji, East Timor, West Papua, Solomon Islands and Tonga, and in other regional nations presumably to come, Australia is going to become more involved, whether we want to or not, and our focus will inexorably move to this area. I trust our Government implicitly in the way it spends our taxes, but I'm struggling to work out how large, multi-million dollar Abrams battle tanks fit into this scheme of things.</p><p>Ian Pollock</p><p>Maleny, Qld</p><p/><p>TWO questions regarding Fiji's latest coup and other Pacific island troubles.</p><p>First, why does Fiji have an army as well as a police force? There is no credible external threat to Fiji's territory or sovereignty and the financial burden of maintaining an army is surely better spent on more useful things. I suppose an argument is made that the army pays its own way by being hired out on various UN peace-keeping missions from time to time. There's an irony.</p><p>Second, what is it about Samoa that keeps it out of the headlines? The answer is that it's a nation of clever and considerate people who developed a system of governance that, for more than a century, has balanced Western structure and Polynesian culture. In his A Footnote to History: Eight Years of Trouble in Samoa, Robert Louis Stevenson chronicled the events and machinations by which Samoans dealt with not one, but three competing colonial powers, and their own internal divisions leading to the creation of a peaceful, law-abiding society.</p><p>The fundamental structures are still in place and perhaps explain why Samoa was the first Pacific island colony to achieve independence (in 1962), and why Samoans still live in peace with each other and their neighbours. Perhaps the Fijians should look to their Polynesian neighbours for guidance in these dark hours.</p><p>Mark Reid</p><p>Doncaster, Vic</p><p/><p>JOHN Howard recently said that it was in Australia's interests to join the coalition of the willing in the invasion of Iraq, a distant country which had never posed a threat to us. He said on Tuesday it was not in our interests to become involved militarily in assisting Fiji, a friendly neighbour. He never mentioned the interests of the Iraqis or the Fijians? He disgraces us all.</p><p>D. Law</p><p>West Hobart, Tas</p><p/><p>I WILL tell you the reason John Howard will not send Australian troops to Fiji: we have none left.</p><p>Bill Grieve</p><p>Enoggera, Qld</p><p/><p>Flintoff can't handle pressure of the captaincy</p><p>I READ Andrew Ramsey's article (''Deficient line-up must be changed'', 6/12) suggesting changes that must be made to England's Test team if we are to have any chance of retaining the Ashes. Of course everyone, apart from the coach, Duncan Fletcher, knew this, even before the first Test in Brisbane, in the same way that we should have chosen the best ''stumper'' in England, Chris Read, rather than Fletcher's favourite, Geraint Jones.</p><p>But I will go further and pray that Michael Vaughan will be fit enough to play and relieve Andrew Flintoff of the pressure of the captaincy. Finally, I would invite Fletcher, who must have been behind England's craven display on Tuesday morning in Adelaide, to catch the next plane back to England. This would then make way for Geoffrey Boycott, if he could be persuaded to accept the challenge of winning the next three Tests by giving the team the benefit of his great experience.</p><p>As an aside, speaking as an umpire for the past 20 seasons, I would have cracked down on Shane Warne's negative bowling. In the Central Yorkshire Cricket League, a ball pitching 15cm outside leg stump is a wide.</p><p>Norman Hazell</p><p>Coldstream, Vic</p><p/><p>(but normally Wakefield, West Yorkshire)</p><p>ENGLAND have repeated the mistakes of the West Indies (Brian Lara) and India (Sachin Tendulkar) by appointing their best player to the captaincy, regardless of their suitability for the role. Andrew Flintoff is clearly bereft of both ideas and inspiration, and is batting like a rabbit caught in the glare of the headlights.</p><p>John Christie</p><p>Oatley, NSW</p><p/><p>RIGHT now I'd say the odds of Kevin and Julia regaining the treasury benches would be a shade better than those of Freddie&amp;Co retaining that mystical little urn.</p><p>Max Vallis</p><p>Wembley, WA</p><p/><p>AFTER Tuesday's performance, it's time for Amanda Vanstone to do what she does so well: terminate the England team's visas and send the players home. It is the only humane thing to do.</p><p>Anthony Alexander</p><p>North Sydney, NSW</p><p/><p>WILL Her Majesty be as quick to congratulate and bestow honours on our Test team as she was when England won the Ashes last year? I doubt it, but then there is always our cricket tragic PM to come to the party, isn't there?</p><p>Mike Yalden</p><p>Kiama, NSW</p><p/><p>I WILL never understand why republicans would want to cut ties with England. The boundless kindness shown through her sportsmen towards us in this colony is legendary. They always find a method of keeping up our spirits, boosting our egos and giving us all a jolly good chuckle.</p><p>Steve Atkins</p><p>Berowra Heights, NSW</p><p/><p>Respect goes both ways</p><p>IT comes as no surprise that several boys from an Islamic school desecrated the Bible and are responsible for abuse of teachers, especially non-Muslims (''Muslim boys urinated on Bible'', 6/12). I spent three years working at an Islamic college and witnessed many cases of abuse both verbal and physical from students towards, in particular, non-Muslim female teachers.</p><p>Respect goes both ways, and while these schools receive government funding they should be more open to scrutiny.</p><p>Andrew Bullen</p><p>Bull Creek, WA</p><p/><p>THE principal of the East Preston Islamic College doesn't believe the schoolboys who urinated and spat on a Bible before setting it alight realised the significance of their acts.</p><p>Really? Such acts of gross profanity were not conscious, deliberate defilement? Next thing, someone will suggest it was all a conspiracy on the part of infidels who ''set up'' the little darlings to discredit Islam. After all, one hardly expects anyone to bring a Bible on a Muslim school camping excursion, does one? And to think that we, the taxpayers, donate almost $4million a year to the school involved. Indeed, we really are quite mad.</p><p>Richard Congram</p><p>Carindale, Qld</p><p/><p>WAS the adolescent stupidity of a couple of Muslim kids who urinated on a Bible really worthy of a front-page story with picture? As a school teacher, I see a lot of kids do dumb things every day -- none of which need to be on the front page of a national newspaper. In the context of recent race riots in Sydney and a genuine tension in the Muslim community, it's surely irresponsible of your newspaper to elevate such minor misdeeds to this level.</p><p>Brett Coelho</p><p>South Yarra, Vic</p><p/><p>PISSING on a Bible is front-page news now? What a sad little country we are.</p><p>Chris Bond</p><p>West Perth, WA</p><p/><p>Gillard: substance and style</p><p>LEAVE Julia Gillard alone. No comments on her hair or clothing, they're irrelevant. She's a smart woman and her marital status and personal life illustrate the modern women in politics who are great role models for the younger generation. Substance and style go hand in hand.</p><p>Pam Papadopoulos</p><p>Prahran, Vic</p><p/><p>Where's the evidence?</p><p>I SHOULD be most grateful if Barry Cohen (''Let a sane leader get on with his job'', Opinion, 4/12) would produce the authoritative evidence to support his assertion that Dr H.V. Evatt was ''declared clinically insane''.</p><p>In all the years that I had the privilege to work for and be associated with Dr Evatt and the ALP, I never heard the expression ''a chip off the old Doc'', nor the incident in a Double Bay restaurant to which Cohen refers.</p><p>Cyril Wyndham</p><p>Charlestown, NSW</p><p/><p>The system is not working</p><p>AS the drought continues, forests in our water catchments are parched. Fires are burning uncontrolled on both sides of the Great Dividing Range, some perilously close to the source of Melbourne's dwindling water supply. The Murray-Darling Basin Commission has confirmed from previous research that a major high-intensity fire decreases the water harvested from eucalyptus water catchments by almost half. Water flows do not return to normal for about 100 years.</p><p>Flows into the Murray and Snowy rivers are now starting to show the effect of the huge 2003 bushfires. Those fires were the result of inadequate fire suppression and environmental neglect that prevented sensible fuel management. Both those vital services were historically provided by foresters, the timber industry, hydro-electricity workers, graziers and, before them, indigenous people. Now, under a lock-up policy, there are very few people taking care of the catchments in our beautiful high country.</p><p>Victoria's forest-fire management system failed, not only in the 2003 bushfires, but also in 2005, when a 20ha prescribed fire was botched in Wilsons Promontory park, and again in January this year when fires devastated national parks and private property in the Grampians and Brisbane Ranges.</p><p>The Bracks Government has consistently manipulated due processes to avoid proper scrutiny of its policies and actions and acknowledge the bleeding obvious -- the system is not working.</p><p>The Stretton Group was formed to bring the burning truth of fire, fuel and management of public land to public attention through greater transparency of the public sector processes involved, no matter how uncomfortable this truth may be. If we want the right to live in this land, we must respect its ecology and the place of fire in it.</p><p>Stewart McArthur (Convenor)</p><p>Bill Middleton</p><p>Athol Hodgson</p><p>Dr Peter Attiwill</p><p>Simon Paton</p><p>David Packham</p><p/><p>Colonialism does not work</p><p>GEORGEW. Bush is in denial over the disaster in Iraq. UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan has described the conflict as worse than civil war. Hardline US envoy to the UN John Bolton has been forced to quit because the new Democrat-controlled will not renew his tenure (''Bolton jumps before the big shove'', 6/12). Is it any wonder that the Middle East is in crisis? Surely, the entire world must now see that the failed policies of the US and its supporters are the reason. Imposing your will upon another people will never bring about the change you desire. Colonialism does not work, Iraq being the latest example. Israel has also failed in its sad attempt to subjugate the Palestinians. Peace will only ever come about with justice.</p><p>Moammar Mashni</p><p>Hawthorn, Vic</p><p/><p>FIRST BYTE</p><p>If only Barry Jones was available for Tintin's front bench.

Gary Walsh considers some of the options.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So you're ready to head for Europe, and the thought of a day or so enclosed in a metal tube 10 kilometres above terra firma doesn't really appeal. You're in stopover mode. The tyranny of distance is something Australian travellers are well accustomed to - the stopover might have been invented with us in mind. A night or two in a pleasant hotel, some much-needed sleep, a little sightseeing and a head start in dealing with jetlag are all welcome. But where should you stop, and why? Here's a brief guide to the main stopover spots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Bangkok</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The seething Thai capital can be confronting even for experienced travellers. Unlike Singapore, where the impact of Asia is less than dramatic, Bangkok assaults the visitor with sights, sounds and smells, so that sensory overload is a real possibility. Take a deep breath and wade into the city's sweaty embrace - here, an immersion course is the only way to learn.</p><p>For: Cultural richness and some splendid sights. The Grand Palace is a collection of gilded, bejewelled temples and pavilions of extraordinary beauty, and there are other fine buildings around the city, such as the Jim Thompson House and the Vimanmek teak palace. The wide, languid Chao Phraya River splits the city in two, and should be enjoyed for the relative tranquillity it provides - you can catch a local ferry, a tourist boat or a roaring V8 longtail boat to see the river, the offshoot canals and the life</p><p>alongside them. The devaluation of the baht means that Bangkok is a cheap place to visit, and the shopping is excellent. Thai silk and clothes are the best value.</p><p>Against: Bangkok's dreadful traffic. If your airline's timing is bad, you can spend a ridiculously large proportion of your stopover on the road between Don Muang Airport and the city, which is why the airport hotels are almost always full. Expect the airport-city drive to take anything from 30 minutes to four hours, depending on the time of day/traffic conditions/weather and a range of imponderables. The road chaos also makes getting around town something of a trial, and Bangkok is very polluted. The honky tonk nightlife of girlie bars and massage parlours is, for some, a big attraction. For those horrified by the exploitation, avoiding the spectacle is simple, as the tourist sex trade is concentrated in three areas - Patpong, Nana Plaza and Soi Cowboy.</p><p>Kuala Lumpur</p><p>The Mahathir-Anwar battle - troops in the streets, riots, demonstrations, a general air of tension - isn't likely to enhance KL's reputation as a stopover city. And Kuala Lumpur struggles to come up with attractions at any time, so you can treat the city simply as a refreshment stop. There are some excellent hotels - the Regent, in particular, is among the world's finest - so you could spend a day or so in pleasant R&amp;R by the pool, with occasional shopping forays and perhaps a brief city tour.</p><p>For: If you're into these things, you can check out the Petronas Towers: the rather phallic-looking twin skyscrapers are the world's tallest buildings. Although this is Malaysia, the Chinatown section of KL is the most interesting bit of town. At night, markets selling everything from cheap T-shirts to knock-off designer goods are set up along the streets of Chinatown. There is also good eating around here. KL has some splendid colonial architecture (note in particular the railway station), a good museum and a number of interesting Islamic buildings, including the central mosque.</p><p>Against: Try political instability for starters. The new airport is a long way from town, and decent public transport connections are a bit iffy. Traffic can be chaotic, although not on the Bangkok scale, and pollution high, especially if there is a repeat of the Indonesian forest fire fiasco. KL is light on must-see attractions. Consider making your stopover in Penang or another of Malaysia's islands instead, although it will mean tacking on a couple of domestic flights. If you're flying with Malaysia Airlines, inquire about stopover deals - free sidetrips are frequently offered, air fares included.</p><p>Singapore</p><p>It used to market itself as Instant Asia, which was a bit inaccurate as Singapore is more like Asia As Theme Park. There's an air of unreality about it when compared with Bangkok or Hong Kong, where life is lived more actively and traditionally on the streets. For a taste of what used to be, go to Chinatown in the early morning, when the food markets are in full swing, and the shophouses are busy with local customers. Get your name written in Chinese by a calligrapher or buy some paper offerings (ricepaper replicas of cars, videos, houses, even Bank of Hell traveller's cheques, all designed to be cremated with a deceased person to give them plenty of wherewithal in the afterlife).</p><p>For: It's clean, efficient and easy to manage, which makes it an unthreatening place for a day or two. Just don't expect to fall in love with the place. Chinatown, Little India (with its south Indian restaurants and temples) and Arab Street have real character. Sentosa Island is the nearest thing Singapore has to a resort. You can swim, play golf, explore the fortress war museum and the butterfly park, and feel at least a little divorced from the mobile phones, the traffic and the bustle of the city centre. Singapore Zoo is an outstanding open-range wildlife park, with a new night safari to enjoy, and Jurong Bird Park is another place to see the natural world in this unnatural city state.</p><p>Against: How can one be polite about this? Singapore can be pretty dull - for an Asian city it can seem strikingly un-Asian and sterile, although the government is trying to bring back some of the colour drained away by zealous redevelopment and sanitisation of raffish places like old Bugis Street. The very things that make it attractive to many - such as the neatness and orderliness - make it anathema to true Asiaphiles. You can't chew gum, spit or jaywalk for fear of substantial fines, which is probably no great loss. The strength of the Singapore dollar, which has been largely untouched by the Asian financial implosion, means shopping generally is poor value. You might consider making your Singapore stopover on Bintan Island - which is in Indonesia. It's just a 45-minute boat ride from Singapore, has fine beaches and resorts, and you have the lowly rupiah to deal with instead of the powerful Singapore dollar.</p><p>Hong Kong</p><p>Tourist numbers are down since the China handover, inexplicably, but Hong Kong remains a fine travel experience. The spectacle of the city rivals Sydney - a beautiful, busy harbour beneath the ramparts of Victoria Peak and the towers of the financial district. You realise quickly what a vertical city Hong Kong is. Like Manhattan, it heaves itself skywards, but there is much to discover at ground level.</p><p>For: Delve into some of the distinctive districts of Hong Kong Island (the HK Tourism Association produces excellent walking tour guides), such as Central and Western, where you'll still find traditional herbalists and snake shops amid the tower blocks. In parts, the streets are little more than stepladders, and the buildings keep the city below in constant shadow. Visit some of the city's Chinese temples and seek out the colonial vestiges of British rule. In reality, a year since the Brits departed, there have been few overt changes. Don't miss a ride on the world's best value public transport system (with the exception of the free Staten Island Ferry in New York), the Star Ferry across Hong Kong harbour. For a few cents you'll get a close-up view of the action on the water, and spectacular photos of Hong Kong Island to boot.</p><p>Against: Of the Asian alternatives, Hong Kong is the costliest city. Forget about trying to pick up duty free bargains when the HK dollar is pegged to the US currency, although there's still good value in electrical goods and made-to-measure clothing if you know where to head. And as the central city has the highest population density in the world, this is not the place for claustrophobics. The take-it-or-leave it attitude of Hong Kong's people can also be difficult to cope with - everyone from shopkeepers to taxi drivers will treat you with little respect, and forget about trying to win a bargaining battle with a trader.</p><p>Africa</p><p>Yes, it's possible to have a stopover in Africa on the way to Europe with South African Airways or Qantas/British Airways. For Africa, read Johannesburg and beyond. Few would want to spend more than a night in South Africa's biggest, baddest city, although a Soweto tour is fascinating. But just a few hours' drive (or a short flight) from Johannesburg is Kruger National Park, one of Africa's prime game-viewing destinations. There's also Sun City, for a kitschy, Las Vegas-style break, and a couple of hours away by aircraft, the spectacle of Victoria Falls.</p><p>For: It's quite simply the most intriguing of all the choices if you are prepared to wander a little way afield. The natural attractions are astonishing: Victoria Falls, which can be one of life's great experiences, and the sight of African animals in the wild. You don't need to stay at a luxury game lodge or join a 4WD tour to see Kruger park, much of which is accessible by conventional vehicle. Culturally, southern Africa is a fascinating, and sometimes confronting place, with Afrikaaner and English heritage bumping up against a variety of indigenous African societies. If you choose to stay in Jo'burg, don't miss Soweto, which may make you weep at the injustice of apartheid, but will also cause you to admire the resilience and achievements of its people. Tours are run by Sowetan people - try Jimmy's Face to Face Tours, which have been operating for more than a decade.</p><p>Against: You need more time than on an Asian stopover, and consequently it will be more expensive. You'll probably have to add an internal airfare or two, or the cost of car hire. If you just want to park your head on a pillow for a night or two, Johannesburg is not a very palatable option. Most hotels are in the Sandton district, well away from the danger zone of the central city, but you will still see armed guards on the streets between the major shopping centres, and feel the pervasive sense of menace. And it is a long way from Australia and from Europe. n</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>FOUR ILLUS: Singapore: clean and efficient but, er, rather dull.

Just don't expect to fall in love with the place. Chinatown, Little India (with its south Indian restaurants and temples) and Arab Street have real character. Sentosa Island is the nearest thing Singapore has to a resort. You can swim, play golf, explore the fortress war museum and the butterfly park, and feel at least a little divorced from the mobile phones, the traffic and the bustle of the city centre. Singapore Zoo is an outstanding open-range wildlife park, with a new night safari to enjoy, and Jurong Bird Park is another place to see the natural world in this unnatural city state.</p><p>Against: How can one be polite about this? Singapore can be pretty dull - for an Asian city it can seem strikingly un-Asian and sterile, although the government is trying to bring back some of the colour drained away by zealous redevelopment and sanitisation of raffish places like old Bugis Street. The very things that make it attractive to many - such as the neatness and orderliness - make it anathema to true Asiaphiles. You can't chew gum, spit or jaywalk for fear of substantial fines, which is probably no great loss. The strength of the Singapore dollar, which has been largely untouched by the Asian financial implosion, means shopping generally is poor value. You might consider making your Singapore stopover on Bintan Island - which is in Indonesia. It's just a 45-minute boat ride from Singapore, has fine beaches and resorts, and you have the lowly rupiah to deal with instead of the powerful Singapore dollar.</p><p>Continued page 32Hong Kong</p><p>Tourist numbers are down since the China handover, inexplicably, but Hong Kong remains a fine travel experience. The spectacle of the city rivals Sydney - a beautiful, busy harbour beneath the ramparts of Victoria Peak and the towers of the financial district. You realise quickly what a vertical city Hong Kong is. Like Manhattan, it heaves itself skywards, but there is much to discover at ground level.</p><p>For: Delve into some of the distinctive districts of Hong Kong Island (the HK Tourism Association produces excellent walking tour guides), such as Central and Western, where you'll still find traditional herbalists and snake shops amid the tower blocks. In parts, the streets are little more than stepladders, and the buildings keep the city below in constant shadow. Visit some of the city's Chinese temples and seek out the colonial vestiges of British rule. In reality, a year since the Brits departed, there have been few overt changes. Don't miss a ride on the world's best value public transport system (with the exception of the free Staten Island Ferry in New York), the Star Ferry across Hong Kong harbour. For a few cents you'll get a close-up view of the action on the water, and spectacular photos of Hong Kong Island to boot.</p><p>Against: Of the Asian alternatives, Hong Kong is the costliest city. Forget about trying to pick up duty free bargains when the HK dollar is pegged to the US currency, although there's still good value in electrical goods and made-to-measure clothing if you know where to head. And as the central city has the highest population density in the world, this is not the place for claustrophobics. The take-it-or-leave it attitude of Hong Kong's people can also be difficult to cope with - everyone from shopkeepers to taxi drivers will treat you with little respect, and forget about trying to win a bargaining battle with a trader.</p><p>Africa</p><p>Yes, it's possible to have a stopover in Africa on the way to Europe with South African Airways or Qantas/British Airways. For Africa, read Johannesburg and beyond. Few would want to spend more than a night in South Africa's biggest, baddest city, although a Soweto tour is fascinating. But just a few hours' drive (or a short flight) from Johannesburg is Kruger National Park, one of Africa's prime game-viewing destinations. There's also Sun City, for a kitschy, Las Vegas-style break, and a couple of hours away by aircraft, the spectacle of Victoria Falls.</p><p>For: It's quite simply the most intriguing of all the choices if you are prepared to wander a little way afield. The natural attractions are astonishing: Victoria Falls, which can be one of life's great experiences, and the sight of African animals in the wild. You don't need to stay at a luxury game lodge or join a 4WD tour to see Kruger park, much of which is accessible by conventional vehicle. Culturally, southern Africa is a fascinating, and sometimes confronting place, with Afrikaaner and English heritage bumping up against a variety of indigenous African societies. If you choose to stay in Jo'burg, don't miss Soweto, which may make you weep at the injustice of apartheid, but will also cause you to admire the resilience and achievements of its people. Tours are run by Sowetan people - try Jimmy's Face to Face Tours, which have been operating for more than a decade.</p><p>Against: You need more time than on an Asian stopover, and consequently it will be more expensive. You'll probably have to add an internal airfare or two, or the cost of car hire. If you just want to park your head on a pillow for a night or two, Johannesburg is not a very palatable option. Most hotels are in the Sandton district, well away from the danger zone of the central city, but you will still see armed guards on the streets between the major shopping centres, and feel the pervasive sense of menace. And it is a long way from Australia and from Europe.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Four photos: Singapore: clean and efficient but, er, rather dull; Hong Kong: Expensive but amazing; Bangkok: Traffic aplenty; Africa: pricey but exotic.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P84-PT70-TXN5-S35S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yhzvpdb16wyaoxqku0</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1998</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1713\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1998 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"10\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>October 18, 1998 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001498</classCode><className>RIOTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000482</classCode><className>DEVALUATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N812199KM</classCode><className>MASSAGE SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001418</classCode><className>PROSTITUTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N721110GM</classCode><className>HOTELS &amp; MOTELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0008WVI</classCode><className>DESTINATIONS &amp; ATTRACTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000482</classCode><className>DEVALUATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"62\"><classCode>N481100CC</classCode><className>AIRLINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>N812199KM</classCode><className>MASSAGE SERVICES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GX323</classCode><className>BANGKOK, THAILAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX201</classCode><className>KUALA LUMPUR, MALAYSIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC313</classCode><className>THAILAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

In countries such as Yemen or Nigeria that are busting at the seams, the biggest national export is people. Indeed, there may be no other contemporary issue that engages me more than the thorny, fraught and morally tortuous matter of accelerating mass migration from high birthrate poor countries to the wealthy, low birthrate West.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given that obsession, what is striking is not how much I've written about the subject but how little. I may have tried my hand at a couple of essays, the odd opinion page piece, but have avoided taking on the material in a novel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To the degree that I've entertained such a notion, I've put it off. I have a feeling that I could put off an immigration novel indefinitely, too. For I immediately envision a gory media aftermath in which I am smeared from San Francisco to Sydney for being a bigoted, xenophobic, right-wing kook.</p><p>Oh, you're safe as houses if you're keen to submit in print that to the US, Canada, Europe and Australia immigration is a net economic benefit and that Western countries desperately need new arrivals willing to do the jobs that ''natives don't want''. You're on solid ground extolling diversity, multiculturalism and tolerance. Preferably decry as nasty, mean-spirited and inhumane referendums such as the one passed in California -- later struck down by the US Supreme Court -- that would deny public services to illegal immigrants.</p><p>Lobby for amnesties and the rights of illegal immigrants to vote. Correction: never use the word illegal to describe people who are not supposed to be in your country to begin with. Prefer ''undocumented workers'', which makes their chancy status sound not like a consequence of law-breaking but like a bungling bureaucratic slip-up by your government.</p><p>If you're going to say anything negative about immigration -- which I do not advise -- make sure to couch your concerns entirely in terms of ''people traffickers'', whose cruel predation on the desperate it is acceptable to deplore.</p><p>In short, if you care about your reputation, not only as a writer but as decent human being, your safest bet is to champion today's historically unprecedented rates of immigration -- legal or illegal -- as the best thing to happen to the West since the invention of Post-it Notes.</p><p>Alas, I have a perverse streak a mile wide. In a world drowning in superfluous text, I have never seen the point in writing anything that duplicates the same watery tropes already sloshing about the internet in buckets. Moreover, I do not know what is good for me. I don't watch my back. When I think something I'm inclined to say it. From which you may correctly infer that I am a fool.</p><p>Accordingly, whenever I have speculated publicly about immigration, -- trying, naively, to observe something I haven't read hundreds of times before, -- I've got my fingers burned.</p><p>In May 2002, I wrote an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal pegged on the disturbingly good showing by the extremist National Front in the 2002 French presidential election. Dutch politician Pim Fortuyn, widely disparaged as anti-immigrant, had just been assassinated in The Netherlands. Yet watching their backs and knowing what was good for them, neither of the centrist French candidates, Jacques Chirac and Lionel Jospin, had mentioned the word immigration anywhere in his election manifesto. Hence any French voter unhappy about French immigration and asylum policy had found nowhere to turn but the National Front's bigoted, anti-Semitic Jean-Marie Le Pen.</p><p>Mindful that the WSJ's official editorial policy was to support the unfettered flow of labour markets, I put forward what was, to me, a mild thesis: ''Even advocates of open borders should concede that all concerns about immigration policy are not inherently racist and xenophobic. Casting the debate in these terms means, in effect, that there is no debate. Anyone who objects to an influx of new arrivals is simply bad.</p><p>''Immigration is already so supercharged that responsible politicians need to develop a less judgmental vocabulary for its level-headed discussion, rather than heaping opportunistic calumny on immigration sceptics. Advocates of tighter border controls mustn't always be saddled with a reputation for derogating other races and harbouring a morbid horror of foreigners. Otherwise immigration will remain a no-go area for Western centrists, who thereby abdicate responsibility to the worst elements.''</p><p>In particular, I argued the modest linguistic case for European politicians not always slamming folk who were anti-immigration as anti-immigrant. The latter downgrades a policy position to a personal prejudice. Thus simply to argue for lower quotas is to invite not only political ostracism but character assassination. As I was soon to discover for myself.</p><p>Now, this was an article studiously neutral on the issue of immigration proper. Yet I feel free to lift from it here because it was never published. In a bitter irony, a WSJ editor had it spiked because it was -- I quote -- ''anti-immigrant''.</p><p>In The Guardian's weekend magazine in 2005, I hazarded a view at diametric odds with my new, and unwelcome, role in the British media as ''the anti-Mom'', with which I had been saddled purely for writing a novel about one mother-son relationship that went rather badly.</p><p>With cheerful hypocrisy (I have no children), I plumped for Western couples bearing more kids. Resistant to embracing an ahistorical individual happiness as the sole holy grail of a well-lived life, I commended the notion of continuing ''our own people, however we might choose to define them'', be that via lineage, ethnicity, religion or nation.</p><p>With great trepidation, I ventured: ''If I feel, oh -- a little wistful -- about the fact that my country of birth, the US, will within my lifetime no longer be peopled in majority by those of European extraction (I'm German-American on both sides), that passing dismay has never been considerable enough for me to inconvenience myself with giving lifts to football practice.</p><p>''Frankly, if I can't be arsed to replace myself with a reasonable facsimile, immigrants willing to nurse sick little boys through their fevers have truly earned the right to take my place.</p><p>''Of course, that wistfulness of mine is political dynamite. Yet maybe the multiculturalism debate is sufficiently matured for us to concede that white folks are people, too. We encourage minorities of every stripe to be proud of their heritage -- Jamaicans, Aborigines and Jews -- as well they should be. The long dominant populations in most of Europe are contracting, and maybe by the time they're minorities in their own countries they will have rights, too, among them, at least the right to feel a little sad.''</p><p>I worded that piece with great care and no little anxiety. So imagine my chagrin in April this year when Lynn Barber, interviewing me for Britain's Observer, parroted them back in the grotesque. ''As far as I could tell,'' said Lynn, tapping an ash mischievously, ''you were saying that we white people have to outpopulate the blacks.'' I blanched. She later claimed she was joking, just trying to get my goat (and she succeeded), but if so she had quite a poker face.</p><p>In any event, I feel sure she was accurately encapsulating what many traditionally liberal Guardian readers took those passages to mean. See, this is the peril of expressing a less than pompom-waving attitude towards immigration: bingo, you're a white supremacist.</p><p>A fascinating little postscript to that Guardian article: to fill it out, I conducted an email interview with another childless friend of mine, herself outspoken and a fellow writer whom I have always admired as intellectually courageous. In response to my query about how she felt about the consequences of her childlessness writ large, she originally wrote: ''Many Western cities will be largely black-Hispanic-Asian in 50 years' time. Does that bother me? Well, I vaguely regret the extinction of gene lines that in their various ways played a part in the establishment of Western civilisation. But the gene lines coming in from the developing world will have their own strengths, energies and qualities, I guess.''</p><p>Yet when she reviewed the article before I filed it, my friend rang up and insisted that I must at all costs edit out that final ''I guess''. I understood; articulating even the gentlest ambivalence about immigration was dangerous, though I gave her a pseudonym. The mere appendage of ''I guess'' risked her seeming anti-immigrant. So I obliged and cut the phrase. Yet the article was the poorer for its excision and less honest. That ''I guess'' was everything, packed with all the uneasiness, moral conflictedness and political self-consciousness that infuses this delicate subject matter. That deadly ''I guess'' is exactly the sort of unedited, mortifyingly forthright slip that I'm always afraid will escape me when interviewers have drawn me on this topic.</p><p>Whenever the word immigration arises while a digital tape recorder is switched on, I grow physically uncomfortable. I fidget; I break eye contact. Even if I've been on a lucid roll, suddenly my syntax is halting and full of pauses. I'm hyperaware that one poorly couched sentiment or injudiciously chosen adjective will damn me for all time as a bigot and I will be reading it -- probably misquoted and made more offensive still -- for years to come.</p><p>Making the blandest assertions on this subject -- say, proposing timidly that economically immigration is more complicated than being purely beneficial -- I am overwhelmed with the sensation of digging my own grave.</p><p>Fair enough, there certainly are nonfiction writers who argue boldly, and sometimes brutally, for more restrictive immigration policies. Pat Buchanan stuffed an unabashed immigration alarmism into his 2006 title, State of Emergency: The Third World Invasion and Conquest of America. But Buchanan would belong to the same American right-wing ghetto inhabited by the likes of Ann Coulter and Bill O'Reilly on Fox News, as well as countless rabid radio DJs.</p><p>Any writer keen to gain the broader acceptance of the cultural mainstream is better off arguing for immigrants' rights or, better still, avoiding this subject altogether.</p><p>It is in fiction that the immigration debate -- in so far as novels and short stories conduct debates, and they can, after a fashion -- has been skewed. Fiction's overwhelming one-sidedness does not hail from a craven toeing of the socially acceptable line alone. Rather, fiction tends to empathise with the immigrant experience -- as opposed to that of native populations undergoing sudden, dramatic ethnic shifts -- because of the nature of narrative and the instinctive gravitations of sympathy in Western readerships. However they may feel about the political issue of immigration in real life, readers side with the underdog in fiction. They may not approve of weakness of character, but their hearts go out to characters placed, through no fault of their own, in a weak position. Traditional heroes and heroines confront seemingly insurmountable obstacles and overcome adversity. Whatever their complex feelings about class, entitlement and death taxes in their own polity, readers tend to be old-fashioned work-ethic types. They admire industry, sacrifice and gains that are hard-earned while deploring the fruits of privilege that fall lazily to hand like apples from a tree.</p><p>Readers admire cunning, resourcefulness and ingenuity. Outside the newspaper, they are unlikely to get too fussed about niceties such as technically breaking the law, especially if doing so is in the interests of a character's survival and the protection of his family. Readers appreciate ambition, dedication to self-improvement and a refusal to accept the lottery ticket of nationality as a permanent, uncontestable limitation on one's fortunes.</p><p>They like characters with vision. They respect get-up-and-go, so naturally esteem folk who got up and went. American and Australian readers would have been raised on derring-do tales of the frontier, and for immigrants a new, often hostile country duplicates the hardships of the wild west or the outback.</p><p>Continued next page</p><p>From previous page</p><p>The immigrant narrative is inherently dynamic. Of necessity, it entails motion, a literal journey, leaving and arriving somewhere else, whereas a non-immigrant stays put. Thus ''stranger comes to town'' is said to be one of the three primary narratives on which all stories are a variation. The stranger is nearly always sympathetic. Think Kung Fu.</p><p>An immigrant's roller-coaster emotions make for intrinsically rich fictional material: the anguish of leaving home, the terror of the unknown, the relief of finding safe harbour. For that matter, I count myself as a classic Western reader in all these respects.</p><p>Whatever my broad concerns about rapid, unchecked immigration in the abstract, on an individual level my heart goes out to the immigrant (after all, as an American living in Britain, I am one). Especially to the illegal sort: living in fear of authorities, probably not speaking the language, often being taken advantage of by unscrupulous employers, barely scraping by yet still being expected to send any extra money back home.</p><p>Thus immigration fiction such as Amy Tan's best-selling The Joy Luck Club is par for the course. Addressing themselves to a variety of ethnicities, numerous novelists have told the tale of immigrant travails and final triumph in making a new home. I don't mean to denigrate these books, either. Immigrants give great story.</p><p>So is there another side, another story to tell? Clearly, but any characters in the host population who are anything but welcoming and helpful to guests of their nation -- not to put too fine a point on it -- are going to look like shit.</p><p>Any character's passing discomfort with the fact most of his kid's classmates don't speak English is going to come across as -- that's right -- racist and xenophobic. Should they be sympathetic, native citizens in a novel whose ethnic landscape has suddenly transformed had better like it. Any reservations whatsoever are going to mark that character as a bigot.</p><p>All of the emotions attached to an anti-immigration -- sorry, anti-immigrant -- character are unattractive: wariness, hostility, paranoia, suspicion, inhospitality. Conjure in your head a character who is, say, campaigning in Texas to have that infamous fence erected on the US-Mexican border and see if you don't immediately picture a satire victim from DBC Pierre's Vernon God Little: provincial, ignorant and mean.</p><p>Furthermore, any native-born character in the immigration drama starts off in a position of advantage. He may not be rich in the terms of his own country, but you can be sure that he is rich in the terms of the world; in an international context, he's spoiled. He speaks the language. He has a credit card and he's plugged into the system; he doesn't live in constant danger of being arrested simply for being where he lives. Advantage is fictional anathema.</p><p>I have read one novel -- one -- that vivifies the experiences of immigrants and their host citizenry in an even-handed, appropriately complex manner: T.C. Boyle's magnificent The Tortilla Curtain of 1995.</p><p>A desperate pair of Mexican newlyweds crosses the border and sets up camp in a Californian public park. While Boyle wrenchingly depicts their hardships, he also dramatises the crime, drug-running and sense of invasion and predation suffered by the white Californians who live near the border. Boyle maintains an impressive authorial neutrality through most of the book, which climaxes, through a cruelly hilarious sequence of events involving the cooking of a free Thanksgiving turkey, with the couple starting a raging forest fire. Yet ultimately, even in The Tortilla Curtain, it's the immigrants, not the Americans, who break your heart.</p><p>Nevertheless, when any community is abruptly inundated by the Other, whoever that Other may be, powerful, primitive feelings arise. (How did Native Americans feel when European settlers -- immigrants, really -- colonised their land? Ditto, the Australian Aborigines?)</p><p>Due to the social touchiness of this subject and the narrative difficulty of making those feelings sympathetic, they have gone under-examined in fiction and nonfiction alike. Like it or not, people are pack animals. Perhaps they should think of themselves as one big happy human family, but as an identity human is too abstract and our species naturally subdivides into groups.</p><p>Few would contest that modest levels of immigration are good for any country's soul. Difference creates vitality. A too-homogenous society is apt to be ingrown, myopic, boring and culturally static. But there may be a psychological tipping point at which even initially kind, broad-minded populations start to feel overrun. When a host country's people no longer feel visited but invaded, big, scary emotions come into play, emotions little different from those of a homeowner whose house is being burgled.</p><p>In 2005, The New York Times ran an article about an American family that has owned a ranch and farmland in New Mexico since 1918, running along 20km of an open border with Mexico. As many as 500 illegal immigrants cross their land every day. Fences are continually torn down, crops pilfered, pastures set on fire, cattle rustled and watering troughs used as toilets. Sure, many of these trespassers are simply trying for a better life, but some are drug smugglers, bandits and armed coyotes. Having been held up more than once, the ranchers are fearful every time they walk out the door, and have written off whole tracts of their own property as too dangerous to set foot on. Is this family's plight not sympathetic, just a little?</p><p>As firmly as I believe that immigration begs to be addressed in fiction in a nuanced, sensitive, intelligent fashion that does justice to both sides of the equation, I dread the self-destructive day that I decide to write such a book myself.

The nation's largest corporates have revealed dangerous exposure on as much as $US80 billion of foreign debt. And the rosy glow of long-term growth has fallen to doubt and insecurity about the political and social consequences of a serious economic contraction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Indonesia is not alone with its problems. Thailand, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and now Vietnam have all felt the chill wind of economic pain. The Thai baht has dropped by 40 per cent against the US dollar since it was floated on 2 July. The Philippine peso and Malaysia's ringgit have fared little better. This week Vietnam bowed to months of pressure on the dong by increasing the range in which it can trade either side of the official rate, from 5 to 10 per cent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In little more than three months, the Asian miracle has looked more like a calamitous economic meltdown.</p><p>How did it happen, especially as none of the best-informed experts were predicting it?</p><p>While some experts still insist that the region's economic fundamentals are still strong, the reality would suggest otherwise. In Jakarta tens of thousands of workers on building sites are sitting around idle. Deliveries have stopped because bills have not been paid. For Australian companies in Indonesia, the story is much the same: exporters still waiting for debts due months ago, order books closing, clients ringing to cancel deals.</p><p>\"The Thais will fall on to a cushion while we will fall on a hard floor,\" Mr Silalahi said of the consequences facing Indonesia.</p><p>\"President Suharto has to make a very, very painful austerity program now,\" said Abdurrachman Wahid, the leader of the nation's largest Muslim organisation.</p><p>\"Don't talk about today, because we are consuming the products we produced four months ago. Now people are stopping production because they can't calculate costs. Inflation will rise for sure. We need to realise that in the next 10 years our bleak economic prospects will place a large burden on our lives, including the political situation.\"</p><p>Only three months ago this warning would have seemed ludicrous. For two decades Indonesia enjoyed an average 7 per cent growth. The Suharto Government had dutifully followed the conservative economic advice of the World Bank and the mantra happily chanted by the local and international business community was that \"Indonesia's economic fundamentals are strong\".</p><p>Even when Thailand was facing the grim reality that it had drained its foreign reserves and still failed to save its currency, the crisis seemed remote. Many believed Indonesia was too strong to be pulled down by the domino effect of a crash in confidence in Asia's tigers.</p><p>But the dramatic decline in the rupiah revealed more what weakness Indonesia's economy had in common with other regional economies, rather than its unique strengths.</p><p>Simplistically put, corporate Indonesia followed the same path as the Thais. In an expanding economy flush with new developments, money was needed. Lots of it. Interest rates at home were high, about 15 to 18 per cent, so large sums - about $US80 billion - were borrowed overseas at more competitive US dollar rates.</p><p>This seemed a reasonable strategy given the certainty of rupiah exchange rates. The Central Bank managed the rupiah rate within trading bands, meaning costs could easily be calculated. In fact, this meant the rupiah was overvalued and the corporate sector lulled into a false sense of security.</p><p>When ripples from the Thai crisis started to shake Indonesia's money and stock markets, the Government began buying its currency to keep it high. After spending $US1.5 billion it said enough, it could not use up its $US20 billion foreign reserves to prop up the private sector. The trading bands were abandoned, interest rates soared and the currency began its spectacular crash. Suddenly there was a severe credit squeeze.</p><p>But the big corporations had short-term US dollars debts maturing - some economists estimate 61 per cent of private Indonesian debt is short term - so they tried to borrow more US dollars to pay last year's loans, sending the currency into a free-fall. Indonesia's problems are more than just US dollar debt. What the crisis exposed was an uncomfortable truth: the economic fundamentals were weak. For at least a year, various analysts had warned Jakarta that the financial sector was weak, there were too many banks and too many bad loans, many of them linked to the political elite. Deregulation of the economy has slowed, private debt was increasing rapidly and the economy was overly politicised. In short, the economy was distorted by patronage and favoritism, corruption was eroding efficiency and the bloated and inefficient bureaucracy was making politicised decisions about contracts.</p><p>The structure of the corporate sector, too, is part of the problem. About 180 conglomerates control the Indonesian economy, most with cosy ties to the ruling elite. Such a narrow business base means their debts can threaten the economy.</p><p>In much of the soul-searching this week one message was that Indonesia must expect a difficult time ahead. At best an IMF rescue package can prevent the collapse of the corporations. But money to pay unhedged debts is unproductive. It does not build, it does not employ. In Indonesia at least 38 per cent of the population is unemployed or underemployed.</p><p>The country is also in the grip of the worst drought for 50 years. Crops are failing and famine has already hit some isolated areas. One estimate said 7000 people a day were pouring into Jakarta off the land looking for jobs, just when the the construction sector was shedding unskilled labor. As in Thailand, the property sector is most vulnerable. Some big developments were begun on 100 per cent foreign loans. Under current circumstances they cannot be completed. The Association of Real Estate Developers estimates that 80 per cent of developers could go bankrupt within four months if there is no bail-out.</p><p>The Suharto Government has already announced a 25 per cent cut in its development budget. Prices are rising in markets across the country and a politically sensitive end to the fuel subsidy is expected soon, which will push up prices.</p><p>\"Those who will suffer sacrifice most will be the poorest,\" said Emmy Hafild, executive director of a coalition of non-government organisations, WALHI. \"But the business groups with vested interests will continue to receive special rights to exploit the nation's natural resources.</p><p>\"Fuel subsidies will be stopped, Government expenditure reduced - we are afraid spending on hospitals, local clinics and schools will be cut.\"</p><p>Over the next few months, she said, the drought and forest fire crisis could lead to famine. Lay-offs in the construction and industrial centres will lead to unrest, she said.</p><p>For Indonesia, the economy is everything. For three decades President Suharto has justified tight political controls by arguing that stability is the essential foundation for growth. It is a model championed in other parts of the region, putting the nation's economic growth ahead of the rights and aspirations of the individual.</p><p>But without the carrot of steadily increasing material wealth, the Government is left merely holding a stick. Many analysts believe this crisis will be the most significant test to date of the Suharto Government, when the communications revolution has exposed tens of millions of Indonesians to new ideas about freedom.</p><p>\"There is a proverb which say the stomach cannot wait,\" says a prominent Muslim leader, Amien Rais. \"If the Indonesian economy is going down and inflation is higher and the price of gas and other essentials is increasing, the political situation will become critical.\"</p><p>Political analyst Dewi Fortuna Anwar said: \"Economic problems will feed into political instability. Political stability is very much dependent on the country's economic solvency. If the economy takes a turn for the worse, then investors don't want to come here, we will be in a lot of political trouble.\"</p><p>Many commentators believe the IMF will demand reforms that will touch the sensitive link between control of the economy and the political elite. That process is likely to have a positive impact on future economic fundamentals.</p><p>At the same time growing demands for justice from workers and farmers, and even the middle class reeling from massive home interest rate rises, could produce pressure for positive political reforms and democratisation.</p><p>WHY THE TIGERS ARE NOT ROARING</p><p>Free Fall: Fears over high current account deficits and speculative trading have sent the currencies of Thailand, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines plunging by 20-40 per cent against the US dollar since July</p><p>View from Japan</p><p>Japan is closely monitoring Indonesia's currency crisis and its economy, but has shied from playing any unilateral role in the bail-out.</p><p>The Finance Minister, Mr Hiroshi Mitusuka, said this week his ministry was liaising closely with the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on an action plan.</p><p>But Japan is wary of playing any direct unilateral role in the bail-out of any of South-East Asia's crashing currencies. As a major investor and aid donor in Indonesia, Japan is certain to be a willing participant in any regional rescue package.</p><p>Japan's banks have invested $38 billion in Indonesia since 1967 and for more than a decade Japan has been Indonesia's biggest foreign aid donor, handing over around $900 million a year. It is believed that Japan has already made it clear to Indonesia that it will provide assistance only through the IMF. - David Lague</p><p>View from China</p><p>The financial crisis now battering South-East Asian economies is causing unease in China where soaring bank debt is a serious threat to the country's economic growth.</p><p>Senior officials including the Premier, Mr Li Peng, and top managers at the People's Bank of China have warned that Beijing needed to learn from South-East Asia's troubles to prevent similar setbacks.</p><p>China's currency, the renminbi, is not fully convertible, which is a major barrier to sudden cash inflows or outflows but many economists, including experts at the World Bank, are deeply worried about the massive bad debts that state-owned enterprises have run up with the state banks.</p><p>The state-run media have been carrying reassuring articles lately that China can avoid a financial crisis, which analysts in Beijing believe is a strong indication that senior officials fear a banking collapse. - Russell Skelton</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Four graphs: Thai Baht/$US;

You were a child and teenager during the late 1940s, '50s or '60s which makes you a baby boomer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">As a kid, you rose when it was still dark, did your chores, left home early and dawdled back at sunset, exhausted from laughing, learning, playing, daring and surviving another day of death defying adventures.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When your parents asked 'what did you do today?' you replied 'nothin', in accordance with the kid-to-parent information rule of 'what they don't know won't hurt them'.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Did not knowing hurt them? No way! Not knowing such things helped you and them to feel free. 21st century life is vastly different to the 1950s, '60s and '70s. In some ways better, and other ways not.</p><p>The biggest difference is that you no longer feel free. Why? You know too much about things that don't matter. You spend too much time watching, reading, listening and getting your guts in a knot about doom and gloom news and views - things you can't fix and which aren't your business.</p><p>Your uptightedness about useless information has numbed the neurons that make you laugh, have fun, imagine and be curious.</p><p>As a result you now suffer headaches, skin disorders, viruses and melancholic moods you never had before. Your obsession about things that don't really matter has made you forget how to be you. You've become oblivious to the reality of life and you are not hearing or feeling the cries from within your body.</p><p>You've become insensitive to your hunches, insight and 'gut feelings' and where is your desire to go out and do things?</p><p>You don't make time for self reflection, self nurturing and listening to your 'inner shrink' - powers that were integral to your once happy and successful life.</p><p>But don't despair. Millions of other baby boomers share the same condition. The problem is you've become too scared to be free.</p><p>And you've lost your way on the frenetic freeway of 21st century life.</p><p>Let's get a handle on what's so different between then and now.</p><p>You went places by yourself without asking or telling your parents. You played ball using rolled up newspapers tied with string.</p><p>You drank water from the garden hose but never bottled water from the shop. And you never heard of sunscreen or blockout.</p><p>You were taught how to use an axe before a cricket bat because work came before play and chopped wood was the source of heat for cooking, washing, bathing and warmth.</p><p>You were also responsible for keeping the household lawns tidy, which meant herding the family horse, cow, sheep, goat, ducks and chickens from the back to the front, and scooping the poo into large hessian bags for use as compost for the vegetable garden.</p><p>There were also after-school and weekend jobs such as chopping more wood, selling or home delivering newspapers, walking a couple of miles to and from the grocery shop; digging holes to bury household garbage and a stinking drum of 'poo and wee' from the outside backyard toilet.</p><p>Luckily you didn't have a swimming pool to clean, and washing the dogs was as easy as throwing them into the river, lake or dam.</p><p>Chores, Sunday school, roast lunch and a weekly bath made Sundays absolute hell, so a great deal of midweek strategic planning and 'Houdini rehearsing' was necessary. But your regular 'escapes' from all or part of 'Sunday hell' can be best described as creatively brilliant and ingeniously carried out.</p><p>You were obsessively curious, wondering, exploring and asking 300-plus questions during an average day. By age six, you learned that disobeying teacher meant a whacking and a screamed reminder: \"That will teach you a lesson.\"</p><p>School discouraged individuality, imagination and fun, so you fantasised about the wonderful free life you would have after and away from school.</p><p>You tried out for school sports, but not everyone made the team. That taught you to deal with disappointment.</p><p>Some students who weren't as smart as others often failed a grade and were held back to repeat the same grade. Tests were never adjusted as a result of 'parental pressures'.</p><p>Your actions and performances were your own. And you copped the consequences, good and bad. You had no one to hide behind. Parent rescue, if you upset a teacher or broke a law, was impossible.</p><p>During 'school and home chores free' times, you would spend hours or days doing stuff with your friends. Your 'what they don't know won't hurt them' policy extinguished the chance for your parents to discover if there was truth in neighbourhood gossip about 'incidents' that might involve you.</p><p>You were brilliant at not being caught, but when you were, you copped your punishment (usually a thrashing) without fuss. Your loyalty to friends remained rock solid despite parental threats of unspeakable punishment for making the shit hit the fan so seriously and frequently when you and your friends were together.</p><p>You were fearless. You never wore a helmet while riding your bike. You rarely read newspapers or listened to the news, so what was there to be scared about?</p><p>Everyone had a nickname like Porky (overweight), Claws (lost two fingers playing with his dad's saw), Hoss (well endowed), Peep (wears thick spectacles), Donkey (great ass), Luscious (has a large mouth), Blue-Knob (red hair and freckled face), Bomber (continually farts), Pope (father a Baptist minister) and Sticks (skinny legs).</p><p>You built billy-carts from scrap and only during the first downhill road test did you realise the need to install brakes.</p><p>After crashing into trees and bushes a few times, you learned to solve the problem.</p><p>That was how you discovered the second meaning of 'trial and error', the first one being don't upset your schoolteacher.</p><p>You rode in cars with no seat belts or air bags. You hitchhiked and bummed rides from complete strangers.</p><p>You collected and swapped stamps, sports cards, marbles, bike wheels and comic books.</p><p>You'd walk into your friends' house without knocking, call their mum 'mum', help yourself to a drink from the ice chest and start talking as though it was your place.</p><p>Remember accidents? You were cut, broke bones and lost teeth, but didn't blame anyone except yourself.</p><p>Law suits didn't happen. Accidents were accidents and no one was to blame but you.</p><p>You were as resilient as a rubber ball. After being hurt, you intuitively bounced back often to the raucous ribbing and suppressed admiration and sympathy of your friends.</p><p>Your T-shirts became tourniquets and bandages and the bloodstains remained as a reminder for rainy day reminiscing.</p><p>To settle serious issues, you sometimes fought, occasionally belting the bejeezus out of each other, but afterwards you'd shake hands to signify the dispute had been resolved. Such outcomes were easier to achieve in those times because fights were with fists, not knives and guns.</p><p>You ate scones, cakes, fat chips and bread and butter; you dipped your fingers into thick, fresh cream and drank fizzy drinks, but you were never overweight.</p><p>Like how could you be overweight when your days were chock-a-block of running, playing, jumping, pretending, climbing, daring, swimming, surfing, wrestling, riding, walking, swinging, skating, sliding, swapping, teasing, pushing, shoving, laughing and joking?</p><p>You shared a warm drink from the same bottle with four or five friends, and remarkably, no one got germs and died. You had real and imaginary friends instead of personal computers, e-mails and Internet chat rooms. You told endless stories, true and made-up, and you loved listening to and reading other people's stories. You made up new games with sticks and tennis balls.</p><p>You ate worms and although your teachers and parents told you the worms would grow 50 feet long and live inside you forever, they didn't. You terrified grandmas and old aunties with your pet spiders, ants, moths, lizards, snakes and every sort of bug imaginable.</p><p>Intuitively you were super smart.</p><p>Your ability to sense danger gave you many lives. You built tree houses in the wilderness, often sleeping over and holding 'secret club' meetings in them. Your last-second slides under barbed wire fences frequently saved you from injury or death after you teased farmyard bulls and billy goats to the point of dementia.</p><p>You were like a frog, jumping, diving, skinny-dipping and belly whacking from rickety old wooden bridges into creeks and streams.</p><p>You tied old tyres and ropes to branches overhanging rivers and performed endless death defying feats. You built fabulous rafts and canoes from fallen trees, bark and junk, and in between creating your own versions of Treasure Island, Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn, your interpretations of the grand sea battles by Lord Nelson, Francis Drake and Long John Silver are legendary.</p><p>You explored old caves in the hills, often burying 'treasure', then creating cryptic treasure maps you tore into equal pieces to be held in custody by you and your closest friends.</p><p>You felt and heard ghosts during your spooky exploits, but you weren't scared because only sissies were scared of ghosts. You pretended to be like cave people, Tarzan, Jane, Al Capone, Davy Crocket or Daniel Boone.</p><p>There were always plenty of fresh field strawberries and blackberries to pick. Your home-made fishing rods and crab pots worked wonders and there were always plenty of field mushrooms and potatoes. Nearly all homes and farms had a vegetable garden so 'bandicooting' fresh carrots, peas and beans was simple.</p><p>You sent smoke signals from one hilltop to another, but it seems only the fire department could understand your message after it became necessary for them to extinguish your forest fire.</p><p>After finding specks of gold in rubble around disused goldmines, you staked your 'claims' and tried to dig for a mighty nugget. When unsuccessful, you found large rocks, painted them gold, buried them close to the surface and laughed till you were sick watching unsuspecting prospectors discover your 'fools gold nuggets'.</p><p>Your neighbourhood fun, games and adventures were at least on a par with those you shared with nature.</p><p>You glued coins to the footpath and laughed hysterically as the suckers tried to pick them up. You played other harmless pranks like throwing stones onto tin roofs of houses and put firecrackers in letterboxes as payback to mean and cranky wrinklies who complained that the noise of your laughter and fun was annoying.</p><p>You argued about and gambled on your predictions for future episodes of radio serials, but mainly you created your own cops and robbers, cowboys and Indians and used your own skills to challenge the feats of radio and comic heroes such as Superman, Hopalong Cassidy, Mandrake, Tarzan, Biggles and The Lone Ranger.</p><p>You were always on the lookout to score free samples from the baker, milkman, butcher, iceman and other suppliers who made home deliveries. As you rode, walked and ran throughout the neighbourhood, you said 'hello' to everyone even though many were terrified as to what your next prank might be.</p><p>No one was able to reach you all day. No mobile phones. Unthinkable. That was the life.</p><p>Your emergence into teenage status did nothing to quell your insatiable appetite for fun, adventure and trying new things. Sometimes you 'borrowed' cigarettes and beers from your parents or from secret stashes at the homes of your friends or relatives who never dobbed.</p><p>You joyfully boasted the arrival of each new pubic hair. You could roll off 100 of the world's crudest jokes and effortlessly produce guffaw laughter from your two-minute version or an embellished half hour rendition. You dawdled past sports clubs and bars from where you overheard and memorised scores of vulgar ditties and songs, which you 'personalised' and performed with gusto and good humour.</p><p>You were around to welcome a new form of music, the likes of which the world had never known. You voraciously embraced Elvis, Bill Haley, Little Richard and the global phenomenon called rock 'n' roll and, with it, countless other new styles of pop music, dancing, records, clothes, languages, lifestyles and superstars.</p><p>Rock 'n' roll was loud and brash yet soft and romantic. It had rhythm, energy, powerful new words and subliminal messages.</p><p>It inspired love and anti-establishment. It introduced you to new love songs, dance songs, wild songs, sexy songs and silly songs that you heard a hundred times a day on jukeboxes or on amazing rock music stations through a new type of radio set called transistors.</p><p>Rock 'n' roll was a call to you and other post-World War II babies to rebel. To be free to be who you are and whatever you want to be.</p><p>James Dean was a rebel for the cause of freedom. So was Martin Luther King, Suzi Quatro, JFK, Buddy Holly and The Big Bopper. Your life was like Happy Days and Grease.</p><p>You hung out at cool milk bars, hamburger joints and dance halls where you flirted, sang, danced, made plans and revelled at being a rebel.</p><p>Rock 'n' roll sent you messages, inspired you to question every aspect of the life your folks wanted you to live.</p><p>You converted old A-model Fords into hotrods and street dragged till you could no longer afford the petrol or the speeding fines.</p><p>You pioneered drive-in movie romance by pretending to watch new flicks while cuddling your newest love in the back seat of a car.</p><p>You were bodgies or widgies; you wore blue suede shoes, stovepipe purple pants, tangerine shirts, hooped petticoats, wide belts, white sports coats, blue jeans, white T-shirts or leather jackets.</p><p>You experimented with dry crew cuts, Brylcreemed long hair with a kiss curl in front, long sideburns, teasing, hair spray and fringes added enormously to the new rock gen.</p><p>You experienced freedom, failure, success and responsibility. Like most of your friends, you found a job you enjoyed and for which you were rewarded for your loyalty, creativity, trust, ethics, humour and handshake deals.</p><p>Your generation produced some of the greatest visionaries, risk-takers, deal-makers and ethical entrepreneurs ever. How did you do it? The answer is you felt free.</p><p>You thrived on laughter and fun; you used your imagination, you were full of curiosity and wonder; you took notice of your gut feelings; you were resilient, and you rarely tried to be anything other than your natural self.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GCBULL-GCB0310111W14084110</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEGOLDCOASTBULLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49RS-VC20-015H-521P-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464543</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2347\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Gold Coast Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"10\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>October 11, 2003 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX002131</classCode><className>SKIN DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000152</classCode><className>BABY BOOMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000428</classCode><className>CRICKET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DLCH</classCode><className>HEADACHES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000201</classCode><className>BOTTLED WATER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Come Sunday afternoon (Australian time) at the Spectrum here, he will have much the same prospects of avoiding a fall. He may not break apart, but has every chance of sagging to the floor like a sack of marshmallows.How long that process takes will depend on the quality of his own spirit and the sharpness of Tyson's timing. But the limitations of Mathis's physique, and the technical shortcomings exposed by the abuses he suffered during an appalling session of sparring last week, suggest he will be lucky to survive more than a round or two.Mathis represents the softest of soft targets. If Tyson lingers over the easy task of demolition he will provide unexpected encouragement for Frank Bruno, who is due to defend the WBC title against the former undisputed champion on March 16.Big Frank should not hold his breath waiting for such a licence to be optimistic. While Mathis has been showing a pathetic vulnerability to his sparmates, Tyson has been brutal with the hired help in his training camp.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>The Sunday Times</p></bodyText></section><p>Reports that he has forced as many as 15 sparring partners to slink off in search of more congenial employment may contain as much hyperbole as is standard in the fight business.There is no need for his PR team to elaborate on the impression made by his appearance, however. The taut lines of his face, accentuated by a neat moustache and small beard, combine with the trim condition of his body to make acceptable the claims of a current weight around 99kg. That is exactly what he scaled for the 89-second destruction of the egregious Peter McNeeley last August, in the one ring engagement he has faced since completing three years for rape.And there was nothing stage-managed about the flurry of precisely-executed violence that hurled Nate Tubbs to the canvas, and curtailed a rare open-day in Tyson's training at a North Philadelphia (home turf of the Hollywood slugger Rocky) gym last week.In four impressive rounds with the 200cm, 128kg Tyrone Evans, Tyson had given no indication of protecting the right hand which caused the Mathis fight to be postponed from November 4 to next weekend. Fears he might be inhibited by that thumb fracture disappeared altogether as he started to pummel Tubbs, a 187cm 113kg giant from Cincinnati.In fact, it was a couple of rights - one to the body and another to the temple that first severely distressed Tubbs. Then, after permitting the bigger man a brief respite, Tyson unloaded a swift leftright-left combination of hooks to the head that blasted his victim sideways to the floor and into a state of confusion which took half a minute to clear.Having given that public demonstration of his aggressive well-being, and coped with a concentrated onslaught of media attention afterwards, he instantly reverted to the reclusive ways that have been the norm since he left prison.But there have been signs here in Pennsylvania his inaccessibility is less armour-plated than it was even a few weeks back. Some say this is because the necessity to sell this fight is more pressing than was the case with the first phase of the second coming against McNeeley (the Fox network television company are understood to be putting up only half of the $US10 million they were going to pay for the original November 4 date with Mathis).Other close observers conclude less cynically that, as Tyson slowly adjusts to the complex consequences of his release, he is gradually thawing towards a more relaxed attitude.There was certainly not a trace of tension or awkwardness in his manner when, on Friday evening, he responded to requests for a private conversation by making a telephone call to my hotel room.The unmistakable voice answered questions with an agreeableness and gentle courtesy which, in conjunction with the televised images of the dumping of Tubbs, created a faintly eerie effect.When he uses the term \"Sir\", as he did frequently, there is a tendency for the listener to touch the forelock.\"I am happy with the way things are going,\" he said. \"Right now, at this stage of my life, I have no hang-ups. I'm not concerned with what people think about me. I am content to live my life for me and my children.\"People underestimate the strain, the pressures of coming back from where I have been to where I am now. Prison was a dismal experience and the horrific ordeal didn't end the moment I was freed.\"I had to deal with so many things, a different mentality, a different valuesystem. But I am pretty loose now. I am smiling more than I ever did. I'm in good shape and I'm having fun.\" The very relaxation he celebrates at 29 is seen as a powerful argument against believing he can ever again be the forest fire of aggression of nearly a decade ago, as he began the devastating surge which made him, at 20, the youngest-ever holder of a heavyweight championship and rapidly carried him on to total supremacy.He was, such critics justifiably emphasise, declining noticeably long before he was jailed.Given all the disparate influences at work on him since, from the eroding effects of four years' idleness to the spiritual impact of conversion to Islam, can he possibly rediscover the singleminded zeal for fighting he once had?\"This is a job I take very seriously,\" was his direct, if less than comprehensive response. \"Being the best out there is still extremely important to me. The money obviously matters a lot but ego and pride are vital elements, too. I always had a hunger to win and it is still there, intact. I can feel my powers coming back.\"The speed is back, the hooks, the combinations. In due time we will discover, in the ring, whether I am as good as I was, or better.\" \"In due time\" recurred in his conversation and had a special resonance when he talked of Riddick Bowe and Bowe's insistence that, in spite of holding nothing more meaningful than the WBO crown, he is the world's No.1.Both men are from Brownsville, a Brooklyn district that is one of the bleakest ghettos in America.There is an almost fraternal respect mixed with the hard implications when Tyson refers to the rival who may bring the ultimate career jackpot.\"A lot of people say they are going to do great things and then when the day of judgment comes they don't fare too well,\" he said mildly.\"But Riddick is a good fighter. He has earned his reputation. I have been away and he has been performing, so you can't say I am the best. He has put in his dues but there will be a day of judgment. In due time, we'll know who is the man.\" Officially, Bowe has only one blemish on his record (a loss to Evander Holyfield sandwiched between two victories over the old warrior).There should have been another in August 1994 when he battered Mathis Jr while Mathis was in a kneeling position during the fourth round of their meeting in Atlantic City.Expediency rather than justice produced a ruling of no-contest. Regardless of the blatant unfairness of that decision, the occasion supplied scant evidence that Mathis can hope to trouble Tyson.There seemed no point in wasting questions on the negligible problems presented by the imminent assignment.Mathis is only a fraction taller than the 181cm optimistically claimed by Tyson. Though the outsider has a substantial advantage in reach, he conspicuously lacks the superiority in physical scope that enabled really big opponents of reasonable talent to worry Tyson even in his prime.Bruno does have such troublesome dimensions, but it was the long list of the Londoner's deficiencies that clearly dominated Tyson's thinking when he was asked about the March rematch with a man he stopped in five rounds in 1989.\"No one has to tell me how Frank Bruno will fight,\" he said. \"I know how he will fight. I know his strengths and his weaknesses.\"If somebody wants to make something of the fact that he landed a decent left hook early in our first fight, that's fine. He caught me off guard and the punch was solid enough, but I took it like it was nothing.\"What I know about Bruno tells me that if I do my work properly I will come out of this championship fight very successfully.\" Naturally, he does not harbour the slightest dread this weekend will damage career figures which stand at 42 wins and one defeat, with 36 stoppages.It was another Buster, James Douglas, who violently inflicted the one loss, in Japan nearly six years ago.Surely that spectre will not haunt the Spectrum, however. A more convincing omen appeared at the Joe Frazier Gym while 25-year-old Mathis was suffering on Thursday.The lanky figure of the retired Michael Spinks engaged in a training routine he insisted had no significance other than as a means of keeping fit.We were reminded of how Spinks, a magnificent light-heavyweight over many years, was annihilated by Tyson in half a round.The great Frazier himself was on hand to reminisce admiringly about Mathis's late father, who earned a living as a heavyweight in a more distinguished era.\"That Buster could fight,\" said Frazier, blinking in the hard sunlight that slanted in from rough streets. \"He could go all right.\" Against Tyson, the younger one can be expected to go all wrong, and early. In seeking to explain the miseries of his sparring, Mathis and his handlers stressed that he was exhausted by a complicated transfer from New York which landed him here in the early hours on Thursday.If he had flown economy from Mars, it would scarcely have been an excuse for such a shambles.No reaction to what we had witnessed was more measured or more damning than that of George Benton, a famous local who has made the transition from outstanding fighter to venerated trainer.\"It will be a miracle if this kid can stay in there with Tyson,\" Benton said. \"He doesn't have anything that can stave off Tyson. He is much the same height, his jab isn't much and he doesn't have muscular strength. The kid looks soft and he obviously doesn't hit very hard. His record shows only six wins inside the distance. How can he resist Tyson? Tyson comes at you with a lot of hands, hooking at you, hooking at you. I'd say Buster's chances are slim and none.\" And, as Don King jokes with tiresome regularity, Slim is out of town.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9512130022213182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49NV-F4F0-01S8-H51J-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1761\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>December 13, 1995 Wednesday 0 Edition</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000202</classCode><className>BOXING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D9GY</classCode><className>SPORTS INSTRUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DNVT</classCode><className>ABUSE &amp; NEGLECT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000DRDX</classCode><className>NEGATIVE MISC NEWS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Their high-tech armory includes satellite monitoring systems, to track the paths of fires, and computers - with enough power to perform billions of calculations every second - to predict the hitherto unpredictable: the start and spread of bushfires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The cutting-edge technology has not yet reached the stage where bushfires may be readily monitored and controlled by firefighters as they assess how factors such as windspeed, landfall, habitation, temperature and humidity affect the progress and direction of a blaze.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For the moment at least, the experts' real weapon is neither modern nor particularly high-tech. To better understand the centuries-old problem of the burning bush, scientists from the CSIRO, and organisations like the Bushfires Council of the Northern Territory and the Cooperative Research Centre for Tropical Savannahs are turning to the past to find answers to the future.</p><p>The future, they believe, is in learning how to burn the bush in a deliberate and controlled way to prevent it from burning in an uncontrolled way, as it did last week between Coonabarabran and Nar-rabri, where more than more than 170,000 hectares of</p><p>bushland have been razed.</p><p>\"Extensive wildfire is just as much a natural part of the Australian environment as the gum trees they burn,\" said Alan Andersen, the program leader of CSIRO's division of wildlife and ecology in Darwin.</p><p>\"The mass burning of houses and other property can quite rightly be described as a social disaster. However, it is quite ridiculous to describe the extensive burning of native forests themselves as a disaster - unless we are talking about lost forestry production.\"</p><p>According to Dr Andersen, the fact that homes in Victoria and New South Wales are regularly threatened by bushfires can hardly be described as unexpected or surprising. \"People like living in and around forests - there is always going to be a fire risk. There really is no excuse for people in fire-prone areas not to be prepared - no excuse other than the time-honored 'it won't happen to me' attitude.\"</p><p>Being prepared, however, does not just mean being ready to evacuate your premises if necessary. For fire management experts, it means regularly burning some of the shrubby undergrowth that fuels the fires and often keeps them raging.</p><p>As odd as it may sound, the solution lies in using fire to keep the fuel-rich understorey of forests under control, so that when fires do start they soon peter out or are at least directed to areas where they may do less harm.</p><p>But being prepared is not easy. Even in Australia's Top End, where fires have taken their toll for thousands of years and more than half of the country is burnt every year, pastoralists are still learning the hard way that being prepared means, ironically enough, to burn in order to protect. In short, Territorians are learning, albeit slowly, what the Aborigines have known and practised for millennia: the art of fighting fire with fire.</p><p>In the Northern Territory, where the tropical savannah landscapes of dense grass and scattered trees dominate the skyline, wet-season rains produce lush plant growth every year. At the season's end, the vegetation dries out quickly, providing wacking great amounts of fuel for dry-season fires.</p><p>One fire last year burnt over a region as large as Victoria, explained ecologist Dr Jeremy Russell-Smith, one of Australia's leading fire experts and a consultant to the Bushfires Council of the Northern Territory.</p><p>The way to keep those sorts of ferocious fires under control is to use fire as a management tool. \"We use early dry-season fires in May and June to create fire breaks,\" Dr Russell-Smith said. \"The breaks prevent the likelihood of more intense fires later in the dry season.\"</p><p>The breaks give the impression that huge swathes of the country have been systematically burnt, particularly near creeklines and other bodies of water.</p><p>\"To many, it would appear something of paradox that such extensive burning activities might be considered as best conservation practice,\" said Dr Russell-Smith, whose unenviable task it is to develop a coordinated fire management and research program for northern Australia.</p><p>\"Yet the stark evidence is there. In the absence of systematic burning undertaken from early in the dry season over the vast tracts of the Arnhem Plateau under contemporary patterns of human settlement, the potential for vast fires burning unchecked late in the dry season is realised</p><p>all too frequently, with catastrophic consequences for fire-sensitive communities and species like cypress pine and Leichhardt's grasshopper.\"</p><p>Recognition of the importance of fire management has led to the development of a fire project organised by the Cooperative Research Centre for Tropical Savannahs. Involving researchers and key groups from Western Australia, the Northern Territory and Queensland, the project aims to use remote-sensing satellites to monitor regions.</p><p>The idea is to obtain fire histories of regions and to assess the impacts of various burning regimes. \"This will assist us to develop economically and ecologically sustainable fire management strategies for regions in northern Australia,\" Dr Russell-Smith said.</p><p>The ambitious task will be coordinated by the research centre, which spans such disciplines as ecology, biology, economics, information technology and social sciences.</p><p>\"We try to develop practical management solutions with land owners and users,\" said John Childs, the centre's director. \"It's very useful to get different bodies cooperating on fire management, because it affects so many different groups with different views - farmers, city people, conversationists, Aborigines and so on. The same broad principles should also apply throughout Australia.\"</p><p>Mr Childs believes public education is crucial. \"The attitude of politicians, and the type of laws and management they apply to fire is often shaped by the ill-informed fears of many people - most of whom live in cities. If people knew more about fires, it would make life easier for the fire managers.\"</p><p>To find practical ways of managing fire, the research centre is working with pastoralists and Aboriginal land owners. \"This is a tricky process,\" said Peter Jacklyn, the centre's communications coordinator. \"Pastoralists are suspicious of the idea of biodiversity, which many consider a political tool of the green lobby, but some would like to use fire to control woody weeds.\"</p><p>Dr Jacklyn said Aboriginal land managers were often \"alienated by scientists who can come across as arrogant and lacking in understanding of traditional culture\".</p><p>None the less, the scientists' understanding is being improved by fire experiments and by satellite monitoring studies, which indicate that vast areas of the north and north-west of Australia are burnt annually - typically by intense wildfires late in the dry season.</p><p>\"Ecological studies indicate that such fire regimes are having a catastrophic impact on fire-sensitive communities\", said Dr Russell-Smith. \"Conversely, on Cape York and over much of northern Australia, where pastoralism is developed on more arable lands, growing evidence indicates that the restricted application or absence of fire is likewise having profound ecological and economic consequences, particularly as a result of the encroachment of native and exotic woody species.\"</p><p>One of the world's largest fire experiments, in which detailed information was collected before and after fire, was conducted by the CSIRO from 1990 to 1994 at the Kapalga Research Station in Kakadu National Park. The experiment, involving students and researchers from various universities and government departments, covered more than 200 square kilometres and required nearly 500 kilometres of fire breaks.</p><p>Four different types of fire were tested: those lit early and late in the dry season, those lit progressively through the dry season, and no fires at all. The scientists collected data on soil nutrients, streams, trees, seed dynamics, insects, small mammals, birds, reptiles and amphibians, bandicoots, wallabies and dingoes.</p><p>The experiment sought to answer a raft of questions: Does fire increase soil erosion and the loss of plant nutrients? How do different fires affect different animals? Does frequent fire prevent seedlings from growing into trees? Does the smoke contribute significantly to the greenhouse effect?</p><p>Scientists, led by Dr Andersen, are still sifting through the mounds of data collected during the four years, and few firm answers are on the table just yet. But he is optimistic. \"The results suggest that current fire management of early seasonal fires seems not to have any detrimental effect.\"</p><p>Elsewhere in Australia other scientists are also concentrating their minds on tackling the task of understanding fire in order, ultimately, to beat it.</p><p>In WA, for example, a six-year study, known as Project Vesta, is about to begin looking at how fires behave - particularly those ravaging bushland at the height of summer.</p><p>Building on existing knowledge of fire behavior, the project will develop a standard system for land managers around Australia to use to predict the spread and intensity of wildfires. It involves WA's Department of Conservation and Land Management and the CSIRO Forestry and Forest Products Division, and enjoys the backing of the Australasian Fire Authorities Council.</p><p>Knowledge gained will help determine the hazards in different types of fuel, and enable more accurate mapping of the threat of wildfires to towns and the environment. The Conservation Department's forest fire behavior tables, developed from more than 30 years of research, has proved invaluable in predicting fire behavior in low-to-moderate intensity fires.</p><p>In Adelaide, meanwhile, scientists at the University of South Australia are working on a computer system that will assist in predicting the start and eventual path of fires.</p><p>When a bushfire starts, the idea is to feed into the computer its current position. Then the \"what if\" game begins: what if the wind swings 40 degrees, what if the wind goes up 20 knots and so on. This helps to position the troops.</p><p>Wind speed and direction and the lay of the land all affect the course of bushfires. But until recently, this information could only be programmed into computers in sequence. Even with the most powerful computers in the world, number crunching at stupendous speeds, this would take weeks to obtain reasonably accurate data - by which time, of course, most fires would have run their course and taken their toll.</p><p>Working in what computer scientists call \"real time\" - that is time as it unfolds before you - the Adelaide scientists have developed a computer system that relies on innovative hardware rather than software to perform its feats.</p><p>And, while the hardware merchants keep hard at it, the climatologists are still scratching their heads to understand what happened to our climate that is making it fan the flames. Earth's climate has warmed by some half a degree in the past century, and the latest figures from the weather bureau reveal that the average temperature in Australia rose this year by 0.11 degrees Celsius from the average between 1961 and 1990.</p><p>\"Most people are now aware that scientists are predicting overall changes in temperature, rainfall and sea levels,\" said Dr Andersen. \"For many management purposes, it is not average changes that will be important but changes in variability, and particularly the frequency of extreme events.</p><p>\"A small rise in average temperatures is not likely to have much of an effect on bushfire risk, but a higher incidence of extreme events - such as an extremely wet period followed by an extremely dry period with an extended hot spell - could have a major impact,\" Dr Andersen said.</p><p>Indeed, extreme events are likely to become more frequent now that scientists have discovered the first direct evidence that El Nino - the warm Pacific current flowing southwards along the west coast of South America - is affecting ocean currents off</p><p>Australia's top end.</p><p>But the concern is much wider than that. If El Nino, perhaps aided and abetted by the global warming, has contributed to the early ferocity of fires like those in New South Wales, then we could be in for a tough time of it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Five photos: John Longstaff 1862-1941 Australia Gippsland, Sunday night, February 20th, 1898 1898 oil on canvas 196.2 x 143.5cm purchased, 1898 National Gallery of Victoria, Melbourne; Humbert River, 1933 and 1994.

Across the gulf of space, minds that are to our minds as ours are to those of the beasts that perish - intellects vast, cool and unsympathetic - regarded this earth with envious eyes, and slowly and surely drew their plans against us. H. G. Wells, War of the Worlds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">LAST Tuesday the news room of The Sydney Morning Herald was galvanised by news that a meteorite had landed near Canberra and started a forest fire. It transpired that the fire had a different cause, but the story got us thinking. If the dinosaurs were wiped out by a meteor strike 65 million years ago, could it happen to us? What sort of early warning system do we have for such occurrences? We challenged the Herald's science writer Leigh Dayton to answer these questions ...</p><p>There's bad news for those who expect some spectacle with their meteor strikes. Rob McNaughton of the Anglo-Australian Observatory (AAO) in Siding Springs says there is \"no authenticated evidence of a fire caused by a meteorite fall\". True, the fabled objects can whiz in at between 11 and 20 kilometres per second. They can glow like fireballs as they rub against molecules in the upper atmosphere, and they get hot on the outside, but the inside is so cold after life in outer space - below zero degrees - that \"falling stars\" arrive cool as cucumbers. And anyway, fewer than 20 meteorites hit populous parts of the globe yearly. (NB: It's called a meteor in space and a meteorite on the ground.)</p><p>Asteroids are another matter. Dubbed \"minor planets\" by astronomers, they can be kilometres across. When they hit, they release massive amounts of energy. A one-kilometre-wide asteroid striking at 30 kilometres per second would release 2,000 times the energy of the biggest nuclear bomb ever detonated. In 1908 an asteroid or comet some 100 metres across blew up over Siberia and knocked the nearest person off his chair - 110 kilometres away.</p><p>Comets are dirty snowballs with a solid icy core surrounded by volatile material which glows when the comet passes near the sun. Comets present less risk than do asteroids, simply because only about 400 are known to cross the Earth's orbit. Astronomers estimate that there are 2,500 asteroids larger than a kilometre across and 150 million asteroids larger than 10 metres across - all waiting to land on a neighbourhood near you.</p><p>According to Ken Russell, an astronomer at the AAO, the chance of a catastrophic collision occurring within the next 50 years could be as high as one in 6,000. If that happened, he bets that \"civilisation as we know it\" would be on the way out. So isn't anybody watching? Yes and no. Yes, dozens of concerned astronomers around the world - including Dr Duncan Steel's team at AAO - have joined together in an informal group known as Spaceguard. They are scanning parts of the sky with rejigged telescopes and seeking funds for new ones. Their goal is to find \"Earth-crossing\" objects years before they are a menace. The US space agency NASA could then land thruster engines on the most threatening and gently \"nudge\" them out of harm's way.</p><p>But scientists can't look everywhere at once and these objects are hard to spot. A doomsday rock could still creep up without warning and devastate the planet - or just Canberra.</p><p>VISIONARIES</p><p>IN A moving ceremony at Central Station yesterday, Bruce Baird, NSW Transport Minister, climaxed a distinguished political career by announcing the winners of this column's contest to name the day and night XPTs between Sydney and Melbourne. Our photo shows him surrounded by, from left, John Brew, chief executive of the State Rail Authority, and several of our shortlisted contestants: David Catterall (who suggested The Archer) Chris Sim (The Yarra-Parra and the Beach Melba), June Strathmore and Maureen Hathaway (The Pacific Zipper) and Jay Govind (The Chang and The Southern Cross). They are holding the sign about to be affixed to the daytime XPT - The Olympic Spirit, a name suggested by Gary Cox, who was unable to be present yesterday to collect his medal and his tickets to ride the Tilt Train. But Jay Govind was there to collect his prize for naming the night train. We should note that several other people suggested The Southern Cross in their entries, but Govind's argument was judged the most convincing. And so this column's readers have now become part of the history of Australian rail.</p><p>After the ceremony, we begged Bruce Baird for permission to reveal a story he once told us in a confidential capacity about why he has a sentimental attachment to the old Southern Aurora, which was the predecessor to the XPT. But even this close to retirement, he refused to release us from our oath of secrecy. Perhaps one day ...</p><p>OPPORTUNITIES</p><p>WE REPORTED yesterday that there's a shocking injury rate among American zoo workers who treat elephants' feet, and that elephant restraints sell for $US100,000 each. But in Australia, what we need is a dog seatbelt.</p><p>About 5,000 Australian dogs were killed or injured last year after falling from moving cars. RSPCA president Hugh Wirth said the dogs mostly fell off utes or open-tray delivery trucks, but there were as many accidents in the city as in country areas. He said carrying an untethered dog on the back of a moving vehicle is dangerous not only for the dog but also for other motorists. Now all that's required is for someone to design a restraint that will fit every hound from a chihuahua to a great dane.</p><p>Footnote: Larry Vogelnest, a senior veterinarian at Taronga Zoo, told us the zoo does not use elephant restraints \"because we don't actually handle our elephants\". Vogelnest said there is debate among the world's zoos as to whether elephants in captivity should be trained so that they can be handled. Taronga's aren't. The problem, said Vogelnest, is that if zoo workers regularly handle elephants, \"there is a risk that people will be killed occasionally\". As for cleaning an elephant's foot, \"fortunately we have not had a need to\". Our pigmies must run faster.</p><p>GOSSIP</p><p>JOAN Kirner set the standard a few years ago by dressing in leather and singing I Love Rock 'n' Roll on ABC TV's Late Show. Now Jivin' Jeff Kennett has announced he will co-host a State reception for the Rolling Stones in Melbourne next week with the British consulate. The venue and date are being kept secret for security reasons (Kennett is consistently mobbed by groupies). Asked his favourite Stones song, Kennett said yesterday: \"I think probably Satisfaction. I think it's because I can't get any from the Opposition at the moment and I try to do my best to keep the Parliament humming along.\" Hmmm. Opposition Leader John Brumby, distressed at not being invited to the party, also twisted a Stones lyric. \"You can't always get what you want, but I think the Premier always gets what he wants,\" he said. This wasn't a bad line, but then Brumby asked why State receptions weren't held for recent rock visitors the Cranberries and U2. No wonder he wasn't invited.</p><p>STEPHEN Fry is back in England. The star of Blackadder and Jeeves and writer of A Bit of Fry and Laurie, stunned London's theatre world last month when he disappeared after only three performances of a new West End play. Fry wrote to the playwright, Simon Gray, saying he considered himself a failure as an actor. Fry's agent said yesterday that after spending last month in a French village, the actor/writer had returned to Britain and checked into a London clinic. She would not specify what the treatment was for.</p><p>OH, LORD, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz?/ My friends all drive Porsches, I must make amends./ Worked hard all my lifetime, No help from my friends./ So, Lord, won't you buy me a Mercedes-Benz. This satirical ditty, a surprise hit for Janis Joplin in 1970, is being used by Mercedes to sell their cars to the baby boomers who can now afford them. But not everyone is happy about Mercedes' purchase of the rights to the recording. \"Some people will say this is another example of commercialism usurping the icons dear to us,\" said US marketing consultant Ross Goldstein. Others have warned the parody of prayer will alienate buyers in the Bible Belt. But the song's co-writer, Bob Neuwirth, said the song \"was never meant to be taken seriously ... I wonder why it took them so long in a way\". And Joplin's sister Laura, co-manager of Joplin's publishing company, said: \"It does honour to the song as well as to the car. It juxtaposed them and was very much in keeping with her image and humour ... It's a hoot.\"</p><p>DESPITE yesterday's revelation that Australian rock star Michael Hutchence spent Sunday night at a Kent hotel with British TV presenter Paula Yates, Hutchence's girlfriend, supermodel Helena Christensen, has said there is nothing to worry about. \"Michael and I love each other and, although we both have to travel a lot, we have a very steady relationship,\" she reportedly told a Danish newspaper. \"My relationship with Michael is as steady as everybody else's,\" she added. \"We miss each other terribly when we're not together. We have our ups and downs like any other couple.\"</p><p>WHAT'S HAPPENING</p><p>TODAY is March 23, the birthday of actor Joan Crawford (1904), runner Dr Roger Bannister (1929) and singer Glen Campbell (1936), and the deathday of actor Peter Lorre (1964).</p><p>CHIEF Archie Fire Lame Deer, a Native American medicine men who has supped with the Pope, swapped ideas with the Dalai Lama and ridden a Brahman bull for Elvis Presley, will speak at The Gazebo Hotel, Elizabeth Bay at 7.30 pm (tickets $20, phone 1 800 671 543).</p><p>A FORUM titled \"Peace, Justice and the Environment: Whose Common Future\" will feature Christine Milne, leader of the Greens in the Tasmanian Parliament, and Trish Caswell, executive director of the Australian Conservation Foundation, when it begins in Sydney University's Wallace Theatre at 6.30 pm.</p><p>BILL Stefaniak, the ACT Minister for Sport and Recreation, wants a rugby union Test to be played in Canberra in the near future.

So he says. Many don't believe him. The experience, and its aftermath, changed his life. BARBARA HOOKS spoke to him yesterday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IN 1975, 22-year-old Travis Walton was reported missing, abducted by a UFO. But another ordeal awaited the Arizona woodcutter when he showed up five days later, telling of a frightening experience in a strange place amid alien beings. He was not believed. And one suspects that for this quietly spoken and conservatively dressed mill foreman, his earthly reception was more upsetting than any he might have suffered extra-terrestrially.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"What's worse, take your pick,\" he says. \"Is he a liar; is he a druggie; is he a crazy? None of those is very appealing; to not be believed.\" Travis Walton was in Melbourne yesterday to promote `Fire In The Sky', a feature film based on his book about the disappearance 18 years ago.</p><p>With him are his wife, Dana, and brother-in-law Mike Rogers, one of the men who reported Walton missing. By any measure, the two men tell an extraordinary tale which began around 6pm on 5 November, 1975, in White Mountains, Arizona. They say they and five other contract loggers were returning from a day's work felling timber when they saw what they thought was a crashed plane or a forest fire.</p><p>Around the next bend in the track, crew leader Mike Rogers stopped the truck. Over the clearing ahead of them hovered a glowing, saucer- shaped craft. Ignoring the entreaties of his workmates, Travis Walton left the cabin and wandered into the clearing for a closer look.</p><p>Nothing happened at first. Then, as the others watched horrified, Walton was jolted by a vertical beam of light, as if by electric shock, and thrown several metres to the ground. In a panic, Mike Rogers accelerated down the track, but collected himself and returned a few minutes later, only to find that the mysterious object and Travis Walton had vanished.</p><p>A search party was mounted from the men's nearby town of Snowflake.</p><p>But few believed the story of the UFO. Most, including the police, suspected the loggers of murdering their companion, disposing of his body and concocting a cover-up story. All six took polygraph tests, and while they only prove that the subject believes what he or she is saying, five passed and one was deemed inconclusive.</p><p>Five days after his disappearance, Travis Walton turned up in a phone booth on a highway a few kilometres south of the clearing where he was last seen. Dehydrated and hungry but otherwise fit, he told of being held on a table in a humid room equipped with overhead lights. Three creatures with large eyes, domed heads and no hair or fingernails were standing around him. Travis Walton saw other rooms and other creatures, more human-looking than the first group. One put a mask over his face and he lost consciousness. When he came to on the roadside, he could see a small, disc-shaped object rising into the night sky.</p><p>No one has been able to disprove the story or explain away the supporting evidence; circumstantial and eye-witness. Blood and urine tests conducted by the county medical examiner showed Walton had ingested no drugs or alcohol. \"A battery\" of psychiatric tests indicated no \"transitory psychosis\" (hallucinations). His mother also took and passed a lie-detector test when it was suggested she had hidden him for the five days he was missing. Magnetic anomalies were found in the clearing, the loggers' hard-hats recorded a higher-than- normal level of radiation, and Walton's story allegedly matched an unpublicised account of a UFO encounter three months earlier, 100 kilometres away.</p><p>Meanwhile, six eye-witnesses have not changed their story in 17 years.</p><p>And according to one US report, Walton's account is believed in some respected scientific circles.</p><p>What is surprising is that Travis Walton, a man who so desperately wants to be believed, is promoting a film that seems to have taken more liberty than licence with his story. In his hotel room on the 44th floor of the Regent Hotel, he tackles the disparities. \"Well, it's pretty good,\" he says of the film's fidelity. \"You know, it's not a documentary. But it does leave one with the feelings we had at the time. There were certain differences, and I was against any at the start. But (the producers) persuaded me there were good reasons for them. For instance, you're taking a story that spans several years and telling it in an hour and 45 minutes so you've got to do some condensing and simplifying to make it intelligible.</p><p>\"There were seven of us out there in the woods, not six. I had two brothers that were involved and they became one. And the head lawman was actually a composite of three different lawmen. It's very hard for an audience to be introduced to a huge cast of characters and be able to follow all these people. From the director's point of view, the function of the two brothers in the story was the same, so it made sense to combine them into one.\" Fair enough, but other changes and embellishments in the film weaken Walton's case. He did not see a half-decomposed (half-eaten?) human body hidden in a hive-like cell aboard the ship. The human-like creatures he says he did see were in charge of their faculties _ not dead. But they are not shown in the film at all. He also has no memory of the horrific medical tests depicted in the drama. And he was not found naked, as the film suggests.</p><p>\"THE things I had more trouble with were departures from my experience aboard the craft,\" Walton says. \"That was one I thought they could leave exactly as it was ... and I resisted those changes the most. But there were so many things happening to me; powerful, powerful intense emotions, but no way to really show the audience. So they contrived scenes that would generate the same emotions with people.\" In another scene, actor D.B. Sweeney, who plays Walton, has material rather like cling-film pulled over his face and body. \"It's designed to invoke a certain emotion,\" Walton says. \"I regained consciousness in a very enclosed space. It was dimly lit and the atmosphere was difficult to breathe. And I had this feeling of suffocation and claustrophobia that would be very hard to show visually. They showed the actor with this membrane over his face and I think it does a very good job of showing the intense feeling I had.\" For the same reason, Travis Walton justifies the depiction of the medical tests. \"You know, a lot of the terror I felt in the aftermath of this was wondering what they had been doing to me. I woke up in the middle of (the procedure) and interrupted it, so I don't know what they were doing before I regained consciousness. Rather than trying to express the terror of wondering about those possibilities, of what had been going on, they just showed some things that didn't actually happen.\" Medical tests later showed that Walton had not been tampered with physically. \"That was something that was extremely scary to me and I wondered about it. I was afraid of a variety of things; maybe I had acquired some bizarre infection, or maybe damage from breathing that strange atmosphere, or radiation sickness or something like that. The tests all came back negative and that was reassuring. Still, it's something I thought about .. I wanted to have kids.\" His four children (the eldest is 15) are fine.</p><p>At first, Travis Walton turned down the offer for the rights to make this film, just as he had done with the half-dozen or so that preceded it, and the many other requests to buy his story. From all accounts the Walton experience has not been unalloyed joy and he didn't want to make matters worse by selling his credibility.</p><p>At first, he was as keen as anyone to find an alternative explanation.</p><p>And had his disappearance not become an international story, over which he had no control, Walton says he would have maintained his silence. But after conducting \"some reality testing of my own and connecting with the experiences of six other men\" he dismissed any notion of self-delusion. In the past 17 years, Walton has lost friends and job opportunities because he stuck so doggedly to his story. He considered moving away from Snowflake altogether.</p><p>Instead, he cut off the phone for 10 years, banned discussion of the incident at home, and endured the slings and arrows of the sceptics, the doubters and the obnoxious disbelievers. So what persuaded him to become involved in this movie? He even has a cameo role _ in a town meeting called to demand the arrest of Mike Rogers and the others.</p><p>\"I was kind of convinced they'd be true to the material.\" Which they weren't. \"Yeah, well, the essence of the material. They could have made a movie that just focused on the lurid, sensational things, of aliens and space ships and laser battles and what have you. The fact that they did stick to the human side of the story, the way it affected me, the way it affected the community, and how the community reacted to it, that was a really important part of my life story.</p><p>That's what I mean when I say they stayed true to the essence.\" Is he happy with the result?</p><p>\"YEAH, I had misgivings, wondering what's this going to do, stir up all the controversy again? But people's reactions have been good; their attitudes have improved.\" By that, he means people don't necessarily believe, but they are more open-minded, more objective about the details of the case.</p><p>\"Although the documentation is not within the movie, the fact that people can go in and experience this and kind of live it for themselves has caused them to take a little more objective look at the evidence. A lot of the rumors and innuendo that were flying around back then have been disproven over the years.\" Travis Walton is not enjoying the publicity circuit. He and Dana are missing their kids. \"I'm a private kind of a person; I guess I'll be relieved when it's over. There'll come a time again when I won't talk about it anymore, because it's not easy. The movie kind of renewed hopes for me that I could vindicate myself, speak to these issues and the controversy surrounding them and rebut the things that have been said.\" Even after all this time, it still hurts. \"It does, you're talking about my character and my reputation.\" It came time to do some earth-bound shopping. With yesterday's public transport chaos in the city, they could have done with a flying anything to get from A to B. But you know how it is, there's never one around when you need one.</p><p>`Fire In The Sky' opens in Melbourne on 13 May at the Russell, Hoyts and Village cinemas.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo, illustration Travis Walton in Melbourne yesterday (above) and how he appears in the film</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P7G-Y1W0-TXN5-S1WF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yhp2b0vjsw1j3vbbfd9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1993</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1762\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1993 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"05\" year=\"1993\"><dateText>May 6, 1993 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Profile</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Film review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000996</classCode><className>KIDNAPPING &amp; ABDUCTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001151</classCode><className>MISSING PERSONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>N113300CC</classCode><className>LOGGING INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GX015</classCode><className>MELBOURNE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS007</classCode><className>VICTORIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

It was a day of extreme fire danger - the worst in three summers. The conditions spawned infernos around the state and seriously tested the CFA's \"stay or leave early\" policy, especially around Anakie, north of Geelong. Four years on, he explores why the policy proved so murderous on last year's Black Saturday, before returning to Anakie to hear five very different perspectives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the '60s, a canberra scientist named Alan McArthur completed the kind of life-saving experiment that, had it involved anything other than arson, might have seen him grace an Australian bank-note by now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Time and again he set fire to the bush outside the capital and gave it a 40-minute start before letting a fire crew try to halt it. His aim was to determine the relative influences of temperature, wind speed and humidity. Further factoring in drought and fuel dryness, he arrived at a formula that he called the Forest Fire Danger Index (FDI). At very low scores, the fire might fizzle out by itself. At 12, the crew generally managed to extinguish it. Around 25, they were in trouble. And at 50, they had Buckley's.</p><p>The formula came to be widely used. Land managers applied it to determine the right, safe time for fuel reduction burn-offs, and still do. Meanwhile, CFA brigades used it to warn of the day's fire danger via rainbow-coloured signs by the sides of highways. An Extreme rating, coded red, meant the index had breached 50, the CFA's trigger for declaring a Total Fire Ban.</p><p>Problem was, Extreme didn't really mean extreme at all. McArthur's index didn't end at 50. The formula had been calibrated so that a score of 100 reflected the perfect-storm conditions of Black Friday, 1939, when 71 people died.</p><p>Three years ago, the authors of a joint CSIRO and Bureau of Meteorology study into the effects of climate change twigged to the fact that the CFA's warning system urgently needed updating. Weather forecasting had improved immeasurably since McArthur's day, and the public deserved to know what degree of fire danger to expect. So-called Extreme days would become more frequent and more severe, and it would no longer do to bundle your 100-plus Ash Wed\u00c2\u00adnesdays with your ho-hum TFBs (days of Total Fire Ban). The authors recommended that two new categories be added: Very Extreme, for days peaking between 75 and 99, and Catastrophic, for those exceeding 100.</p><p>State and federal authorities received the report in the winter of 2007. Nothing happened. Along came February 7, 2009. Five days in advance, the FDI had been tipped to top 150 in the ranges around Melbourne. Values greater than 100 are largely academic, much in the way that cyclone ratings stop at category five. But 150-plus was unprecedented. No one within the CFA could have failed to grasp its meaning: to get the hell out of the way. (It's no coincidence that not one firefighter was among the dead on Black Saturday.)</p><p>The figures were not conveyed to the public. No one had explained the fire danger index to us before, and no one was game to start doing so now. To be sure, Victorians were repeatedly warned by the Premier, John Brumby, that the weather would be \"seriously bad\" - hotter, windier and drier than 1983's Ash Wednesday. We were advised not to travel. We understood - we'd just endured a record run of 40-plus temperatures. Add 60kmh northerlies, and Saturday would definitely be a day to stay home. But we were also led to understand it was policy as usual: as nagged ad nauseam by authorities and their emergency broadcasters, Victorians were to \"activate\" their bushfire plans and \"prepare to stay and defend, or leave early\".</p><p>What we didn't know, but authorities did, was that the \"stay or go\" policy was never intended to cope with 100-plus conditions. Both the Australian Standard for Building in Bushfire-Prone Areas and the CFA's guide to individual bushfire survival plans were modelled on studies that assumed a worst-case fire danger index of 100. February 7 was, in fact, a day when the only bushfire plan worth \"activating\" was the second option: leave early. But we weren't told that.</p><p>At kilmore on black saturday, near the snapped powerline that ignited the day's deadliest fire, the FDI peaked at 189. Of the 173 people who died that day, 113 died in their homes.</p><p>Ahead of this summer, state governments belatedly agreed to split Ex\u00c2\u00adtreme fire weather days, i.e., days of Total Fire Ban, into three new fire danger ratings. The \"stay or go\" policy has yielded accordingly: on a Severe day (50-74), you'll need a sound plan to defend your home; on an Extreme day (75-99), you'll need a sound house as well (i.e., compliant with fire safety standards), and on a 100-plus Catastrophic day - just go, as soon as you can.</p><p>But the policy remains shaky. It's a fine line - a degree in temperature, an extra puff in wind speed - that separates an Extreme day from a Catastrophic one. Besides, the intensity of any fire is at the mercy of fuel loads and topo\u00c2\u00adgraphy as well as weather conditions. In the barren north-west of Victoria, for instance, 100-plus days occur almost yearly, yet are unlikely to see a catastrophic fire, whereas in the hillier parts of south-eastern Australia, such a day almost invariably earns itself a black name.</p><p>When Good Weekend was invited to the CFA's control room four summers ago, the FDI reached the high 80s in southern Victoria, based on 43-degree temperatures, flailing northerlies and forests dry as kindling. \"If the forecast were for a cyclone,\" I wrote, \"it would be a category four - Cyclone Tracy strength.\" By mid-afternoon, bushfires were raging through the Gram\u00c2\u00adpians, the Latrobe Valley and the Brisbane Ranges, north of Geelong.</p><p>About 7pm, the deputy chief briefed staff that 18 houses had been lost around Anakie, at the base of the Brisbane Ranges. Whether there were fatalities, he didn't yet know, but his face was grave. An hour later, at a nearby emergency relief centre where some 200 people had gathered seeking refuge and information, the situation was no clearer. Said an anguished policeman, \"We don't yet know if we'll find any deceased. Some of these homes are tucked right into the bush and we know there are people who stayed. Fact is, if they keep their properties clear, and they have a [bushfire] plan, we and the CFA encourage them to stay. That's the policy. As to whether it's wise ... I have to say that from where I stand now, it's a bit of a worry.\"</p><p>By midnight, residents were able to return. On the face of it, the \"stay or go\" policy had stood up well. All those who had stayed to defend their homes had managed to do so. Only abandoned houses had been lost. No one perished. But it transpired the local version of \"stay or go\" had been more like \"wait and see\". Most residents had delayed leaving, often to the last minutes. Several families who planned to defend ended up fleeing when members panicked at the sight of the front roaring towards them. In other cases, wives left and their husbands stayed on to fight solo and, in at least two instances, drunk. Writing in The New Yorker in October, Christine Kenneally contrasted our \"stay or go\" approach with that of Californians, who resort to mandatory evacuations in the face of bushfires. She put it down to \"a streak of self-reliance in the Australian character\", and went on to contemplate \"the extent to which the deaths of Black Saturday were the result not just of the Australian landscape but of an entire mentality\".</p><p>Doubtless, self-reliance took a knock on Black Saturday. In coming summers at least, before memories fade and lessons are unlearnt, more Australians will choose to leave in the face of fire. But when we returned to Anakie, four years on, we found support for \"stay or go\" resurgent. If anything, there was an attitude that the fire had been good for the area, in that it had exposed local complacency and the weaknesses in people's fire plans - without actually killing anyone.</p><p>They'll be ready next time, goes this line of thinking. Maybe they will. Then again, maybe the next fire will be worse.</p><p>farmer &amp; CFA volunteer Peter Stray</p><p>Peter Stray, a stalwart of the Maude Rural Fire Brigade, lives alone on the flat open country south of the Brisbane Ranges, in a weatherboard farmhouse an hour's drive west of Melbourne. He doesn't have a fire plan. In the event of fire he'd be out with the crew, probably defending the homes of city escapees who, to his lasting puzzlement, insist on settling right in harm's way, in the bush up on the ridges, hankering for a view of properties like his.</p><p>Four years ago, Stray knew he was in for a rough weekend. On Saturday morning, the Department of Sustainability and Environment, which has responsibility for fire suppression on public land, called on local brigades to help contain a fire sparked by lightning in the Brisbane Ranges National Park. When Stray finally got home that night at 2am, he slept badly, fearing the rangers' containment lines wouldn't hold in the 40-plus temperatures and 40kmh-plus northerlies to come. They didn't. Late Sunday morning, as the FDI began climbing sharply, the fire spotted into fresh bushland. Forty more trucks and seven choppers were dispatched but it was too late. The tankers fell back to concentrate on saving Anakie township. The fire crowned in the trees atop the last escarpment and sent a storm of embers over the lowlands, sparking fears of grass fires that could run all the way to the coast. Fortunately, the paddocks were drought-barren and the fire was held at a road to the south.</p><p>\"We were very lucky nobody got killed,\" says Stray. \"There was a fair bit of community apathy here. Many people seemed to think that fire trucks would magically appear on their doorstep.\" In the preceding months, Stray had helped the CFA run its Community Fireguard program, which advises residents on how to survive fire. He was nervous to know how they had fared, especially those he'd helped plan to stay. \"We don't tell people they should stay. But we do tell them that if they leave, they'll probably lose their house to ember attack.</p><p>\"Problem is, people's fire plans vary greatly and even an excellent plan can't give you absolute protection. It might hold up on your average Total Fire Ban, but when the index is pushing 90, as it was that day, it's really going to test things.\"</p><p>At the same time, Stray wonders whether authorities have overestimated people's psychological capacity to rely on their fire plans. \"We taught people to stay and defend or leave early. But would I do so myself? I can't answer that. I don't know how I'd handle it, if a wall of flame came over the rise and the sky turned dark and it started raining embers, the wind howling, heat and smoke everywhere ... I can understand why people would flee at the last minute.\"</p><p>On Black Saturday, Stray's brigade ended up in the Latrobe Valley. \"It was chaos. We were held up in the staging area for hours, which was very frustrating. But on a day like that it's likely you go in after the fire and do what you can to save things. I never want to see weather like that again. If it had been like that during the Anakie fire, I would have ended up [stationed] in Geelong.\"</p><p>stayers and defenders</p><p>John and Carlene Baker</p><p>The Bakers live in a hidden gully in the far south-eastern corner of the Brisbane Ranges, hemmed in by forest. Not long after they moved here 12 years ago, a local brigade captain drove up their long, bumpy access track and knocked on the door. \"He was shaking his head at us,\" recalls Carlene. \"He warned us that if a fire came, we shouldn't expect a truck to come and save us. Then he asked us for a donation.\"</p><p>The Bakers decided to join the CFA, but a different brigade. They trained in firefighting and acquired fire-resistant clothes. They clad their dream cabin, made from recycled timber, in corrugated iron on three sides. They installed a water tank and fitted a pump to their four-wheeler. They also created two perimeters of \"defendable space\" around the house - an outer one, which they kept as clear of fuel as possible, and an inner circle of closely cropped lawn, which extended to the stables and barn.</p><p>\"Our strategy was to save the outbuildings in a low-intensity fire, but if it was a high-intensity fire, we would retreat to saving just the house. And if that failed, we would save ourselves by keeping low and putting our hoses' fog nozzles over us.\"</p><p>Summers came and went. Then came January 22, 2006. \"We sat here on the veranda pretty well all day waiting for the fire,\" says John Baker, who sports a pioneer's beard and makes dental prosthetics in Geelong. \"We knew it would come. I wasn't at all nervous. We had five fire hoses and 60,000 litres of water. And I knew everyone would do what I told them to do.\"</p><p>The Bakers crowded their five cows, 22 sheep and one alpaca into the barn. They locked their two dogs, cat and chickens in the house. The pig was tethered on the veranda. Their son and daughter had been given the option of leaving, but they'd said no. Still, when embers the size of small birds began landing and igniting around them, Molly, then 13, lost her will for a moment. Says John: \"I grabbed her and told her, 'This fire is going to be the worst thing you've ever seen. Just do your job and everything will be fine.\"</p><p>\"The wind was coming from the north all day,\" says Carlene. \"We never saw or smelt anything, as the fire was to our north-west. Then the change happened. Everything went dark and suddenly the wind started coming in from everywhere. Within a couple of minutes, there was fire all around us.\"</p><p>Gusts lifted the aviary and dashed it onto the ground. Branches thudded against their hard hats. The fire rumbled loud as a train. Carlene kept the hose on the stables. John sprayed the house. Unbeknown to him, embers were gusting in through the gaps between the roof iron and the roof cap to land on the beds upstairs. Inside, Molly, bucket in hand, was onto it.</p><p>Thoughts of doom flashed through their heads. \"I kept thinking, 'What am</p><p>I doing with my kids here?\"\" recalls Carlene. At one stage John crouched down next to the house and had to steel himself. \"I thought, 'Holy shit, we're in trouble here.'\" He ordered Carlene to give up on protecting the stable; they could only hope to save the house. But she wouldn't hear of it.</p><p>The battle lasted four hours. About 11pm, they judged themselves saved. They tried to ring out, but the phone line was dead. \"We just sat there on the veranda and looked out at the devastation. It felt like we were the last people on earth,\" says Carlene.</p><p>Even now, John can't suppress an air of victoriousness. \"We were prepared for the worst - you have to be, because it's like going to war,\" he says. \"I like the 'stay or go' policy. My feeling is that if you're going to live in the bush, you have to take some level of responsibility. But it's not for everybody. If you need to think about whether you can cope with staying, you should go.\"</p><p>left early</p><p>Nick and Bonnie Lanham</p><p>There have been three years of drought since the Anakie fire, and the Brisbane Ranges are struggling to\u00c2\u00a0recover. On the ridges, many of the trees still stand\u00c2\u00a0black and naked, and the koalas, once abundant, have yet to return. Along the southernmost escarpment, De Motts Road winds through a subdivision of about 20 bush blocks with fine views. A third are for sale, including the Lanhams' rebuilt home.</p><p>In the lead-up to the fire, Nick and Bonnie Lanham were among the very few De Motts Road residents who chose to leave early. Of their three neighbours, one stayed to fight, one stayed until his wife panicked and the third left just as flames began licking at the Lanhams' house, tucked among the box gums and ironbarks.</p><p>\"We bought our house just six months before the fire,\" says Nick. \"We didn't have a bushfire plan, because we hadn't really considered fire. We were living in blissful ignorance on our dream bush block. The neighbours told us there hadn't been a fire in 40 years, so we figured we'd be right.\"</p><p>Nick and Bonnie had left the previous night to stay with friends on the coast and complete a fun run in the morning. \"We grabbed the dogs, computer and photo albums, just in case,\" says Nick, a paramedic. \"The morning was way too hot to run, so we pulled out. We kept an ear out for news of the fire in the ranges. We heard it had broken containment lines and I was thinking of returning to do a little fire preparation. But it was hard to know what was going on because there was very little information coming our way.\"</p><p>All afternoon, black smoke billowed over Geelong, and the Lanhams fervently hoped their possessions weren't going up with it. About 5pm, as Bonnie drove Nick to work, they heard on the car radio that De Motts Road was under attack. Shortly afterwards, Nick heard from his neighbour's wife. Her husband had rung her to say he was abandoning his house and that it looked like the Lanhams had lost theirs. \"We got back the next day,\" says Bonnie. \"We lost the garage, two bedrooms, the bathroom and the laundry. A helicopter drop saved the main part of the house. Actually, our belongings suffered more damage from water than they did from fire.\"</p><p>They decided to rebuild. It took Nick three years. He cleared trees and used fire-resistant materials where possible. \"We didn't plan on selling,\" he reflects. \"I completed a bushfire awareness course online and we had fire extinguishers, a dam, a water tank, a pump, a fire hose and gutter covers.</p><p>\"In the event of a fire our plan was that we would stick around to fight spot fires, but if it loomed as a front we'd leave. We figured it's a good road out and we'd be out of danger in two minutes.</p><p>\"Then came Black Saturday. It put everything into perspective. Our plan didn't allow for something like that. We'd have been dead.\"</p><p>Russell Rees</p><p>CFA Chief</p><p>At 2pm in the control room on January 22, 2006, Russ Rees, chief of Victoria's CFA, received a call from his regional commander that the Anakie blaze was scaring his men and could not be stopped. Someone produced a map and drew a teardrop, representing the likely fire path. \"That's a dangerous spot,\" the chief said, leaning in. \"If it gets in there\" - he pricked his pen at a spray of little black squares along De Motts Road - \"that's a lot of people under threat.\"</p><p>Unconfirmed reports of houses ablaze started coming in an hour later, but it would be another eight hours before anyone knew whether there were people in them. Meanwhile, another five large fires were demanding his attention. Scores of teardrop maps were drawn that day. Predictions were continually being updated or discarded. Outgoing warnings were mostly educated guesses. Nobody really knew what was happening on the ground - a situation Rees calls \"the fog of war\".</p><p>On Black Saturday, what was being predicted could happen had often as not already happened. The fires were moving so fiercely and spotting so far ahead that incident controllers on the ground could no longer tell (a) whose incident it was, and (b) whether it was one or several incidents. The confusion in the field turned to chaos in the control room. Incoming reports (there were 600 reported fires that day) made little sense on the map. People thought in terms of teardrops when, in fact, they should have joined the dots - there were rabid, roiling dobs of fire coursing down the map on the big screen.</p><p>For Rees, who is fond of military analogies, it was \"like the Battle of Britain. You know the planes are coming, but you don't know where ... It was a total bombardment, this totally erratic fire behaviour. We didn't know how bad Marysville was. There was nothing, no communication, going in and out. It was beyond imagining.\"</p><p>Rees has been criticised for his insistence in the face of a communications debacle that he had more troops on the ground than ever before, and that he was satisfied every one of those did his or her best. Indeed, his reappointment a few months later for another two years met with some surprise. However, it's likely the Premier, John Brumby, retained Rees not for his policy brain but for his pastoral role within the CFA. The organisation is part emergency service, part club, and no one knows this better than Rees, who, as a boy from a battler family in the Latrobe Valley, found solace and strength in Moe's junior fire brigade after losing his eldest brother when he was eight and his father when he was 14. At present, firefighters are nursing deep sensitivities inflicted not only by Black Saturday but by the ongoing Royal Commission. The Government knows this is not the time to ditch Rees. There is too much healing yet to be done.</p><p>Rees himself is still seeing a psychologist. \"Black Saturday is with me the rest of my life. It's like losing a child or getting divorced or your parents dying. It will never, ever go away.\" But he is deeply aggrieved, too, by the reports that he has failed to protect Victorians.</p><p>\"You have bad days. Days when you sit there and say, 'I'm sick of this crap.' You learn to build a shield around yourself. I don't read the papers any more. I don't watch the news. I'll have someone ... tell me if there's something I should know. Because it's all just too overwhelming. It would have been easy to quit. But part of my job is to hold the team together.\"</p><p>Rees stands by the \"stay or go\" policy. \"Last summer very few people had very good, complete plans. 'Stay or go' wasn't just about saving houses. But it became just about houses. The message went from 'prepare, stay and defend, or leave early' to 'stay or go'. It kept being dumbed down. One day it was quoted to me as 'fight or flight'. Now, that's a response driven by adrenalin, which is the last thing we want.</p><p>\"I sometimes think fire safety is as complicated as road safety. Look at the number of road safety campaigns, yet\u00c2\u00a0we're trying to distil fire safety to a simple message. What we are trying to get through to people is that you are\u00c2\u00a0vulnerable, your plan has to be solid. It has to cope with 100-plus days, and on those days it might be a different plan.\"</p><p>Rees says all other measures - fuel reduction, community refuges, improved messaging, bunkers, fire-safe powerlines and better policing against arson - can only be a part of a solution. \"What I see is that Australians want to be in a position to make their own choices, but they don't want to be in a position where they have to take responsibility for those.</p><p>\"We're living in a way that is riskier than what we realise. This is drought-affected country and it is permanently changing. What we've learnt is that we've got to put a lot more effort into the way we plan for that. Clearly education is not enough. We need wholesale behavioural change, and it may need regulatory control to get us there.\" But forced evacuations, California-style, remain off the table. \"There's an element in the Australian psyche that says, 'We're not going to run, we're going to fight this bastard.' It's deep-seated in our culture.\"</p><p>Kevin Tolhurst</p><p>Fire Behaviour Expert</p><p>On Black Saturday, Kevin Tolhurst was in the control room at CFA headquarters. The fury of the fires north of Melbourne caught him by\u00c2\u00a0surprise as much as anyone. Tolhurst, who'd been studying and\u00c2\u00a0predicting fire behaviour since 1998, had spent most of the day concentrating on a large fire threatening Victoria's power supply in the Latrobe Valley and, like others in the room, went home late that night not knowing whole towns had been lost. Later he was to tell the Royal Commission that the energy emitted in the fires that day amounted to 1500\u00c2\u00a0Hiroshima bombs.</p><p>Tolhurst is highly critical of current Australian building standards. Under the\u00c2\u00a0Australian Standard for Building in a Bushfire-Prone Environment, for instance, the scorched towns of Marysville, Strathewen and Kinglake were not deemed fire-prone, because the standards consider only the vegetation within 100 metres of the home.</p><p>\"Anyone with fire behaviour knowledge knows that fires are acting on a\u00c2\u00a0much larger scale,\" says Tolhurst. \"Really you need to look at a radius of 10 kilometres to see how much threat you're under.\"</p><p>Tolhurst points out that much of Australian fire science, safety and design is based on relatively predictable fires that move as a front. But there are fires and there are firestorms. Hilly topography and certain forest types will intensify a fire's heat, but so, too, may the size of the fire itself. Allowed a run-up of a few hours, a fire will form a convection column that sucks in the surrounding air and heat, not just from the fire-front, but also from the burning fuel behind it.</p><p>Says Tolhurst: \"As we saw on February 7, a convection column can create windspeeds of up to 120, 140, 180 kilometres an hour. So if you are hit by fire relatively early, in the first hour or two, then your chance of defending your property is much greater than if the fire has been going for three hours, when it might have a footprint of five or 10 kilometres across, being held together by a convection column. A megafire becomes so hot it can come at\u00c2\u00a0you from almost any direction. So your house really has to be able to withstand not only fire but also cyclonic winds.\"</p><p>Tolhurst advocates a new ratings system that assesses individual homes for their \"defendability\", based on their location in the landscape as well as\u00c2\u00a0on their construction. The ratings would broadly reflect the weather conditions up to which a house could be defended against wildfire. As an example, Tolhurst (who accompanied Good Weekend to Anakie) rates the Bakers' home highly, believing its box-like construction, small windows and bare yard make it defendable in the worst possible conditions. He's less confident about the Lanhams' house, rating it as defendable in the event of \"severe\" fire weather conditions, i.e., a fire danger index of up to 75, pending further improvements.</p><p>\"I think the 'prepare, stay and defend or leave early' policy is largely a good one, but if we are going to expect people to take more responsibility for their own welfare, then it's not fire trucks we've got to provide them with, it's actually good information, good intelligence.</p><p>\"People in fire-prone areas need to know what they're capable of and what their property can withstand.\" \u00ef\u00bf\u00bc</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: Photograph Julian Kingma</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-5sp5c1o2ig41gq1fobrw</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2010</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7XJJ-C3C1-2RR2-D407-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4383\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2010 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"01\" year=\"2010\"><dateText>January 16, 2010 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents and Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

Steven is very young and very</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">successful\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Connery, in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade, plays Dr Henry</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Jones, Indy's father, a wonderfully eccentric medieval scholar</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">in the tradition of real-life Victorian adventurer, Sir Richard</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Burton.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It was a role he jumped at, as much because he relished the</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">idea of playing Indiana's father as for the chance of working</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">with Spielberg whom Connery says he has known for \"some years\".</p><p>Connery who has worked with some of the greatest film directors</p><p>of all time in his long and illustrious career that spans 48</p><p>movies and includes films with Alfred Hitchcock (Marnie) and</p><p>John Huston (The Man who would be King) says: \"I thought it</p><p>was a marvellous idea to introduce the father of Indiana Jones</p><p>and to show the son, or rather the boy, Indy, and what gave</p><p>him all that zip.</p><p> \"I had known Steven for a number of years and I am a great</p><p>admirer of his and the chance to work with him I knew would</p><p>be bundles of fun and afterwards this proved to be the case.</p><p>I enjoyed working with him tremendously.\"</p><p> Connery gets impatient with Hollywood's establishment and Spielberg's</p><p>peers continual refusal to give Spielberg true acclaim or hand</p><p>out an Oscar.</p><p> Spielberg missed out on Oscars for E.T., the Color Purple and</p><p>in a surprise this year, received no major nominations for the</p><p>year's big smash hit, the innovative Who Framed Roger Rabbit,</p><p>which for the first time ever, mixed animation and life action</p><p>creating a whole new process.</p><p> When the Academy Awards again snubbed Spielberg, who produced</p><p>Roger Rabbit, Disney's boss, Jeff Katzenberg who financed the</p><p>film exasperatedly said: \"We had</p><p>a running joke that our chances suffered from the three Ss</p><p>success, special effects and Spielberg.\" Said Connery: \"I think there</p><p>is</p><p>quite a bit of envy of Spielberg. \"I remember when John Huston made the</p><p>Man who Would be King</p><p>there was a screening in Los Angeles at the Directors' Guild</p><p>and I went with Michael Caine. We were sitting at the back and</p><p>we had this showing to what were supposedly our peers and all</p><p>those people who are part of this business.</p><p> \"It was not a nice experience. The atmosphere was quite antagonistic.</p><p>Half way through the film my toes were crunched up in my shoes</p><p>and I was perspiring quite a bit.\"HE added: \"I turned to Michael Caine and said: 'Do you think</p><p>this is as bad as I think it is?' And he said: 'It's worse.</p><p>It's appalling.'</p><p> \"And we went to this thing afterwards at the house of John</p><p>Foreman who was the producer, and Jack Nicholson came and Peter</p><p>Bogdanovich and Cybill Shepherd and Ryan O'Neal.</p><p> \"Ryan came up to us and said: 'Hey, it went terrific' and</p><p>I said: 'You must be joking. I thought it was dreadful. The</p><p>response.'</p><p> \"That's when Jack Nicholson laughed and said: 'Well, you've</p><p>got to remember they booed the Cuckoo's Nest.' \"</p><p> Connery shakes his head. \"What does that mean? To me it means</p><p>there is something very wrong in Hollywood. It's some kind of</p><p>envy or something. I don't think you should share your films</p><p>with people who want to be so disagreeable and show it so apparently.</p><p> \"And as far as Steven Spielberg is concerned it is envy.\"</p><p> Connery believes instead of snubbing or ignoring Spielberg</p><p>or dismissing his films as \"special effects kiddie comics\"</p><p>Hollywood should be behind him and encouraging him.</p><p> \"He is still very young and he is going to make other movies</p><p>and when he ventures into other fields, such as the Empire of</p><p>the Sun and the Color Purple, somehow there seems to be this</p><p>real need in Hollywood to hit him with a big stick because all</p><p>his other movies have made so much money. What's wrong with</p><p>money? Particularly in America? In America they love money,</p><p>I thought.</p><p> \"Everyone seems to think being financially successful is terrific</p><p>except where Steven is concerned. But why shouldn't he be financially</p><p>successful? Hitchcock's films - apart from a very few, one of them being</p><p>mine - made a lot of money.\"</p><p> According to Connery, Spielberg is a \"terrific director\".</p><p> \"He is very good with visuals and he is a wonderful storyteller.</p><p>I think technically Steven is not as assured in the composition</p><p>of things as Hitchcock, but Hitchcock began as an art director,</p><p>therefore he was a painter and a conceptualist before and he</p><p>had visualised before Steven was even born.</p><p> \"But remember Hitchcock and Huston were both making movies</p><p>into their 70s and 80s and how old is Spielberg now? Just 42.</p><p>So you have to give him more time and what Hollywood should</p><p>really be doing is encouraging him.</p><p> \"Steven is trying to do a lot of things and I think he has</p><p>got a way to go, still, and he's got to understand certain things</p><p>about actors too, and other stuff. But that is understandable.</p><p>I think he's tremendous.\"</p><p> Connery says critics of Spielberg overlook his professionalism. \"He</p><p>has film storyboards that block everything from A to Z,\"</p><p>says Connery. \"He and George Lucas know exactly what they want</p><p>to get before the movie is shot and they know every sequence</p><p>. So when we get on the set we shoot that and then if they find</p><p>some bits of business by the actors or some invention they have</p><p>themselves, a bit of improvisation on top, they will shoot that</p><p>as well, but Steven is already prepared and because of this</p><p>is able to give himself alternatives that can be used when they</p><p>get into the cutting room.\"CONNERY adds: \"Steven is much more prepared than most people</p><p>realise. Like all really good directors he has piercing observation</p><p>of what to start a scene from, which may be missed by the general</p><p>public, but it is there and has the same brilliance of a John</p><p>Ford, a John Huston or a Hitchcock.</p><p> \"Steven Spielberg is much more professionally prepared than</p><p>this kid who shoots comic book impressions that has arisen.\"</p><p> Spielberg, who finished shooting Indiana Jones and the Last</p><p>Crusade last August and has since worked on the movie with post-production</p><p>and editing, is about to start work on his newest film and</p><p>first truy adult love story, Always. It will star Richard Dreyfuss</p><p>and Holly Hunter, and is a remake of the 1943 Spencer Tracy-Irene</p><p>Dunne classic, A Guy Named Joe.</p><p> \"This is the only remake I would ever consider directing myself,\"</p><p>Spielberg says. \"It is a story that touched my soul when I</p><p>was 14 years old and saw it on television and it was the second</p><p>movie that ever made me cry that didn't have a deer in it. It's</p><p>a reassuring story. It's about life and saying that while you're</p><p>here, do it while you can.\"</p><p> In the original, Joe, played by Tracy, was a World War II pilot</p><p>who is killed, but returns to earth as an invisible but influential</p><p>presence. Spielberg's film will update the storyline and centre</p><p>around the firefighters of Montana and Wyoming and when his</p><p>hero, Dreyfuss dies, it is in a forest fire. Spielberg already has</p><p>spectacular fire footage. When Yellowstone</p><p>National Park went up in flames last November Spielberg was</p><p>there shooting for two weeks as the inferno raged.</p><p> While Spielberg's movies have always been about love - love</p><p>of a child, love for an alien, love of sisters, father and son</p><p>love (as in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade), buddy love</p><p>and brotherly love, Always is his first bona fide adult love</p><p>story.</p><p> \"Yep,\" he says with a grin, \"and I don't want it to be a</p><p>mushy gushy lip-lock love story. I think the best love stories</p><p>are about people we perceive as being just like us.\"</p><p> Which is why he says he has cast Richard Dreyfuss (his star</p><p>in Jaws and Close Encounters of the Third Kind) because he believes</p><p>Dreyfuss is the personification of everyman and he has chosen</p><p>Broadcast News star, Holly Hunter, because he believes she is</p><p>everywoman \"feisty, smart and extremely opinionated.\"</p><p> Spielberg is keen to make movies that don't necessarily bear</p><p>his distinctive stamp - a melodramatic fantastic vision - and</p><p>he says he admires A Guy Named Joe's director Victor Fleming.</p><p> \"He made that movie and Captains Courageous and Gone with</p><p>the Wind and the Wizard of Oz, but there is no such thing as</p><p>a quintessential Victor Fleming movie. He could adapt to any</p><p>story, any period any premise.\"</p><p> Spielberg says he has matured and while once he could not have</p><p>imagined directing a film like Martin Scorsese's Raging Bull,</p><p>now he says he can imagine it.</p><p> A movie buff and scholar, Spielberg not only studies early</p><p>movies and the works of Fleming, Capra, Huston and Hitchcock,</p><p>but is aware of new directors and upcoming talents.HE gave hot new directors like Robert Zemeckis (Roger Rabbit,</p><p>Back to the Future I, II and III - the last two currently being</p><p>filmed) their breaks, has pushed the writer of Moonstruck, John</p><p>Patrick Shanley, into the director's chair with the movie Joe</p><p>Versus the Volcano with Tom Hanks, and keeps a careful eye on</p><p>all movies that release each year.</p><p> Of 1988, Steven Spielberg believes the best movie was Fred</p><p>Schepisi's A Cry in the Dark, based on the Lindy Chamberlain</p><p>story.</p><p> \"It was an underrated movie with a new form of storytelling,\"</p><p>he says.</p><p> Then he grins. \"But I also saw Lawrence of Arabia at the end</p><p>of 1988 and that puts it all in perspective. That film in its</p><p>original form made me want to go back to film school.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>2 photos: harrison ford, sean connery iin a scene fromindiana jones and the last crusade;

Official Government statements explain only that Suharto has been resting after suffering from \"exhaustion\" during an extended overseas tour. But diplomats and insiders believe the 76-year-old leader had suffered a slight stroke and continues to be plagued by kidney and blood-pressure problems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There has been no coup attempt, the usually aloof armed forces felt compelled to announce, adding they were ready to handle any breakdown in social order that the deep economic crisis may trigger.</p><p>The rupiah and the stockmarket rallied moderately when Suharto made his first public appearance on Thursday morning to address new military graduates. His voice was slow and his speech short.</p><p>But already deep questions about Indonesia's future were being publicly posed.</p><p>The terms were vague and the debates carefully worded, as they usually are in a nation where such an ordinary act as forming a new political party can be punished as treason.</p><p>But the meaning was clear. The political and economic pyramid that Suharto has skilfully built, with himself at the apex, must be reformed for Indonesia to survive.</p><p>So personalised has power become under Suharto that the economic survival of a nation is linked to the health of one man, says an analyst of the rupiah's collapse.</p><p>Suharto has not anointed a successor, nor put into place reforms that would even begin to accommodate the growing pressures for democratisation and justice.</p><p>The process of politics in modern Indonesia is still played out behind the scenes, much as it was in the old fiefdoms of the Javanese kings. Like the Javanese shadow puppets, only the outlines of the characters can be seen as they battle their way through the minefield of intrigues in their quest for power in the royal courts.</p><p>What the financial markets fear in the long term is not the inevitable ill-health or death of an ageing leader, but the vacuum he would leave behind, which throws into question the viability of the political model.</p><p>\"Good governance cannot be established upon one person's goodwill,\" says scholar Nurcholish Madjid.</p><p>He says Indonesia must abandon the model of state leadership under one man.</p><p>Muslim leader Abdurrahman Wahid, says: \"There is a very deep change. People now see that the end of the President's rule is not a possibility, but an imperative.\"</p><p>The Petition of 50, a group of former senior officials of the Suharto Government, emerged to make a statement: \"President Suharto took office promising democratic reforms. But in fact the people's sovereignty was ignored and the nation is ruled in an authoritarian way without effective political and social control.\"</p><p>In a nation that has regarded Suharto as unshakeable, a man of power beyond that of an ordinary politician, the possessor of the special protection of the \"pulung\", such criticism has been taboo.</p><p>But, on Thursday a group of university students in Yogyakarta symbolically circumvented the closed political system and called their own referendum: the question was simple. Should Suharto lead Indonesia into a seventh term when presidential elections are held next March?</p><p>\"We have taken a quantum leap in uncertainty. There is not just disquiet, there is real anxiety,\" says one diplomat.</p><p>\"Everything is hidden behind smoke screens and mirrors. There is now a direct relationship between the market and rumors . . .</p><p>\"Look around the region, everywhere there is some kind of plan for the future and public debate over dealing with the economic crisis. In Indonesia, the future is just a black hole,\" says one economist.</p><p>Asia's economic crisis started in Thailand with the collapse of the Thai baht. One by one the nations around the region fell to the so-called contagion effect. Indonesia, much praised for its strong economic fundamentals, held on for a month by using its reserves to prop up the rupiah before it allowed the currency to slide.</p><p>Like Thailand, Indonesia's private sector had chalked up an overwhelming short-term United States dollar debt while riding on the crest of optimism after three decades of growth. The further the rupiah fell against the US dollar, the bigger that debt became in rupiah terms.</p><p>The more rupiah Indonesian corporates were forced to spend to buy US dollars to pay their debts, the faster the rupiah fell. The bigger the debt burden became, the more nervous foreign and domestic investors felt, and so the house of cards fell down. The Indonesian rupiah lost up to 58 per cent of its value in less than six months, becoming the worst performing currency in the world.</p><p>The market capitalisation of the Jakarta stockmarket was about $US100 billion ($A151 billion) in June this year, but had fallen to $US23 billion by last week, according to C. J. Koning, country manager of the ABN-AMR0 Bank.</p><p>Corporate Indonesia, he says, owes $US43 billion over the next year, or $US3.6 billion a month. Technically, the stockmarket is already bankrupt, its market capitalisation considerably less than its debt burden.</p><p>In October the International Monetary Fund announced a $US38 billion rescue package to help the Suharto Government arrest the slide and win back confidence. The IMF also came with demands for reform.</p><p>But those reforms challenged the dark side of Indonesia's economic growth. Under Suharto, political and economic power have become so entangled that the policy-makers in the Government are closely entwined with the business elite.</p><p>To attack corruption, nepotism and the lack of transparency in the Indonesian economy, Suharto must reign in an extensive network of his own relatives and allies who have gained considerable economic benefit under his leadership. Observers say he has clearly failed to do that.</p><p>\"The Government hasn't even announced the details of the IMF package; it hasn't given the market any sense of commitment to reforms,\" says one diplomat.</p><p>\"Indonesian markets have been going down faster than anywhere else; people are tearing down their economic forecasts.\"</p><p>Already, he says, Indonesia was facing a \"corporate bloodbath\" next year thanks to maturing debts, spiralling inflation, widespread lay-offs and a \"real wage reduction\" for those who manage to keep their jobs. This week Standard and Poor's revised its growth projections for Indonesia down to minus-5 per cent next year.</p><p>One economist recently estimated that the economic crisis could push the number of Indonesians living in abject poverty from 24 million to 42 million, and average annual family income from $US1200 to $US750.</p><p>In an ordinary year this would have been devastating enough. But this year, Indonesia has struggled through a drought and forest fire crisis wrought by the strong El Nino pattern. The planting of crops has been delayed, starvation is threatening isolated tribal communities and poor villagers have already sold their animals to pay for water.</p><p>These tragedies have taken on great significance to many who believe in the power of the pulung of Javanese mysticism. The 1000-year-old prophecy of Joyoboyo tells of five modern Javanese \"kings\", of which Suharto is says to the second.</p><p>The prophecy warns of terrible calamities if the morality of the nation is lost and corruption and greed gains the upper hand.</p><p>The five kings are all male, explained one mystic practitioner. Yet, Suharto has promoted his eldest daughter, Tutut, as a political leader, and some say he is trying to alter fate.</p><p>\"To people who believe in this balance President Suharto has already committed the sin of challenging the cosmic process of Java and hence all the disasters.\"</p><p>For those who believe in the more pedestrian science of politics there are the three political foundations of Suharto's New Order: stability, growth, equity.</p><p>For decades Suharto has justified strict controls on political opposition in the name of economic development. One of the basic tenets, equity, was already seriously challenged in the high-growth years as the wealth gap widened alarmingly. As growth falters, stability is also likely to be threatened.</p><p>Under the tarpaulin of the sidewalk noodle stall, the air is thick and humid. The muddy ground is littered with trash. The steam from the soup vat mingles with fumes from passing cars, weaving their way through the factory belt on Jakarta's outskirts.</p><p>Across the road is a textile factory where 3000 workers demonstrated earlier this week, marching on the local Parliament to demand fairer wages. For a 13-hour day, says one worker perched on a wooden bench, they receive about 150,000 rupiah a fortnight (about $A44).</p><p>But prices are going up. The currency crisis and the impact of the drought are already being felt. Rice, say the soup stall customers, has gone up 30 per cent; cooking oil more than 100 per cent; chilli, 40 per cent. \"We can't put up the prices of the soup because people can't pay, so we just earn less and less,\" says the vendor.</p><p>Around here, they say, at least four factories have already closed. In Jakarta alone two million casual workers in the construction sector have lost their jobs, 16,000 more in banks that have been closed, 30,000 in textile factories, 23,000 in the forestry industry and countless more in small businesses that escape the attention of the Manpower Ministry.</p><p>Angry workers, hungry villagers and a middle class that has seen its gains disappear into ballooning mortgages and spiralling prices makes for a volatile mix in a nation which has already seen two years of sporadic rioting.</p><p>Western embassies in Jakarta say they expect outbreaks of violence around factory closures as well as the expected non-payment of bonus for the Muslim new year, which falls in mid-January. But, decades of living within an authoritarian system under a Government that cannot be voted out of power has created myriad tensions below the surface.</p><p>The expansion of plantation developments controlled by the political elite, has, for example, forced tens of thousands of small farmers off the land. While the rich have won a five-star lifestyle of shiny new shopping malls, Mercedes and lavish weddings, the average Indonesian has made comparatively moderate gains under Suharto.</p><p>Social envy between the rich and poor is already brewing and only likely to intensify as the economic crisis bites.</p><p>Power, too, has corrupted the bureaucracy and the justice system. Bribes are routinely demanded for the most basic services, such as identity cards and school places, and the courts offer little justice to the ordinary citizen.</p><p>\"My fear is that there will be an increasing demand for change, increasing economic hardship, and an elite which wants to hold on to power. Then there will be a real clash,\" says political analyst Dewi Fortuna Anwar.</p><p>\"There is a desire for reform, but there is an unwillingness to face the fact that if you want reform you have to change the team leader. There is a fear of radical change here.\"</p><p>Many analysts have long argued that the memory of the trauma of the fall of President Sukarno in 1965 and the carnage that followed in which up to 500,000 people died serves as a break for social upheaval.</p><p>Wahid says: \"There will be deepening militancy on the part of labor; everywhere there will be sporadic strikes, boycotts and protests. The harsh reality is that if the Government fails to end the economic crisis there will be violence from both sides - the people and the military.</p><p>\"Violence now is unavoidable. We just have to try to limit the damage.\"</p><p>But he says the increasing scope of public protests means the military will be unable to defend the status quo and will be forced to negotiate with the people; at some time in the future, the process of democratisation in Indonesia must begin.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Lacking energy: President Suharto, now aged 76, has been largely out of public view recently, suffering from what Indonesian Government officials assert is exhaustion only.

That's the most recent advice of business analysts, who also warn that for every reward the Net promises, there is an associated risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Byram Johnson, vice-president of AT Kearney, says: \"The Internet is hyped up significantly. We advise clients to advance with a level of caution.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He even says the Internet could be dangerous if companies race into it without considering its role in their overall corporate strategy.</p><p>Although McKinseys believes electronic commerce will become significant, it warns that businesses might have to cannibalise themselves to gain full advantage.</p><p>Early examples of this corporate cannibalism include The Wall Street Journal, which now offers an online version of the newspaper that costs less than the printed paper; the Australian Stock Exchange's live share quote feed, which can be accessed over the Internet free by anyone who uses OzEmail's access service; and News Corp oration and Fairfax , which have put their classified advertising - the \"rivers of gold\" - on the Net, where they can be read free of charge.</p><p>Although these exercises may appear self-defeating, they have been designed by management to expand the business by tapping new markets rather than damaging core ones.</p><p>There are probably as many views of the commercial benefits of the Internet as there are viewers. McKinseys, for example, believes electronic commerce will be the route into a new and dynamic market for many companies. AT Kearney views the Internet as a weapon to force overhauls of the supply chain. Bach Consulting believes it will liberate organisations from conventional industry structures. To the next crop of management consultants now in business school, the Internet will be just another scalpel for corporate surgery - in the right hands it will reform and enhance, but in the wrong hands will disfigure.</p><p>More than a third of Australia's chief executives have already used the Internet, according to a study released last week by The Executive Connection. Over the next year though, a full three-quarters of the CEO population expects to be online.</p><p>A quarter of the 265 CEOs who responded to the survey expected the Internet could improve their bottom line, and a fifth had already set up Web sites.</p><p>But analysts lament the lack of Internet strategic vision coming from Mahogany Row.</p><p>A slow burn for the first 20 years of its existence, in the past 12 months the Internet has become a forest fire, with protagonists predicting a billion people online by 2000.</p><p>Captains of industry are bombarded by a business media obsessed by the Net; they watch the competition race to establish Web sites; their technologists mutter darkly about internal intranets and virtual corporations; electronic commerce and digital cash is raised in polite conversation; and all the while the marketing department dreams up new products targeted at the embryonic cyber-marketplace.</p><p>There's no escape at home where teenagers are tuned in online.</p><p>As Fred Steingraber, chief executive of AT Kearney, puts it: \"The Internet has a ways to go. But I don't think you can deny it is out there and working.\"</p><p>McKinseys believes electronic commerce, which will increasingly be underpinned by the Internet, will be important - but also demand corporate reorganisation.</p><p>In its latest quarterly the firm published a paper by Lorraine Harrington and Greg Reed from its Silicon Valley and Toronto offices respectively, which notes: \"Success will involve piloting new approaches, mastering new technologies, challenging conventional market definitions, surviving an initial period of low revenues and perhaps cannibalising core businesses. But the potential rewards are great; a new platform and set of tools for competing in a new and dynamic marketplace.\"</p><p>The big question facing business is when will all these riches materialise? A company which cannibalises itself too soon may find itself without a leg to stand on.</p><p>Wayne Madsen wouldn't use his credit card on the Internet. He might not use his real name. He harbours serious concerns about net security and cyber stalkers.</p><p>But Wayne Madsen isn't just the consuming public, he's a leading expert on data security and the Internet, head scientist at Computer Sciences Corporation, and author of the Handbook of Personal Data Protection.</p><p>Wayne Madsen knows a cybertrick or two, but if even he won't risk doing much business on the Internet, who else will?</p><p>Certainly not purchasers of information, according to market research company Forrester Research, which has warned content publishers not to expect any return on the Internet until the turn of the century. In fact most stand to lose millions before they turn the corner, according to Forrester.</p><p>But as Madsen confirms: \"The genie is out of the bottle.\" New security systems are being developed, communications carriers are expanding bandwidth, and the online population is growing fast. It is a rare corporation which is completely ignoring the Internet, even if it is only to create a Web site.</p><p>In Australia the most obvious manifestation of the corporate rush to the Internet is in the number of Web sites established in the .com.au domain. Such has been the demand for domains that the system now in place to issue them is fraying at the edges.</p><p>There are 7,300 domain names registered in the .com.au space, and a further 1,000 in the .net.au area, giving an inkling of the corporate demand for Web addresses.</p><p>Sanjay Kumar, president and chief operating officer of Computer Associates, considers the Web site frenzy as driven by \"herd mentality\". Chief executives were being subject to a \"very compressed wave of hype\" about the Internet, he says.</p><p>\"Everywhere you're looking it's there, whether it's happening or not,\" according to Kumar, who believes that chief information officers are rushing to put Internet plans in place to satisfy management seduced by coverage of the Internet in newspapers</p><p>and glossy magazines.</p><p>But Fred Steingraber believes that the best current application for Internet technologies is not necessarily to set up a Web site - which some analysts describe as a billboard in the outback - but to integrate the Internet with the corporate supply chain. By tightening up the supply chain it might be possible to cut product lifecycles, eliminate middlemen and reduce risk, he argues, rather that than \"pushing things out through the Internet and hoping people will buy\".</p><p>Over time Steingraber believes more and more virtual companies will emerge, partly thanks to the integration which the Internet affords. And there would be more mass customisation - or \"particle marketing\" - such as that being offered through technology systems in the US where Levis offers every customer a made-to-measure jeans-making service.</p><p>Bach Consulting, a small firm established by a pair of ex-McKinsey analysts in North Sydney earlier this year, is focusing on providing business analysis for companies which are considering how they can leverage off the Internet.</p><p>Partner Julian Fairfield claims the arrival of Internet business will upset traditional business models where industry structures have tended to control business profits more than managerial capabilities.</p><p>He warns though that the \"Internet will cause instability in many industries ... this will allow capable management to reposition industry structure and their relative position to improve profitability\".</p><p>Dr Rony Attar, also a Bach partner, and a former chief information officer with the State Bank of NSW, confirms the Internet as \"not just a delivery mode; it's a new way of doing business\". But he laments that today's Internet strategies too rarely come from chief executive officers but are being driven by IT, product managers or marketing departments.</p><p>Summerfield agrees: \"I don't know of any chief executive officers thinking strategically about this.\"</p><p>Again though, when to move?</p><p>\"You can be two years too early or two years too late, and if you're two years too late then you're dead,\" according to Fairfield. One of the problems he envisages is overcoming the political barriers involved in cannibalising the current way of doing business.</p><p>Summerfield argues the case for \"skunkworks\": new teams of people set up solely to explore Internet opportunities, who worked independently of current business structures, were unfettered by emotional attachments to \"the way we've always done it\" and</p><p>reported only to the top brass.</p><p>As success stories emerge and Internet scepticism abates, skunkworks will be replaced by converted middle management who will be able to recognise how Internet levers can be used to grow or improve a business.</p><p>That could even be the case by the time the next generation of Australian management consultants emerges from the MBA course at the Australian Graduate School of Management.</p><p>This will be the first wave of dyed-in-the-wool Internet converts to enter the consulting community. In the past year the proportion of their research queries over the Internet has risen from noise level to a third. Two of the three final-year management projects are on the Internet.</p><p>By the time those graduates filter through to Mahogany Row, the Internet will be much more than a technological curiosity.</p><p>Today though the AGSM cautions that there are very few commercial successes on the Internet.</p><p>\"Those that are (successful) have been around for a while and have spent a lot of money doing it well,\" said the AGSM's manager of computing and IT services, Dr Geoffrey Gordon.</p><p>Asked what companies ought to be doing today about the Internet, associate professor Simon Sheather, director of the MBA program, recommends the purchase of a crystal ball.</p><p>\"It is just too early to say.

In this immense sameness, isolated things -- a duck pond, a well, a horse cart -- took on a lonely piquancy. I gazed with relief at terrain empty of coal or ruins, whose mounds were natural. A luxurious sense of freedom welled up. For the first time in Russia's history, a foreigner could wander Siberia at will. At any little town where I stopped, I might alight and disappear, nursing my business visa -- a scruffy paper inscribed with pro forma destinations -- against police intrusion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The exhilaration of this freedom never quite left me. Whenever I pulled out my map and imagined entering the mountains abutting Mongolia or taking a ship up the Yenisei river to the Arctic, I would be hit by euphoria, then disbelief. Something or someone would surely prevent me. That was how Russia had always been. I had slipped through a transient gap in the country's age-old xenophobia.</p><p>The faintly clownish name of Omsk precedes the city with a light-hearted expectation. It lies where the railway crosses the Irtysh on a massive cantilever bridge and you see the curve of the river under a line of stooping derricks as it heads out among sandy islets and meadows, touching the city with an illusion of peace. But beyond, the suburbs bristle with petrochemical plants, textile combines and oil refineries, and the pollution is so thick that driving at night has sometimes been forbidden. They sprawl for kilometres above the river. Marx Prospect, Lenin Square, Partisan Street: the veteran names follow one another in relentless procession.</p><p> Yet the city keeps a modest distinction. Whereas World War II razed western Russian towns to the ground, in Siberia, untouched, they often attain a formal grandeur or rustic exuberance and seem older than they are. I wandered the streets in surprise. The municipal flowerbeds were all in bloom and fountains played between provincial ministries. Close above the river, 19th-century streets dipped and swung in icing-sugar facades. The air in the parks clattered with pop music. Clusters of miniskirted girls paraded their irregular beauty and children strolled with their parents in sleepy obedience; but their jeans and T-shirts were stamped with stars-and-stripes or Donald Duck. Every other pair of shoes or trousers sported a pirated Western logo. Fast-food restaurants had arrived, offering instant pelmeni -- the Siberian ravioli -- or anonymous steaks with stale mash, and a rash of small shops and kiosks had appeared, selling the same things.</p><p> Yet a feeling of boredom, or of waiting, pervaded the city. All style and music, the new paths of paradise seemed synthetic, borrowed. Real life remained on hold. The pop songs had the scuttling vitality of streams. The bus shelters and underpasses, stinking of urine, were rife with graffiti: \"Pomponius Nautilus -- I love you! \u2026 Agatha Christie! Sepulchre! The Prodigy!\" It took me time to realise that these were pop groups; other graffiti followed them, sometimes scrawled in English, the lingua franca of youth. \"Jim Morrison lives! No!\u2026 I f...ed the bitch! \u2026 Communists are all buggers.\" Then, in Russian, enigmatically: \"Why travel with a corpse? \u2026 The point of life is to ponder the cross on your grave.\"</p><p> Outside the big, unlovely cathedral, which in Stalin's day had been a cinema, I found a coach-load of pilgrims setting off for a rural monastery. They welcomed me on board. The monastic foundations were only just being laid, they said, and they were going to attend the blessing of its waters. In 1987 an excavator at the site -- near the state farm of Rechnoi -- had unearthed a mass grave and the place was revealed as a complex of labour camps, abandoned on Stalin's death. The inmates, mostly intelligentsia, had died of pneumonia and dysentery from working in the fields, and their graves still scattered its earth.</p><p> As our bus bowled through ramshackle villages, the pilgrims relayed the story with murmurs of motherly pity. They were elderly women for the most part, indestructible babushkas in flower-printed dresses and canvas shoes, whose gnarled hands were closed over prayer books and bead strings, and whose headscarves enshrined faces of genial toughness. When a fresh-faced cantor began chanting a hymn in the front of the bus, their voices rose in answer one after another, like old memories, reedy and melodious from their heavy bodies, until the whole bus was filled with their singing.</p><p> We reached a birch grove on the Rechnoi farm. It was one of those ordinary rural spots whose particular darkness you would never guess. As the women disembarked, still singing, the strains of other chanting echoed from a chapel beyond the trees. It was the first of four shrines that would one day stake out the corners of an immense compound. Inside, a white-veiled choir was lilting the sad divisions of the liturgy. As the pilgrims visited their favourite icons, a forest fire of votive candle-flames sprang up beneath the iconostasis, and two or three babushkas shuddered to their knees.</p><p> In the south transept, meshed in scaffolding, an unfinished fresco of the Deposition from the Cross loomed above us. It was almost complete but the flesh tints were still missing, as if the artist was afraid to touch too closely on divinity, and pots of pigment lined the scaffold.</p><p> So only the painted garments of the disciples semaphored their grief, while their hands and features were empty silhouettes in the plaster: here a face uplifted in dismay, there a blank caress on the unpainted body of Christ -- which remained a ghostly void, like something the onlookers had imagined.</p><p> Sometimes, whimsically, I felt as if this scene were echoed in the nave where I stood, where around the great silence left by God the worshippers lifted their heads and hands, crossed themselves and wept a little.</p><p> From outside came the squeal of bulldozers in a distant field. They were smoothing the earth of the labour camps into monastery foundations. I strained to catch the sounds, but our singing drowned them in the mournful decrescendos of the Russian rite. And out of the mouths of these ancient women -- whose sins, I imagined, could barely exceed a little malicious gossip -- rose the endless primal guilt, \"O Lord forgive us!\" -- over and over, as if from some deep recess in the national psyche, a need for helplessness.</p><p> The sanctuary curtains parted on an incense-clouded region inhabited by a small priest. His hair shimmered down in a phantasmal jumble, like a Restoration wig, and melted into a droop of violet-clad shoulders. Occasionally, feebly, one of his arms swung a censer; in the stillness between responses, its coals made a noise like suppressed laughter. As he intoned the prayers he constantly forgot or lost his place, until his chanting dithered into confusion and three deacons in raspberry robes prompted his responses with slips of paper. He would peer at these through enormous spectacles stranded in his hair like the eyes of a lemur and try again. But the cause of his panic was plain to see. Enthroned beside him, giant and motionless, sat Feodosy, Archbishop of Omsk.</p><p> Towards noon a procession unwound from the church and started across the pasturelands towards the unblessed waters. It moved with a shuffling, dislocated pomp. Behind its uplifted cross, whose gilded plaques wobbled unhinged, the archbishop advanced in a blaze of turquoise and crimson, his globular crown webbed in jewels. He marked off each stride with the stab of a dragon-headed stave and his chest glinted with purple and gold embossed frontlets, and a clash of enamelled crosses. He looked huge. Beside him went the quaint, dishevelled celebrant, and behind tripped a huddle of young priests in mauve and the trio of raspberry-silk deacons.</p><p> I fell in line with the pilgrims following. It was oddly comforting. An agnostic among believers, I felt close to them. I, too, wanted their waters blessed. I wanted that tormented earth quietened, the past acknowledged and shriven. I helped the old woman beside me carry her bottles. My feeling of hypocrisy, of masquerading in others' faith, evaporated. As I took her arm over the puddles and our procession stretched across the wet grass, Russia's atheist past seemed no more than an overcast day in the long Orthodox summer and the whole country appeared to be reverting instinctively, painlessly, to its old nature.</p><p> We reached a place where a silver pipe, propped on an old lorry tyre, was spilling warm water into a pool. A blond deacon like a Nordic Christ planted the processional cross on the far side and the archbishop, the priests, acolytes and pilgrims, the babushkas with their bags and bottles, a few war veterans and one mesmerised foreigner formed a wavering crescent round the water's rim.</p><p> The unkempt celebrant, clutching a jewelled cross, was ordered to wade in. From time to time he glanced up pathetically at Feodosy, who gave no signal for him to stop. Deeper and deeper he went, while his vestments fanned out over the surface, their mauve silk waterlogged to indigo, until he was spread below us like an outlandish bird over the pool. At last Feodosy lifted his finger. The priest floundered, gaped up at us -- or at the sky -- in momentary despair, recovered his balance and went motionless. Then, with a ghostly frown, he traced a trembling cross beneath the water.</p><p> A deep, collective sigh seemed to escape the pilgrims. Again the cavalcade unfurled around the pool while the archbishop, grasping a silver chalice, sprinkled the surface with its own water and the wobbly cross led the way back towards the noise of the bulldozers.</p><p> But the babushkas stayed put. As the procession glimmered and died through the darkness of the trees, and the archbishop went safely out of sight, a new excitement brewed up. They began to peel off their thick stockings and fling away their shoes. They were all ready. They tugged empty bottles labelled Fanta or Coca-Cola from their bags. Then they clambered and slid down the muddy banks and waded into the newly blessed water. At first they only scooped it from the shallows. It was mineral water, muddied and warm. They drank in deep gulps from their cupped hands and winched themselves back to stow the bottles on shore.</p><p> Then it all went to their heads. Six or seven old women flung off first their cardigans, then their kerchiefs and skirts, until at last, stripped down to flowery underpants and bras, they made headlong for the waters. All inhibition was lost. Their massive legs, welted in varicose veins, carried them juddering down the banks. Their thighs tapered to small, rather delicate feet. Little gold crosses were lost between their breasts. They plunged mountainously in. I stood above them in astonishment, wondering if I was meant to be here. But they were shouting and jubilant. They cradled the water in their hands and dashed it over their faces. Holiness had turned liquid, palpable. You could drink it, drown in it, bring it home like flowers for the sick.</p><p> Two of the boldest women -- cheery, barrel-chested ancients -- made for the gushing silver pipe and thrust their heads under it. They sloshed its torrent exultantly over one another, then submerged in it and drank it wholesale. They shouted at their friends still on land, until one or two of the young girls lifted their skirts and edged in. Bottle after bottle was filled and lugged to shore. But it was the young, not the old, who hesitated. The old were in high spirits. One of them shouted at me to join them, but I was caught between laughter and tears. These were women who had survived the Stalin years, the deprivation, the institutional suffering, into a life of widowhood and breadline pensions, and their exuberance struck me dumb. Perhaps in this sacred and chaotic waterhole the world seemed finally to make sense to them and all this aching, weary flesh at last found absolution.</p><p> The procession, meanwhile, had reached the open fields where the bulldozers worked. All the way to the future cathedral, which would stand in the compound's heart, the tarred pipes lay ready alongside their trenches, and the channel was blessed. I caught up with the remaining pilgrims clustered in the big meadows, beside the ghost cathedral. There Feodosy, above the lonely swing of a censer, blessed the site \"where nameless thousands had laboured and died\", and we stared across fields lacquered in blue and white flowers while the incense vanished over them.</p><p> When we arrived back at the chapel, we found a long table in the shade, laden with salads and jams. The babushkas had returned. Their hands were ready beside their soup plates in two ranks of sun-cracked knuckles and broken nails. The archbishop, presiding at the head, commanded me to sit beside him -- \"We have a guest from England!\" he boomed. \"We must make him welcome!\" -- and I looked down an avenue of nodding heads, which turned to gaze at me as one and murmured: \"England \u2026 England.\" Their cheeks bunched into smiles, and faltering lines of teeth parted in welcome.</p><p> Feodosy pounded the table with a bottle. \"This is for you!\" he said. \"It's our monastery water! It cures everything!\" The babushkas crossed themselves and commended me to God. They looked deeply respectable. Nobody would have guessed that half an hour before they had been ducking one another half-naked in a waterhole. Yet under the benches their bags bulged with bottles of holy water and they were sitting becalmed, almost smug, in the warmth of their success.</p><p> This is an edited extract from In Siberia by Colin Thubron (Random House, $49.95 hbk).

That he'd be gasping for the little oxygen in the air, a wet handkerchief about his nose and mouth.</p><p>He had thought it was going to be a typical forest fire until, while out in the bush helping Forest Commission workers, he heard radio reports that Powelltown, to the west, had been evacuated and that two police were fighting the flames on the outskirts of Noojee. He headed back to town to help them.</p><p>Hours later, he was in one of two police vehicles near the town when fire swept across the road behind them and cut them off. They tried to radio back but got no response.</p><p>FOR a moment, he stood stunned by the extent of the conflagration about him, watching trees aflame, burning branches dropping to the ground, wondering if he would make it back alive.</p><p>\"It's terrifying,\" he says. \"It's not just a fire. You go out on some of these fires, half the time it's burned out by the time you get there.</p><p>\"When you're in the front line of it you've got to think pretty clearly. You can't just rush into it. You've got to get yourself together and sort out what you're going to do.</p><p>How to get out of the bloody place.\" He laughs. \"It sounds funny now but it wasn't at the time.\"</p><p>He told the police that their best option was to drive back in the direction of the fire. The safest path was through the already charred terrain. \"The boys that were with me, they didn't like the idea of going back into it. But I said, `Well, you can do what you like but I'm off. I started walking'.</p><p>It wasn't long before they were right behind me.\"</p><p>They drove over blackened earth, using a chainsaw to clear the fallen trees that blocked their way. It took 10 hours - from 1am to 11am the next day - to cover the few kilometres back to town.</p><p>At one point, the firefighter remembered an Esky a local woman had given him. He shared the sandwiches and a bottle of hot beer. \"It was warm but, I tell you what, it was thirst quenching,\" he says. \"What water you've got you've got to try and hang on to. That little water might save your life.</p><p>\" American author Stephen J. Pyne has written of the way in which fire in Australia has been \"absorbed into the subconscious\".</p><p>\"Its smoke haunted memories. Its flames lit nightmares. The bushfire was part of indigenous Australia that would remain forever alien and unassimilable,\" he says in `Burning Bush', a recent history of fire in Australia.</p><p>About 75,000 Victorians freely give of their time, at considerable risk, as unpaid, voluntary members of the Country Fire Authority.</p><p>Like battles, the big fires are part of our lore: Black Thursday (1851). Red Tuesday (1926). Black Friday (1939). Ash Wednesday (1983).</p><p>Noojee horticulturalist, Tia van Horick, \"70 going on 40\", talks of a rush of adrenalin as the bright red tanker bounces along rough roads bearing its load of water to a fire. \"It's not an enjoyable event but it is an enjoyable thing to go and do.\"</p><p>But whether they dwell on it or not, for thousands at 1226 rural and urban fire brigades who are on call 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, there's always a chance that each ride might be their last. Fifty firefighters have died \"in the line of duty\" since the CFA was founded in the mid-1940s to replace the old Country Fire Brigades Board. Thirteen of them were killed on Ash Wednesday.</p><p>Les Hubbard's successor as captain of the Noojee volunteer fire brigade, Terry Strickland, is a sturdily-built, bearded bear of a man. He drives a forklift at the sawmill. Strickland and a workmate have permission to leave work to fight fires and assist at road accidents, chemical spills and other emergencies.</p><p>At 45, Strickland is a fairly recent recruit. He was \"sort of shamed into it,\" he says.</p><p>\"There was a brigade full of women, I couldn't have that, \" he concedes with a gruff laugh. Attracted by neither a sense of civic duty nor fear of fire, he says he responded to an appeal for help in a magazine put out every month or two by the CFA secretary, Liza Bennett, 62. \"So I thought, `ah well, a bloke should do something about it. I just sort of showed up.\"</p><p>The original brass bell is partly for display these days.</p><p>But the station remains a rallying point in times of threat.</p><p>An unemployed secondary teacher, a horticulturalist, a theatrical engineer, a woman who runs a fabric shop and works part-time in the post office. Six locals in Strickland's charge have nick-named him \"Mongrel\".</p><p>Another member, Dawn Thomas, 57, is \"the Wet One\". \"She's our mermaid,\" says Liza Bennett. \"She always gets wet.\"</p><p>They meet on Sunday mornings for a couple of hours. \"Sometimes its fair dinkum training and sometimes general maintenance and cleaning up around the station and so on,\" Bennett says.</p><p>\"We try to keep it in good condition. We're in the fire brigade . . . We're proud of it and we like to keep it tidy.</p><p>\" Though each brigade has a rank structure and Strickland has two lieutenants, the Noojee station is a far cry from the formality of military regimen during training at the CFA college at Fiskville near Ballan. It's a world away from the image that lingers in some quarters since mid-1970s claims on ABC TV by a United Firefighters Union official that the then CFA chairman, Dick Eason, was creating a paramilitary, right-wing organisation.</p><p>Perhaps it's partly that they are on their own, away from the watchful eye of professional CFA officers, but theirs is an easy camaraderie. \"Especially when we can put the hose on Terry,\" The Wet One chips in.</p><p>\"There's the work side but there's also the social bond, \" says Gary Weir, one of 820 paid CFA staff and based at Warrigal, where he and a colleague co-ordinate 1800 volunteers at 51 fire brigades in CFA Region 9 in western South Gippsland.</p><p>\"The brigades vary depending on the culture of the area and who the members are. Some have lots of parties and social dinners and teas and get-togethers. Others get together more informally, have barbecues. Some just come down on the Sunday so they can do some maintenance on the trucks and see their neighbors and talk.\"</p><p>For the volunteers, commitment to the CFA can be disruptive to domestic life.</p><p>Neil Bartlett, 35, is a benchman who cuts timber at a Noojee mill, says, \"my missus is glad to get rid of me for a couple of hours\". Strickland says his wife has told him to \"make your tea down there\". And Bennett's husband \"thinks he's not looked after . . . especially when you get called out at meal times\".</p><p>The CFA traces its origins to the bush \"bucket brigades\" of the last century. The Burwood headquarters is base for a powerful organisation that now has highly computerised monitoring systems, extensive radio connections, a 2000-strong fleet of trucks, 17 planes and helicopters.</p><p>As many as 2.5 million people live in the area for which the CFA is responsible: all of rural Victoria except state forests and national parks. Funded through fire insurance premiums and the State Government, its presence extends from the million or so residents of outer suburbs such as Frankston, Dandenong, Cranbourne, Melton and Werribee to the lone shed on some isolated, country back block.</p><p>\"In a number of places, the CFA is the only thing left in the township,\" says Gary Weir. Noojee would be among the quietest stations in his region; the busiest are at Warrigal and Moe.</p><p>\"Especially in a lot of the very small rural communities, they've closed down the primary school, a lot of the halls have fallen into disrepair and practically the only thing that signifies that there's a township there - or that it has a name representing a township - is the fire station. It's just sort of sitting there.\"</p><p>Noojee's seven firefighters have received 12 calls since last July. They might be needed to attend a fire or just a smouldering windrow. A car collision or a tree across the road. \"A car that needs to be pulled back onto the road,\" says Liza Bennett, whose recent duties included handing out CFA educational leaflets in Captain Koala garb. \"A car on fire on the trestle bridge. A tractor on fire. House fires . . .\"</p><p>At which point, Strickland interjects: \". . . which was 12 kilometres up the road. By the time we got there, it was far too late.\"</p><p>After 20 years' service, Les Hubbard retired from the CFA two years ago and none of the seven volunteers lived there at the time of the 1983 fires.</p><p>In one hot spell, the CFA attended 180 separate fires around the state. \"I was lying in the swimming pool at home,\" says Graeme Elliott, 47, an owner-driver for Boral Bricks. \"I saw the smoke on the hill, thought, `Jesus this doesn't look good, maybe they needed my services.' He drove over to offer his services at the Belgrave South brigade and has been a volunteer firefighter since. HE now turns out at the Boronia CFA brigade on the outer eastern fringe of suburban Melbourne where Neil Parlby, a 46-year- old maintenance contractor and veteran of 19 years who followed in the footsteps of his volunteer firefighter father, Norm, is</p><p>first lieutenant.</p><p>Parlby, had knocked off from work early because of the heat and dropped in at the station on his way home at around 3.</p><p>30pm. Within 10 minutes or so, he found himself on a fire engine.</p><p>He remembers pulling into a street half an hour after the flames had passed through on Ash Wednesday. All that remained of some houses were stumps or holes in the ground. \"I had been to a lot of bushfires but never anything with the intense heat of that fire,\" Parlby says.</p><p>The Boronia brigade is one of seven in the busy Knox Group that handles 2000 emergencies a year including factories, commercial and residential premises, grass and bushfires, industrial rescues and helps with severe vehicle collisions.</p><p>On the afternoon of our visit, volunteers Brian Cross, a 25-year-old transit police constable, and Bill Ireland, 49, a postman at Bayswater had been part of a six-man crew on a tanker to a suspected fire at a primary school in Ferntree Gully. It turned out to be nothing serious.</p><p>Bill Ireland has been in the CFA for 29 years. \"During the really bad days I'm always looking over the hills,\" he says. \"You're always keeping your eyes peeled. I turn out with the Ferntree Gully fire brigade too if I hear their siren I go. I'm just as close to them.\"</p><p>Ever mindful of the threat of fire since his recent arrival from Geelong, Noojee theatrical engineer Peter Brown, 36, says: \"I feel that if I don't do it, I can't expect anybody else to. It's my way of putting something back into the community.</p><p>\" The Noojee fire truck heads into the state forest. We stand on a mountain slope - the very place, explains Gary Weir, you wouldn't want to be when a bushfire was raging out of control.</p><p>This summer, the weather has been forgiving. But he knows that one day, after a long dry spell, the north wind will rise and there will be smoke on the horizon.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photos Action stations: Bayswater postman Bill Ireland (right) with fellow volunteers; Historic hot spot: Members of the Noojee brigade at the disused railway trestle bridge and (inset) the clean-up at the same spot after the 1939 bush fires.

Humour should be an occupational requirement, not an occupational hazard.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In that spirit, today the Gold Coast Bulletin launches its Jobs for Jokes series, for which we want you to send in your favourite jokes about the jobs we do.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For example, what do you have if there are 10,000 lawyers buried up to their necks in sand? Not enough sand.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What about teachers? Those who can, do. Those who can't, teach. Those who can't teach, teach physical education.</p><p>No occupation is sacrosanct and you can send in as many entries as you like. Here's a few to start things off and, to prove that journos do have a sense of humour, we'll begin with the members of the Fourth Estate.</p><p>JOURNALISTS</p><p>A PHOTOGRAPHER for a national magazine was assigned to get photos of a great forest fire. Smoke at the scene was too thick to get any good shots, so he frantically called his home office to hire a plane.</p><p>\"It will be waiting for you at the airport,\" he was assured, and as soon as he got to the small, rural airport, sure enough, a plane was warming up near the runway. He jumped in and yelled: \"Let's go!\"</p><p>The pilot swung the plane into the wind and soon they were in the air. \"Fly over the north side of the fire,\" said the photographer, \"and make three or four low level passes.\"</p><p>\"Why?\" asked the pilot.</p><p>\"Because I'm going to take pictures. I'm a photographer and photographers take pictures.\"</p><p>After a long pause the pilot said: \"You mean you're not the instructor?\"</p><p>AN editor, a photographer and a journalist are covering a political convention in Miami. They decide to walk up and down the beach during their lunch hour.</p><p>Halfway up the beach, they stumble upon a lamp. As they rub it a genie appears and says: \"Normally I would grant you three wishes but, since there are three of you, I will grant you each one wish.\"</p><p>The photographer goes first. \"I would like to spend the rest of my life living in a huge house in St Thomas with no money worries.\" The genie grants him his wish.</p><p>The journalist goes next. \"I would like to spend the rest of my life living on a huge yacht cruising the Mediterranean with no money worries.\" The genie grants his wish.</p><p>Last but not least, it is the editor's turn. \"And what would your wish be?\" asks the genie.</p><p>\"I want them both back after lunch,\" replies the editor, \"the deadline for tomorrow's newspaper is in about 10 hours.\"</p><p>ENGINEERS</p><p>TO the optimist, the glass is half full. To the pessimist, the glass is half empty. To the engineer, the glass is twice as big as it needs to be.</p><p>WHAT is the difference between mechanical engineers and civil engineers?</p><p>Mechanical engineers build weapons. Civil engineers build targets.</p><p>AN engineer was crossing the road when a frog called out and said: \"If you kiss me, I'll turn into a beautiful princess.\"</p><p>The engineer put the frog in his pocket. The frog spoke again: \"If you kiss me and turn me into a beautiful princess, I will stay with you for one week.\"</p><p>The engineer took the frog out of his pocket, smiled, then put it back.</p><p>The frog cried out: \"If you kiss me and turn me back into a beautiful princess, I'll stay with you and do anything you want.\"</p><p>Again, the engineer took out the frog, smiled, then put it back.</p><p>\"What's the matter?\" asked the frustrated frog. \"I've told you I'm a beautiful princess and that I'll stay with you and do anything you want. Why won't you kiss me?\"</p><p>\"Look,\" said the engineer. \"I'm an engineer. I don't have time for a girlfriend. But a talking frog, how cool is that?\"</p><p>PSYCHIATRISTS</p><p>WELCOME to the Psychiatric Hotline.</p><p>If you are obsessive-compulsive, please press 1 repeatedly. If you are co-dependent, please ask someone to press 2. If you have multiple personalities, please press 3, 4, 5, and 6.</p><p>If you are paranoid, we know who you are and what you want. Just stay on the line so we can trace the call.</p><p>If you are schizophrenic, listen carefully and a little voice will tell you which number to press.

No one will answer.</p><p>If you are delusional and occasionally hallucinate, please be aware that the thing you are holding on the side of your head is alive and about to bite off your ear.</p><p>A MAN goes to a psychiatrist and says: \"Doc, I've got a real problem. I can't stop thinking about sex.\"</p><p>Says the psychiatrist: \"Well, let's see what we can find out.\" He pulls out his ink blots. \"What is this a picture of?\" he asks.</p><p>The man turns the picture upside down then turns it around and states: \"That's a man and a woman on a bed making love.\"</p><p>The psychiatrist shows the next picture. The man looks and turns it in different directions and says: \"That's a man and a woman on a bed making love.\"</p><p>The psychiatrist tries again with the third ink blot. The patient again turns it in all directions and replies: \"That's a man and a woman on a bed making love.\"</p><p>\"Yes, you do seem to be obsessed with sex,\" says the psychiatrist.</p><p>\"Me?\" says the patient. \"You're the one who keeps showing me the dirty pictures.\"</p><p>DOCTORS</p><p>A MAN speaks frantically into the phone. \"Doctor, my wife is pregnant and her contractions are only two minutes apart.\"</p><p>\"Is this her first child?\" asks the doctor.</p><p>\"No, you idiot! This is her husband.\"</p><p>A DOCTOR and his wife were having a big argument at breakfast.</p><p>\"You aren't so good in bed either!\" he shouted and stormed off to work.</p><p>By mid-morning, he decided he'd better make amends and phoned home. After many rings, his wife picked up the phone.</p><p>\"What took you so long to answer?\" he asked.</p><p>\"I was in bed,\" she replied.</p><p>\"What were you doing in bed this late?\"</p><p>\"Getting a second opinion.\"</p><p>LAWYERS</p><p>A NEW client had just come in to see a famous lawyer. \"Can you tell me how much you charge?\" he asked.</p><p>\"Of course,\" replied the lawyer. \"I charge $200 to answer three questions.\"</p><p>\"Well that's a bit steep, isn't it?\"</p><p>\"Yes it is,\" said the lawyer. \"And what's your third question?\"</p><p>\"I'M beginning to think that my lawyer is too interested in making money.\"</p><p>\"Why do you say that?\"</p><p>\"Listen to this from his bill: 'For waking up at night and thinking about your case, $25'.\"</p><p>THE lawyer's son wanted to follow in his father's footsteps, so he went to law school. He graduated with honours and then went home to join his father's firm.</p><p>At the end of his first day at work, he rushed into his father's office and said: \"Father, father, in one day I broke the accident case that you've been working on for 10 years.\"</p><p>Responded his father: \"You idiot, we could have lived on the funding of that case for another 10 years.\"</p><p>A LAWYER was talking to his son about entering college and said: \"How did you get it into your head that you want to be a doctor instead of a lawyer?\"</p><p>\"Well, Dad,\" answered the son, \"did you ever hear anybody get up in a croud and shout frantically 'Is there a lawyer in the house?'.\"</p><p>TEACHERS</p><p>A MUM and dad were worried about their son not wanting to learn mathematics at the school he was in, so they decided to send him to a Catholic school.</p><p>After the first day of school, their son came racing into the house, went straight into his room and slammed the door shut. His parents were a little worried about this and went to see if he was okay. They found him sitting at his desk doing his homework, a process he repeated for the rest of the year.</p><p>At the end of the year, the son brought home his report card and gave it to his parents. Looking at it, they saw he had scored an A-plus for maths.</p><p>\"What changed your mind about learning maths?\" they asked.</p><p>\"Well, on the first day when I walked into the classroom, I saw a guy nailed to the plus sign at the back of the room behind the teacher's desk and I knew they meant business.\"</p><p>\"DAD, can you write in the dark?\"</p><p>\"I think so. What is it you want me to write?\"</p><p>\"Your name on my report card.\"</p><p>ACCOUNTANTS</p><p>AN accountant visited the Natural History museum. While standing near the dinosaur he said to his neighbor: \"This dinosaur is two billion years and 10 months old\".</p><p>\"Where did you get this exact information?\"</p><p>\"I was here 10 months ago, and the guide told me that the dinosaur is two billion years old.\"</p><p>AN accountant is having a hard time sleeping and goes to see his doctor. \"Doctor, I just can't get to sleep at night.\"</p><p>\"Have you tried counting sheep?\"</p><p>\"That's the problem - I make a mistake and then spend three hours trying to find it.\"</p><p>A PATIENT was at her doctor's office after undergoing a complete physical exam. The doctor said, \"I have some very grave news for you. You only have six months to live.\"</p><p>The patient asked, \"Oh doctor, what should I do?\"</p><p>The doctor replied, \"Marry an accountant.\"</p><p>\"Will that make me live longer?\" asked the patient.</p><p>\"No,\" said the doctor, \"but it will seem longer.\"</p><p>THERE once was a business owner who was interviewing people for a division manager position. He decided to select the individual that could answer the question 'how much is 2+2?'</p><p>The engineer pulled out his slide rule and shuffled it back and forth, and finally announced, \"It lies between 3.98 and 4.02.\"</p><p>The mathematician said, \"In two hours I can demonstrate it equals 4 with the following short proof.\"</p><p>The physicist declared, \"It's in the magnitude of 1x101.\"</p><p>The logician paused for a long while and then said, \"This problem is solvable.\"</p><p>The social worker said, \"I don't know the answer, but I'm glad that we discussed this important question.</p><p>The attorney stated, \"In the case of Svenson vs. the State, 2+2 was declared to be 4.\"</p><p>The trader asked, \"Are you buying or selling?\"</p><p>The accountant looked at the business owner, then got out of his chair, went to see if anyone was listening at the door and pulled the drapes. Then he returned to the business owner, leaned across the desk and said in a low voice, \"What would you like it to be?\"</p><p>JUDGES</p><p>THE local ranger in a small town western Queensland tow had arrested a man for killing and eating a kookaburra. The man went before a judge to plead his case. After pleading guilty, but with an explanation, the judge asked him why he did it.</p><p>\"I was just trying to feed my hungry family,\" he told the judge, \"and I've never done anything like that before.\"</p><p>The judge, being a family man himself, had a soft heart and agreed to let the man go free, since he was only trying to feed his starving family and it was his first and only offence.</p><p>\"Before you go, though, I want to ask you a question,\" the judge quipped, \"What does kookaburra taste like?\"</p><p>\"Well your honour,\" the man told him, \"it's not as tender as platypus but it's better than koala.\"</p><p>AT the height of a political corruption trial, the prosecuting attorney attacked a witness.</p><p>\"Isn't it true,\" he bellowed, \"that you accepted $5000 to compromise this case?\"</p><p>The witness stared out the window as though he hadn't heard the question.</p><p>\"Isn't it true that you accepted $5000 to compromise this case?\" the lawyer repeated.</p><p>The witness still did not respond.</p><p>Finally, the judge leaned over and said, \"Sir, please answer the question.\"</p><p>\"Oh,\" the startled witness said, \"I thought he was talking to you.\"</p><p>A YOUNG lawyer was defending a wealthy businessman in a complicated lawsuit. Unfortunately, the evidence was against his client, and he feared the worst. So the lawyer asked the senior partner of the law firm if it would be appropriate to send the judge a box of Havana cigars.</p><p>The partner was horrified.</p><p>\"The judge is an honorable man,\" the partner exclaimed.</p><p>\"If you do that, I can guarantee you will lose the case!\"</p><p>Weeks later the judge ruled in favor of the lawyer's client. The partner took him to lunch to congratulate him.</p><p>\"Aren't you glad you didn't send those cigars to the judge?\", the partner asked.</p><p>\"But I did send them,\" replied the lawyer.</p><p>\"I just enclosed the plaintiff's lawyer's business card!\"</p><p>MUSICIANS</p><p>A RESEARCHER arrives in Borneo to gather data for his thesis. Accompanied by his trusty guide, he seeks out a very remote locale for researching the mating behaviour of the giant rat of Sumatra.</p><p>Around dusk of the first day, he's sitting by the campfire with his guide when in the distance, he hears tribal drums.</p><p>They get louder.

Perhaps, perhaps not. Either way, Chris Taylor writes, it demonstrates how China's inability to tell the truth threatens us all.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">IN MID-2001, a Hong Kong magazine ran a front-page story about how the world's next flu pandemic would hatch in southern China and infect the rest of the world via Hong Kong. The story espoused the theory that the Spanish Flu of 1918, which eventually claimed 20 million lives, had leapt from pigs to humans in southern China and travelled with Chinese labourers to the trenches of World War One. It was no more than a theory, but on two crucial counts the magazine was deadly accurate: the two other killer pandemics of the last century, which killed about two million people, sprang out of China and so will the next.</p><p>In February 2003, 18 months after the article appeared, shops in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou experienced a run on vinegar. The traditional New Year celebrations had just begun, and most of China's 1.36 billion people were either en route to their hometowns or already with their families enjoying the longest and most anticipated holiday season of the year. Vinegar does not usually play a part in Chinese New Year. But it is a traditional fumigant used by Chinese in times of plague. If the world had been watching, alarm bells might have rung.</p><p>Instead, Spring Festival, as the Chinese call the lunar New Year, was celebrated as usual, with a massive countrywide exodus - more than 130 million trips by train, nearly nine million by air, a staggering 1.9 billion on the roads. For a deadly pathogen looking to hitch a ride, conditions were perfect. What's more, the Chinese authorities knew it.</p><p>On November 16, a businessman had checked into a hospital in Foshan, a city close to the Hong Kong border, with a mysterious strain of pneumonia. Two weeks later, in the drab, industrial city of Heyuan 200 kilometres away, staff at the Municipal Hospital began to get sick and die. On January 3, the Heyuan News ran a brief story denying the existence of an \"epidemic virus\", urging local residents not to panic. It was the first media reference, and the last for more than a month, to a disease that had appeared from nowhere in southern China. Two months later, it would reach Hong Kong, and the world would come to know it as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, or SARS.</p><p>As China unbuttoned for the New Year holidays, Liu Jianlun, a 64-year-old doctor, was working round the clock at Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital. His problems had begun when a seafood salesman was wheeled into the hospital on February 1 with a high fever. He was barely able to breathe. Within two weeks nor could 45 other people in the hospital.</p><p>As they started dying, hospital staff began calling the salesman \"Du Wang\", the \"Poison King\". His coughs were like biological bombs, and the infection they spread was unlike any flu virus Liu had seen. He worried that he was witnessing the birth of a new epidemic, and that the authorities were turning a blind eye to it.</p><p>Concerned that news of the disease might cause panic and affect foreign investment and the tourism industry, a news blackout had been imposed. Like previous outbreaks of new strains of the flu, Chinese officials hoped this one would burn out and retreat to wherever it had come from before the world noticed.</p><p>If Liu Jianlun had been working at an Australian hospital and thought the government was ignoring the birth of a new life-threatening disease, he would probably have gone to the press. In China, such a move would have spelled the end of his career. It would also have been a waste of time.</p><p>The Chinese media were already aware of the emerging epidemic, but journalists could do nothing but watch until February 11, when Guangdong provincial health officials held a belated news conference. A disease called \"atypical pneumonia\" had sickened 305 people and killed five but was now under control, they said. Among the brief flurry of articles that appeared in the provincial press was an interview with a local academic who accused the government of incompetence. The result: a second media blackout that lasted until March.</p><p>Shortly after the February 11 press conference, Liu received a phone call from Hong Kong inviting him to a family wedding. He was feeling unwell, but he put it down to overwork. He'd taken precautions against catching atypical pneumonia, and didn't want to miss the wedding. Besides, a visit to Hong Kong would also allow him to consult with Hong Kong University specialists on emerging flu viruses in southern China.</p><p>Liu travelled by bus from Guangzhou to Hong Kong on February 21. The three-hour journey took him through a corner of the world that has changed more in the past two decades than anywhere else in the history of the planet.</p><p>The Pearl River Delta is home to almost 40 million people. In the decades since Deng Xiaoping told China that \"to get rich is glorious\", cities and factories have sprung from the delta's paddy fields. Densely packed tenements tower over sprawling pig and poultry farms. When medical experts talk about the next influenza pandemic, the Pearl River Delta is the place they worry about.</p><p>Virologists think China sneezed and gave the world the flu between 2000 and 3000 years ago, when ducks were first domesticated. The influenza virus lives harmlessly in the digestive systems of ducks, but when it jumps species, or a \"zoonosis\" occurs, it makes other mammals sick.</p><p>The most famous example of a zoonosis in history is the bubonic plague, which between 1347 and 1362 nearly halved the population of Europe. Like the flu, it started in China, when a virus found what scientists call a \"vector\" - in this case, fleas - that allowed it to jump species from rats to humans. By 1347 it had made its way to ports on the Black Sea, spreading to Sicily by trading ships. Like the Spanish Flu more than six centuries later, it was brutal. Boccaccio wrote at the time about people \"eating lunch with their friends and dinner with their ancestors in paradise\". It killed around 40 million people.</p><p>The plague, which still claims around 1600 lives a year, evokes fear because it emerges so rarely and kills so many (the last major outbreak was in western India in 1994). The flu, though, is always with us. It infects most of us many times in our lives because, like many common viruses, it is constantly mutating to fast-foot our defences. Scientists call these constant small changes \"antigenic drift\".</p><p>But every so often the virus \"shifts\", becoming almost unrecognisable to our bodies' defences. Perhaps a human strain recombines with an avian strain in a domesticated chicken and jumps. Such a biological event is rare, and when it does take place it usually burns out after infecting just a few people. But sometimes, as in 1918 and again in 1968, when the Hong Kong flu killed more than 700,000 people worldwide, the biological spark fans out like a forest fire through vast swathes of the healthy population.</p><p>This was precisely what experts had long been predicting would happen in the area Liu - now feverish and short of breath - drove through en-route to Hong Kong in late February.</p><p>The prediction was based on the unique conditions of the Pearl River Delta, where tens of millions of people live together with the world's largest populations of ducks, chickens and pigs. But unique conditions give rise to unique events. It was also possible - and this was something the experts did not talk about - that the next disease to emerge from the urban landscape of southern China would be something else. Something unexpected.</p><p>On February 21 Liu checked into Room 911 on the ninth floor of the Metropole, a sprawling three-star hotel complete with Chinese banquet restaurants and karaoke pubs in the heart of Kowloon, Hong Kong. The most densely populated slice of real estate on the planet, Kowloon is like an affluent version of crowded, push-and-shove Guangzhou, with wet markets and teeming housing blocks, their windows festooned with drying laundry.</p><p>Hotels in Kowloon are cheaper than on Hong Kong island, making them popular with Asian business travellers and package tourists. Kowloon also has the advantage of being more convenient to both China and the airport.</p><p>The next morning Liu was too sick to attend the wedding. It probably crossed his mind, after what he'd seen in Guangzhou's Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hospital, that he was too sick to be in Hong Kong. He left the hotel and walked five minutes down Waterloo Road to the Kwong Wah Hospital, where he told medical staff, \"Lock me up. Don't touch me. I have contracted a very virulent disease\".</p><p>It was too late, and Liu probably knew it. His disease had already spread mysteriously in the hospital he worked at. It had begun to spread at the Metropole Hotel, too. Somehow - perhaps in the lift, perhaps in the corridor, nobody knows - he infected seven other people staying on the same floor he was. They travelled to Canada, Singapore and Vietnam. Two of them were dead within three weeks.</p><p>The onset of SARS might be marked by a violent headache, or it might be marked by chills, diarrhoea and agonising pain in the joints. Within days liquid fills the lungs, making it impossible to breathe. Some patients' livers and kidneys start to malfunction and their blood stops clotting properly. Victims often lose consciousness for days and have to be kept alive on a respirator. The death rate may be as high as 10 per cent. Survivors are gaunt, enfeebled, some partially paralysed.</p><p>Kwong Wah medical staff knew none of this, however, and did not move Liu into isolation until his condition became life threatening. Within a month of his arrival, 70 medical staff and 17 medical students at the hospital were struck down. Liu died on March 4.</p><p>Eight days after his death, the World Health Organisation issued a global alert about atypical pneumonia. Three days after that, with infections in nine countries, the WHO was calling it Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome, and warning, in the words of director-general Gro Harlem Brundtland, \"This syndrome is now a worldwide health threat\".</p><p>The new pandemic experts feared would emerge from southern China's viral incubator was a new strain of the flu. But SARS was something altogether different, a whole new disease.</p><p>According to the WHO, around 30 new diseases have emerged over the past three decades. Almost all of them have failed the test of a truly successful virus, the ability to \"amplify\" in a host and then \"shed\" via a transmission method that infects large numbers of other hosts. The most frightening of the new diseases - Ebola, which kills 85 to 90 per cent of its victims by essentially liquefying their internal organs - consumes its hosts so rapidly and effectively it has so far never managed to spread beyond the five small</p><p>African communities in which it has erupted. The most well known of the new diseases, AIDS, requires such intimate contact to spread that it took from 1959, when it claimed its first proven casualty, until 1981 to infect 422 people in the US.</p><p>SARS, in other words, accomplished in the space of several months what it took AIDS, the 20th century plague, more than two decades to do.</p><p>If ever an example of the difference between Hong Kong and China were needed, their handling of the threat of disease is it. When 18 people contracted the bird flu in Hong Kong in 1997 and six of them died, the Government went straight to the source of the problem and slaughtered every chicken in the territory, all 1.4 million of them. When SARS broke out in Guangdong province, the Government chose to keep it quiet. It was a mistake that would not only endanger the world's health and economy, but also undermine the credibility of the Chinese Government itself.</p><p>Even in a country as closely kept under wraps as China, the truth has a way of coming out. On the evening of April 3, Jiang Yanyong, a 72-year-old semi-retired surgeon, was watching TV at his home in Beijing. That night the news featured a spot in which China's Health Minister, Zhang Wenkang, announced that China's capital had just 12 cases of SARS. Jiang couldn't believe his ears.</p><p>Jiang was a former head of surgery at Beijing's Military Hospital 301, and still did regular work there. How, he wondered, could the minister tell the world Beijing had only 12 cases of SARS when he knew for a fact there were 50 in his hospital alone? \"I simply couldn't believe what I was seeing,\" he wrote in an email the next day to the state-run television station CCTV-4. \"All the doctors and nurses who saw yesterday's news were furious.\"</p><p>The state TV channel's reaction was predictable: silence. But when the email made it to the hands of the foreign media, the allegations were soon circling the world. The WHO, which had bought the Government's line that the epidemic was under control, demanded access to Beijing's military hospitals. Within a fortnight, the Government upped its Beijing SARS statistics tenfold; three days later, the numbers were doubled again.</p><p>A tiny virus that hatched somewhere in Guangdong province had percolated 2000 kilometres north to the Chinese capital and infected close to 1000 people, rocking the central government. It had hitched rides to nearly every corner of the world, throwing the international airline industry into turmoil and snatching headlines from the US-led war on Iraq. And, while Beijing played cat and mouse with WHO inspection teams and foreign reporters, it was continuing its insidious assault on the Chinese population.</p><p>China's free-market reforms have made the country an economic miracle. But there are many victims of those reforms: tens of millions of workers laid-off from loss-making state-owned enterprises; tens of millions unemployed in the agricultural sector; and a public healthcare system that has been all but abandoned.</p><p>Guangdong, where SARS first emerged, is China's richest province, and has some of China's best hospitals. Rural China, on the other hand, has 70 per cent of the country's population but receives only 20 per cent of its public-health spending. In China's poor provinces - home to some 800 million people - hospitals turn away anyone who cannot afford to pay.</p><p>In educated, affluent Hong Kong, Singapore and Toronto, first-rate health-care systems have managed to prevent SARS from reaching epidemic proportions, but they have not been able to prevent panic. Despite widespread dissemination of information about the disease, it is still not known exactly how it spreads or even what causes it.</p><p>In uneducated, poor rural China, a ramshackle network of under-funded hospitals and clinics is the only thing standing between SARS and a vast population. In the days after Beijing upped its SARS count from 37 to nearly 900 the city descended into panic. Despite a ban on travel, first the student population fled and then the city's four million migrant workers from the poor provinces joined them. Businesses shut down. In less than a week, more than a million people left the city, taking disease and panic with them to the country's rural hinterland.</p><p>The Chinese Government's hold on power is guaranteed by its ability to deliver economic results. As panic spreads and business grinds to a standstill, that will be hard to do. In the meantime, its incompetence in dealing with the outbreak in Guangdong has allowed SARS to jet around the world.</p><p>Already epidemiologists are warning that if it is \"the big one\" - a fast-mutating virus that proves resistant to antibiotics - it will soon outstrip AIDS as a world health problem. Even if it is not, Guangdong's viral incubator has hatched a terrifying warning of the threat that China poses to the health of the world.</p><p>Last Monday, speaking at a press conference in Bangkok, David Heymann, the director-general of the WHO, admitted that \"China will make or break this disease\". The unanswered question - as outbreaks outside China are contained by efficient healthcare systems and the sharing of information - is not just whether this disease will make or break China, but if the big one will make or break the world as we know it.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Three photos: Transport hubs, a massive population and the proximity of animals and humans make southern China's conditions perfect for an epidemic.

Ramrakha, Balmain</p><p>Lost in translation</p><p>You need not be confused, William Hicks (To the point, October 24). The virgin birth of Jesus was as natural as any other birth of children.</p><p> In the early days of translations of the Holy Scripture from the Hebrew to the Greek, the Hebrew word \"almah\", meaning \"a young woman\", was translated into the Greek word meaning \"The Virgin\". And ever since the Niceno-Constantinopolitan Creed by the Council of Nicaea in 325 CE, the Christian church never bothered to rectify this mistake in the translation and kept on telling us that Jesus was the result of a \"miraculous conception\".</p><p> Karl Kilian, Lake Munmorah</p><p>Silent advisers</p><p>Whether Piers Akerman likes it or not, children were not thrown overboard (\"Sinking ships and Labor's dirty tactics,\" Daily Telegraph, October 24). Several people in the Government and military were aware of this and were silent about it while John Howard ranted and raved about \"these people\" in part</p><p>of his pre-election propaganda campaign.</p><p> The choice is simple: Mr Howard is either a liar with</p><p>no ethics and utter contempt for the Australian people, who repeatedly lied to the Australian people, or he said what he believed to be true because no one who worked for him would tell him the truth -- which means he is incompetent in terms of running the Government he heads. It's that simple.</p><p> Adrian Bain, Pendle Hill</p><p>Dripping ignorance</p><p>In my daily walk this morning through the richest postcode in Australia, I came across no fewer</p><p>than five people using their hoses to rid the footpaths of a leaf, and passed another three wet tracts as evidence of more. When I searched their faces for arrogance, all I saw was a dull, ignorant boredom.</p><p> The real drought is one of morality. Under the lovely greenery, the water streaming across those pavements and down the drains seemed more to me like blood.</p><p> Sadly, it won't just be \"user pays\" when the restrictions kick in. Get those Save Water ads back on TV, Mr Carr, and fine the abusers.</p><p> Nigel Abbott, Edgecliff</p><p>A lot of Sydneysiders seem indifferent to the severe drought our state is in. Sydney Water deserves congratulations for its current campaign to educate the public on water conservation, but with the prospect of a scorching summer and bushfire problems, surely we need immediate water restrictions.</p><p> Those who continue to waste water on lawns and so on need to wake up to the dire situation our country cousins face. Apparently, the affluent are more indifferent to the water crisis.</p><p> I doubt that voluntary restrictions will change attitudes sufficiently.</p><p> Anne Mooney, Silverwater</p><p>Luke Kasper laments Sydneysiders' criticism of Melbourne's weather (Letters, October 24), but I can only say we are justified. Sydney does have a higher-than-average annual rainfall for two reasons -- one, Sydney is never and will never be just \"average\", and two, numbers can always be manipulated.</p><p> For example, of the 365 days that make up Mr Kasper's annual rate, Sydney may have 65 extremely rainy days and 300 with nothing but blissful sunshine. On the contrary, Melbourne would have 300 days with some degree of rain.</p><p> So next time I'm in Melbourne, I'll remember my umbrella and sun-</p><p>screen, T-shirt and overcoat. You can never be too prepared when you have four seasons in one day.</p><p> And as for Melbourne being the most liveable city in the world, perhaps Mr Kasper should once again check his facts -- I'm sure Vancouver and Vienna are still top of the tree.</p><p> Tom Matosevic, Jannali</p><p>Luke Kasper should be congratulated for defending his city from the constant barbs of Sydneysiders. He is indeed correct that Sydney has more rain than Melbourne.</p><p> However, according to the Bureau of Meteorology, Sydney also has more hours of sunshine per day, fewer rainy days and a warmer average temperature. I guess that's why Melbourne is the only city in Australia that needs a roof over its sporting facilities.</p><p> Luke, I'm afraid the facts paint a bleak picture of your city. Full marks for trying, though.</p><p> Tony Williams, Dee Why</p><p>Melbourne's weather may or not be worse than Sydney's, but the southern capital wins hands down when it comes to quality of life. Anyone who has been to Melbourne knows that.</p><p> Ron Garland, Petersham</p><p>True to its nature</p><p>I was appalled to read of a crocodile being slaughtered because someone decided to go for a swim in a billabong at night (Daily Telegraph, October 24). There are posted signs telling people not to swim in the these infested waters, so if you swim you risk your life -- and if you risk your life, why should we kill a crocodile because of it?</p><p> Crocodiles may not be cute and cuddly, but they don't deserve to be killed because humans are foolish.</p><p> Deborah Cooke, Carlingford</p><p>Champions do us proud</p><p>In response to Mike Gibson (\"Are the Aussies killing cricket,\" Daily Telegraph, October 23), I would argue that there are in fact three types of people who watch Australian sport: those who enjoy seeing us beat everybody, those who prefer a good contest, and those who just love sport and will watch either way.</p><p> I am in the latter group.</p><p> When the Australian cricket team is losing, critics complain the players are too old and changes need to be made. When we are winning, critics complain the games are boring and that there is no real competition any more. What are they meant to do? Draw every game?</p><p> It was great to see them playing so well against Pakistan, especially in such extreme heat. We should be proud of these guys. They played exceptionally well and have reminded us all of how good they really are.</p><p> Erin McGarrigle, Toongabbie</p><p>Why workers must drive</p><p>Transport Minister Carl Scully's announcement of increased penalties for infringement of the state's traffic</p><p>laws (Daily Telegraph, October 24) should be condemned for its adverse impact on community safety in western Sydney. One only needs to sit in a magistrate's court for</p><p>a few hours to find working people, many middle-aged with young families, begging to keep their licences after minor infringements.</p><p> It is ironic that the main reason for the severe impact of licence loss on people</p><p>in western Sydney is Mr Scully's other portfolio responsibility, that of public transport. In many areas of western Sydney public transport is inadequate, if not totally non-existent. The situation in rural NSW is probably much worse.</p><p> Working people in this state rely upon their driver's licence to make their living. The effect of Mr Scully's announcement, for many offenders, will be to make the penalty for exceeding the speed limit by 31km/h the loss of the offender's livelihood.</p><p> If Mr Scully is serious about road safety he would impose a higher licensing standard for four-wheel-drive vehicles and introduce a driver training regime that included instruction on how to control a vehicle in an emergency. Providing drivers with some simple tuition in how to control a motor vehicle would undoubtedly save more lives than continuing along the current punitive path.</p><p> Darren Magennis,</p><p> Windsor Downs</p><p>One hat too many</p><p>The week after the Bali tragedy highlighted again how confused the role of Australia's head of state has become. The Queen sent a message of sympathy -- but then so did many other foreign heads of state. We don't expect her to do any more than that -- nobody would have expected her to go to Bali or come here to console those affected.</p><p> Her Australian representative flew out to Egypt and his absence from here and Bali was barely noticed until late</p><p>in the week.</p><p> The Prime Minister, as usual, assumed the role of head of state in addition to that of head of government. But in so doing, his attempts to console Australians in Bali were nullified when they criticised him for what they perceived as the failings of his Government in the identification and protection of the bodies of their loved ones.</p><p> When questioned on the absence of the Governor-General, Foreign Minister Alexander Downer summed up the Government's attitude to a head of state with: \"I think the significant thing is the role of the Prime Minister in these situations.\"</p><p> The Prime Minister cannot wear both hats. We need an effective, apolitical head of state.</p><p> Mike O'Shaughnessy,</p><p> Spence, ACT</p><p>I commend the Prime Minister and the Governor-General on delaying their attendance at the Bali disaster. During a crisis we need executives to act, not legislators to talk. Action first, talking later.</p><p> Kow-towing to Mr Howard and Mr Hollingworth would have severely hindered the important work being done when it was needed.</p><p> Dieter Greulich, Noraville</p><p>Jan and Len Clark (Letters, October 23) would like our political leaders to call a national day of prayer, \"asking God to intervene and halt such attacks\".</p><p> They quote a passage from their holy book, which claims such prayers are effective.</p><p> If this is true, it means Jan and Len Clark did not, after the September 11 atrocities, ask their God to intervene and halt further attacks.</p><p> Rather than closing my eyes and talking to the Clarks' imaginary friend, I would spend this national day of prayer doing something useful, like planting trees.</p><p> Richard Lead, Kenthurst</p><p> To the point</p><p>Can somebody please explain to me why an innocent crocodile had to die because of the sheer stupidity of an incompetent tour guide who allowed his group to swim in a well-signposted area warning of the dangers from such creatures?</p><p> Ann-Maree Davis, Surry Hills</p><p>I am disgusted that a crocodile acting on instinct was murdered in its own habitat and then cut up and frozen for police investigations. Surely this Australian icon could have been tranquillised to retrieve the tourist's body?</p><p> Naomi van der Velden, Lilyfield</p><p>With all the trouble involved in identifying the Bali victims, I wonder if now is the time for thumbprints to be included on all passports, not only for quicker identification but also for security purposes.</p><p> N.

In a column published in the London Daily Telegraph on October 3, he wrote: \"I'm going to wring the withers of the Government, I told him, and before he could interrupt I outlined my dithyramb of recrimination.\" A dithyramb is a wildly ecstatic hymn of ancient Greece, especially one dedicated to the god Dionysus.

From midnight tomorrow they become simply 10 more years of human history. Are you glad or sad to see their departure? That was one of several questions put to a cross-section of South Australians by The Advertiser this week. Politicians, public servants, sports stars, farmers, artists and many more were asked for their judgments on these four questions:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WHAT have been society's greatest achievements in the 1980s?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WHAT has been your own greatest personal achievement?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> WHAT is your one regret for the dead decade?</p><p>WHAT is your greatest aspiration for the last 10 years of the 20th century?</p><p> The answers were as diverse as the people who gave them.</p><p> But one subject was cited frequently - the forest fire of democratic freedom burning through eastern Europe in the final weeks of the 80s.</p><p> Also looming large was society's recognition of environmental issues.</p><p> For South Australia's Education Minister, GREG CRAFTER, society's greatest achievement has been the progress towards a more peaceful world, and the improvement in East-West relations.</p><p> His greatest achievement? \"To comprehend the education system and to bring to the attention of the community the importance of education, not just for young people but for the whole of the community.\"</p><p> His greatest regret? \"That it is almost impossible to balance my time with my family, the electorate and my ministry.\"</p><p> He also regrets \"the increasing lack of respect and understanding which the community has for politicians\".</p><p> \"My greatest aspiration is to see the reversal of the trend in Australia where we have more wealthy and more poor people and, in particular, to see greater opportunities for the disadvantaged to obtain comprehensive education.\" The Lord Mayor of Adelaide, STEVE CONDOUS, said society's greatest achievement in the 1980s had been the recent triumph of democracy in many European countries, marked most significantly by the collapse of the Berlin Wall.</p><p> His greatest personal achievement had been the adoption of his only daughter, Chilean-born Stacey.</p><p> \"It was a long, painful wait for (my wife) Angela and I, but Stacy has given me more happiness in the past three years of my life than anything else,\" he said.</p><p> Mr Condous said his greatest aspiration for the 1990s was to continue fighting for the cause of street kids and the growing problem of poverty.</p><p> South Australian Tourism Minister BARBARA WIESE thought society's greatest achievement for the decade had been that people \"realised that the earth's resources are finite and must be protected more for the future\". She saw her own personal achievement as \"placing tourism in this State in the position where we are able to realise our potential as a desirable international destination\". Ms Wiese regrets that \"South Australians still tend to be negative and lack the confidence to compete on the world stage\".</p><p> For the next 10 years, her greatest aspiration is \"the development of a society that is prepared to work together and constructively make South Australia an even better place to live\".</p><p> GAY NAFFINE, a leading South Australian fashion designer, retailer and national marketer, said she believed society's great achievement of the decade had been a \"more tolerant attitude and a breakdown of social barriers, culminating in the recent events in eastern Europe\".</p><p> Her greatest achievement had been the overcoming of fear of taking risks.</p><p> Ms Naffine regrets that she didn't gain more formal training in the financial and commercial side of business, such as an accounting degree, \"which would enable me to drive my own business in this area\".</p><p> For the 1990s, she intends to \"totally enjoy what I am doing\", and develop the intellectual and philosophical side of fashion, in order to relate her business to \"the cultural, social, political and psychological needs of our society\".</p><p> The coach of the Port Adelaide football team, JOHN CAHILL, saw society's greatest achievements as \"awareness of the environment and the fact that people were apathetic about it before the 80s\".</p><p> His personal high point was being Port's coach this year when it became the first team to win both night and day premierships.</p><p> His greatest aspiration for the 1990s is \"to see myself as someone who can win and lose with dignity - and that's something that is easier said than done\".</p><p> MARINA PEARCE, a 25-year-old dual Olympic Games basketballer, thought society's greatest achievement in the 1980s was \"the invention of the microwave oven\".</p><p> Her own high point in the decade was \"without a doubt playing in the 1984 Los Angeles and 1988 Seoul Olympic Games.\"</p><p> She regrets not winning a Women's National Basketball League title with the North Adelaide Rockets and, for the 1990s, wants the Australian women's team to qualify for the 1992 Olympics in Barcelona, and \"to complete the extensions to our house\".</p><p> Champion racehorse trainer COLIN HAYES said he hoped the opening of the Berlin Wall would play \"a major part in bringing peace to the world\".</p><p> He saw his greatest personal achievement as winning two Melbourne Cups, with Beldale Ball (1980) and At Talaq (1986), and the Cox Plate in October this year with Almaarad. \"Winning Melbourne Cups is every trainer's dream and Almaarad's victory in my last season as a trainer is probably the most emotional I've been after a race.\"</p><p> Colin Hayes' greatest aspiration for the 1990s is to see his son, David, break all the training records he has established in recent years.</p><p> LYNEECE SCHMIDT, hotelier and society identity, rejoiced that in the 80s it became acceptable for women to drink in a hotel and that \"old money\" was no longer the criterion for social acceptance. Her triumph for the decade was having been accepted in business as a female, while her big regret was to have been picked up for drink-driving. In the 90s she hopes to have children.</p><p>Australian Airlines' promotions officer KARYN BAYLISS thought the breakthrough of the 80s was that men had come to want women on management teams. Her personal achievement was having a child and her impish regret was \"not giving in to all those blue-eyed, brown-eyed and hazel-eyed men\". During the 90s she's set herself the task of getting an MBA.</p><p> KARYN FOSTER, a vivacious public relations consultant, also hailed women's acceptance in the professional workforce as a major achievement of the 80s. Her own achievement as a dedicated working woman was not having children during that time. She had no regrets and has set her sights on retiring in the 90s.</p><p> ALAN OLDING, founder and president of the Australian Sherlock Holmes Society, believed that while society had little of which to be proud in the 80s, the Voyager journeys and the probing of outer space was a great scientific achievement. Of himself, he said maintaining a good lifestyle while keeping out of the hands of finance companies was a fair achievement, but he regretted that all the 80s had done was to make him 10 years older. He aspires to live through the 90s in similar style to the 80s.</p><p> LINDSAY THOMPSON, general manager of the State's biggest employer organisation, the South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, saw the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and a move towards democracy right throughout Europe as the great achievement of the decade. His own high point was \"to be part of a team comprising chamber members and public servants which has achieved the doubling of shipping coming into the Port of Adelaide from both Europe and Japan\". He regrets that industrial restructuring of Australia \"has been too slow and, as a consequence, our overall standard of living has fallen\".</p><p> In the next 10 years, Mr Thompson wants to make people more aware of the need to become productive and competitive on international markets.</p><p> REX LEVERINGTON, a 5AN radio announcer, also cited the fall of the Berlin Wall as the greatest event of the 80s. Personally, he felt the 80s had been a phase of mellowing and maturing, and he hoped in the 90s to learn to relinquish anxieties and come to terms with life as it is. Regrets? \"Ah,\" he said. \"Regrets. I've had a few, but too few to mention.\"</p><p> The executive officer of the Australian Hotels Association's apprentice chef scheme, GLEN LAWRENCE, said: \"At last we have begun to realise the damage we are doing to the atmosphere with chloroflurocarbons.\"</p><p> Any regrets? \"That young people are faced with AIDS and drug problems, which we never encountered in our youth.\" Her personal aspiration for the 90s is to see her apprentice chefs recognised for improving the standard of hospitality in Australia. She hopes the 1990s will offer \"employment for young people who would otherwise be on the dole\".</p><p> MIKE RANN, South Australia's new Minister of Employment and Further Education, says his greatest personal achievement was \"finally learning to question old assumptions, thinking through things that were absolutely sacred cows\".</p><p> Society's greatest achievement was a \"growing appreciation of the value of multiculturalism and greater realisation that, out of diversity, Australia will find its strength\".</p><p> His regret is not having been able to spend more time with his family and his aspiration for the 90s is that they will encounter \"renewed activism\" after a decade which was \"a time for taking stock and rearranging priorities\".</p><p> Freeling farmer MICHAEL SHANAHAN, a former senior vice-president of the National Farmers Federation, former deputy chairman of the Australian Wheat Board and past president of the United Farmers and Stockowners of SA, said the greatest achievement of the decade had been \"the almost universal commitment by society to introduce control measures to protect the environment from further degradation following irreparable damage caused to the ozone layer, the destruction of natural resources such as rain forests, and the frightening effects of Chernobyl\".</p><p> He regretted the serious loss of political and market power by Australian grain growers, \"who lack the resources to compete with government and economic bureacracies, marketing boards and private industry. This alarming change in the past five years is continuing and, if not arrested, will lead to a crisis in farmer influence in the Australian grain industry\".</p><p> In the 1990s, Mr Shanahan wants to see the restoration of the balance of influence in the Australian grain industry so that graingrowers, through appropriate reorganisation, can have an effective say in how reform and restructing is implemented in their industry.</p><p> ALDO IACOBELLI is an emerging Adelaide artist of national significance who also saw society's greatest achievement in the 1980s as the Berlin Wall coming down.</p><p> \"My greatest personal achievement has been supporting my family, mainly through my art,\" he said. Mr Iacobelli's aim is to \"keep on working and hopefully I can do that without having an extra job to support my family. Artistically, I hope to be able to express myself in a most sincere way in my work, without being compromised in any way, and that includes the monetary one. That is the hardest thing to achieve.\"</p><p> ROB BROOKMAN, director of the 1992 Adelaide Festival, said: \"You can't go past the peaceful democratisation of eastern Europe as the most significant development of the 1980s.\"</p><p> Mr Brookman's major regret is \"the pragmatism that has led to the vandalisation of land that should have been returned to the green belt and that now houses some of the ugliest buildings in Adelaide, while making a mockery of the Adelaide Railway Station, the one fine building we had there - in short, the ASER development and all it represents in the pragmatic 1980s\".</p><p> In the 1990s, he looks forward to \"more money for the arts\".</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>cartoon: the 80s;
