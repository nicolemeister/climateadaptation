Six thousand homes and four million olive trees burned, half the forests of Greece gone, and 64 people dead is a huge loss, and in the carbonised landscapes of the Peleponnese it is hard to imagine that people will ever live there again.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what nobody saw coming was the political fall-out: this may be the first time that a government falls because of climate change.</p><p>When the centre-right government of <person><nameText>Costas Karamanlis </nameText></person>called an early election last month after only three years in office, it had a comfortable lead in the opinion polls and was cruising towards a certain victory.</p><p>The fires changed all that, shaking people's trust in the competence not just of the Government but of the established parties in general. In the last published opinion polls (Greek law bans polls in the last two weeks before the September 16 election), neither Karamanlis's New Democracy nor the centre-left opposition party, PASOK, had even 40 per cent of the vote.</p><p>The beneficiaries were the extreme right Laos party, a normally marginal group preaching nationalism, hatred of immigrants and Orthodox Christianity (its posters urge all Greeks to unite as \"one fist\"), and the equally fringe party of the hard left called Syriza. Neither party is represented in the present Parliament, since they could not clear the legal threshold of 3 per cent of the popular vote.</p><p>They are both very likely to be in the next Parliament and if the two major parties end up more or less tied, as seems probable, extremists of one sort or another will be able to extort a high political price in return for agreeing to support a coalition government.</p><p>Obviously, we can't just extrapolate from this single example and say that climate disasters lead to a polarisation and radicalisation of politics, but this is a phenomenon that warrants attention. After a week like the Greeks had, there was bound to be a political reaction, but does it mean anything for other places?</p><p>First of all, were these fires really caused by climate change? After all, there were fires of a similar scale in Greece about a century ago, and of course the land did turn green again after a few years. But uncontrollable \"megafires\" are ceasing to be once- in-a-century events. Another one burned about a quarter of the island of Tenerife in the Canary Islands this summer.</p><p>There have been comparable megafires in the past few years in France, Portugal, Canada, Russia, Indonesia, South Africa and Brazil.</p><p>In the United States, where a forest fire that burned more than 2000ha was relatively rare 20 years ago, in the past decade there have been more than 200 megafires that burned at least 10 times that area.</p><p>Six of the past 10 years have seen the previous US record for the amount of land devastated by forest fires broken.</p><p>If this isn't climate change in full costume dress, it is certainly its first cousin. Temperatures in Greece this summer hit 46 degrees, unheard of even 10 years ago. In a Mediterranean climate where almost all the rain falls in the winter, this virtually guaranteed massive forest fires.</p><p>There is a prima facie case for seeing this as a manifestation of climate change so what about the political reaction in Greece? It has been ugly on every side.</p><p>The Karamanlis Government, having made few preparations for coping with massive fires despite the speed with which the problem has grown in recent years, was slow to respond to the crisis, and then tried to shift the blame for its failures by claiming that the fires were set by arsonists, saboteurs and terrorists. Its spokesmen rambled on about \"asymetrical terrorist threats\" and an \"organised plan\" to destabilise the country, but those Greeks paranoid enough to believe such claptrap did not forgive the New Democrats for their sins. Instead, they promptly shifted their votes to the extremists who promised to \"crack down hard\" on something or other.</p><p>It hardly matters what they crack down on. Minorities and immigrants are usually favoured by the far right, which will probably be the main beneficiary of these events in Greece, but it's pure symbolism, so the actual target doesn't matter. Any outsider or foreigner will do.</p><p>Now envisage a world where climate change is really hitting hard.</p><p>The Mississippi delta, various Pacific islands and a good deal of Bangladesh are disappearing beneath the waves. The Amazon is burning, the monsoon has failed for the third successive year in the Indian sub-continent, and Spain, Italy, Greece and Turkey are turning into deserts. Will people and governments be sweetly reasonable, seeking collaborative ways to cope with a shared international disaster?</p><p>Sure they will. Just as soon as they have shot down all the flying pigs.</p><p>Gwynne Dyer is a London-based independent journalist whose articles are published in 45 countries.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-9295103</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2007</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4PMC-C2B0-TX4S-M1H5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"824\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2007 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"09\" year=\"2007\"><dateText>September 10, 2007 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001347</classCode><className>POLLS &amp;

A 70-year-old woman has been charged with first-degree murder, accused of suffocating eight of her 10 children. Marie Noe smothered the children with a pillow or other soft object, District Attorney Lynne Abraham said. All had been declared healthy at birth and were developing normally. They were 13 days to 14 months old when they died over a 19-year period from 1949. Mrs Noe said they had died in their sleep and in each case was at home alone with them. Her lawyer, David Rudenstein, said Mrs Noe denies the charges.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mormon accused of polygamy</p><p>SALT LAKE CITY. The arrest of a man accused of making his 16-year-old niece his 15th wife has resurrected the subject of polygamy in the Mormon Church and has embarrassed officials at its headquarters in Salt Lake City. David Kingston has been arrested on two charges of incest and may also be charged with violating a Utah state law prohibiting polygamy. If so, it will be the first prosecution for polygamy in more than 45 years. Leaders of the 10-million-member Church of Jesus Christ of the Latter-day Saints, which renounced multiple marriages more than a century ago, say they now excommunicate anybody caught engaging in polygamy.</p><p>Fierce fighting in Sri Lanka</p><p>COLOMBO. Fierce fighting between Sri Lankan troops and separatist Tamil rebels in the country's north and east has left at least 213 dead in the past two weeks, an army spokesman said today. There was no comment from the rebels on the latest fighting. Sri Lanka in June slapped censorship on war reporting by local and foreign media after the military stepped up its campaign to capture the highway.</p><p>Japan remembers Hiroshima bomb</p><p>HIROSHIMA. Sorrow mixed with anger on the 53rd anniversary of the world's first atomic bombing today as thousands gathered to remember the dead and renew their commitment to peace. Prayers for a nuclear-free world took on a grim new significance in the wake of Indian and Pakistani testing in May that many fear may have started a global drift back towards nuclear weapons. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima killed an estimated 140,000 people by the end of 1945, according to city records, with thousands dying of related illnesses afterwards.</p><p>Bulgarian dictator dead at 86</p><p>SOFIA. Bulgaria's former communist dictator Todor Zhivkov has died in a Sofia hospital at the age of 86, doctors said today. Mr Zhivkov ruled Bulgaria from 1954 until he was ousted in a bloodless coup by fellow party members in 1989. He was released from house arrest in September 1997 after becoming Eastern Europe's first communist leader to stand trial in 1991.</p><p>Key Palestinian minister resigns</p><p>RAMALLAH. Hanan Ashrawi, a leading member of Yasser Arafat's Cabinet, resigned today in protest at a reshuffle of the Palestinian selfrule Government and its handling of peace negotiations with Israel. \"I've reached my own conclusions, it's a question of being honest. There is nobody above the law,\" she said. Dr Ashrawi, an independent, is a leading voice of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and a crusader for Palestinian human rights who has challenged both Israel and Mr Arafat's PLO.</p><p>New fires flare near Olympia</p><p>ATHENS. A new forest fire broke out at dawn today near ancient Olympia, home of the Olympic games of antiquity, firemen said. Major resources were brought in to tackle the latest fire as officials feared that the ancient site might be damaged, a spokesman for the firefighting coordination centre said. Prime Minister Costas Simitis had interrupted his holidays to chair a special Cabinet meeting on Tuesday night as ministers were recalled to discuss the fires, thought to be deliberately lit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Todor Zhivkov</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NV40-TXN5-S1MB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yi27uyig08wtinp2o4</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1998</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"611\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1998 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"08\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>August 7, 1998 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Criminal Law &amp;

That book was the first time Evans exhibited what was to become his trademark: taking strangebuttrue, intriguing occupations and turning them into blockbuster stories.</p><p> The Horse Whisperer was about American horse trainers from what was once the wild west who can \"speak\" to their charges, communicating in \"horse language\".</p><p> Evans' new book, The Smoke Jumper, takes a special breed of firefighter, those who are airlifted into fires to save people trapped inside infernos.</p><p> Evans' books generally mix romance with rugged heroes and adventure tales and The Smoke Jumper is no exception.</p><p> Jumpers Ed Tully and Connor Ford are best friends, both in love with Julia, who must choose between the two men.</p><p> Connor is also a photographer who travels through Africa to capture images of disaster and despair. No one could accuse Evans of choosing material that lets him sit back and relax.</p><p> He sets himself huge research tasks each time he writes a novel.</p><p> \"That stems from a journalistic background, in the sense that that was my first job,\" Evans says.</p><p> \"Real life is just so rich and the process of research is crucial to me.</p><p> \"If you're going to make a character who's a smoke jumper you need to know what you're talking about.</p><p> \"As a reader you have no experience of these areas I'm writing about and accept it as plausible.</p><p> \"But the people involved in that area should see it as real, too.</p><p> \"If somebody working with horses saw that I had done something completely wrong in The Horse Whisperer, it would really bug me, so I just want to get it right.\"</p><p> The man who sets his stories in the American west is, in fact, a mildmannered English person who lives on an idyllic Devon property where the River Dart runs through into a wooded glade.</p><p> He lives with partner Charlotte and dog Hopi, \"the second love of my life\".</p><p> Evans came to writing novels after studying law, working as a newspaper journalist and then making TV documentaries as well as movies.</p><p> He came across the notion of smoke jumpers at the same time he was thinking about major life choices. His 25year marriage was coming to an end and he thought fire was a great metaphor for purging, clearing and starting again.</p><p> And jumping into the flames of a forest fire seemed a great metaphor for leaping into what life has to offer. He says he wanted to describe that moment in our lives when we have to choose between either the decent thing -- \"the honour or the loyalty or things we're brought up thinking are the things we should stay with\" -- or ambition.</p><p> \"And whether you have the guts to jump into the flames to go and get it,\" the author says.</p><p> Evans knows people wonder what an Englishman is doing writing about the American west, but explains the west is his subject matter because \"I was an Indian for the first 10 years of my life\".</p><p> Playing the children's game of cowboys and Indians was a favourite hobby when he was young, with just an older sister for company.</p><p> \"If you're a boy and you have an older sister they're like a generation apart, they're so sophisticated,\" Evans says.</p><p> \"You want to play with them, but they don't want to play with you.\"</p><p>\u00a0 * The Smoke Jumper by Nicholas Evans, Bantam Press, rrp $45</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-DTM0110061074310714</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEDAILYTELEGRALTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:444P-8H20-015G-S0DM-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"636\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Sydney, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"10\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>October 6, 2001, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CFDI</classCode><className>HORSES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp;

The authorities gave us these,\" one said, proudly referring to a battered plastic water tank strapped to his back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Until now, he explained, they had to beat flames out with tree branches.</p><p>This time, they walked about three kilometres from the nearest water hole to fill each 15-litre tank. When they finish dousing this fire, they will walk back, refill and hike to another blaze, he said.</p><p> Wildfires that poured choking smoke across much of South-East Asia and threatened the health of an estimated 70 million people last year have returned to the jungles of Borneo island.</p><p>Indonesia's worried neighbours have demanded strong action. But bogged down in its worst economic crisis in three decades, Indonesia admits that without heavy rain it has almost no chance of preventing haze from spreading across the region again.</p><p> Most days, a heavy haze blankets the cities of Balikpapan and Samarinda, both about 1,200 km north of Jakarta. Their airports have been closed much of the time since the first fires started in January.</p><p> Here the sun burns orange in a grey sky. Smoke fills the nose, irritates the throat and stings the eyes. Doctors warn of a dramatic increase in respiratory infections and asthma if the haze persists.</p><p> \"We could face major health problems if it does not rain soon,\" said Dr Jusuf, the head of a hospital in Samarinda.</p><p> The smoke is worst in two national parks that are home to rare species such as orangutan apes.</p><p> Scientists warn that together with drought, the haze could devastate harvests as it did last year when crops could not get enough sunshine to grow.</p><p> \"The smoke has ruined my crop. Fruit from my trees is too small to sell,\" complains Kondo, a farmer who lives on the edge of the burning forest.</p><p> As last year, officials have said many of the fires appear to have been set, a cheap way for farmers, plantation owners and logging companies to clear land.</p><p> Officials using satellite imaging count between 400 and 600 hotspots a day in eastern Borneo and dozens more in central Sumatra island. Fires have also been spotted in the Malaysian-controlled northern part of Borneo.</p><p> At this time of year, these locales should be green, lush and wet. But meteorologists say El Nino has cut short the rainy season, leaving jungles, farmland and commercial forest areas tinder-dry.</p><p> The government says about 8,900 hectares of land have been blackened in Borneo. But Grant Beebe, a forest fire expert from Boise, Idaho, said the damage could be in the hundreds of thousands of hectares.</p><p> Several hundred soldiers, firefighters and farmers are battling the fires with buckets or branches of trees, said Beebe, who works for a German-funded aid project monitoring the problem.</p><p> They haven't had much success, he said, but \"it's an improvement on the past when people just let fires burn. At least now they know they should at least try to control them.\"</p><p> When the fires first started in Borneo costly water bombing planes were sent up for a few days - to little effect.</p><p> The government then began a cloud-seeding operation in which a plane drops salt crystals into clouds to induce rain. But so far that also has failed.</p><p>Indonesia's neighbours seem resigned to another year of choking on Indonesia's smoke. In Singapore, the state-owned television advised people to get their air filters and face masks ready.</p><p> \"Prepare early and well for the full impact of El Nino,\" viewers were warned this week.</p><p>AP gr</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S66-VHB0-0048-T4YN-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"610\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 AAP Information Services Pty.

The youths, some of them barefoot, join the fight with even cruder equipment, including lumps of wood and half-full buckets of water from a muddy and nearly empty nearby creek.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> With the firefighters spread over less than 50 metres as a two-kilometre wall of fire moves towards them through the rugged Bukit Suharto area of Indonesia's East Kalimantan province it is difficult to see the reason for their mirth, unless it is in the utter hopelessness of their task.</p><p>This is the frontline \u00a0one of scores of such frontlines \u00a0in<br/> what experts are saying is one of the greatest environmental disasters faced by the world today.</p><p> Some 1,000 fires are burning over 200 square kilometres in the province. They have razed about 200,000 hectares of forest and caused $\u00a0US220 million ($\u00a0A329 million) damage since the start of the year, according to officials and firefighters.</p><p> Thick smoke blocks out the sun in the provincial capital of Samarinda, the oil town of Balikpapan and other areas, leaving thousands wheezing and suffering skin and eye irritations. One person reportedly died here last week from a respiratory ailment linked to the smog.</p><p> Others are falling sick from poor water quality, the result of a dramtic drop in river levels because of a prolonged drought.</p><p> The fires have raised fears that last year's devastating haze, which disrupted transport and caused health problems over much of the region, could be repeated.</p><p> On the 125-kilometre highway linking Samarinda and Balikpapan, residents continue to pour water into the dust surrounding their wooden homes in what has proved until now an effective shield against the flames.</p><p> \"My crops are burned but my house is okay,\" said one elderly woman in a village in Bukit Suharto.</p><p> The highway by night is illuminated by the thousands of slowly burning trees on either side, traffic slowing to pass through the smoke as flames melt the bitumen at its edges.</p><p> Fires are also burning southwest of Balikpapan and in the Kutai national park north of Samarinda, where endangered animals including orangutan flee the flames.</p><p> On the approach to Samarinda, the brothel settlement of Sepuluh Kilometre is surrounding by blackened earth and the hundreds of prostitutes and clients cough as they go in and out of scores of bars.</p><p> \"Business is bad,\" said a guard at the entrance to the village.</p><p> \"There have been fires here before and now the forests here are burning, people think it is dangerous.\"</p><p> Firefighters blame timber and plantation companies and small-holding farmers for the fires, saying indigenous Dayak tribes have centuries of experience in controlling the fires.</p><p> Satellite photos place many of the latest blazes within timber and palm oil concessions, though the companies deny they are using fire to clear land for fresh planting.</p><p> Farmers are more forthright, saying they need to burn trees and bush so they can plant fresh crops.</p><p> The disastrous Bukit Suharto blazes began several weeks ago when a farmer decided he needed a new peppercorn field, officials say.</p><p> Pepper is the area's main crop and the fires and drought of last year led to a shortage which in turn has forced prices up.</p><p> \"So the farmers think they can get higher prices and want to plant more peppercorn,\" said Hartmut Abberger, of the German-funded Integrated Forest Fire Management Project in Samarinda.</p><p> \"But if there is more pepper, the price will drop, and if they start more fires they could lose their own crops anyway. Its crazy.\"</p><p>AFP \u00a0ts<br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S9J-8320-0048-T05K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"647\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 AAP Information Services Pty.

Yet we have an objection.</p><p>It seems as if nothing can be done on the Central Coast without people objecting.</p><p>Want to sink a warship for a major tourist attraction, build a skate ramp to entertain children, look for gas way out to sea, build a race track to provide a major sporting facility and generate tourism revenue or maybe just want to smarten the place up?</p><p>Well forget doing it on the Central Coast - we're the NIMBY Coast where very little gets done and what does gets objected to.</p><p>I'm certainly not in favour of laissez-faire development but all this negative whingeing is dragging the Central Coast down.</p><p>John Shingleton,</p><p>Terrigal</p><p>Brown water from tap rates poorly</p><p>I HAVE just received my new rates notice with an increase of $178 a year.

All were members of the NSW Rural Fire Service Wingello Volunteer Bushfire Brigade.</p><p>Police have not released the name of the dead man, who had three young children and had been a brigade member for many years.</p><p>The injured include Mrs Gail Pritchett, 40, who is in a critical condition in Royal North Shore Hospital, and her husband, Mr Frank Pritchett, 40, also listed as critical in Westmead Hospital.</p><p>Mrs Pritchett received burns to 20 per cent of her body, including her airways, and was in intensive care and on a ventilator last night.</p><p>Mr Mick Neale, an experienced firefighter who is a teacher at St Patrick's College, Goulburn, is in Westmead Hospital in a critical condition and his son, Mr Andrew Neale, is in Bowral Hospital in a satisfactory condition.</p><p>Mr John Luke and Mr Roger Robinson are both in a satisfactory condition in Liverpool Hospital, and Mr Mike Young, 32, son of a local general store owner, is in a stable condition in Royal North Shore.</p><p>Police said the man's body was still in the tanker at 9 pm and was expected to be removed by late last night.</p><p>\"He was a really reliable fellow,\" said Mr David Lidgard, who runs the shire canteen for Bundanoon Fire Brigade. \"Wingello was a brigade that should never have been lost. They are well trained and dedicated.\"</p><p>Senior Constable Bob Eagleton, of Bowral police, said: \"It looks like the fire has turned with a gust of wind and they have been caught in the truck.</p><p>\"It's just a terrible disaster. Everyone feels it so badly. I'm a six-foot-tall pretty tough fella and this has had a terrible effect on me and all the other emergency workers.\"</p><p>A police chaplain arrived to counsel firefighters. There are 700 volunteers in the district.</p><p>It was the second fire death to hit the area in three years. Mr Bob Page, a member of the Wingecarribee Shire firefighters, was killed in 1994 fighting fires around Grafton.</p><p>The death was the fourth in four weeks to strike the Rural Fire Service in a summer that Commissioner Phil Koperberg has warned might be one ofthe worst bushfire seasons on record.</p><p>As police investigated the tragedy, more than 700 volunteer firefighters, backed by 17 helicopters and nine fix-winged aircraft, were battling fires at 32 locations throughout the State. So far, the fires have destroyed more than 200,000 hectares of bush.</p><p>One of the worst forced the evacuation of more than 1,200 campers from the Myall Lakes National Park on the mid-North Coast.</p><p>The fatal Wingello State Forest fire was one of three still burning in the Wingecarribee Shire last night.</p><p>The Minister for Emergency Services, Mr Langton, last night announced an immediate investigation into the death.</p><p>PAGE 2: Volunteers rally to fight deadly blaze; more pictures, map.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Two illus: One of the injured Wingello volunteers is taken from a helicopter into Westmead Hospital.

Greater Union and Village suburbs. Selected independents.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former pro football star Howie Long quickly becomes part of the scenery in his screen debut - an action adventure about a gang of fire fighters at work in the Wyoming state forests. With a neck like a tree trunk, a face seemingly chiselled out of pine and an acting style to match, he could beat a forest fire to death, if he didn't first bore it into submission. He's not quite what Jerry Seinfeld calls a slow talker, but he's getting there, and this is not dialogue to linger over. \"You're going to pound some more ground before you fly the sky,\" is fire chief Howie's idea of putting a little backbone into one of his less agile trainees.</p><p>The script was written by Chris Soth, a University of Southern California film student, and produced by his USC professor who successfully pitched it to Twentieth Century Fox. It would be interesting to know if anybody actually read it during its progress across the lunch tables of Hollywood, although I suspect not. The basic idea was probably enough to swing the deal. Howie and his team are \"smokejumpers\" - firefighters who parachute into burning forests which can't be reached any other way. Are they mad? The script doesn't go into that question. Psychology is not on its beat. It gets them in there and out again, strewing assorted complications in their path, while you suspend disbelief if you can - a feat which would be easier it you had a few more practicalities to work with. Soth isn't strong on logic. Nor does he trust the fearsomeness of the fire to keep the plot revved up, which is a pity, because Australian cinematographer Dean Semler, directing for the first time, turns on quite a show. A display of radiant heat and billowing vapours lighting up the sky, burning up the ground and almost eating up the screen. You're able to study it from so many angles that its changes of mind and mood are more than enough to keep the main plotline going - although Soth isn't convinced. As a result, he throws in a gang of escaped convicts, led by William Forsythe, a good actor when the circumstances are right, but completely baffled by his role here. He plays a sort of paste-up of villains gone by. Discernible are borrowings from Hannibal Lecter and Cape Fears Max Cady, but the basics of a characterisation are nowhere to be found. A criminal mastermind who speaks grammatically and calls his prison mates \"Mr.\", this man has spent his years inside becoming a whiz at physics and chemistry, and still he has to be told by Howie that fires run uphill.</p><p>Should be be played for laughs? Unable to make up his mind, Forsythe settles for being a bad Joke. Semler should have been able to help him. Unfortunately, he's not nearly as good with actors as he is with smoke and flames. While Forsythe hams it up, Howie doesn't act at all, and Scott Glenn, who actually manages a performance, has nowhere to take it, as Semler pumps up the music and lays on the bathos. Finally, it's the script that defeats them all. The clunk, clunk of those lines is enough to put out anybody's fire.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUS:Lucky Luciano, capo di capos (an elegant Andy Garcia)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhvw4gk97ozv9um7qz</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P85-1CN0-TXN5-R2J2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"529\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1998 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"1998\"><dateText>March 14, 1998 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

But my blue eyes turn green when I see their car parks.</p><p>I compete at Baker Park knowing that to do so one risks life and limb to find safe parking within cooee of the netball courts. In Wyong every netballer plays their games at the same location on a Saturday, regardless of where they live.</p><p>The traffic congestion and danger that accompanies more than 2200 players, officials and thousands of family members all converging on this small patch of ground has to be seen to be believed.</p><p>To give you an idea the whole netball complex of 30 courts and clubhouse facilities would fit easily inside two professional soccer fields.</p><p>The courts have parking for about 35 cars in a weed-infested, poorly marked car park.</p><p>There are ways to help ease this traffic gridlock: angle parking, demolish and return the derelict tennis club site to parking or turning the unused road off Pollock Ave into a car park. I am sure that the council can find more solutions if they really try.</p><p>Lorinda Lombardelli,</p><p>Alison</p><p>Speeding drivers deserve to be fined</p><p>GOSFORD councillor Craig Doyle and those who support him in opposing the introduction of speed cameras, hidden or otherwise, are behaving disgracefully.</p><p>These cameras do save lives and avoid injuries despite his rubbery statistics that contradict those from the RTA.</p><p>We've just had thousands of dollars spent installing security cameras in various places around town to reduce crime in the area.</p><p>Why should the roads be any different? The next speeding driver booked could well save a life. As a driver for more than 40 years, I've had a few speeding fines and deserved each one.</p><p>David McDougall,</p><p>Woy Woy</p><p>Politics prevents reduction burning</p><p>THE findings of the Royal Commission into the 2009 Victorian Black Saturday bushfires have been released.</p><p>One recommendation is that fuel reduction burning be drastically increased.</p><p>I would like to know how much reduction burning has been carried out in Wyong shire throughout the winter months.</p><p>Former Victorian forest fire chief Athol Hodgson was interviewed on radio and said there was no political will to reintroduce the necessary fuel reduction to make the State fire safe because the Labor Government is too concerned about Green preferences.</p><p>When will our State Government and our local councils allow the Rural Fire Service to do its job and carry out the necessary fuel reduction burning to keep the people safe.</p><p>Or do they want a repeat of the Victorian disaster?</p><p>Anne Guest,</p><p>Wyee</p><p>Pensioners should be looked after</p><p>PENSIONERS deserve a boost in the pension now not down the track or just before they die.</p><p>What does it say about Australia, a rich country which ranks at the bottom of the developed countries, when it comes to the support of its senior citizens.</p><p>The big corporations can raise their prices as often as necessary to ensure a desirable level of profit, but the retired person whose income depends on a state pension is simply forced into the ranks of the country's impoverished.</p><p>Politicians spare a thought for the pensioner who opens a tin of generic baked beans and spreads them on week-old bread as you gorge into your T-bone steak at the Parliament House canteen at cut price, thanks to the generosity of the Australian taxpayer.</p><p>Richard Ryan,</p><p>Summerland Point</p><p>Welcome to the NIMBY Coast</p><p>I READ with astonishment Jennifer Hatton's objections to the long overdue refurbishment of the scenic walking route of The Esplanade at Terrigal (Express Advocate, July 28).</p><p>The awful chicken wire fencing surely a relic from the 1950s has been replaced by a proper, tasteful metal fence and a concrete safety barrier installed on the roadside to protect pedestrians. Yet we have an objection.</p><p>It seems as if nothing can be done on the Central Coast without people objecting.</p><p>Want to sink a warship for a major tourist attraction, build a skate ramp to entertain children, look for gas way out to sea, build a race track to provide a major sporting facility and generate tourism revenue or maybe just want to smarten the place up?</p><p>Well forget doing it on the Central Coast - we're the NIMBY Coast where very little gets done and what does gets objected to.</p><p>I'm certainly not in favour of laissez-faire development but all this negative whingeing is dragging the Central Coast down.</p><p>John Shingleton,</p><p>Terrigal</p><p>Brown water from tap rates poorly</p><p>I HAVE just received my new rates notice with an increase of $178 a year.

Though her first two stories, 'Wish for a Pony' (1947) and 'No Mistaking Corker' (1947), were fodder for the wish-fulfilment of horsey-minded girls, their successors dealt with such adventures as forest fire, floods, smuggling, the predations of French fishermen and foot-and-mouth disease. 'Wish for a Pony' was the book Edwards liked least, and it saddened her that it was one of the most popular. But there was a depth of character in her fictional children that was missing from the huge numbers of horse-show rosette stories of the 1940s and 1950s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's a fair cop</p><p>The undoubted worth of Ken Sanzel's screenplay for 'The Replacement Killers' was being judged this weekend, when the movie opened in the United States. Much of his research is based on his nine years as a detective with the New York City Transit Police. Does the movie, which stars Mira Sorvino, bear any resemblance to the real-life world of crime fighting? Er, no, he says. \"In police work, if you have a big event once a month, that's a lot.\"</p><p>Going on a bear hunt</p><p>There's a bear in there. And Piglet as well. But the problem seems to be that Christopher Robin's original toys are on the wrong side of the Atlantic. Gwyneth Dunwoody, a British MP, spotted Winnie-the-Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet and Kanga at New York's Donnell Library and decided they looked \"very unhappy indeed\". So she announced a campaign to bring them back to England. But New York mayor Rudolph Giuliani said, \"I think Winnie-the-Pooh is an example of the very best in immigration. He's very, very proud of his background and heritage, but now he's found a new land and he's found a better life for himself here.\"</p><p>Comrades in arms</p><p>Bill Clinton will soon be appearing in China. Well, on bookshelves across China, anyway. 'The Los Angeles Times' reports that the Bill Clinton-Jiang Zemin story might not be nearly as titillating as some of the sagas now circulating in Washington, but the 237-page glossy paperback with smiling Presidents Clinton and Jiang on the cover is</p><p>still something of a political milestone. The book, 'Building a Constructive China-US Strategic Partnership,' makes no mention of the 29 October White House news conference in which Clinton and Jiang, who is also China's Communist Party chief, engaged in a brief, pointed debate over the bloody 1989 army crackdown in Tiananmen Square. Responding then to questions from reporters, Clinton said the Chinese Government was \"on the wrong side of history\" in the Tiananmen episode. The lapse is explained thus by the publisher: \"If we included all the material in the book it would have been too thick\".</p><p>Shop Stop</p><p>The Bookery</p><p>348 Drummond Street, Carlton 9347 7857</p><p>Age: Six years old.</p><p>Owner: Richard Hughes</p><p>Number of titles: About 12,000</p><p>The Place: Behind the anonymous green facade of the old Brunswick green cottage in Drummond Street, Carlton, is a large orderly room devoted to textbooks on English as a Second Language, Literacy, Numeracy and Linguistics - all sold under retail prices.

You'd find such black forests in any nightclub doing the grind tonight, Friday night, in Melbourne.</p><p>The Lone Ranger has come to Heat, at Crown. And he isn't here to stand and look, to simply dare to dream. I spotted him 20 minutes to midnight, trying to connect at the bar. Friday night has become Saturday morning and he's still out there, trying.</p><p>In his dark suit and good shoes, playing the easy-going funny guy, the Lone Ranger does all right in the first couple of seconds; the accidental meeting of gazes, the shy but boyishly leering smile, asking if she's having a good night.</p><p>But the no-worries routine, like his dancing, is undone by a clumsy and obvious premature ejaculation of dishonorable intentions. After a long spell collecting polite mumbles and fake-smile goodbyes - and not one taker for his cheesy offer of \"free drinks\" - he clearly looks out of sorts. He sulks for a while, with his head down, smokes three cigarettes.</p><p>It's getting on to 2am when he puts the good-mannered make-up back on, orders two vodka coolers and walks off looking to share them with someone, preferably someone already blind.</p><p>Soon after he spots a young woman - perhaps 18 years old - walking around without a clue, her eyes glassy and puffy, her lips swollen, hair in her face, looking here and there for her friends, looking like Bambi in a forest fire.</p><p>The Lone Ranger is now at her side. She says she's looking for friends, but one of them's gone off with some guy and the other one went to the bathroom and hasn't been seen since and no, no, no, she doesn't want a drink, she just wants to find her friends.</p><p>He moves on, the drinks going warm in his hands; she lifts her head and tries to get her bearings. She nods her head when I mention last week's announcement by the Centre Against Sexual Assault that large numbers of women are being drugged at nightclubs and later sexually assaulted, a dozen of them at or after leaving the casino precinct. She nods again when I mention the story from London about the development of a swizzle stick that - working something like a pregnancy test kit - changes color if your drink has been polluted.</p><p>The problem is she just about nods at anything I have to say - until it hits her that she, too, may need to find the bathroom and that maybe her friend is still there.</p><p>It takes a while, but I find the Lone Ranger, with another blind young woman. She's a rowdier drunk than the other girl. And so he finally gets to offload that vodka soda pop, 40 minutes after leaving his spot at the bar. She gets it down in big gulps, listens to him yabbering, then moves on, leaving him looking sour - only to perk up again. And that's when he goes to the dance floor, to try something else. He's got all night, right?</p><p>Fifty per cent of complaints of sexual assault are made a week after the assault; 10-50 per cent go unreported. Drugs used to spike drinks include Rohypnol (flunitrazepam) and the bodybuilders' steroid alternative GHB (gamma-hydroxybutyrate).

The source of the new fires is the negligence of people clearing land and we are afraid because of the El Nino effect we will face a new disaster.\"</p><p>Mr Sugandhy said Kalimantan and northern Sumatra had received little rainfall, and the severe economic crisis might encourage the overuse of natural resources, using fire as a cheap method of clearing land.</p><p>A new phase of the drought, the most severe to hit Indonesia in 50 years, would also have serious implications for food supplies as most crops are expected to be harvested late and in reduced volumes.</p><p>The massive fires that raged from July to November were mainly caused by land clearing for the expansion of palm oil and timber estates and the burning off of debris from logging concessions.</p><p>Mr Sugandhy said the fires this week were deliberately lit for land clearing. Satellite images show 40 fires on a nine-kilometre front inside the Bukit Suharto preservation area and smaller fires near villages.</p><p>Mr Byron said: \"The next three to four months are an absolute time bomb. During the 1982-83 El Nino year, three-quarters of the fire damage was done between January and April and these were the biggest fires ever recorded on earth.\"</p><p>In 1982-83 fires destroyed 3.7 million hectares of forest on Kalimantan. The fires last year destroyed an estimated 1.2 million hectares of tropical forest.</p><p>\"Whenever there is an El Nino you get a dry period, which extends into October, then you get some rain which is 30 to 40 per cent of normal falls, and then the drought comes back between January and April.</p><p>\"We know from Portuguese explorers' logs that there have been El Nino's in this region for at least 500 years because there are references to haze from peat swamps, but the difference now is large scale logging and plantation development.\"</p><p>He said land damaged by logging was eight to 10 times more likely to burn than virgin tropical forest, and fire was widely used for land clearing because it was about a quarter of the cost of any other method.</p><p>\"We are still traumatised by what happened several months ago and I am very worried about lung diseases caused by the smoke,\" said Wiwin, a teacher in Samarinda, near the new fire zone. Another resident, Didi, said: \"It hasn't rained in two months and I'm worried about the chance of the recurrence of the fires.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Fires unbeaten: A study of past El Nino years has shown that a second round of fires usually follows the inadequate monsoon rains, which will add to environmental devastation of blazes last year.

The Styx, if left alone and if there is no fire, will become pure rainforest over the next 100 years or so.</p><p> If a forest fire occurs the rainforest will be removed and eucalypts will dominate.</p><p> This is a natural process of change that requires expansive areas of wild forest in which the fire/eucalypt/rainforest dynamic can occur.</p><p> Small reserves of tall forests are pointless because they become ecological islands that are ultimately unsustainable.</p><p> Logging the Styx will not regenerate the forest. Rather, a monoculture of young eucalypt trees will be established that will never be allowed to grow old enough or big enough to ever resemble the old-growth forest, either visually or biologically. The rainforest timbers will not regenerate and this resource will be lost forever, largely to fuel forestry \"regeneration burns\".</p><p> The Styx does not need Forestry Tasmania to regenerate it.</p><p> It has done perfectly well since the last ice age.

Finally Mrs B declared, \"I think my husband must be the only man here not going to the semis.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"True,\" I replied. \"But I am going to the Australian Dance Awards tomorrow night!\"</p><p>A silence descended with the swiftness of nightfall in the Gobi desert. The clink of melting ice in the Esky suddenly sounded like icebergs shearing away from Antarctica; the barbecue like the roar of a forest fire. Men examined their beer glasses intently and five kilometres away, a dog howled.</p><p>\"Er ... I'm actually presenting one of the awards,\" I feebly countered. \"You know,</p><p>it's a part of my job type thing. It's an arts-related thing ... er ... go the Wallabies!\"</p><p>Minutes later, as we walked to the car,</p><p>I reflected on the average male response</p><p>to dance. Here they are, about to spend hundreds of dollars to watch 30 strapping men from private schools spend the best part of 80 minutes with their heads up each other's backsides, yet they think ballet is gay? Please. As it turned out, the awards night was far more thrilling than watching England bore France into submission on a rain-soaked sponsor's logo in Homebush. Extraordinary displays of athleticism, invention and prowess made the England First XV look like a slightly animated showroom of fridge-freezers. One performance by the Australian Dance Theatre was so physically demanding, I felt the need to consult an orthopedic surgeon after just watching it.</p><p>Don't get me wrong, I enjoy sport, too, but every now and then I find that too much sport is more than enough - \"now\" being 20 hours in any given day and \"then\" the remaining four. On the other hand, my father can watch tennis not only until the cows come home but also until they go out again the next day. He even used to watch the qualifying rounds of the Tasmanian Open from the first ball toss to the last backhand being forced long to mercifully end the whole tawdry affair. When the networks finally stopped broadcasting</p><p>it, they discovered he was the only viewer.</p><p>At Newcastle Boys High, sport was compulsory, a practice since banned by the UN on humanitarian grounds. Every boy had to enter at least one event in the athletics carnival, so I chose shotput. Immediately disqualified after my first throw, I had nonetheless entered and could repair to the canteen. The same draconian regime applied to the swimming carnival, where you had to enter at least one race - even if you couldn't swim. I wasn't a bad swimmer so it wasn't such an ordeal, although I was never fond of presenting my puny physique to the school's gaze as the PE teachers chipped the ice off the pool's surface. At least I didn't come last or sink to the bottom, like a few of the more stoutly chaps, from whence they were rescued by clutching onto the leaf skimmer.</p><p>I quickly realised it was the sort of school that didn't like people who used the term whence, so in second year I entered the javelin as well and did cross-country running because some idiot told me it was a mind game, before settling on tennis because (being a lefty) I had a decent serve out wide to the advantage court.</p><p>Ironically, my only major physical injury has come not through sporting endeavour but dancing. At the end of a long tour of a show, I was standing in the wings preparing for</p><p>a sketch - every sport of the 26th Olympiad presented as interpretative jazz ballet to the music of Cats. My how they laughed! The cue came and as I lifted onto my toes to spring gazelle-like onto the stage, my leg exploded with pain as if someone had hit me in the back of the calf with a cricket bat. Despite being unable to support my own weight,</p><p>I struggled through the routine, although admittedly the audience was puzzled by</p><p>the sight of a grown man in a flared Lycra unitard in obvious agony, limping heavily and falling over repeatedly. When the curtain came down, I was whisked off to casualty and spent the next two weeks on crutches. But I didn't miss a show - I was back on the horse (metaphorically) the next night. So cop that, you big girly rugger-bugger sissy-Marys!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yih17i03cw5t6us555</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2003</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P6W-1CK0-TXN5-R36W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"690\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2003 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"13\" month=\"12\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>December 13, 2003 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001615</classCode><className>SPORTS &amp;

Not one of the report's 51 recommendations deals with prescribed or controlled burning or any means of fuel reduction which reduces the intensity of a fire and makes firefighting easier, or even possible.</p><p>That is despite the fact 485 of more than 1200 submissions concern fuel reduction.</p><p>The commission, which has spent four months investigating the February 7 fires which killed 173 people, claims to have first dealt with issues relevant to this bushfire season and will address long-term changes before handing down its final report in July. But in a press release flagging future areas of interest, the commission makes no mention of fuel reduction, just building standards, bunkers, the electricity industry, and \"a range of other matters\".</p><p>The Orwellian language of the interim report, which rebadges \"evacuation\" as \"relocation\", hardly engenders confidence that people will be any safer in bushfire seasons to come.</p><p>To be fair, it may be that the commission is not copping out but buying time before tackling the controversial problem of fuel reduction and management of public land.</p><p>There is no shortage of insightful material in the submissions waiting to be addressed. The submission from the Institute of Foresters of Australia, for instance, is crisp, clear, informative and unemotional.</p><p>It charts the evolution of the \"deeply unsatisfactory\" bushfire situation in Victoria, especially over the past decade when there has been \"a political focus on expanding national parks and conservation reserves\" - now 52 per cent of Victoria's public lands.</p><p>There has been \"a profound change in management focus to meet more passive conservation aims [leading] to a loss of fire management expertise, greater restrictions to public access due to track closures and declining levels of maintenance, and a demonstrable reduction in the broadscale use of prescribed fire as a management tool to mitigate the impact of summer bushfires.</p><p>\"This combination of factors has allowed forest fuels to accumulate to an extent that has raised the intensity of summer bushfires and increasingly forced a greater reliance on emergency fire-fighting,\" the institute says.</p><p>\"This has occurred at a time when there has been an increasing development of housing in bushfire-prone areas both making the use of prescribed burning more difficult on adjacent public lands...\"</p><p>These professional foresters not only have university training in bushfire behaviour, fire suppression and prevention, and land use planning, but every day they are in the field working in forest, parks and plantation management roles, fighting fires and using prescribed burning to mitigate fire. As they put it: \"We know the business, from the sharp end.\"</p><p>Their submission points out that south-east Australia's flammable native forests and climate make it one of the most fire-prone areas in the world. Bushfires are inevitable, with \"high-intensity conflagrations every few years when dry fuels and rainfall deficits combine with days of high temperature and wind. This has been the case throughout our recorded history.\"</p><p>Refusing to perform adequate controlled burning in fire-prone landscapes \"inevitably results in heavy fuel accumulations that consign forests to a regime of periodic large, high intensity fire.\"</p><p>The foresters trace the history of fire politics from the 1920s when European ideas started subverting the Australian forestry practice of regularly using fire to \"clean up\" the forest floor and maintain a light fuel load as the \"key to controlling bushfires\".</p><p>Controlled burning during this period was haphazard. Then in 1939 came the Black Friday inferno which killed 71 Victorians.</p><p>Paradoxically, say the foresters, \"these fires heralded the beginning of a new era of forest fire management\" after the Stretton royal commission placing the blame squarely on \"the hand of man\", on poor land management and inadequate controlled burning.</p><p>Stretton's legacy was that Australian forestry moved to controlled burning rather than bushfire suppression to protect its forests. Foresters were responsible for almost all the state's forests and there was a \"healthy balance between expenditure on fire prevention activities in the off season against that spent on summer bushfire suppression\".</p><p>But the 1982 election of the Cain government in Victoria \"signalled the start of an enduring period of profound change which continues today\".</p><p>Successive state governments \"largely embraced the environmentalists' view that Victoria's forests needed to be 'saved' and that this would be achieved simply by changing public land tenure from state forest to national park\".</p><p>National Parks in Victoria increased by almost 30 per cent from 1998 to 2008. \"A substantial part of this expansion has had little or no rational conservation-based foundation, and has been undertaken simply to serve a political need to win the support of 'green' voters.\"</p><p>The upshot is that fire mitigation activities, such as controlled fuel reduction burning, have been neglected in favour of \"funding towards an emergency bushfire suppression model that we believe will always fail to justify its huge expense\".</p><p>Suppression is nigh on impossible with high intensity fires \"that are a direct consequence of inadequate fire prevention activities which over many years have allowed forest fuels to accumulate to high levels in much of the forest estate\".</p><p>This week's interim report has drawn criticism because it didn't identify scapegoats to crucify. Clearly mistakes were made that terrible day, but the fires were out of control, a perfect storm of weather and fuel loads pushing them at a speed and intensity that could not be stopped.</p><p>It was an impossible situation that should have been avoided. Prevention is always better than cure.</p><p>devinemiranda@hotmail.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUSTRATION: Ed Aragon</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-5qlsfwb72io1afelia5r</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7WDS-S841-2RR2-D02V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1017\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"08\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>August 20, 2009 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>VIC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents and Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Prevention</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Accidents and Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires/Black Sat Feb 7 09/Royal Commission</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Report</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Recommendation</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

This time they have no choice.</p><p> \"The only situation left for the people is to starve to death,\" said farmer Martin Bai examining his bare garden.</p><p> \"Areas where we normally migrate to are also affected now like Hagen, Wabag and Mendi.\"</p><p> The Tambul-Nebiliyer region tucked in the Western Highlands' south-western corner is one of the areas hardest-hit by the nationwide drought.</p><p> Continuing frosts have meant double trouble for the highlanders, killing what's left of their drought-ravaged crops.</p><p> The shrubs, casuarina, fir and banana trees that cover the mountains around Tambul are now drying to a copper colour.</p><p> A smoke haze blots out the sun as a massive forest fire sweeps up from Mt Giluwe to the south and smaller blazes rage through the mountains.</p><p> Rivers like Amboga near the Tambul township have fallen two metres over the last four months. Mountain streams, usually the source of water for drinking and cooking, are running at a trickle.</p><p> The black soil of the food gardens is now bare, with the exception of small patches of frost-burned cabbage and withered kaukau plants.</p><p> Douglas Lingawa, the district administrator, remembers the last major drought in 1972 when the Australians came to the rescue of the villagers.</p><p> Sacks of rice and cartons of tinned food were air-dropped onto old tyres and piles of dried grass in the village clearing.</p><p> Village chief Napa Nambo, now in his 80s, said the current drought and frost were the worst in living memory.</p><p> \"This is the worst one I've experienced and we are looking at a disaster,\" he said.</p><p> \"People are actually feeling the pinch of looking for food and they are starving now.\"</p><p> Mr Lingawa said the drought was the worst in 50 years. He said there was no starvation yet, but the food supply would not last much longer.</p><p> \"Food is left, but it's not that sufficient to hold a population ...,\" he said.</p><p> \"According to my predictions it would last for a month or so.\"</p><p> The Papua New Guinea government has so far contributed $\u00a0A22.8 million to drought and frost relief nationwide.

If you do, chances are the English-born, Massachusetts-based songwriter's passion for the game will dominate the conversation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> For instance, he seems as eager to play some of Australia's best courses in the next few weeks as he is about his solo tour, which begins in Melbourne on Thursday.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Three years after his last visit, Cole, who plays off a seven handicap, has brought his clubs as well as his guitar and plans to make good use of both.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>MATP</p></bodyText></section><p>\"Actually golf doesn't take up enough of my time,\" he says, revealing even more his love for the sport. Such is his dedication that he plans to play in the Massachusetts Amateur Championships next year.</p><p> To some it might seem an idyllic lifestyle, travelling the world hitting a few balls between shows. However, Cole fans will be more concerned with hearing him play songs from his fifth solo album, Music in a Foreign Language, than about the putt he sank on the 18th.</p><p> If they're lucky they will also hear highlights from his more illustrious period in the 1980s, when, with his band the Commotions, he scored hits such as Perfect Skin, Forest Fire and Brand New Friend.</p><p> Cole's blend of jangly pop tunes and English-lit sophistication was a refreshing antidote to the superficial pop alternatives of the time, but the band's reign lasted only five years before Cole upped sticks to New York and embarked on a solo career. That career has taken on a more folky, singer-songwriter hue.</p><p> What triggered his reinvention, he explains, was a folk festival he played in Belgium. \"It wasn't something I was used to but I immediately felt comfortable,\" he says. \"And the amazing thing is that folk people are a lot cooler than rock ones. Joan Baez is one of the coolest people I've ever met.\"</p><p> These days, Cole, 42, operates on a much smaller scale than in his '80s heyday, when in Australia he played to crowds of up to 25,000, but he has maintained a core audience through albums such as Don't Get Weird on Me, Babe (1991), Bad Vibes (1993) and Love Story (1995).</p><p> \"I became a one-man band to get myself back on my feet,\" he says, \"and I'm just about back on my feet now.\"</p><p> Cole's retreat to New York was brought about partly by the pressures of being a rock star. He says he regrets that at their peak he and the Commotions \"didn't have the time to enjoy it. We were trying to be like Talking Heads or something like that and it didn't make us happy. Mind you, Talking Heads weren't a happy band either.\"</p><p> Time can heal old wounds, of course, and there are rumours that the Commotions will reconvene to celebrate their 20th anniversary next year.</p><p> \"There are rumblings that we might drag ourselves out of the cobwebs to do a tour,\" Cole says.</p><p> \"Nothing is confirmed yet but we might do it if our combined beer bellies aren't too big to go on the road together. We've all emailed each other and nobody has actually said absolutely no. It could be exciting. These kinds of things, if you get it right it can be great, but if you get it wrong it could be awful.\"</p><p> Commotions or not, Cole appears to be happy with his lot. He moved recently from New York to a small town three hours away in Massachusetts. He prefers the quiet lifestyle there with his wife and two sons and he runs his professional life -- writing songs, booking studios, maintaining his website -- from a small office.</p><p> \"I have my golf clubs collection in one corner and my wife has a bit of an office in the other and my computer's in the middle,\" he says.</p><p> His computer also features as a golf aid. Some of his Australian golf matches were prompted by invites directed to his website.</p><p> \"I have tee times booked all over the place,\" he says eagerly.</p><p> Despite appearances to the contrary, not all of Cole's down time on this trip will be dedicated to golf. On December 10 he will address students at Griffith University on the Gold Coast on the nature of popular music.</p><p>Cole's Australian tour begins in Melbourne on Thursday and travels to Canberra, Byron Bay, Brisbane, Sydney, Adelaide and Fremantle.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS0312021015802191</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4B4G-H3S0-015G-P2JS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"686\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Australian</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"12\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>December 2, 2003 Tuesday All-round Country Edition</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000800</classCode><className>GOLF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U6L</classCode><className>MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC1</classCode><className>STRINGED INSTRUMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N711130MM</classCode><className>MUSIC GROUPS &amp;

The leader of the 28-million strong Muhammadiyah, Mr Amien Rais, said the fires, drought, economic crisis and fatal accidents of the past few months were a warning to both the Government and the community to \"repent\".</p><p>In a statement signed by religious leaders, Mr Rais said: \"We are calling on the Government to remember that power is a mandate from Allah that has to be accounted for. No matter how great and strong a power is, Allah will one day take it back.\"</p><p>The biggest disaster facing Indonesia was the complacency and arrogance of those in power, he said.</p><p>Government ministers responsible for the recentdisasters should resign and the Soeharto Government had to face the problems of corruption and collusion in its ownranks.</p><p>Mr Sarwono said Indonesia had no choice but to change its land-use policies, end slash and burn practices and the stop the abuse of political connections to flout environmental regulations.</p><p>Asked whether he was concerned that a repeat of this year's haze could threaten the Commonwealth Games in Kuala Lumpur next year, he said: \"Of course, we are very concerned. It is my job to stop the haze. If it happens all over again next year we are out of business as a nation.\"</p><p>Mr Sarwono was speaking at an extraordinary briefing for journalists by seven Indonesian ministers dealing with the fire crisis, in an attempt to arrest the damage to Indonesia's international image the haze crisis is causing.</p><p>Fire-fighting teams had put out scores of fires, he said, but fires burning in peat seams in Sumatra and Kalimantan would be difficult to extinguish and could burn for months.</p><p>On the economic front, the Central Bank moved in to halt the collapse of the rupiah yesterday morning when the currency fell to an all-time low of 3,855 to the US dollar, a loss of more than 50 per cent since mid-August.</p><p>The stock market also lost ground as brokers and economists predicted the rupiah could fall to the 4,000 mark, leaving scores of major Indonesian companies critically exposed on large US dollar debts.</p><p>There would be a certain economic slow-down and the prospect of politically sensitive inflation and unemployment as crop failures due to the drought coincided with the corporate financial crisis.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Illus: An Indonesian family geared up to deal with smoke in Jambi, Sumatra.

Among the popular destinations in the region for Australians, only Bali remains unaffected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The department this week discounted Australian press reports that Bali had been blanketed by smoke as a result of a \"forest fire\" out of control on the neighboring island of Lombok. The department says a grass fire on Lombok was put out by local authorities on Tuesday and, by Wednesday, Bali's skies were clear.</p><p>But Bali is about the only place in Indonesia where there's a blue sky. Plantation fires - believed deliberately lit by big-business operators clearing forest land - are out of control from Irian Jaya, on New Guinea island, to western Sumatra, 5000 kilometres away.</p><p>They have made travel in Indonesia outside Bali hazardous and uncertain. Domestic airline flights have been disrupted and several smaller regional airports, in both Indonesia and neighboring Malaysia, have been closed for varying periods.</p><p>In light of last Friday's air disaster in Sumatra, when a Garuda Airbus A300 crashed, killing 234 people, it is clear that flying the domestic airways in Indonesia is now more potentially dangerous than it already was. Though the Garuda crash may have been the result of confusion between the crew and air-traffic controllers, it probably would not have happened had thick smoke not been blanketing the area.</p><p>In Canberra, the Department of Foreign Affairs is taking about 600 calls a day from would-be travellers trying to find out which destinations are affected. The number to call is (02) 261 3305. There's also an Internet site at www.dfat.gov.au</p><p>By mid-week, the smoke haze was affecting almost every country in South-East Asia:</p><p>* THAILAND: the pall of smoke from Sumatra had begun moving into southern Thailand, and was beginning to affect resort towns, such as Phuket and Koh Samui. Rain this week cleared the air in Phuket but the Department of Foreign Affairs warned that this was only temporary and the area was expected to be increasingly affected.</p><p>* MALAYSIA: Kuala Lumpur airport this week became the first major airport in the region to be forced to close, shutting for an hour early Tuesday morning. Visibility in Kuala Lumpur at times has been down to a few metres.</p><p>With fires raging out of control on Borneo island, the Malaysian states of Sabah and Sarawak were also virtually off-limits to travellers, with Brunei also badly affected.</p><p>* SINGAPORE: Badly affected, though many of the thousands of Australians going there each week are only passing through on their way to somewhere else and can bunker down, while waiting for their connecting flights, in the air-conditioning at Changi Airport. So far, flight operations at Changi haven't been seriously affected.</p><p>* INDONESIA: Sumatra - forget it. Virtually the whole island is enveloped by the smoke, which means that some of Indonesia's most beautiful destinations, such as Lake Toba in central Sumatra, can't be reached.</p><p>The haze is floating east as far as western Java, which means the capital, Jakarta, is another major city badly affected. Smoke was also hanging over Irian Jaya, extending west to some of the islands between Bali and Irian Jaya, though these areas are well off the beaten track for Western tourists.</p><p>* PHILIPPINES: Most of the Philippines have escaped the worst of the haze, though there were reports this week that the south-west of the country, including the city of Zamboanga on Davao Island, were now being affected. By mid-week, the Department of Foreign Affairs hadn't been able to verify these reports.</p><p>Write to: Clive Dorman, Traveller's Check, The Age, 250 Spencer Street, Melbourne 3000, or fax (03) 9601 2332.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NRD0-TXN5-S198-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yhv1svu39417jkxg5us</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1997</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 4, 1997 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N928000CC</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS &amp;

The company's mission: to open a small human settlement on Mars within 20 years or so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It may sound far-fetched. The company's initial plans are a lot more terrestrial, such as developing a 2250m2 replica of a Mars settlement on Earth, then charging tourists admission. But the people behind the venture are quite serious, as serious as the $A33 million they want to raise from investors.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>AP</p></bodyText></section><p>CEO Mark Homnick, a former manager for Intel Corp who has registered 4Frontiers in Florida, says he has already raised \"a couple million\" from people he won't name. He hopes for an initial public offering within five years.</p><p>That still leaves a lot of questions: Why should people live on Mars? If it's going to be done, should a private enterprise engage in what would be one of humanity's defining moments? Besides, what's in it for investors?</p><p>Homnick and his co-founders -- a long-time Mars aficionado named Bruce Mackenzie and a 25-year-old Massachusetts Institute of Technology masters student, Joseph Palaia -- are ready with several answers.</p><p>First, they contend, humans need a new frontier to explore, with all the intellectual and engineering challenges that creating a home on Mars would present. Also, who knows the fate of Earth? Will we meet an early end at the hands of an asteroid or from warfare, disease or some other catastrophe?</p><p>In that case, we'd be glad civilisation had been preserved by some colonists on Mars and perhaps elsewhere in the galaxy, if all goes well on the red planet. That broader vision of space settlement gives 4Frontiers its name: the frontiers being the Earth, the moon, Mars and the asteroids.</p><p>\"It's the nature of life -- life tries to expand and tries to adapt,\" said Mackenzie. \"If there's a forest fire in one valley, then all of the organisms in the next valley will slowly creep over the ridge and repopulate that valley. Any species that don't do it eventually die out.\"</p><p>Going to space, he believes, is as if \"all of Earth's life, acting together, is trying to get into the next valley\". \"And the only way we can do it is by building rockets.\"</p><p>Mackenzie, a software developer, has devoted much of his energy to a non-profit group called the Mars Foundation, which aims to advance knowledge about how to colonise the planet. But he decided a private venture such as 4Frontiers also would be necessary to drive things forward.</p><p>Although US President George W. Bush has called for a manned mission to Mars, Mackenzie believes big bureaucracies might never get the job done right.</p><p>\"It's better to have lots of groups out there, all trying things,\" Mackenzie said.</p><p>Space is no longer solely the province of earnest astronauts with crew cuts and government-issued uniforms. Space tourism is on the verge of becoming big business. Space Adventures Ltd of Arlington, Virginia, has brokered $A26 million trips for the wealthy on Russian rockets and is taking deposits for $131 million fly-bys of the far side of the moon. For a lot less money, you can sign up for a quick blast into zero gravity.</p><p>In comparison, 4Frontiers' ultimate goal of an extended stay on Mars is extreme.</p><p>It would take months to get there. Once there, you couldn't kick off your shoes and dig your toes into the sand. Life would transpire in an enclosed space with pumped-in air (unless Martian settlers could pull off the even more speculative feat of \"terraforming\" the planet by changing its toxic atmosphere). Venturing outside would require sealed suits.</p><p>To begin, 4Frontiers plans to gather patents and engineering ideas that would enable a small crew to land on Mars with home-building materials and the manufacturing capability to keep expanding the settlement. The key would be to find ways to miniaturise industrial processes, such as making plastic or steel, and methods for exploiting Martian resources, such as the carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, iron in the dirt or the water bound up in Martian ice.</p><p>As the company gains expertise, it expects to sell consulting services to aerospace companies or NASA. It envisions getting work designing Mars sets for movies and Mars rides for amusement parks. Meanwhile, it plans to construct a mock-up of its Mars home and begin selling tickets to it by 2007. Possible sites in Colorado, Florida and New Mexico are being considered.</p><p>A business plan estimates these projects would bring in $A44 million in revenue in 2010.</p><p>Even if that flies, then what? A $44 million company probably isn't in a great position to begin launching rockets. Homnick says 4Frontiers would probably \"stay incremental\" through the early 2010s, perhaps getting involved in robotic surveys of Mars or asteroid mining.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-MER0509301025074116</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HOBARTMERCURYLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4H7V-HG70-015H-90M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"787\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Hobart Mercury (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>September 30, 2005 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>INTEL CORP\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>MASSACHUSETTS INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>INTC (NASDAQ)\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>NAICS334413 SEMICONDUCTOR &amp;

The March collapse of brokerage Bear Stearns, a key player in the business of packaging dicey loans for sale to investors, was the kind of high-profile calamity that historically has marked the end of financial crises.</p><p>\"It's all part of the whole unravelling of global credit markets,\" said Johnathan Pain of HFA Asset Management.</p><p>\"What I am hearing is the FDIC is ringing up retired staff and asking them to come back to work because they are expecting a huge number of bank failures this year and there aren't enough regulators.\"</p><p>The collapse of IndyMac follows a recent warning by Jamie Dimon, chief executive of JP Morgan Chase, that credit markets could deteriorate further and even Wall Street investment banks should not be considered too big to fail.</p><p>Australian banks also face problems, with CBA and St George last week raising rates to cover the cost of funds and NAB saying further provisions may be needed on top of the $US1.1 billion it has already set aside for collateral debt obligations.</p><p>Since the subprime crisis emerged in the US late last year, about $US400 billion in loans have been written off globally, and leading market players are now predicting the final figure could pass $US1 trillion.</p><p>\"The subprime virus has grown and mutated,\" Mr Pain said.</p><p>\"It started in the US, then crossed the Atlantic and hit Ireland, hit the UK and hit Spain. It then travelled across the world and hit New Zealand. There is no way Australia is not going to get hit.\"</p><p>Before Wall Street closed on Friday night, panicked investors pushed US mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to the brink as concerns emerged that rising defaults would drain their reserves and force a government takeover.</p><p>The two government-chartered, shareholder-owned giants underpin some $US5 trillion in home loans, or about one in every two US mortgages.</p><p>The Dow Jones fell sharply during Friday's session until Reuters reported (later withdrawn) that Freddie Mac would make use of the discount lending window that allowed many institutional banks to survive the first round of the credit crunch.</p><p>Charles Schwab &amp; Co analyst Brad Sorenson said the companies \"affect a much wider swathe of the economy than just a typical financial institution, such as Bear Stearns\", and that any hint of failure would be \"devastating to the US and indeed the global, financial markets\".</p><p>Fears that either of the mortgage giants would require a government bailout crossed the Atlantic to help drive the British sharemarket into bear territory.</p><p>Declines in the value of Britain's top 100 companies reached more than 20% since their peak, heralding sustained selling not seen since the stockmarket collapse of 2003.</p><p>\"The movement . . . was a clear indication that we haven't reached the bottom and the bears are still fully in control,\" said Angus Campbell, head of sales at British-based Capital Spreads.</p><p>AMP Capital Investors chief economist Shane Oliver said the Australian market was likely to open up to 100 points lower as news of IndyMac's collapse dragged down financial stocks. He also said resource stocks could eventually get hit as economic growth of the commodity-hungry developing world slowed, taking the shine off recent record coal and iron ore prices.</p><p>IndyMac, America's second-biggest independent mortgage bank, with $US32 billion of assets, is the second-biggest bank to go under, after Continental Illinois National Bank &amp; Trust - with $US40 billion of assets - in 1984.</p><p>IndyMac is the fifth US bank to fail this year. -- With NEW YORK TIMES, WASHINGTON POST, BLOOMBERG</p><p>Another one bites the dust</p><p>\u00b7 IndyMac was America's second-largest independent mortgage provider.</p><p>\u00b7 It is the fifth US bank to fail this year.</p><p>\u00b7 It will cost up to $US8 billion to revive the retail bank as a new government entity.</p><p>\u00b7 It racked up almost $900 million in losses as house prices tumbled.</p><p>\u00b7 Concerns about mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac weighed heavily on Wall Street during Friday trade and drove the FTSE into official bear territory.</p><p>\u00b7 About $US400 billion in loans have been written off since the subprime crisis emerged in the US late last year.

Addressing a news conference on the sidelines of the IMFWorld Bank annual meeting in Hong Kong, Mr Wolfensohn said: \"We are ready to come in in any way on an emergency basis if funding were the reason for the problem.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> He said the haze, blamed on farmers felling and burning trees to cultivate their land in Indonesia, was \"terrible\", \"tragic\" and \"dreadful\". \"We are ready to come in with money if it is necessary, but money does not appear to be a problem.

But he admitted experts were at a loss.</p><p> \"The question is how to put it out and the answer is we don't know,\" he said.</p><p>Indonesian government officials said President Suharto had described the haze as a national disaster and urged that efforts be stepped up to extinguish the fires.</p><p> Sources in Jakarta, citing satellite photographs, said between 600,000 and 800,000 hectares of Indonesia forest and plantation had been hit by the fires.</p><p> Pollution expert Anthony Hedley, of Hong Kong University, warned that thousands of people could be killed by the smog which also threatened crops and stock.</p><p> \"It's an absolute disaster in health terms,\" he said. \"It's not stretching imagination too far to say if you immerse people in this tremendous pollution . . .</p><p>then I think there is nothing more predictable than a substantial number of premature deaths. There are going to be tens of thousands of illnesses and I don't think we've seen the half of it.\"</p><p> Professor Hedley said health effects of the haze could include chronic bronchitis, emphysema, diseases of blood vessels in the head and lung and cardiovascular disease.</p><p> Other specialists said the haze was blocking sunlight, starving plants and reducing temperatures amid a drought, a combination of factors which could devastate food supplies.</p><p> \"It will destroy the ecology of the region,\" said Fang Ming, senior climatology program manager at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.</p><p>\"Insects, animals and vegetation alike will be largely destroyed.\"\u00a0 The situation deteriorated in the worst hit area yesterday, the Malaysian State of Sarawak, Borneo, where the capital, Kuching, was virtually cut off from the world after shipping and air traffic were disrupted by poor visibility.</p><p> In The Philippines, the haze reduced visibility in the southern cities of Puerto Princesa, capital of the western island of Palawan, and Zamboanga.</p><p> In Tokyo, the Japanese Government said it was considering sending doctors and forest fire experts, while the US and Canadian embassies in Kuala Lumpur announced partial evacuations.</p><p>Malaysia's Star newspaper carried reports that tourists were cancelling holidays to the region while Thai officials were forced to close Trang airport in the country's south amid growing fears there that the lucrative tourist industry would suffer further harm.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THEAUS-AUS9709261006234159</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEAUSTRALIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:457Y-MH30-0197-51H7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244777</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"598\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>THE AUSTRALIAN</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>September 26, 1997, Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>SCIENCE &amp;

Deals are made and alliances forged at prayer sessions around Washington.</p><p>Political redemption also comes through Jesus.</p><p>The disgraced <person><nameText>Bill Clinton </nameText></person>prayed with Billy Graham while others go to Chuck Colson, the Watergate jailbird who became America's most celebrated evangelist. These men are known around the world.</p><p>But author and academic Jeff Sharlet says they do not have the clout or connections of Doug Coe, the leader of a secretive fundamentalist group known simply as the Family.</p><p>That is a big call given that Coe is ``off the radar'' and essentially invisible as a mover and shaker. Although the organisation has been around since 1935, he is best known as the organiser of the National Prayer Breakfast, held in Washington each February.</p><p>But Sharlet's expose, which combines investigative journalism and history, is intriguing, startling and ultimately convincing.</p><p>Coe and his followers are ``avant-garde'' fundamentalists who target Washington's elites by setting up prayer cells around congressmen and generals. There are no passwords or secret handshakes but members are discreet and told not to commit deliberations or deals to paper.</p><p>The network extends to pro-American foreign leaders, some of them dictators. The late Indonesian president Suharto and Somalia's bloodthirsty strongman Siad Barre were ``brothers'' of the Family. They prayed with congressmen, oilmen and arms dealers. Later some lucrative business was done.</p><p>The scary part is that Coe admires the leadership models of Adolf Hitler, Mao Zedong and even Osama bin Laden, who built disciplined organisations around a fanatical core.</p><p>There is, Sharlet writes, something disturbing about a ministry which ignores traditional Christian teaching and which celebrates power for the powerful. Domestically, the ministry works chiefly with conservative Republicans, but senior Democrats and even Catholics are within its orbit.</p><p><person><nameText>Hillary Clinton </nameText></person>is regarded as a ``fellow traveller'' of the organisation and attends Coe's weekly Senate prayer breakfasts.</p><p>Al Gore also counts Coe as a friend.</p><p>George W. Bush is not a member, but he was famously ``born-again'' at a prayer group set up by the Family.</p><p>As an investigator, Sharlet is first-rate. Much of the material here comes from interviews and a treasure-trove of confidential documents. He managed to infiltrate the Family on its ground floor by gaining admission to Ivanwald -- a house in Arlington, Virginia, where some of the next generation of cadres is schooled. As a part-Jewish New Yorker, Sharlet was an unlikely recruit among a crew of preppy, athletic young devotees who spend their time praying and playing endless scratch games of basketball.</p><p>The author is fascinated by a 1989 Coe speech in which the minister admired the fanaticism of Maoist Red Guards who were prepared to kill their parents rather than betray the cause.</p><p>It is this that sets the Family apart from mainstream conservative groups -- such as the Southern Baptist Convention -- which focus on opposing abortion, gay marriage and gun control. Coe's followers, writes Sharlet, broadly support these stances but their eyes are on the big prize, a ``world government under God''.</p><p>Should anyone be worried about congressmen, judges and mayors who meet in prayer cells?</p><p>Sharlet says it does matter and points to what the organisation has achieved since it was founded by Norwegian immigrant Abraham Vereide in Seattle in 1935.</p><p>Then it was called the Fellowship and it was an alliance of conservatives opposed to communism and labour unions. By 1944 Vereide's prayer groups involved a third of the members of Congress. During the Eisenhower presidency, he started the National Prayer Breakfast and expanded his influence into the military and the CIA. During the 1950s, Vereide worked with the Pentagon and the CIA on a worldwide anti-communism propaganda campaign and he supported US involvement in Vietnam.</p><p>Coe took over in the late 1960s and decided to go underground, as he ``crafted ever more complex hierarchies behind the scenes''.</p><p>Sharlet is not an angry liberal and the tone of the book is balanced, reasonable and often good humoured.</p><p>The author likes the young men at Ivanwald even as he wonders why the handsome young heterosexuals such as ``Jeff C'' were so overdosed on Jesus and running they had no time for women.</p><p>In some ways Sharlet admires fundamentalism and recognises its place in American history -- from the Mayflower to the ``Great Awakening'' of preacher Jonathan Edwards in 1735 and on to Bill Graham and the current flock of televangelists.</p><p>And he recognises its resilience, noting that the scandals surrounding Ted Haggard and Jimmy Swaggart strengthen the faithful in a way that a forest fire clears the underbrush.</p><p>But his exasperation rises when he contemplates how Suharto and other dictators benefited from their Family connections. In 1970, Suharto had a meeting with a Senate prayer group attended by secretary of defence Melvin Laird. Over the next two decades, Family-linked congressmen backed arms sales to Indonesia even as its military invaded East Timor and slaughtered its civilians. This, Sharlet writes, made them ``brothers in blood''.</p><p>It is unlikely that this book will cause any great concern in America's power elite.</p><p>The author, who is editor of TheRealer.org, first wrote about Ivanwald in 2003 for Harper's magazine and there have been a smattering of articles about Coe and Vereide in newspapers over the years.</p><p>But it will give outsiders a better picture of US fundamentalism in its most pure and disturbing form.</p><p>The Family: Power, Politics and Fundamentalism's Shadow Elite</p><p>by Jeff Sharlet (UQP, $34.95).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML-20080531-1-M23-675922</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4SMN-16M0-TX5N-00GV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"960\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - First with the news Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"05\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>May 31, 2008 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp;

This is one occasion that the stewards believe they should defend the licensed people under their charge and accordingly they wish to place on record that no evidence was uncovered which would even in the slightest way suggest that the Hong Kong Mile</p><p>was subject to any corrupt practices.\"</p><p>Now, in due deference to Schreck and his panel, it is patently clear that yesterday's inquiry would not have even got off the ground had it not been for \"pressure from the press\".</p><p>As misguided or naive as the writer of the original article that led to what became a veritable furore might have been, Schreck had no alternative but to open an official inquiry once the local press in Hong Kong got hold of it.</p><p>It is just as obvious now that by finding Childs was not guilty of any dishonest practice but slamming him with the maximum fine, that the stewards were looking for a scapegoat to stem what had become a forest fire of innuendo in Hong Kong.</p><p>After many sensational rorts in Hong Kong racing over the years before the end of British rule, some of them involving Australians, the Hong Kong Jockey Club, is particularly sensitive of its image.</p><p>The HKJC's international race day has developed into one of the great race meetings in the world.</p><p>So, the merest suggestion in the context of the offending article - what were really nothing more than a couple of throw-away paragraphs - was inevitably going to bear the brunt of officialdom.</p><p>As well as questioning Childs and Justin Sheehan, four other jockeys who rode in the race and Australian trainer David Hayes, the stewards reported they had \"looked carefully\" at the five 1600-metre runs of Adam this year.</p><p>They noted the consistent manner in which Adam had been ridden and said his run in the Hong Kong Mile at Sha Tin had fitted \"perfectly into that pattern\".</p><p>Childs told the inquiry he had been instructed, if possible, to ride Sunline somewhere just off the pace as it was anticipated the race would be run at a fast pace from the outset and that some of those horses drawn inside Sunline would go forward.</p><p>But because of the manner in which the race was run in the early stages, Childs said he elected to go forward and lead.</p><p>Childs told the stewards he did not agree that he made the comments attributed to him in the Sydney Morning Herald although he said he had an off-the-record social conversation with a Melbourne journalist and two other people who were, at the time, not known to him.</p><p>There is no doubt that in future the old wartime maxim \"loose lips sink ships\" will become Childs' motto.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8B-RM70-TXN5-S0NY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yicvsx9bkgh062751i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2000</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"634\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2000 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"12\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>December 30, 2000 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Hong Kong</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>People/Name/Childs/Greg/Jockey</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Sport/Turf/Jockeys</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Inquiry</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000722</classCode><className>FINES &amp;

Jack Rush, QC, counsel assisting the commission, also gave an indication of how indefensible when he said the blazes probably reached an intensity of 100,000 kilowatts per square metre. The maximum that a forest fire can be controlled is about 4000 kilowatts per square metre. Even in the glory of a Melbourne autumn, the traces of smoke were still in the air from the burning off of more than 3000 hectares on the city fringes in the past week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2 RICHARD Pratt, billionaire businessman, arts patron, philanthropist, Carlton Football Club tragic, and price-fixer, is close to death. Pratt, 74, was diagnosed with prostate cancer in 2007, but his health recently deteriorated dramatically. Prominent Australians, including Premier John Brumby, who described him as a quot;great Australianquot;, this week paid tribute to Pratt. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has criminal charges pending against the businessman. However, his lawyer Leon Zwier said Pratt did not want the charges dropped because he was dying, but because he believed he was innocent.</p><p>3 IT'S the word that dares not speak its name, at least to the Prime Minister. This week Kevin Rudd said he believed it was inevitable Australia would enter a recession. Reserve Bank governor Glenn Stevens said we were already there. quot;I think the reasonable person, looking at all the information available now, would come to the conclusion that the Australian economy, too, is in recession,quot; Stevens said. The International Monetary Fund agreed. However, in the same week came news that the global financial crisis may be eased by Da Vinci Code author Dan Brown. His latest book, The Lost Symbol, is due out this year. It may be an economic stimulus and reading non-stimulant all at the same time.</p><p>4 WHILE attack and counter-attack were launched over Australia's border protection policy, the immediate fate of asylum seekers from the boat that exploded last week was decided by a simple matter of geography. The Age reported that those who were taken from their sinking boat to the oil rig Front Puffin cannot apply for refugee status because the rig is in territory excised from Australia. Those who were taken to Darwin can apply for refugee status and appeal if their application is rejected. Another boat of asylum seekers was intercepted during the week off Western Australia, and another was being tracked by the navy heading towards the coast.</p><p>5 MELBOURNE is booming. In fact, it is experiencing the largest urban growth ever seen in this country. In the past two years, the city's population has risen almost 150,000, putting it on track to hit 4million by year's end. The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in figures released this week, said most of the growth had occurred on the city's fringes, with Wyndham leading the way.</p><p>6 THE civil war in Sri Lanka between Tamil Tiger rebels and the Government was heading for a showdown that many observers believe could end in widespread bloodshed. The Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam this week ignored an ultimatum to surrender, thereby triggering a push by government forces to defeat them. The United Nations estimates that 4500 civilians have died in fighting in the past three months.</p><p>7 TWELVE months ago, Australia's best and brightest descended on Canberra to cook up a storm of ideas as part of Kevin Rudd's 2020 summit. This week, of the 962 ideas to emerge, nine were given Government blessing. These were: a) quot;golden gurusquot; as workplace mentors; b) teams of civilians to respond to overseas emergencies; c) an Australia-Asia Endeavour Awards Scheme; d) an ABC children's channel; e) a round table of business and school connections; f) a carbon challenge initiative; g) a broadband network involving training and universities; h) an indigenous cultural centre; and i) $50 million for bionic eye research.</p><p>8 LAST week, US President Barack Obama referred to Bush administration memos detailing CIA interrogation measures as reflecting an America that had lost its quot;moral bearingsquot;. This week, he left open the door that those in the previous administration who approved such torture may be liable to prosecution. Attorney-General Eric Holder is investigating. A congressional inquiry may also be established. Mr Obama has said the CIA agents who did the torture, in effect those who were following White House orders, would not be held accountable.</p><p>9 TEN former directors and executives of James Hardie were found guilty of having broken the law by making misleading statements about the adequacy of a compensation trust fund for victims of asbestos-related illness. Justice Ian Gzell, in the NSW Supreme Court also found that James Hardie itself was guilty of misleading conduct. The guilty, including former James Hardie chairwoman Meredith Hellicar, face heavy fines and bans from serving on company boards. It is believed Hellicar and others will appeal.</p><p>10 THEIR armies were defeated, but their love was unconquered. The couple were Marc Antony and Cleopatra, who more than 2000 years ago killed themselves to avoid Roman capture. William Shakespeare turned their lives into a tragic love story wrapped in the cloaks of empire. At play's end Octavius says: quot;She shall be buried by her Antony/No grave upon the earth shall clip in it/A pair so famous.quot; This week their final resting place, which has been lost under the sands of time, may be nearer to revelation. Zahi Hawass, general secretary of Egypt's Supreme Council of Antiquities, claimed that the Taposiris Magna temple, 50 kilometres from Alexandria, could be the site.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-5oxofdqw7pk333od55x</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VHV-6JM1-2RR2-D02W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"970\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>April 25, 2009 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>STX001457</classCode><className>RECESSION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001779</classCode><className>URBANIZATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000297</classCode><className>CITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000300</classCode><className>CITY LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

Many more who had been touched by the tragedy travelled to the timber town for the funeral.</p><p>Deborah Stallard, 49, was washed off rocks by a \"king\" wave while on an Easter fishing trip to remote Black Point, 30km southeast of Augusta.</p><p> Andrew Stallard, 19, jumped in to save his mother, followed quickly by his 25-year-old brother, Paul, while their father, Ron, 57, tried to get them all to safety using rope and driftwood.</p><p> Only the bodies of Mrs Stallard and Andrew have been recovered.</p><p> Yesterday the tiny wooden Catholic Church of St Thomas More at Nannup was filled with family and friends and hundreds more gathered outside for funeral services for Mrs Stallard and Andrew and a memorial service for Paul.</p><p> The town was eerily silent with main street shops and businesses closed as a mark of respect, and a sprinkling of white ash from a big forest fire fell on the congregation.</p><p> Father Matt McPhee said the community would never forget the brothers' sacrifice for their mother.</p><p> In a eulogy for Mrs Stallard, lifelong friend Julie McDonald said: \"Deb loved being with her family and friends. She had a special gift of making people feel loved. She radiated happiness and love and</p><p>realised her dream of having a large family. They were her pride and joy.\"</p><p> Sarne Mellema described his friend Andrew as a free spirit with a unique sense. Cousin Sarah Stallard said Andrew was the kindest person she knew. Brett Heffernan said his longtime mate, Paul, was a dedi cated family man and a good friend -- \"more like a brother\" -- who died a hero.</p><p> The two young men had driven home for Easter from Perth where Andrew was a marine biology student at the University of WA and his brother had taken time out from his university studies to work for a steel company.</p><p> Dozens of people have signed a condolence book.</p><p> One wrote simply: \"Deb was an Angel on Earth.\" Another said the writer would always remember Mrs Stallard's smile and kindness, and Paul and Andrew as very special people whose lives set a wonderful example.</p><p> Shire president Barbara Dunnet, a close friend of the family, said the town was stunned as news of the tragedy spread. \"People couldn't believe what had happened,\" she said. \"We were numb. Then everyone started bonding together. They became tight-knit and wrapped around the family.</p><p> \"Some people still can't talk about it and don't sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night wondering why it happened and how shocking it all is.\"</p><p> Mrs Dunnet said Mrs Stallard had been \"an integral part of the community . . . in occasional care for young children, scouts, guides, the historical society . . . so well respected that some people would not leave their children with anyone else but her\".</p><p> She added: \"Some people called her the second Mother Theresa. They thought she was a saint. Bringing up seven children never fazed her. She was as steady as a rock. Her family was everything to her. It was all she ever wanted.\"</p><p> Mrs Stallard's brother-in-law Geoff has become the family spokesman. He described this week how the family was still in shock and had searched the coast every day, living in hope that Paul's body could be found before the funeral.</p><p> \"It's a thing in you that refuses to accept we are not going to find Paul and bring him back,\" he said. \"You go down to Black Point believing that you are going to bring him back, but the days end in tears.</p><p> \"The support from people in the town, their moral support and simply being there if you want them, has been remarkable.</p><p> \"The family is binding together well. There will never be a closure to this. There will only be another day, another stage, that we will all have to live through.\"</p><p>\u00a0 *\u00a0 A trust fund set up by the local council to help the family cover the funeral costs has already reached $5000. It remains open.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">PSUNTI-SDT0305042007339119</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THESUNDAYTIMESLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:48H9-14H0-015H-D0K6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244821</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"693\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Sunday Times (Perth, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"05\" year=\"2003\"><dateText>May 4, 2003 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000454</classCode><className>DEATH NOTICES &amp; OBITUARIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS69</classCode><className>GRIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000453</classCode><className>DEATH &amp; DYING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST00099LP</classCode><className>CHRISTIANS &amp; CHRISTIANITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D76Q</classCode><className>MARINE BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000A0RH</classCode><className>CATHOLICS &amp; CATHOLICISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"66\"><classCode>ST000D43B</classCode><className>BUSINESS CLOSINGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000973</classCode><className>IRON &amp; STEEL INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GX017</classCode><className>PERTH, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GS004</classCode><className>WESTERN AUSTRALIA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

gets the gobbledegook he is seeking</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speeches of Premier David Bartlett often contain comments along the lines of ``People in the street tell me . . .'' -- and what they tell him is often at odds with the official advice he has been given.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">By taking unrepresentative comments out of context, properly prepared science-based evidence can be wiped away.</p><p>An example of this is in John Rich's article `Home-grown gobbledegook' (Over the Fence, April 17).</p><p>We cannot tell the size or representative nature of his sample, but we do know his question: would people be prepared to pay more for organic produce?</p><p>To ensure he gets the ``no'' answer, he paints a picture of poor-quality fruit and vegetables.</p><p>This not only elicits the answer he is after; it gives readers of Tasmanian Country the impression that organic food is not as good for you as non-organic produce.</p><p>Through many properly conducted studies worldwide, this has been found to be far from the case.</p><p>Furthermore, the idea of poor-looking organic fruit and vegetables is now out of date.</p><p>Indeed, the picture in the article shows how organically produced vegetables can look.</p><p>Rich's main message is that consumers will continue to need to buy fruit and vegetables -- and this is true.</p><p>The demand for organic food is still growing, and Tasmania is the best place to produce it.</p><p>JIM ROSSITER</p><p>convener</p><p>Organics Tasmania</p><p>Official view on burning issue</p><p>I would like to clarify several points about fire management in David Byard's article `Grasp this burning issue' (Chews the Fat, April 24).</p><p>The onset of climate change, higher temperatures and drier conditions does require new ways of thinking so that the risk of bushfire continues to be properly managed.</p><p>Recognising that bushfires are likely to become more frequent in a warmer climate, the Tasmanian Government announced in 2007 a statewide strategic fuel-reduction burning program to reduce bush fuel loads and, in turn, to reduce the risk to lives and property posed by uncontrolled bushfires.</p><p>Under this initiative, the state's three fire-fighting agencies -- Forestry Tasmania, the Parks and Wildlife Service, and the Tasmanian Fire Service -- are using their combined expertise to undertake strategic fuel-reduction burns across the state.</p><p>This autumn, the three agencies have been individually undertaking scheduled burns.</p><p>Last week, the first of the co-operative burns was completed at Lake Leake on the East Coast.</p><p>The objective of that burn was to create areas of bush with low fuel loads to help prevent large bushfires.</p><p>Further burns are scheduled as weather conditions permit.</p><p>We accept that fuel management is a fundamental responsibility of all land managers, and it assists in reducing the potential for damaging bushfires.</p><p>Indeed, the Parks and Wildlife Service is endeavouring to do more burning than it has in the past.</p><p>It must be understood, however, that fuel-reduction burning does not solve the problem of wildfires by itself, but it does make controlling and extinguishing wildfires easier.</p><p>Yes, planning fuel-reduction burns is a process that should consider environmental and social impacts, such as smoke impacts on communities.</p><p>Proper planning for burns does take time and we are working hard to streamline our planning processes.</p><p>However, as a community, and from the legal aspect, we have a lot of expectations and obligations that cannot be ignored.</p><p>Finally, it must be remembered that fuel-reduction burning is not the only factor to consider in regard to the safety of communities during bushfires.</p><p>We have seen only recently in Victoria the disastrous implications that extremely severe fire weather can have on communities.</p><p>That and other factors will no doubt be carefully considered as we try to better manage this risk.</p><p>PETER MOONEY</p><p>general manager</p><p>Tasmania Parks and Wildlife Service</p><p>Put metal in roadside fences</p><p>The January Epping Forest fire (`Sparks over fence fire claim, April 24) clearly demonstrates that roadside fencing built with treated pine strainer assemblies, posts and droppers can be totally destroyed by fire.</p><p>This allows stock to escape on to roads, thus creating a traffic hazard.</p><p>The use of metal strainer assemblies and droppers and making at least every second post metal -- while not entirely solving the problem -- would result in most fencing remaining stock-proof after fire.</p><p>It is surprising that many new roadside fences on the East Tamar Highway reconstruction project still have treated pine strainers and posts.</p><p>Property owners should insist that all replacement roadside fencing be constructed using metal strainer assemblies and droppers and with at least every second post being metal.</p><p>LINDSAY MILLAR</p><p>Hillwood</p><p>We can still let nature save us</p><p>Why is Prime Minister Kevin Rudd focusing on an industrial-dream version of ``carbon capture and storage'' (CCS) to tackle our carbon emissions problem when the most effective and efficient system already exists in nature: trees and plants?</p><p>Timber companies cutting down our forests through the industrial age have caused the climate change crisis by depleting the natural CCS system.</p><p>For this, the timber industry should be held entirely legally and financially accountable.</p><p>And it should be made to pay in full for the remedy.</p><p>To think that, somehow, another (so far unrealised) man-made industry could do any better, or even anywhere near as well, as nature is ridiculous.</p><p>The concept toys with our very existence on this planet.</p><p>It can only be considered in the way we think about that other fairytale -- ``clean coal''.</p><p>Perhaps we can all now look forward to living in gingerbread houses with Hansel and Gretel.</p><p>Mr Rudd, get real, for goodness sake.</p><p>The simple way to achieve emissions reduction through CCS is to protect what forests we have left and plant more trees elsewhere.</p><p>Go for a drive just about anywhere in country Australia and you will see cleared paddock after cleared paddock, areas that were once treed.</p><p>Just have a look at the old photos on the walls of our country pubs.</p><p>RUSSELL LANGFIELD</p><p>Kimberley</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

A spokesman for ACT Policing said yesterday the report was received on Tuesday morning but luckily the suspicious character with a gun turned out to be only a person spraying weeds on the reserve with a spray gun. \"We get lots of things where people are ringing up and saying there is suspicious activity and we respond and we find out that it's, after all, something quite legitimate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It's just a standard thing that we do,\" the spokesman said. The area was locked down for less than 15 minutes, he said. \"When [police] arrived they stopped access for about 14 minutes until we found the guys who were spraying the weeds and that was the end of it,\" he said.</p><p>Fighting-fit firies THERE is no doubt the 50 ACT Rural Fire Service members who have been sent to battle the forest fire near Tumut are among the fittest in the territory. The Rural Fire Service has three levels of fitness for its volunteers and departmental firefighters: light, moderate and arduous. All the firefighters who were sent to Tumut have reached arduous level meaning they passed a test of completing a 4.8km walk in under 45 minutes while carrying a 20kg pack.</p><p>Tough stuff. The volunteers also have accommodating bosses, allowing them to go to the fire on leave without pay, or, in some cases, with pay.</p><p>Christmas jeer SOME staff believe they are getting mixed Christmas messages at the head office of the Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs in Belconnen. On the one hand, staff were praised for raising more than $2000 to buy Christmas presents for 60 Canberra teenagers in an office whip-around. \"The Christmas spirit is truly alive here in the national office!\" an e-mail to them read. But at least one worker thinks the department is being stingy for not reimbursing staff for the Christmas decorations they put on their work stations and around the office. All staff were informed in an email from the financial strategy and reporting division that \"Christmas decorations cannot be purchased with corporate funds\". \"Please note that the costs of decorations CANNOT be reimbursed.</p><p>Any decorations must be purchased with your own money.</p><p>Reimbursement forms sent to Financial Services Section will be returned to the relevant officer.\" The accusation it was being a little bah- humbug brought a swift response from the department, with a spokesman saying \"taxpayers' money must be used appropriately when it comes to departmental expenses and activities\". \"While the department has put up some communal Christmas decorations in the lobby, it would be remiss to use taxpayers' money to decorate individual staff areas within the department,\" he said. \"Of course, people are free to hang decorations within their work areas. However, it is reasonable and appropriate for these to be bought privately.\" The spokesman also pointed out that DIMA staff had raised $40,000 throughout the year for charities with raffles, trivia nights and various whip-arounds.</p><p>Emptying the bath CANNY kangaroos have shrugged off the drought and found a steady source of fresh water in the garden of Judi Power Thomson at Hall. \"Last week I erected a bird bath for the hot and thirsty birds,\" she said. \"It took three days before our resident kangaroo family discovered this little gem. They now empty the bird bath every day.\" Judi took this photograph from her kitchen window, with \"dad, mum and the kid\" kangaroo now visiting each afternoon.</p><p>Pollie with no voice ACT Opposition Deputy Leader Jacqui Burke is in the extremely frustrating position of being a politician without a voice, literally rather than figuratively. A virus nine weeks ago has attacked her vocal chords, temporarily paralysing part of them, meaning she can only speak in a whisper. \"It's been the most distressing nine weeks of my life,\" she said. \"It's like a landscape gardener who has to go to work with their hands tied behind their back. My voice is the tool of my trade.\" Burke hopes a break over Christmas will restore her voice and get her fit and ready for next year. \"I love my job and I've got so much to give,\" she said. \"It couldn't come at a worse time with me accepting the position of Deputy Leader.\" She does see some sort of silver lining to the cloud, saying it has given her some extra empathy for people with a disability in the workplace.</p><p>Rudd in demand PASS the turkey, Kev. Labor's new leadership duo of Kevin Rudd and Julia Gillard are the political couple most wanted at Christmas dinner tables this year, beating the John Howard and Peter Costello partnership with four times the votes, according to a survey conducted by Australian marketer to women, The Heat Group. The online survey, which questioned 277 Australian women of all ages, showed foxymorons Kath and Kim, winners of last year's poll, were again the most-wanted duo (living or dead) to have at the Christmas table with 31 per cent of votes. Bono and Sting were the next most popular (17 per cent).</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-7795653</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4MK1-2KF0-TX4S-M2VV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"856\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 The Federal Capital Press of Australia PTY Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"12\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>December 15, 2006 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001932</classCode><className>CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT &amp; CORRECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000969</classCode><className>INVESTIGATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp; FIREFIGHTING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000887</classCode><className>IMMIGRATION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N520000CC</classCode><className>BANKING &amp; FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX001313</classCode><className>PERSONAL FINANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GX013</classCode><className>CANBERRA, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS006</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN CAPITAL TERRITORY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Then the alternative is not only the loss of sight, but every other sense as well.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rebekah Devlin (The Advertiser, yesterday) quotes those who selectively draw on the Bible/Torah, yet does not mention that this saying is about proportion, and mercy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There appears to me nothing merciful about prison, especially American-style incarceration and nothing quite as barbarically inhuman as wishing someone a ``long and miserable existence . . .

God will be the ultimate judge, whether he dies of natural causes in the end or is given the death penalty.</p><p>Many who face the penalty of death apparently fear God and repent of their crimes. As God promises forgiveness for all sin, and we all do sin (albeit not on such a scale), God sees all wrong as sin and needs our repentance or words of sorrow for them. God wants us to do good, not evil.</p><p>B.V. HAMILTON, Bordertown.</p><p>Weapons are worse</p><p>ALI Carle is correct in that previous generations in Western society have been more violent in their day-to-day life than we are today (The Advertiser, 23/7/12).</p><p>That does not mean we have gone far enough in tackling violence. Much more can be done. With the weapons available today, one act of violence by an individual is shown to be far more damaging than in any previous period. An individual with a knife, a sword or a bow and arrow would not cause the slaughter we now see.</p><p>I believe the level of violence we now witness in movies, mainly produced in the US, is little different to the Viking burial or hollow brass cow to which Ali refers.</p><p>I do acknowledge there is a need for some members of our society, such as our farmers, to possess a weapon. Beyond that, no person in a civilised society needs to own firearms unless they intend to kill or maim. Societies that are obsessed with the ownership of weapons, such as the US, are far from being civilised.</p><p>ERIC TAYLOR, West Beach.</p><p>Guns all around us</p><p>GUNS are all around us. First there are the official ones: experts with guns, hundreds of thousands involved in wars, defence force reserves, state troopers, police, security companies, the armaments industry, etc.</p><p>Then there are the ``non-official'' ones: gun and hunting clubs, hobbyists, farmers.</p><p>With high winds it is very difficult to stop a forest fire.

How he could refer to his movies as innocent and hopeful is quite beyond me.</p><p>But I am a voice in the wilderness, completely out of step in a society that considers violence as entertainment and kicks up a fuss if the censors try to regulate what appalling images we are exposed to.</p><p>HEATHER LAUTERBACH, Victor Harbor.</p><p>Sorry, Mr Nolan</p><p>WHILE absorbing the media reports of the newly infamous ``Batman killer'', James Holmes, my jaded responses were rattled by a comment attributed to Christopher Nolan, the director of the Batman Trilogy.</p><p>Sorry, Mr Nolan, but my personal belief is that you and other movie directors should hang your heads in collective shame at some of the unbelievably violent, sick, perverted and mindless muck that you have been producing for years.</p><p>To suggest that the cinema is a place of innocence and hope is hopelessly naive, inappropriate and out of kilter with reality.</p><p>BILL CUNNINGHAM, Goolwa.</p><p>Media mayhem</p><p>THERE is a lot of talk about gun bans in the media, but little about the glorification of gun violence in films like The Dark Knight Rises and Gangster Squad, with a trailer for the latter preceding screenings of the former in some cities that contained a scene involving the mass shooting of a movie theatre audience.</p><p>Batman trilogy director Christopher Nolan (``Dark night'', The Advertiser, 22/7/12) said: ``Movies are one of the</p><p>great American art forms. That someone would violate that innocent and hopeful place in such an unbearably savage way</p><p>is devastating.''</p><p>If the media corporations that produce such movies believe the gratuitous depiction of gun violence, including massacres, is a legitimate form of entertainment, it follows that depicting lunatics driving cars into crowds at high speed is also innocent and a legitimate form of entertainment.</p><p>Yet few if any movies do so. Because it would be irresponsible? Do the elites who control the mainstream media (consciously or unconsciously) want to promote shooting sprees in order to disarm the mob, or are they simply indifferent to the consequences of their actions? They seem fixated on banning guns for some reason. No talk about media violence or mental health from them, just ``guns bad, ban guns''.</p><p>RICHARD LUTZ, Seacliff.</p><p>Industry to blame?</p><p>JAMES Holmes is a mass murderer.

In 2002, there were 71,160 wildland fires in the US, burning through more than 2.8 million hectares, according to the National Interagency Fire Centre in Boise, Idaho. This is about double the 10-year average. The superlatives flowed through the northern summer - there were some of the biggest, most damaging and protracted fires in the country's recent history. Hundreds of homes were lost, whole towns threatened. Some of the worst-affected states were in the west, which has a long history of</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">fire and fire suppression. It shares with south-eastern Australia and parts of</p><p>the Mediterranean rim the distinction of being one of the most fire-prone areas of the world. The recent experience of the US has been one of increasingly severe wildfires affecting broader expanses of wildland forest. In 1988, Americans watched in horror as fire cut a swath through Yellowstone National Park. In 2000, they welcomed assistance from overseas, including Australia, as wildfires bit hard in the western states. That year more than 122,000 fires burnt through 3.4 million hectares. The fires prompted debate in the US over whether land managers need to burn the</p><p>forest to save it. By comparison, in Australia - especially Western Australia - land managers have always used fuel-reduction burning as a way of combating the threat of bushfire. Over the past century, the US has developed a range of techniques to fight wildfires. These have included using water-bombing aircraft, hot-shot paratroops and platoons of dedicated paid ground firefighters, together with a huge army of volunteers across the nation. But the realisation has been slow in coming that however much hardware and technology you throw at it, wildfire is a natural phenomenon that long predates</p><p>man's intervention. Over much of the past century, US land managers have been fixed on the idea that fire must be excluded at all costs from the forest. The no-fire philosophy</p><p>can be traced to devastating, uncontrollable fires that obliterated entire towns and decimated timber reserves in the early 1900s. That experience spawned</p><p>a US Forest Service and a campaign that saw fire as the enemy of the landscape</p><p>and exclusion as its aim. Enter Smokey Bear, a cartoon poster character so successful in proselytising the no-fires message that his fame spread well beyond the US. Then came Disney's Bambi fleeing the destructive forest fire deliberately set by the villains who killed his mother. Such messages were drilled into the American psyche and their impact is still felt today. As fires have become bigger and more threatening to forests and wilderness areas and to the people living on their fringes, debate has shifted to whether total fire-exclusion policies adopted across the US are appropriate. In one of the more intelligent recent assessments of the \"burn versus don't burn\" debate, retired US forester Stephen Arno and science writer Steven Allison-Bunnell have examined the issue as it relates to the western forests of</p><p>the US. Differing forest regimes aside, there are plenty of parallels with the</p><p>Australian experience. Whether fire helps or harms the environment, they argue, is largely a matter of</p><p>perception. Humans have been conditioned to see fire as purely destructive, rather than helpful. They say part of the problem is that the US public is so confused about the place of fire in the natural environment that it is not sure</p><p>what to believe. What appears clear from Arno's and Allison-Bunnell's analysis is that after prevention and mitigation, fire suppression is tantamount to failure in environmental management. \"It does not treat the underlying cause of the problem,\" they conclude. Reintroducing fire into the western US forest regime is an acknowledgement of its original role in maintaining a healthy ecosystem. After a century of fire exclusion in the US, just how this can be done while satisfying the competing social, political and land-use interests is another matter. Precisely the same challenge will face Australian land managers who have moved away from using prescribed burning as a key management tool.

Two computer hard drives containing vital nuclear secrets have disappeared from a vault at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico, laboratory and US Energy Department officials disclosed. Department officials first learned that the nuclear secrets were missing on June 1 and have not ruled out the possibility that the disappearance is linked to a forest fire that threatened the lab and forced its evacuation last month. The two hard drives contained material used by the Nuclear Emergency Search Team, which is trained to respond to nuclear accidents of terrorism threats. They contain data needed to render weapons safe in an emergency or as part of a threat by terrorists.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Former pupils sue Hare Krishna group</p><p>DALLAS. More than 40 former students of Hare Krishna schools have filed a $400 million lawsuit against the religious movement, alleging they were sexually and physically abused as children over two decades. The suit filed in federal court named the International Society of Krishna Consciousness, the movement's umbrella group, as the lead defendant along with 16 local organisations, 17 governing board members and the estate of the movement's founder, Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. The lawsuit alleged children in Hare Krishna boarding schools were routinely abused by teachers and staff from 1972, when the society's first school opened in Dallas, until about 1990. The abuses ranged from rape and beatings to forcing small children to stand for hours in a darkened closet or sleep in soiled blankets as punishment for wetting their beds.</p><p>Coup leader brought to book</p><p>RIO DE JANEIRO. The former Paraguayan general accused of inspiring last month's failed coup was brought to Brasilia on Monday to await extradition to his homeland. Lino Cesar Oviedo, a controversial populist politician, was arrested on Sunday in southern Brazil. He was officially being sought in connection with his role in an attempted coup in 1996. But the search for the former military leader, missing since early last year, took on new urgency last month after factions of the Paraguayan military and police tried to overthrow the government of President Luis Gonzalez Macchi.</p><p>Putin appoints Chechnya leader</p><p>MOSCOW. Russia's President Vladimir Putin has appointed a Muslim cleric to govern Chechnya, a move intended to legitimise the Russian intervention in the breakaway republic. Mr Putin said the new leader, Mufti Akhmed Kadyrov, a Chechen, would have the support of his people. But many Chechens distrust leaders who have sided with the Russians, and it will be difficult for him to establish authority. Aslan Maskhadov, the president of Chechnya before the Russians intervened in 1994, has denounced the mufti as a traitor. The cleric has already been the target of several assassination attempts, including a bombing last month that wounded his son.</p><p>Dancer wins implants suit</p><p>NEW YORK. A former exotic dancer won $30,000 in a jury verdict yesterday after she sued her plastic surgeon for using breast implants to enhance her buttocks. Mary Gale, 43, of North Miami, Florida, accused Dr Elliot James of negligence and malpractice in the November 1990 procedure. Ms Gale said that she suffered mental anguish and physical pain, and was no longer able to earn $US500 ($A845) a night dancing in men's clubs. She now works as a bartender. \"I'm glad we won the case. Breast implants belong in the breast area,\" Ms Gale said.</p><p>Mexican police die in ambush</p><p>TUXTLA GUTIERREZ. Seven police officers were killed on Monday when unidentified armed men ambushed a patrol in Mexico's troubled southern state of Chiapas, where Zapatista Indian rebels took up arms six years ago, an official said. The attack occurred about 110 kilometres north-west of the state capital, Tuxtla Gutierrez. Two other people were injured. Chiapas has simmered since the Zapatista National Liberation Army rose in rebellion in 1994, demanding improved rights for Mexico's 10 million Indians.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8B-RHP0-TXN5-S1DY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yicj1w2ohse2b4p51i</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB2000</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"667\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2000 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"06\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>June 14, 2000 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp;

Susan Murdoch</nitf:byline><nitf:dateline>BRIGHT, Vic, Jan 22</nitf:dateline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The north-east Victorian town of Bright is on high alert tonight, with residents nervously watching the progress of a fire closing in on a nearby pine plantation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fears that the fire would take hold in the plantation at Devils Creek, 6km from Bright, and jump to the town eased by 8pm (AEDT) with a drop in the wind.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But fire authorities and residents of the town of 2,000 people were remaining vigilant.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"As a result of some feverish activity, the immediate threat to Bright has been averted on the basis of pretty good weather conditions,\" Department of Sustainability and Environment (DSE) spokesman Alan Everett said.</p><p>\"It's still possible it will go up the ridge and go up there quickly, but at the moment with backburning, we're hoping it won't go that far.\"</p><p>The residents of several nearby towns are also on full alert as, for the second night in a row, 16-day-old bushfires encroach on townships in the picturesque region.</p><p>Last night, four homes and a shed in the hamlets of Stanley, Yackandandah and the Indigo Valley were destroyed by fires which authorities believe may have been deliberately lit.</p><p>Fire authorities this evening advised the residents of Bright, Porepunka and Wandiligong to either leave for safe shelters immediately or stay and defend their properties.</p><p>DSE spokesman Stuart Ord said the crews were preparing for unpredictable behaviour from the Buffalo fire encroaching on Bright.</p><p>\"The fire is becoming extremely erratic and hard to predict,\" he said.</p><p>\"With hot conditions expected this weekend, the fire intensity may well increase.\"</p><p>Mr Ord said humidity in the region was down to just four per cent, with more severe conditions expected on Saturday.</p><p>Residents at Harrietville were urged to activate their fire plans and remain on high alert with spot fires from the Bogong bushfire slowly heading towards the Alpine hamlet.</p><p>Eight fires in the north-east and Alpine country are continuing to burn, while another fire this afternoon broke out in a pine plantation near Linton, west of Melbourne.</p><p>Linton was the scene of the 1998 tragedy in which five firefighters died when their truck was engulfed in flames.</p><p>The Country Fire Authority (CFA) said the fire burned up to 50ha, at one stage endangering houses on the Linton-Snake Valley Road before being contained by 8pm (AEDT) without damaging property.</p><p>Another fire on the outskirts of Melbourne at Lysterfield, which was thought to have been deliberately lit, was brought under control at about 3pm (AEDT).</p><p>CFA chief fire officer Russell Rees said this morning that three fires which threatened Yackandandah, Stanley and the Indigo Valley began in quick succession.</p><p>\"The origin of these fires are suspicious \u2026 and are being investigated by police,\" Mr Rees told reporters.</p><p>More than 8,900ha had been burned at Eldorado, and up to 4,000ha was razed in Stanley, with the flames racing through grassland, scrub, plantation pines and box ironbark country.</p><p>However, Mr Rees said given there were 130 houses directly in the path of the fires, the efforts of firefighters and the community had worked well.</p><p>\"It's outstanding that the losses were so small,\" he said.</p><p>By mid-afternoon, the Eldorado and Stanley fires had slowed along the frontlines and firefighters were controlling its flanks.</p><p>Relief centres were established at Wodonga, Chiltern, Beechworth, Myrtleford and Bright for residents who fled their homes.</p><p>CFA spokesman John Worthy said about 8pm the Eldorado fire had been contained at the top of a ridge near the Indigo Creek Road.</p><p>\"It remains a fairly significant threat to some property in the towns of Indigo Valley, Worragee, Barnawartha South, Barunduda and Wodonga,\" he said.</p><p>Mr Rees said firefighters were working frantically ahead of forecast extreme conditions over the weekend, but he said with conditions so dry after five years of drought, the fires were continuing to burn regardless of temperature or wind direction.</p><p>\"There has been 15 days of solid fires. In my view there is no end in sight,\" Mr Rees said.</p><p>Meanwhile, exhausted firefighting crews were today relieved with reinforcements from around the state.</p><p>A team of forest fire experts from New Zealand had also been sent to the Gippsland fires near Omeo, which were burning through dense, rugged country.</p><p>Meanwhile, the state's bushfire crisis has affected horse racing, with Racing Victoria transferring tomorrow's eight-race meeting scheduled for Wodonga to Seymour, north of Melbourne.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2003</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-02-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"748\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2003 AAP Information Services Pty.

In their different ways, they all wrote about pigs, and they figure among the 301 items in Lyall Watson's biblio-graphy. A notable omission from it is Jeffrey Masson's The Pig Who Sang to the Moon (reviewed here on March 28), though perhaps The Whole Hog was already in press when Masson's book came out. Watson is a naturalist, with interests in fields as diversely related as biology, anthropology, palaeontology and archeology. People have written popularising scientific books about geese, whales, cats, dolphins, chimpanzees and many other animals, which are sometimes seen as mere humans in disguise, a lesson to us all as embodiments of simple nobility, fair-mindedness, tolerance and fun. Masson's book was explicit advocacy of the right of the pig (and the duck, and the goat, and the cow, etc) to be treated by us as decently as we treat our fellow humans. Watson doesn't go that far, though he does present many arguments in favour of seeing pigs, both wild and domesticated, as close to human beings not only through history and culture, but in their eyes and teeth, as well as in other evolutionary consequences of being omnivorous, characteristics such as curiosity, play and interest in novelty. He sees them as having a better claim than dogs to be called \"man's best friend\" (besides, he says, they taste better). As Churchill said, \"Pigs look you in the eye as equals.\"</p><p>About 30 years ago, a French novelist, Jean Giono, wrote a light-heartedly learned article about pigs, in which he said that the adage about nothing in a pig going to waste, except the squeal it makes at the moment of slaughter, has been rendered obsolete by technological progress, for now even the squeal is used, by being recorded, then minced into sound effects by radio producers and filmmakers. Watson seems not to have heard of this, but it seems a small omission from a book that combines great erudition with engaging humour. It may seem an odd thing to say of a book about pigs, but it is exhilarating, offering constant intellectual fodder, served with a refreshing humanism of manner and felicitous use of language. The author contrives to make his reader believe that this fascinating porcine lore is essential knowledge and that to learn so much about pigs from a single book is to be more human. In part, this is because he writes not just about pigs, but about the roles they have played and continue to play in human life and cultures.  The only problem it poses is how anyone could write such a brilliant book about pigs. After reading it, Desmond Morris said that if anyone ever called him a swine, he would take it as a compliment. The title says it all, both in style and contents: the book covers most aspects of all pigs, ancient and modern, free or captive; and the author's way of writing about his subject is a constant delight, vivid, sprightly, evocative, hugely informed and neatly inventive in turn of phrase. Take this, from a description of a herd of white-lipped peccaries in the Amazon jungle: \"noisy, barking and squabbling, moaning and retching like football fans on their way home from a lost match. You can hear this hullabaloo from a hundred yards away, but the sound of a herd in a palm grove carries much further. Each crack of a hard nut shell sounds like a pistol shot, and the effect of a hundred fruits being opened and devoured in quick succession has to be heard to be believed. It combines the menace of an approaching forest fire with all the staccato explosions of a Chinese New Year celebration.\" Think of any English expression about the family Suidae (the learned name for pigs of whatever species) and you will find as many sentences in this book where the author plays on it with an amusing twist to its tail: pig in the middle, when pigs can fly, on the pig's back, hogging the limelight, pig ignorant and so on. The very fact that there are so many locutions and so much mythology, from the old \"This little piggy went to market\" to the newer Miss Piggy, is no doubt testimony to the ambivalent closeness of our relationship to pork. The book is solid suidology from beginning to end, but the science is leavened with anecdote, personal experience and a lightness of manner that make the book readable to anyone who appreciates a dash of style in the service of knowledge. It is a model of how a literate scientist can make science, its premises, its methods and its implications for us all accessible to the non-scientist. James Grieve, as a reader, is as omnivorous as a pig.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CANBER-3200691</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CANBER2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FFX-JX40-0045-53WS-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">161300</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><pagination><pageSequence><page/></pageSequence></pagination><wordCount number=\"768\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Canberra Times (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Federal Capital Press of Australia Pty Limited</copyright><edition>Final Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"02\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>February 12, 2005 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009U56</classCode><className>HUMANITIES &amp; SOCIAL SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009UAK</classCode><className>NOVELS &amp; SHORT STORIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST000CFER</classCode><className>ANIMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0009TS7</classCode><className>ANTHROPOLOGY &amp; ARCHAEOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST0008Z8M</classCode><className>BIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>ST00098X3</classCode><className>CUSTOMS &amp; CULTURAL HERITAGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DIER</classCode><className>FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009U58</classCode><className>HISTORY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A1LF</classCode><className>ARCHAEOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000A3EZ</classCode><className>CATS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DD7B</classCode><className>PALEONTOLOGY &amp; PALEOBIOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX001379</classCode><className>PRIMATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He said Arrowfield would not be replacing Orton.</p><p>Vinery's owner, Dr Tom Simon, required a top hands-on horseman to take over the management of his Australian breeding set-up, which includes the Roselands Stud in Victoria, and Orton's background fitted the bill perfectly.</p><p>Flying start</p><p>* MESSARA surprised a few breeders with the release of his 2000 stallion service fees for Arrowfield last Monday.</p><p>He has based his prices on supply and demand and has received 200 inquiries about Flying Spur this year.</p><p>Flying Spur has made an excellent start to his stallion career and up to last weekend had produced eight individual winners of 13 races from just 24 representatives. He is third on the prizemoney list.</p><p>The fee increases of the Arrowfield team are Flying Spur from $17,500 to $35,000, Danzero from $12,500 to $25,000, Snippets from $20,000 to $25,000 and End Sweep from $25,000 to $30,000. Redoute's Choice, the $10 million horse, begins his stud career at a fee of $30,000. All prices will be subject to GST.</p><p>The fees for Timber Country ($30,000), Unbridled's Song ($25,000), Fuji Kiseki ($20,000) and Brocco ($15,000) remain unchanged, while the other newcomer to the Arrowfield line-up, Xaar, commences at $22,500.</p><p>Full house</p><p>* BREEDERS looking to gain a service to last year's Golden Slipper winner Catbird for the coming season can save themselves a phone call to Yarraman Park Stud.</p><p>I've been advised that house full sign has been posted just a fortnight after the announcement of the three-year-old's retirement to stud and his arrival at Yarraman Park.

There's about 20 firefighters taking a well earned break here eating and drinking and generally kicking back.</p><p>It's an eerie atmosphere. We're surrounded by smoke from the smouldering forest. And there's the strange sight of city taxi cabs occasionally coming down the dirt track to take exhausted firefighters back to hotels and motels.</p><p>FIREFIGHTER: Oh we've been here since Saturday night, seven o'clock Saturday night we first got called out.</p><p>DAVID WEBER: So you must be pretty tired?</p><p>FIREFIGHTER: Yeah, we're buggered, yeah. I've got ... oh we rotate our guys out on a sort of 14, 16 hour basis. But it sort of catches up with you with the smoke and the fire and all that, and just the conditions, yeah.</p><p>DAVID WEBER: How long have you been here for?</p><p>FIREFIGHTER: Since Sunday.</p><p>DAVID WEBER: And how do you think this operation's come off?</p><p>FIREFIGHTER: Oh ... it looked pretty disappointing there for a while, but I hope it's under control. I mean, no one's got caught as far as I know, which, happy with that. I mean, and the houses haven't gotten burnt down, so that's a good result, I think.</p><p>FIREFIGHTER: It's been hard because we're running out of crews, and our group is a specialist group, and we can't just take anybody. We've got to use specialists, and people are getting tireder and tireder. We're glad that we're probably going to run another shift tonight and hopefully we&amp;apos;ll pull our transportable gear down.</p><p>DAVID WEBER: The statistics are staggering. More than 20,000 hectares burnt and a perimeter of around 150 kilometres. The fire was so fast that in some places it charred the lower part of the forest and left the tops of the trees untouched.</p><p>The Department of Conservation and Land Management, or CALM, has responsibility for the fire because it&amp;apos;s in the State Forest.</p><p>Fire-controller Kevin Haylock.</p><p>KEVIN HAYLOCK: I'd have to say it's been an absolutely Herculean effort by FISA, by the Government agencies, and by the private individuals involved. And I can only liken it to a group of school kids going out and performing in an AFL Grand Final. It's been an elevation of effort that's surpassed everyone's expectation and been a very, very good effort and a good result.</p><p>DAVID WEBER: I've been told that there was a lot of fuel in the area and when they're trying to push the fire back to somewhere to bring it under control there was a lot of fuel there as well. Has this park been perhaps not as managed as well as it could have been?</p><p>KEVIN HAYLOCK: Look, one of the things that we have tried to do in Western Australia in fire management for the last decade is to be very responsive in regard to putting smoke over the city. And certainly there has been less prescribed burning in this area than we would want to have achieved, and there are fuel loadings greater than 10 years, and it's very difficult for us to be able to catch a fire, to contain it, and actually full suppress it when the fuel is much greater than 10 years old. And so that has certainly been an issue.</p><p>DAVID WEBER: The isolated communities around this area were under alert for a long period of time. How have they managed the situation?</p><p>KEVIN HAYLOCK: There has been some evacuation from properties. So there's been dislocation of peoples' livelihood. There has been fire in pasture and orchards, so there will be some damage there to peoples' incomes.</p><p>There has been a great deal of uncertainty from the community because there is a huge pall of smoke that is coming out of this fire, and once the fire is out, or contained, the smoke doesn&amp;apos;t actually stop. There are numerous logs on the ground spread over 15,000 hectares that will smoulder for days and days, and so whenever the wind shifts it shifts that pall of smoke in that direction of course, so there's been a great deal of concern from people who all of sudden see smoke coming their way that they think there may be another fire outbreak, and it's been a task to try and reassure the community that we are actually making good progress.</p><p>TANYA NOLAN: Kevin Haylock, a fire-controller in Perth's eastern hillside, speaking to David Weber.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ABCTRN-1285813</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ABCTRN2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4K00-S5T0-TXDB-C2HP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">473393</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"759\"/><timeReceived>5:38 PM AEST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2005 Australian Broadcasting Corporation All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>ABC Transcripts (Australia)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"37475\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2005\"><dateText>January 20, 2005 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Transcript</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>News Transcripts</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Australia/WA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Disasters and Accidents/Fires/Bushfire</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government and Politics/Parliament/State Parliament</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Government and Politics/States and Territories</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Community Organisations</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Community and Society/Volunteers</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"89\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000113</classCode><className>ARSON</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

They also performed anti-poaching plays for villagers, which dramatised how conflict for space between farmers and wildlife can be resolved.</p><p>* The National Youth Environmental Protection Council of Hungary held its second festival of environmental films made by young people recently - and polluting industries who were cleaning up their act helped sponsor it.</p><p>* At the ripe old age of 13, Andrew Holleman of Massachusetts in the USA led a successful campaign against a harmful development of a wetland site near his home.</p><p>* Children - especially young adolescents - were the driving force behind the \"green consumerism\" movement in developed countries, by telling their parents what to buy.</p><p>It is such happenings which have made Dr Tolba hopeful for the future.</p><p>Over the last year there had been a significant increase in the space, time and prominence devoted to environmental issues in the media, he said.</p><p>And a recent international poll of both rich and poor countries revealed mounting public concern for the global environment.</p><p>\"The world is beginning to recognise that our quest for ever higher material living standards is on a collision course with the environment,\" said Dr Tolba.</p><p>\"In the past, we commonly assumed that the next generation would live on a planet with an environment very similar to ours - and perhaps with new technology to make life safer.</p><p>\"This assumption is no longer justifiable.</p><p>\"We have to constantly ask ourselves: 'Will this action help meet our present needs, while not jeopardising the needs of future generations?'.</p><p>\"The situation is serious now and likely to become worse as the present global population of more than five billion increases.</p><p>KILLING THE POOR</p><p>\"It may double by the middle of the next century, and about 90 per cent of the growth is expected to occur in the developing countries.\"</p><p>Dr Tolba said the degradation of the environment was killing mostly the children of the poorest parents in the poorest countries.</p><p>He said their growing bodies and minds were less tolerant of disease, pollution and malnutrition than those of adults.</p><p>UNICEF figures showed that diarrhoea and other illnesses related to unsafe water were killing millions of children each year.</p><p>And air pollution played a major part in the annual four million deaths from breathing system infections of children from developing countries.</p><p>In the industrialised nations, the major environmental killers were air pollution and hazardous chemicals.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Two Illus: MOSTAFA TOLBA TREE PLANTING: Children's awareness of the destruction of natural resources gives

Begun by John Ford and finished by Mervyn LeRoy, Henry Fonda, William Powell and Jack Lemmon's battles with tyrannical captain James Cagney see them all at their comic peak.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Reluctant heroes. 8 Hard Knox (Nine, 2 pm): The 1984 telemovie pilot, directed by Peter Werner, for Robert Conrad's Baa Baa Black Sheep series, as yet unseen here. Marine career flyer Conrad is grounded and must choose between a desk job and running a military school full of misfits. Guess what he takes on.</p><p>As in school of . . . 5 E V E N I N G The Ten Commandments (Ten, 7.30 pm): Cecil B. De Mille's formula for biblical epics (nine reels of sin to one of repentance) never worked more profitably than in this 1956 spectacular. Charlton Heston's stolid Moses endures life in Pharaoh Yul Brynner's court. After betrayal and the seven plagues he leads the Israelites across the parted Red Sea into the wilderness. The Top Ten look as if they are inscribed by a thunderbolt-activated laser writer. Unsubtle primary-level script and acting.</p><p> The Exodus project. 6 Lawrence of Arabia (Seven, 8.30 pm): See Movie of the Week, page 7.</p><p> The Last Wave (Nine, 8.30 pm): Lawyer Richard Chamberlain defends Aboriginal David Gulpilil and learns that his nightmares are part of a Dreamtime legend that Sydney will be engulfed by a tidal wave.Peter Weir's 1977 film is strong on atmosphere.</p><p> Damper dumper. 7 F O R N I G H T O W L S</p><p> Coach of the Year (Nine, 10.40 pm): Wheelchair-bound Viet-vet Robert Conrad agrees to teach his football skills to a group of delinquents.This afternoon's Hard Knox had more series potential; this busted 1980 pilot, directed by Don Medford and Andy Sidaris, is a better film and built around a similar theme.</p><p> The behind-bars team. 6 Fire! (Nine, 12.50 am): Producer Irwin Allen claimed his disaster-movie formula was to start with a catastrophe, then build to a climax. It works fairly well in this 1977 telemovie, directed by Earl Bellamy, with a forest fire racing towards a mountain community. Like a whodunnit, the trick is to guess who in the semi-star studded cast will survive.</p><p> Schematic, but passable. 6 School For Secrets (Ten, 1.50 am): Conceived as a documentary follow-up to The Way Ahead, Peter Ustinov's 1946 film instead became a feature about the boffins who developed radar.Starring Ralph Richardson, it's interesting but afflicted by elements of its 25-year-old writer-director's precosity.</p><p> Back room boys. 5 In This Our Life (Nine, 2.45 am): Bitchy Bette Davis ruins sister Olivia de Havilland's life by stealing her husband Dennis Morgan.But she gets her just desserts in a car crash. John Huston's disappointing directing follow-up to The Maltese Falcon, many of whose cast plus father Walter can be seen as extras in a bar scene. Davis never stays still; she was obviously expecting potshots for this neurotic melodrama.</p><p> Unsisterly. 5</p><p> END OF STORY</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERALDLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49M5-J4R0-01S8-D3FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"514\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Herald</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1990 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"04\" year=\"1990\"><dateText>April 9, 1990 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>JOHN FORD MORRISON\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CO</classCode><className>NAVIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009UGQ</classCode><className>THEATER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009IRB</classCode><className>SPORTS AWARDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001177</classCode><className>MOVIE REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009JZR</classCode><className>MILITARY SCHOOLS &amp; ACADEMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST000D1DR</classCode><className>NEGATIVE NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009XVW</classCode><className>WORLD WAR II</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000644</classCode><className>COACHES &amp; TRAINERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX000900</classCode><className>TSUNAMIS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001464</classCode><className>RELIGION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097CO</classCode><className>NAVIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000A5JP</classCode><className>FILM DIRECTORS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001177</classCode><className>MOVIE REVIEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009JZR</classCode><className>MILITARY SCHOOLS &amp; ACADEMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX002273</classCode><className>NAVAL VESSELS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"65\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000A2L7</classCode><className>INDIAN OCEAN</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Details about the find will be<br/>reported on Monday in the magazine Archaeology, the company said.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The wreck was found almost 500 km off the coast of Corsica while<br/>the company was working for the Israeli government, searching for a<br/>submarine that disappeared in 1968.<br/></p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Company general manager Tom Dettweiler said his crew members at<br/>first were unhappy that the thing they discovered wasn't the sub.<br/></p><p>\"They called me back sounding really disappointed and said,<br/>'It's this really old ship',\" Dettweiler said. \"I got pretty<br/>excited.\"<br/></p><p>The discovery was made in May 1999, but was kept secret until<br/>the salvage of the Israeli submarine - which the company eventually<br/>found - was completed.<br/></p><p>Oceanographer Brett Phaneuf of the Institute of Nautical<br/>Archaeology at Texas A&amp;M University estimated the wreck's age using<br/>video images of amphorae, large ceramic containers used to<br/>transport olive oil, wine and other commodities. Their appearance<br/>suggested they came from the Greek islands of Rhodes and Kos and<br/>were made around the second and third centuries B.C., the company<br/>said.<br/></p><p>The discovery of the wreck between the trading centres of Rhodes<br/>and Alexandria, nearly 500 km from land, could challenge the<br/>thinking that ancient Mediterranean trading ships generally didn't<br/>venture into the open sea.<br/></p><p>\"We'd always believed that ships hugged the coast and stayed in<br/>sight of the land,\" Phaneuf said. \"This is the nail in the coffin<br/>on that theory. These ships are as far as you can possibly get from<br/>any shore. They didn't get there by accident.\"<br/></p><p>AP<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>Sci Extinction<br/></p><p>LONDON, Feb 22 PA - A giant comet or asteroid smashed into the<br/>Earth 250 million years ago and triggered the biggest mass<br/>extinction in history, scientists said today.<br/></p><p>The disaster was even more catastrophic than the impact which is<br/>thought to have ended the reign of the dinosaurs 65 million years<br/>ago.<br/></p><p>It resulted in almost all life - 90 per cent of all marine<br/>species and 70 per cent of land vertebrates - being wiped out.<br/></p><p>Scientists call the event at the boundary of the Permian and<br/>Triassic periods The Great Dying.<br/></p><p>But only now has evidence come to light linking the destruction<br/>with an object hitting the Earth.<br/></p><p>Researchers who reported their findings in the journal, Science,<br/>today said the impact probably did not wipe out life directly.<br/></p><p>Rather, it triggered a series of events, including the most<br/>furious period of volcanic activity the world has ever seen, that<br/>made survival impossible for the great majority of species.<br/></p><p>It happened 250 million years ago, occurred again 185 million<br/>years later, and experts warn that another major impact could<br/>destroy the human race.<br/></p><p>The US scientists estimate that the object responsible for The<br/>Great Dying was between 6 km and 11.9 km wide.<br/></p><p>They do not know where it landed on the single continent called<br/>Pangea, which comprised all the Earth's land at the time.<br/></p><p>However, the \"bolide\" - the term used for either an icy comet or<br/>rocky asteroid - left a calling card in the form of tell-tale<br/>chemical traces found in rare ancient rocks from sites in Japan,<br/>China and Hungary.<br/></p><p>One of the researchers, Dr Robert Poreda, associate professor of<br/>earth and environmental sciences at the University of Rochester,<br/>New York, said: \"The impact of a bolide of this size releases an<br/>amount of energy that is basically about one million times the<br/>largest earthquake recorded during the last century.

The rest is up to him,\" said<br/>Kurt Cunningham, supervisor of the state wildlife shelter in<br/>Helena.<br/></p><p>The cub was found after a forest fire raged through the<br/>Bitterroot Valley in southwestern Montana. The animal, its paws<br/>burned and fur singed, was alone, emaciated and clinging to a<br/>charred tree.<br/></p><p>The cub was brought to the shelter in Helena, where its burns<br/>were treated and its body fattened up on a high-protein diet.<br/>Officials also tried to limit the bear's contact with humans, which<br/>became difficult as news of the orphan spread and it was styled as<br/>a modern-day Smokey Bear.<br/></p><p>\"We were getting hundreds, sometimes thousands of visitors to<br/>the shelter, everyone wanting to see the bear,\" Aasheim said.<br/></p><p>He said biologists are confident the bear will do well once it<br/>comes out of hibernation, even without its mother. Its special diet<br/>gave it more fat reserves than most wild bears going into<br/>hibernation, and that extends the time it can survive after<br/>awakening until it finds food.<br/></p><p>\"In a perfect world, you would rather they had a mother,\"<br/>Aasheim said. \"But if they don't, we've prepared them as best we<br/>can.\"<br/></p><p>AP<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/></p><p>QUOTE UNQUOTE<br/></p><p>A diplomat is somebody who can tell you to go to hell and leave<br/>you looking forward to the trip - Alex Salmond, former leader of<br/>the Scottish National Party.<br/><br/></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:42DR-95V0-0048-T1S5-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1659\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2001 AAP Information Services Pty.

SALLY BROWNE reports on a remarkable journey of self-discovery and recovery</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">SHE looks exactly the same, but Toni Childs has been on quite a journey to get to where she is today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the early 1990s, the American singer had the world at her feet. Her debut album, 1988's Union, was an international hit, producing such memorable songs as Stop Your Fussin', Don't Walk Away and Zimbabwe.</p><p>I've Got to Go Now, from her second album, House of Hope, was a No.5 hit in Australia.</p><p>While working on a fourth album, Childs plunged herself into charity work, starting the Dream a Dolphin charity for sick children. It was then she discovered she, too, was sick. She had a disease she had never heard of. It was Graves' disease, a thyroid condition brought on by stress.</p><p>``My right eye was popping out of my head and I was waking up with my hands and feet cramping,'' she says.</p><p>``These are classic symptoms. I didn't know what it was. I thought, `I know I need to go to an eye doctor', but I was so busy and my life was so crazy. I remember I was visiting my grandmother and my Aunt Linda said: `You know what? I bet you have Graves' disease'.''</p><p>A doctor told her that her resting pulse rate was 120 beats a minute and immediately put her on heart inhibitors.</p><p>``It was a shock because each one of the doctors said I had to dismantle my life,'' she says.</p><p>She put the brakes on her projects and recording career and spent the next eight years focusing on getting well. She describes the experience as like a forest fire.</p><p>``It wipes everything out for a while, and then you have to kind of regrow, heal, rebuild,'' she says. ``You've been dismantled and dismembered. And then all your bits start coming back together and it's wonderful.</p><p>``It gives you this amazing appreciation for life and the privilege of getting to do what you love.''</p><p>What she loves is music, so Childs is thrilled to have a new album out. It's titled, aptly, Keep the Faith.</p><p>Her journey to recovery brought with it other rewards. Part of her healing ritual was to treat her body with salt rubs, reminding herself that each part of her body was beautiful.</p><p>Gradually, she was able to wean herself off her medication. The process inspired her to create a line of organic bodycare products with names such as I Love My Body and I Love My Hair. They will be released in Australia next month.</p><p>She continues her ritual salt rubs by her outdoor shower at her home on the island of Kauai, Hawaii.</p><p>It was a serendipitous meeting that led her back to the recording studio.</p><p>She was performing in a production of The Vagina Monologues, with Eve Ensler, the show's creator, in the audience. She sought out Childs after the show.</p><p>Ensler told her that her record, Union, had had a profound impact on her life. When Ensler was down in the dumps and living out of her car, she listened to the record over and over.</p><p>S HE took Childs aside and told her she needed to start singing again.</p><p>``She said, `You need to be singing. This is your gift. Why aren't you singing?' She really gave me a hard time and then she asked me the craziest thing: `OK, I want you to write an anthem that will inspire people to end violence against women and children for all time'.</p><p>``And what's really scary was I actually contemplated whether I could do it or not. That's the funny part.''</p><p>With that inspiration, Childs wrote Because You're Beautiful for Ensler's documentary, Until the Violence Stops. The song won an Emmy.</p><p>``I wanted to address how women need to know they are beautiful,'' she says. ``I think we as women are really hard on ourselves. I think we have what I call a beauty wound, needing a lot of outside reflection that we're OK . . . we give our power away.</p><p>``It's centuries old, this wound, and I think there are certain things that happened in our history which created a situation for women to stay more in the background. I believe right now that a lot of women in the world, not all women in the world, are coming into their own.''</p><p>At 50, Childs is finding her voice again, both as a speaker and a singer.</p><p>She says her new record is more rootsy and homespun than her earlier work and she believes her voice is more ``open''.</p><p>The music industry has changed a lot since her previous record -- for the better, she thinks.</p><p>``It's actually becoming more karmically balanced,'' she says with a laugh. ``It also asks the artist to become more business savvy. With computers and the internet, and also the ability to really connect with people, it's much better now.''</p><p>Her life, too, is much more balanced.</p><p>She lives on a beautiful property with two dogs, a cat, a horse named Sunny, 50 ducks and 100 chickens.</p><p>A particularly plucky rooster likes to crow outside her window to let her know it's breakfast time. Then her day begins.</p><p>In the morning she'll work online with people on the US mainland and in the afternoon, when the time is right, she'll work with people in Australia.</p><p>``I feel like there's this amazing world,'' she says.</p><p>``We've got this life and then we've got this chance to live it to its fullness and each one of us is an amazing shooting star here for a short period of time. What are we going to do with it?''</p><p>Keep the Faith is out now. Toni Childs will perform at the Corner Hotel on October 1.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HERSUN-SHS-20080831-8-007-644322</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYHERAL2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4TB8-JMC0-TX5N-017T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Sunday Herald Sun (Australia)</publicationName><edition>8 - IE Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"08\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>August 31, 2008 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX002063</classCode><className>ENDOCRINE SYSTEM DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000511</classCode><className>DISEASES &amp; DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DNKD</classCode><className>SELF IMPROVEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DB57</classCode><className>AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000278</classCode><className>CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DPK4</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DPLG</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000410</classCode><className>COSMETICS &amp; TOILETRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX001070</classCode><className>RECORD RELEASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST000A4JW</classCode><className>SINGERS &amp; MUSICIANS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DPK4</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"60\"><classCode>ST000DPLG</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Rudd Government is currently promising thousands of jobs from the national broadband network rollout alone.</p><p>Many farmers will take the profits from selling up and retire or start new ventures. These activities, in themselves, will create additional employment.</p><p>I'm not sure what exactly Ms Eddy finds ``interesting'' about nations who suffer war or who starved looking after their farmers.</p><p>These countries are poor, and although Ms Eddy may like to pretend we are poor, most Australians are very rich and lead rich lifestyles. She may prophesise that we will be poor, but the fact is that today we are not.</p><p>My grandparents grew all their own food and cooked it themselves. My parents grew no food, buying all their food from a shop but still cooking it themselves.</p><p>My family buys some food from a shop, cooks rarely, and often pays for the food to be delivered on a plate, at a table. My kids wouldn't even know how to turn an oven on.</p><p>Is this bad? No.</p><p>Our lives and lifestyles continue to become easier, and if that means the dairy industry is not viable in Australia, so be it.</p><p>Stop your whingeing.</p><p>Stephen Rentsch,</p><p>Hill End</p><p>Government</p><p>must act on fires</p><p>THE Victorian Government, Department of Sustainability and Environment and CFA bureaucracy are counting down the days to the next fire season, presumably to jog the public to take action to protect themselves from the onslaught of fire this coming season.</p><p>It is the Victorian Government that needs to take action.</p><p>The State Government hasn't taken notice of the recommendations of its own inquiries into the 2006 and 2003 bushfires.</p><p>The main recommendation was the funding of more fuel reduction in state-controlled forested areas. This has not happened, despite DSE having ground crew with the expertise to carry out more burns using extra resources.</p><p>There may be a slight chance of doing some burns before this season, but spring burns generally produce poor fuel reduction. Cool autumn burns are best.</p><p>Most of the dialogue from the Government and its emergency management agencies is to throw the responsibility back on the public for their own safety.</p><p>There is plenty that could be done by government agencies and municipalities before this fire season to reduce the likelihood of fatalities in the event of fire.</p><p>Public road and reserve managers have been persuaded by misguided ideals from the green lobby to let roadsides and reserves become life-threatening hazards.</p><p>Roadsides that have had natural clear areas that were a safe haven for motorists or fauna in a fire are now planted with scrub and trees by suburban-orientated ``feel-good'' groups.</p><p>Planting trees is great, but they need to be planted in the right places with the right species.</p><p>Roadsides now are linear fuses, with the ability to burn with intense unnatural heat, and authorities expect the public to use them.</p><p>Many fires start on roadsides and reserves and many vehicle accidents are connected with roadside vegetation.</p><p>Because roads have many different species of native vegetation on them, the green lobby believes roads should be left alone, without ecological burns. This belief is wrong.</p><p>The cool autumn burns of the past are why these special species are still there.</p><p>Common sense needs to prevail over misguided ideology.</p><p>Maurie Killeen,</p><p>CFA volunteer,</p><p>Valencia</p><p>Why no state</p><p>of disaster?</p><p>PETER Ryan is right to say questions directed to the CFA at the bushfires royal commission should have been asked of Emergency Services Minister Bob Cameron (WT, July 29).</p><p>Premier John Brumby also should explain why counsel assisting Jack Rush QC found ``no serious consideration was given by any witness to advising that a state of disaster, under section 23 of the Emergency Management Act 1986, be declared on 7 February.''</p><p>Born out of Ash Wednesday, the Act allowed Mr Brumby to declare a state of disaster before Black Saturday, ensuring the State Disaster Co-ordination Centre at police headquarters was fully operational and the DSE chief fire officer and CFA chief officer were at their respective operations.</p><p>That didn't happen, despite the Premier's warning on Friday, February 6, that ``the forecast conditions would make it (February 7) the worst day ever in the history of our state''.</p><p>Fires were burning uncontrolled when the Premier made his Friday statement. It was a defining moment, requiring informed leadership.</p><p>Victorians need to know why the Premier failed to exercise his statutory authority before people died on Black Saturday.</p><p>Athol Hodgson,</p><p>president,</p><p>Forest Fire Vic Inc,</p><p>Parkdale</p><p>Tribute to a</p><p>gentleman</p><p>I WOULD like to pay tribute to Ted Kenna, VC, one of Australia's most extraordinary, inspirational and gracious men, who contributed significantly towards the betterment of this country.</p><p>Ted passed away on Wednesday, July 8, shortly after his 90th birthday. I had the privilege of knowing him for over 20 years.</p><p>He was a humble man and one of Hamilton's most loved and recognised figures.</p><p>Yet, at local events, Ted was just another one of the boys. He always avoided highlighting the events that led to him being awarded the Victoria Cross for his efforts during World War II.</p><p>His humility and courage are just two of the qualities that made him a much-loved member of the Hamilton community.</p><p>On May 15, 1945, during an attack on a Japanese position, and amid enemy fire, Ted stood and confronted the enemy.</p><p>He took out an entire Japanese machine-gun crew, single-handed. Ted survived the attack, only to be shot in the face three weeks later. He spent over 12 months in hospital.</p><p>Ted loved his sport. He played football for Hamilton Imperials when he returned from the war, kicking the winning point in the 1947 WDFL grand final. He successfully coached the St Mary's under-13s for many years.</p><p>Ted Kenna was a fair dinkum, loved Australian gentleman. My condolences go to his wife, Marjorie, and his family. He will be sadly missed.</p><p>David Koch,</p><p>Member for Western Victoria</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">WKLYTM-WKT200908051015189221</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">WKLYTM2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7W9K-DXG0-YBDY-R273-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244818</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1092\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Weekly Times (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - FIRST Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"08\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>August 5, 2009 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DHZK</classCode><className>FOOD SECTOR PERFORMANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N920000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT &amp;
