Here, once again,</p><p>is illicit sex - lonely, raw, isolated, almost violent. But</p><p>just as with Williams's works, the underlying current is one</p><p>of tenderness and compassion.</p><p> The story, the screenplay, the direction all flow from Zalman</p><p>King, whose 1986</p><p>movie 9 Weeks broke new ground in on-screen sensuality. He</p><p>has done it again with this tale of a Southern cotton princess</p><p>who can't keep her hands off a handsome carnival drifter.</p><p> Sherilyn Fenn, a once-brunette door bunny at the LA Playboy</p><p>Club, has been transformed into a striking blonde for her role</p><p>as the privileged sorority queen, April Delongpre.</p><p> She is about to marry Chad Douglas Fairchild (Martin Hewitt,</p><p>the impossibly precocious and handsome brat who made his screen</p><p>debut opposite Brooke Shields in Endless Love). April feels</p><p>a little confusion at the approaching lifetime commitment, though</p><p>Southern society declares the two are a perfect match.</p><p> While going through the motions of preparing for the wedding,</p><p>April takes her younger sisters to a travelling carnival. Looks</p><p>that would ignite a forest fire are exchanged with a rugged</p><p>ride attendant called Perry (Richard Tyson).</p><p> The two launch into a torrid affair - one which seems destined</p><p>to last but one weekend.</p><p> Things are made difficult by April's interfering grandmother,</p><p>Belle, and her old friend Sheriff Hawkins, who tries to run</p><p>the interloper out of town.</p><p> (Belle and Hawkins are superbly played by those old troupersLousie Fletcher and Burl Ives.)</p><p> April goes through with the wedding, but finds she still can't</p><p>give up Perry.</p><p> It's a movie where subtlety and emotional confusion are blended</p><p>with steamy sensuality to create a love story as far from plasticised</p><p>perfection as it's possible to get. It's a tale where love hurts,</p><p>love cheats - a movie that doesn't like the idea the sexual revolution is</p><p>dead.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>photo: richard tyson in two moon junction; Richard Tyson as Perry in \"Two Moon Junction\"</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-SUM8809183158175573</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYMAIL(SA)LTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:49KJ-J5G0-01S8-843D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"356\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Sunday Mail (SA)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1988 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"09\" year=\"1988\"><dateText>September 18, 1988 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>PERFECTION AS\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><classCode>STX001830</classCode><className>WEDDINGS &amp; ENGAGEMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009UM7</classCode><className>DRAMA LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DMYZ</classCode><className>EMOTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST000DMNV</classCode><className>SOCIAL ISOLATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>STX001695</classCode><className>CIRCUSES &amp; CARNIVALS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A man walked in and asked for a couple of rolls and drinks. I put my wallet on the counter and served him. Nice guy gave me a tip. When I turned around, he had already left and a few seconds later I realised my wallet had left, too. The next hour was spent cancelling credit cards and being angry at myself for being so stupid. But joy. One and a half hours later he knocked on the door waving the wallet. Turned out we have identical wallets and he took mine by mistake. Beautiful to know there are still honest people.\"</p><p>A colleague who visited Young last week to feast on cherries found that cherry trees are grown to perhaps two metres, so the human pickers can reach the berries. Then why, he asks, is that platform on a mobile hoist called a cherrypicker. Are there cherry trees in this world that grow to six and seven metres?</p><p>Epping Boys' High School's third-grade cricket team were a little astonished when told their match against Homebush last week had been washed out. In the middle of the drought, the game was abandoned before the first ball could be bowled because the outfield at Marsfield Park was a swamp not a remarkably localised downpour, but a burst water main.</p><p>More thanks to Kate Sieper, of the ABC at Tamworth (Column 8, yesterday) for more so-dry jokes from listeners. The winner was:</p><p>It's sooo dry that when I went out this morning to check on the livestock I found my blooming clothes horse had died (Des, of Tamworth).</p><p>And some more:</p><p>It's sooo dry we have to put rocks on the corners of our property to stop it from rolling up (Liz , of Guyra).</p><p>It's sooo dry up our way, the economic rationalists are coming for their holidays (Jack, of Armidale).</p><p>It's sooo dry the bartender's putting real rocks in our scotch (Vince, of Laverton).</p><p>It's sooo dry the town council had to close two lanes of the swimming pool (Margaret, of Bellata).</p><p>\"In fact,\" Kate says, \"the jokes have become so dry we haven't got the joke in one in six months!\"</p><p>David Meggitt, of West Pymble, has sent us a fragment of a plastic balloon, found on his back lawn, next to Lane Cove National Park. This bit of litter still has on it one logo for World Environment Day and another, Life on Earth -Department of the Environment-SAVE OUR SEAS. The balloon, apparently released on June 5, made two bloomers. First, it caused litter, second, had it floated to sea then burst, the Save our Seas hope would have been dashed.</p><p>Ding, dong, are you there? A year later, and Avon cosmetics hasn't woken up. Andreas Tillmann, of Armidale, found among male deodorants in the Avon catalogue: Forces of Nature Deodorant Body Sprays, scents inspired by nature ... Ground Zero.

Certainly you'll be able to count on A Day in the Life with its stunning orchestral crescendos from the 1967 masterpiece Sgt Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, but the pre-publicity promises old Beatle classics and some not so familiar songs, all given the quartet's soulful and melodic treatment.</p><p>The Promethean. 116 Grote Street, Adelaide.

Highlights from his days with the Commotions include Perfect Skin, Are You Ready to be Heartbroken?, Forest Fire and Rattlesnakes. The older material sits well alongside recent compositions such as Writers Retreat! and favourites from the solo years such as Margo's Waltz, Like Lovers Do and the encore, Undressed. Cole's singing, buoyed by clever wordplay, is enriched throughout by a swell of acoustic instruments. Splendid.</p><p>SEAN SENNETT</p><p>The Gov. 59 Port Road, Hindmarsh. Wednesday, 5pm.

Attendant on Maria Callas's meticulous voice, their molten bodyline and precision made the complex seven-couple pas de deux in Jiri Kylian's Un Ballo almost transcendental.

That is the central conceit behind this substantial dancework by Lucy Guerin, which premiered at Melbourne's Malthouse Theatre last year. Structurally, the work creates a triptych of progressive abstraction: the first section parodying news conventions, the second offering metaphorical representation of news consumption, and the third a visceral and sometimes unsettling choreographic expression of sensory overload.</p><p>EAMONN KELLY</p><p>State Theatre Centre.

Their former meeting room, the Toual Public Schoolhouse built in 1888, has become a wine-tasting facility.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The schoolhouse is the focal point of Ken Helm's idiosyncratic winery, 45km on the Barton Highway from Canberra.</p><p>Mention Canberra and most of us think politics, foreign embassies and the National Gallery, Parliament House and the Australian War Memorial. Tasting wine would be at the bottom of the scale in most national capital tourists' must-visit lists.</p><p> Yet John Richard Hardy (no relation to the Hardy winemaking clan) planted grapevines in Yass, on the edge of Canberra, in 1853.</p><p> That was 23 years before James Busby lit what became a \"vinous forest fire\" by establishing a vineyard in the Hunter Valley.</p><p> While the Hunter wine industry never stopped growing, Canberra's had a short life until resurrected as a cottage industry in 1971 by the Lake George and Clonakilla wineries.</p><p>Canberra wine's shot-in-the-arm came when Ken Helm quit his job as a CSIRO scientist two years later and established the district's first commercial vineyard and winery.</p><p> Every successful wine region has a champion -- a local winemaker who takes it upon himself to garner publicity, extolling the virtues of his area's produce.</p><p> Helm has been so successful that his face appears regularly on Canberra Tourism promotional material and in 2000 was given the title of \"Canberra's honorary ambassador\".</p><p> Inside Helm's quaint cellar door, besides thumbing your nose at those temperance wowsers with a schoolhouse tasting, you can inspect a working 1920s Bordeaux wine press that goes like the clappers during vintage.</p><p> The best way to visit Canberra is to enter the region along the Barton Highway and leave via the Federal Highway. This way you can choose from six Murrumbateman area wineries, grab an excellent yet inexpensive lunch at Barrique, built in 1879, then head to Canberra.</p><p> The latest, and for mine the best, attraction is the free-entry National Museum of Australia on the Acton Peninsula, which opened in March last year and welcomed a million visitors in its first 12 months.</p><p> I'm no \"culture vulture\" and until my wife dragged me into the National my perception of museums was stodgy and usually boring. Put those notions aside here.</p><p> The museum houses 172,000 historical and indigenous objects.</p><p> Five permanent exhibitions comprise Nation (symbols of Australia), Horizons (peopling of Australia since 1788), Eternity (stories from the nation's emotional heart), Tangled Destinies (Australia's land and people) and First Australians (a gallery of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders).</p><p> When leaving Canberra take the Federal Highway and inspect the showpiece Kamberra Wine Tourism Complex, opened in September 2000.</p><p> Joshua Moore, who received the area's first land grant in 1824, named his property Canberra after hearing local Aborigines calling the area Kamberra.</p><p> Set on 8.5ha and surrounded by vineyards, the complex has a showcase display of Canberra's 24 wineries, a restaurant and tasting room, glassware exhibits and 11am daily tours.</p><p> For $10 visitors get a souvenir glass, taste a dozen new-release wines and a 45-minute inspection of the winery.</p><p> It's the perfect end to a varied trip.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">HBTMRC-STS0209011036489414</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SUNDAYTASMANIANLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:46N5-MM50-015H-92B4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244810</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Sunday Tasmanian (Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"09\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>September 1, 2002, Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"97\"><className>CANBERRA TOURISM\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>N928120JM</classCode><className>EMBASSIES &amp;

Instead of returning to work on Monday as eager as a beaver with ADHD, I brought only a ham and pickle sandwich, a kiwifruit, a can of Pepsi Max and the spectre of doom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why? Well, the first three items comprised my lunch. The fourth, however, that spectre of doom thingy, is the real problem and it's been tracking me like David Gulpilil ever since I realised early in my holiday that my pay-TV service wants to kill me.</p><p>Informer once adored Austar - she was the partner who never answered back - and unlike those hoity-toity subscribers who fib about only watching National Geographic and the Discovery Channel, I have long relished Austar's baser options.</p><p>If pay-TV were a swimming pool, you'd find Informer splashing around in the shallow end, down there with the endless Seinfeld re-runs, the Poirot and Miss Marple repeats and the idiotic genius of Cops, I'm a Celebrity ... Get Me Out of Here! and Ladette to Lady.</p><p>Then there's all the movie channels which, while screening many films among the greatest in the cinematic pantheon, also feature those of lesser artistic and intellectual merit, but which do have bevies of half-naked, morally casual, gorgeous women shagging as if their plane was going down.</p><p>Despite such marvels, lately my affection for Austar has waned, mainly because the network keeps telling me I'm about to pop my clogs and thus consign Mrs Informer and the kids to destitution and life on the streets.</p><p>Believe me, Informer would never inflict any such fate . . . on the kids.</p><p>Yet it's difficult not to ponder one's demise when most Austar ad breaks now comprise some earnest twat/twats patronisingly flogging cheap online life insurance premiums to ensure one's family will be tickety-boo after I drop like a shot duck any minute now.</p><p>And if all that isn't depressing enough, the manner of one's departure is even more worrying. Research this week found examples of some of history's more bizarre exits. Such as -</p><p>*l 8th century Chinese poet Li Po drowned in the Yangtze River when, trying to hug the reflection of the moon, the dickhead fell out of his boat.</p><p>* 16th century Austrian crackpot Hans Steininger was nuts enough to grow his beard longer than he was tall. When fire tore through his township, a panicked Hans tripped over his beard, broke his neck and carked.</p><p>* In 1982, American David Grundman shot a 10m saguaro cactus, a chunk of which fell and crushed him. Killed and quilled. Serves him right.</p><p>* Sixth-century Greek wrestler Milo of Croton tested his strength by trying to rip a tree apart with his bare hands. When Milo's mitts got stuck, the cretin from Croton was eaten by wolves.</p><p>* In 1649, British military commander Sir Arthur Aston was beaten to death with his wooden leg.</p><p>* In 1816, American statesman Gouverneur Morris died after shoving a whale bone through his urinary tract.</p><p>* In 1991, American Carl Hulsey was butted to death by a goat he'd been training as, wait for it, a guard goat.</p><p>* In 1915, Tour de France winner Francois Faber was fighting in the trenches of World War I when, upon receiving a letter announcing the birth of his daughter, he cheered, gave away his position and was shot by a sniper.</p><p>* In 2010 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 20 people were killed when a plane crashed after a pet crocodile escaped and passengers stampeded the cockpit.</p><p>* In China last year, a 59-year-old chef died when drunken mates shoved a 50cm swamp eel up his clacker as a prank. The eel devoured his bowels, although Informer in no way suggests this proves some people's contention that Asians will eat anything.</p><p>* Turkish farmer Ismail Ayyildiz tried to cure his toothache by shooting the offending molar. You can guess the rest. Dental as anything.</p><p>* While this one is said to be an urban legend and was even adapted for a CSI episode, there might be some truth behind US firefighters finding a body dressed in full scuba gear in a scorched earth area after a forest fire.</p><p>The story goes the diver was swimming where choppers were drawing water to dump on the blaze. Yanked skyward in a bucket, he was dropped from 100m. Splash to splat.</p><p>* Finally, an Egyptian farmer lost three sons, a daughter and two cousins when each descended a well to rescue a chook and were dragged to their deaths by an undercurrent. The chook emerged alive.</p><p>There are so many ways to go and Informer really doesn't need one morbid insurance ad after another to remind me of that inevitable reality every time I turn on Austar to watch How to Look Good Naked, a 1975 episode of Columbo or the three-part series of The Brady Bunch when the family goes to Hawaii and finds Vincent Price.</p><p>Perish the thought, so to speak, but if Austar persists with this ghoulish practice I may be left with no choice but to return to the entertainment graveyard that is free-to-air TV.</p><p>Such is life, I suppose, when death comes at such a premium.</p><p>``In 2010 in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, 20 people were killed when a plane crashed after a pet crocodile escaped and passengers stampeded the cockpit</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">GCBULL-GCB-20111210-Q-027-607655</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QGCBUL2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:54FN-V9N1-F0JP-W2FF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">464543</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"845\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Gold Coast Bulletin (Australia)</publicationName><edition>Q - Paradise Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"12\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>December 10, 2011 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"67\"><classCode>ST000C43N</classCode><className>BONE FRACTURES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N515210CC</classCode><className>SUBSCRIPTION TELEVISION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000268</classCode><className>CELEBRITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>STX001033</classCode><className>LIFE INSURANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>ST0009ESX</classCode><className>INSURANCE PREMIUMS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"52\"><classCode>ST000A2WH</classCode><className>YANGTZE RIVER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Is it OK to break up with someone by changing your relationship status to single and just letting her figure it out?</p><p>A. No.</p><p>Every aspect of the network is examined and explored with amusing -- and useful -- tips, with illustrations by Aurora Andrews.</p><p>The authors reckon they have a good insight into Facebook as they were at Harvard University when Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg created the network there in 2004.</p><p>``Neither of us knew him well,'' Atwan says. ``He kept to his dorm room mostly.</p><p>``We all assumed he was programming, but in retrospect -- since he knew he was about to found a $15 billion company -- he was probably spending his days splashing around in a kiddie-pool filled with caviar.''</p><p>At first the social network was limited to the Harvard community but Atwan says once the word was out the interest grew rapidly.</p><p>``It spread like a forest fire,'' he says.</p><p>``At first it was just the computer geeks, then the computer nerds, then the wonks, and finally the analog geeks.</p><p>``Before anyone knew it, the president of the university was `poking' (virtual attention seeking) everyone.''</p><p>So what is it then that makes people crowd together on Facebook -- the most popular social network website in Australia, according to the internet monitors Hitwise.</p><p>Atwan attributes its success to Facebook's ability to allow users to keep an eye on what their friends are doing.</p><p>``Never before have people been afforded an opportunity to spy on their friends without being barked at by their friends' dogs,'' he says.</p><p>He also likens the networking to the online equivalent of hanging out in the village square.</p><p>``Especially in America,'' he says, ``where the actual village squares are polluted by poor former investment bankers.</p><p>``People are looking for a safe place to hang out with their friends, `frenemies' (an enemy disguised as a friend), and strangers, without the awkwardness of eye contact.''</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-CML-20081027-1-044-318331</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4TSD-X4Y0-TXX1-F0NR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Courier Mail (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - First with the news Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"10\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>October 27, 2008 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0009VRA</classCode><className>FACEBOOK INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS519130 INTERNET PUBLISHING &amp;

Count me as a traditionalist, even though we're talking about cyber, is that there still has to be some kind of violence, some kind of physical effect, so the so-called cyber war that hit Estonia several years ago, essentially a couple of their public facing websites on government institutions got defaced, it would be a lot like someone running up to the parliament and spray painting the side of it.</p><p>And then some of the traffic was blocked, it would be like someone standing there in the road blocking it for a couple of hours. If these were physical things, if it was people doing the spray painting, or standing in the road, you wouldn't describe that as war.</p><p>MARK COLVIN: You could use another analogy, you could say that one country bombs another one's power station, kills nobody, that's defiantly an act of warfare and it makes just as much difference, just as much damaged doesn't it?</p><p>PETER SINGER: Exactly. But fortunately we've not had that happen yet. We've not had someone carry out this kind of attack that knocks power grids offline or disrupts traffic in a way that people die or the like. We haven't had...</p><p>MARK COLVIN: But if they did by cyber means, that would be an act of warfare, just as bombing a power station would?</p><p>PETER SINGER: Exactly, I don't think a prime minister or a president will care whether the means was with software or hardware. They'll judge it by the ends; they'll judge it by the final effect.</p><p>If someone lit a forest fire, even though, and hundreds of people were killed, even though they used a match rather than killing with a knife or a gun, no one would say well, that wasn't a bad deed.</p><p>So at the end of the day I think we'll judge a lot of the effects of cyber war in traditional manners.</p><p>Now the key here cyber war in all its likelihood is probably going to be involving both traditional, physical operations and computer operations. And a good illustration of this is what we've seen Israel do a couple of years ago, for example, where they use cyber means to turn Syrian air defences off and then flew jets overhead which dropped real bombs. It was the cyber and the traditional working together, that's probably the future of both war and cyber war.</p><p>MARK COLVIN: But in traditional warfare there are the Geneva conventions and a bunch of other rules, at the moment there are no rules in cyber warfare, am I right?</p><p>PETER SINGER: We have this debate as to whether the old rules should apply and if they're sufficient and then if not what can we do about them. Now we get into a problem of can we then walk the talk? So as an illustration, NATO put together a group of international legal experts and said 'you know what - we should write a manual about the laws of cyber war'.</p><p>And they wrote this manual, it's a very good document, except then the US government looked at the manual and said, 'you know what, great manual, but we're not going to say that that definitively applies to us, we want to keep all our options.' That's just within NATO...</p><p>MARK COLVIN: It took the UN to create the Geneva Conventions, is there any prospect that the UN could do anything about this?</p><p>PETER SINGER: Well it took the UN, but remember it also took the horrors of World War Two, that's unfortunately the long history of international law - in fact the foundation of international law itself, going back to the 1600s. Usually we wait for the bad thing to happen and then we collectively build up a rule based structure to try to prevent it from happening again.</p><p>Hopefully we won't repeat that pattern with cyber, but I'm not going to bet my house on it.</p><p>MARK COLVIN: Well the obvious question from that is what is the nightmare scenario?</p><p>PETER SINGER: I think to me the nightmare scenario is not the clear cut use of this in a war, it's actually the fuzzy space in between, before you get to formally declared wars, where one side may carry out a cyber attack and think it's not an act of war and the other side will interpret it as an act of war.</p><p>This fuzziness also affects the who, so not just what you're doing but the who. A number of nations, particularly the Russias and Chinas of the world, have been using cut-out groups, criminal groups, people's militia, basically to conduct attacks but say 'well that was not us, that someone else.'</p><p>And in many ways we're back to a parallel of the 1600 and 1700s where you had navies who were clearly official representatives of the King, you had pirates who were clearly criminals. And then you had this thing in the middle called privateers, they would kind of go back and forth between the legal and the illegal.</p><p>We have the cyber equivalent of that right now in a lot of different places. And that's disturbing, that's where bad things might come, from miscalculation.</p><p>MARK COLVIN: Has the United States lost moral high ground because of the Snowden revelations? I mean it's all very well to talk about China and Russia, but somebody will always now snap back with, 'well look at what the NSA did'.</p><p>PETER SINGER: It's very clear that the Snowden scandal - revelations - however you want to frame it, have been a hammer blow to Americans' standing, both in terms of our bilateral relationships, when we're pressing china on something they point their finger back at us, right now, even if it's on things justified or not, to the discourse over internet freedom has clearly been harmed by this, to frankly American technology companies themselves are very angry at the NSA because it's costs them business.</p><p>And so this is why it's had a long-term affect well beyond just the immediate sort of revelations of what they're doing.</p><p>The question is how do we move past it, how do we power through it? We'll see some reforms, it's already happening within our legislature and then other parts of it frankly, and this also applies to our Australian partners, there's things that aren't going to change and it's just the new context of a post-Snowden world.</p><p>MARK COLVIN: Peter Singer of the New America Foundation.

So the first time you see your forensic case where that body, that beautiful body is disrupted, whether it's disrupted by fire, by decomposition, by trauma, whatever it may be, you almost look beyond that to what it was and you compare the two, and in the comparison of the two, it allows you to determine what happened. What happened between that perfect intact body, you know what it should look like, and what you have in front of you. So it becomes the investigation, it becomes the puzzle. And we all love puzzles.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unknown:</emphasis> The power of flies and maggots is extraordinary. It's said that three flies can get rid of the flesh of a horse faster than a lion can because of the way that they lay their eggs, the eggs turn into maggots, the maggots eat the body, and the next set of flies come along, and it's this biological process that sounds quite gruesome when you talk about it and it is quite gruesome when you see it in action, but is extremely effective.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Good morning, I'm Robyn. So, forensics in the 21st century. From <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sherlock Holmes</emphasis> to ABC's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Harrow</emphasis>, people have always loved a good mystery, particularly the sometimes gruesome and always intriguing portrayal of forensic science in popular culture. And it seems always at dinner time Amelia Fox is extracting a liver or opening a mouth full of maggots.</p><p>But is modern forensics really like we see on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CSI</emphasis> or those gritty and dark Scandinavian crime shows? Today we are going to indulge our inner forensic pathologist and take a glimpse into the lives and work of four real-life forensic scientists, from DNA to the dark web, they will reveal at least some of their secrets to solving a case.</p><p>Our first guest has worked in forensic science education for over 24 years and is currently director of the Leverhulme Research Centre for Forensic Science at the University of Dundee in Scotland. Please welcome Niamh Nic Daeid.</p><p>Next please welcome a leader in forensic genetics from the University of Technology in Sydney. He spent his career finding better ways to extract and analyse DNA, imparting his knowledge to students of forensic science, Professor Dennis McNevin.</p><p>Our next guest works in the area of forensic taphonomy, which is the science of estimating the time of death from animal or human remains. She is also developing methods for the successful location and recovery of victims' evidence in mass disaster scenarios. Also based at the University of Technology Sydney, please welcome Maiken Ueland.</p><p>Finally we welcome the inaugural chair of cybersecurity at the University of the Sunshine Coast and director of the Institute for Cyber Investigations and Forensics. He is also the managing director and co-founder of IDCARE, the national identity and cyber support community service. Needless to say you won't find him online: Professor David Lacey.</p><p>So Niamh, what do you think of Amelia Fox, frankly?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> She is a very nice lady. Amelia Fox stars in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Silent Witness</emphasis>, and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Silent Witness</emphasis> is a really great program, it's entertainment folks, that's what it is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And what about the rest of the shows we're seeing?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> I would argue the same, shows like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CSI</emphasis> and other crime dramas are exactly that, they are fantastic at what they do, which is to entertain us, but forensic science isn't like that. 40% of what you see in CSI does not exist, folks, when it comes to science, and so they build expectations. When we do have to do this job for real, they build expectations of the jury, they build expectations of the non-scientists as to what it is we can deliver and actually we can't, and so there is a real significance behind this as well.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> One thing I didn't know, that forensics comes from the Latin <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">forensis</emphasis> which means 'in open court', and to this day the endpoint and real value of forensic science is to find a person guilty or innocent of a crime in a public court of law. So Niamh, you were virtually born (is this right?) into forensics?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> Oh look, there I am. Kind of. I was cute once! My family background...I come from a family of scientists, one is a botanist, one is a chemist. And very early on it as I was growing up they started to get involved in the investigation of fires and fire scenes and where the job to be done there is to determine the origin of the fire, the cause of the fire and how the fire spread through a building. And so as a result of that we were always exposed...because they worked for themselves, they worked in a private company for the civil courts, not criminal, we were always exposed to conversations about what the little burnt black thing looked like in the photograph and which way up should the photograph be and what does it mean and how do you put it into context of the story of the case, the story of the fire. And so I was always, as I said, exposed to that from a very early age. And to me it crystallised a number of things. The very first one was that women can be involved in science just as much as men and actually can hold their own very well indeed. The second was that science is useful, so that what you do as a scientist actually can have real-world impact because we were using our scientific understanding to unfold the story of this event. So from that early age, 10, 11, I always remember it to be a part of just our family upbringing.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Dennis, for you, DNA and your profession, was that serendipitous?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> It was. I mean, I always grew up entranced by nature, and like probably many of you in this audience, I used to love watching <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Life on Earth</emphasis>, which was a David Attenborough marvellous genre-defining documentary about the origins of life, but I studied engineering. But I used to do biochemical engineering, so it was the engineering of using bacteria to treat wastewater, as it turns out. But they do this because of their DNA.</p><p>I then moved to Canberra, and there are no engineers...well, there are very few opportunities for engineers in Canberra. I saw a job advertised for a forensic scientist at the Australian Federal Police forensic laboratories, and I thought, look, why not, I'll have a go. So I applied for the job. I'm pretty sure I was the only applicant. And to my great surprise they gave me the job. And I spent the first three months of that job hiding from people at morning tea time so that I wasn't exposed for the fraud that I was. But I did read up and immerse myself in the world of forensics for that three months and that I felt confident enough to approach people in the lunchroom and that was the start of my career in forensics.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> More or less what are the issues you deal with?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> My job is to look at the use of the DNA in the courtroom, so how can we make use of DNA to answer questions that courts are interested in. And of course that generally revolves around is one person guilty, is one person innocent. And DNA can tell us a lot but not everything about that. And Niamh alluded to some of the harm that has been done by the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">CSI</emphasis> programs. The very presence of DNA tends to create an impression of guilt, and that is not the case. DNA can be at a crime scene for many different reasons, and part of my job is to try and explain those reasons.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Maiken, you come from Norway. Tell me, is taphonomy a Norwegian name?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maiken Ueland:</emphasis> No, definitely not. In fact in Norway we don't really have forensics, so I was grown up always intrigued by a crime and Scandinavian crime stories. I loved puzzles and I loved just playing outdoors and was so intrigued by signs in the body and everything that was happening, but I had no idea what forensics was. And in fact when I was 15 years old we were asked to write an essay in school; Where do you see yourself in 10 years? And I was so clear when I said 'I would like to be a doctor working for the police'. And everyone was like, what is that? Because I didn't actually know what forensics or taphonomy was but I knew exactly what I wanted to do, I wanted to help police solve crime. But because I didn't know how to go about it, I thought I had to be a doctor, study medicine and then join the police force, which is not really the way it works here. I googled it, ecstatic, ran around, and I was like, yes, of course, exactly, that's what I want to do. And then I attended a lecture at university my first year on taphonomy, and I was absolutely sold. It had everything, it had all the mysteries about the human body and how we can use that to solve everything. So taphonomy deals with everything that happens to an organism from the moment it ceases to breathe and until it is found. And it deals with what happens to the environment, to the body, and everything around it and how we can use that to solve crime. And I've never looked back since.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> So are you dealing always with crime, or is it also accidents or some disaster?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maiken Ueland:</emphasis> So our victims can be anything from individuals that have just gone bushwalking and unfortunately they've gotten lost and eventually they perish, and then we deal with the victims of crime, but it's also victims of mass disasters which are unfortunately happening more and more commonly now due to global change, but also genocides or war crimes. So there's a series of different individuals that we are trying to help.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> How do you get used to the horror of the scene?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maiken Ueland:</emphasis> Well, it's not an easy situation and you never really get used to it and I don't think you should be getting used to it, but you just have to remember why you're doing the job, and what you're doing, you're helping the victim and their family, so that's why you're there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And David, cybercrime and so on, how did you get into the field? If your name <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">is</emphasis> David, that is.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> I graduated with an accounting degree, became a graduate accountant, and within about two weeks thought this is not for me. So, much to my parents' disgust I joined the army. And I worked within the intelligence domain, and law enforcement got wind that there was somebody in intelligence that had an accounting degree, 'you've got to come to us and do fraud'. The thing that kept me interested in this field is the constant evolution of the criminal actor and how they are exploiting the environment to their own ill-gotten gain, and what occurred over that 20-year period was obviously the growth and dominance of the online environment and the need to adapt.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> What you seem to be saying is if your basis is solid, you could end up in all sorts of places, including cybercrime.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> Absolutely. At the end of the day I think what's common across all of our different disciplines is the thirst for truth and fact and being able to translate that in a way that a court can understand.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And how do you keep up with the changing technology? Every time I blink they've done something different.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> The thing that I've benefited mostly from is the work of IDCARE. So IDCARE, for those that haven't heard of it, which is a good thing in a way, it's a community support service that is free and anonymous if you experience cybercrime or identity theft. It's physically located an hour drive up the road on the Sunshine Coast, and it's resourced with counsellors and psychologists that help people through the event that they're dealing with. And so the benefit that I have is that I have this call centre that's telling me what the community is experiencing every day and how the criminals are evolving, and that keeps us honest about how we are applying our trade.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, it's amazing, I went to a place in Edith Cowan University in Perth and there's a whole room there, they are tracking all sorts of things coming in from all sorts of banking systems to see whether there is a furphy coming through and they can then warn the people or warn the bank. And I've got this vision of there being various small dark rooms with various twisted people, nerds in strange clothing, existing on chocolate bars and maybe Diet Coke and all night going through, plotting. Have you ever come across the criminals unit yourself and are they like that?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> I guess my apprenticeship was 20 years working in national security and law enforcement, and almost all of that time exclusively was working within agencies that were exempt from the Privacy Act, so they had extraordinary powers, they could collect anything, as long as it fit the particular investigation's domain. And in some respects I was the antichrist of privacy, and since establishing IDCARE it is actually the opposite of that, it's about how we protect people and their privacy and how do we educate them about what the risks are when bad things happen and what are the steps you can take to mitigate those risks. So my career to date has been this kind of ying and yang of privacy and personal information. And technology is an absolutely amazing thing that we should all embrace, but like anything there's risks, but there is useful steps you can take to mitigate that. So the value of the knowledge that we maintain is actually from you, it's from what you're experiencing. That's what keeps us current and that's what is really important.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> So much for the background. Let's go to the second part of our discussion, which is from the crime in the lab to the courtroom, and so gathering and analysing and presenting evidence to the judicial system is a special kind of procedure. Maiken, take us to AFTER, as in the afterlife, but it stands for the Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research (say that when you're pissed!), which you now lead, and how Australia got to have the first body farm outside the USA.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maiken Ueland:</emphasis> So a body farm is a place where people can donate their body to science, with the purpose of studying human decomposition, so how the body breaks down after death. And these were started in the US by a forensic anthropologist, Dr William Bass, and there was one particular case that he was working on where he ended up getting the age, the sex and the height of the victim correct, but he got the time of death (so how long the individual had been deceased for) wrong by over 100 years, which is quite outrageous. So you can't really say, oh yeah, he has been dead for a year and it has actually been 101 years. You can't really go to court with that. So allegedly this was the case that led him to open the very first body farm because he realised that we just don't know enough about decomposition and preservation. So what had happened in this particular case was that the body had been embalmed and that's why it looked so well preserved.</p><p>So he opened that very first facility in the US, and then it took about 20 years, and then additional of these research facilities...they call them body farms, we like to call them Taphonomic Research Facilities, it just doesn't sound as good in media. So after about 20 years, more of these opened up in the US in different climatic regions because we know that climate plays such a major impact on how the body decomposes. And if you look at the climate map, comparing the climate in the US and Australia, it's very different. And if we had similar maps of the tree coverage, for example, or if we look at the soil types between the US and Australia, if you looked at the type of insects, if you looked at the type of scavengers there would be, all of these are going to influence how the body is decomposing. They are going to be very different between the US and Australia. So that's why in 2016 we opened the Australian Facility for Taphonomic Experimental Research, and it was featured a fair bit in the media. And it's located in the outskirts of Sydney in a very remote location to mimic the kind of environment that the police would often get bodies being found in.</p><p>And at AFTER we are looking at four different types of research. We look at how we can search and locate for human remains and then how we can best recover these individuals and then determining their time of death, so how long they've been deceased for, and then lastly we look at how we can best identify these individuals. And we aim to better develop the current methods that we have but also developing new methods, all so that we can better assist law enforcement so we can ultimately provide answers to the families.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> From what you say about getting the time wrong by 100 years reminds me of a lovely exhibition I saw in London, it was called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Tzar</emphasis>, because they were murdered 100 years ago, the entire family, and they couldn't actually find some of the kids, and they dug up another site because they happened to have some clues as to where it was, they were doing tests to find out whether it was in fact the family of the Tzar. And they roped in various other people who were connected, such as Prince Philip, they got his DNA and got a family profile and found indeed it was a couple of the boys who were involved. And they also managed to solve the problem...one of the survivors supposedly was the princess claiming to be the last one of the family. And they found out that she was in fact a cleaner or something else, which is amazing how you can now have the technology to find out all sorts of amazing stuff.</p><p>But Niamh, despite your efforts not to do what your parents did, did you eventually become a forensic chemist working on fire investigation?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> The answer to your question is yes. So I teach fire investigation, and many of my research students have done work on both the fire scene investigation side of things but also analysis of debris, so materials you take back out of a fire. Fire investigation is many things, so an understanding of the combustion of different materials underpinning the work we do as fire investigators is having to have a knowledge of fire science and fire engineering, both essentially laboratory-based skills, and the two of them together create an overarching skill set called fire dynamics. So we have that.</p><p>When we you're a fire investigator you also do something that many forensic scientists don't do, and that is that you talk to real people, you talk to witnesses because we need to understand the story of what happened prior to the fire, what did normal look like, what was the building usually used for, who was the last person to leave, what's the lock-up procedures for them leaving that shop or premises or whatever it is, who saw the fire, what did they do, what did the firefighters do, where did they go, what colour was the smoke, what colour were the flames, where was the first fire discovered? And so on and so forth. So all of that witness information is really important for us.</p><p>So we get witness information, we've got a solid understanding of the chemistry and the physics and the engineering behind a particular building and how it will respond, and added to that we need to have an understanding of how electricity works because electricity is your friend in a fire if you are a fire investigator, because things will fail, so fuses or fuse boxes or appliances or whatever they might be will fail and will leave physical evidence behind them of the time of that failure. So you take those four blocks and you put them together when you walk into a black room that is blackened with black stuff and you're trying to figure out the black detail in the black background as to how and where the fire started and then what caused it to start and then why did it move to where it moves. So there is a very defined pathway in fire development that when you are skilled enough to know what you're doing, then you can find your way through that pathway.</p><p>I work on quite a number of different types of fire cases, and they can be anything from small-scale domestic fires to very large-scale. And one of the roles I am currently involved with is acting as an expert witness for the Grenfell Tower fire, so my job there was to work for the public inquiry and to review the cause of that fire; where did it start, and how did it start?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> I wanted to ask you about forest fires and whether you can go into a forest fire and say fairly quickly whether it looks like lightning or whether it looks like some villain did it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> Forest fires are particularly challenging, they really are. I know it's a huge issue here in Australia, as it is in other parts of the world. There are particular techniques that you can use to try to track where the fire developed or where it might have started from, and often that's early news stories, early reports from people who have seen that first fire event occur. For things like lightning strikes versus some other activity, obviously you can track things like, well, was there a storm there at the time where the fire is alleged to have begun. But investigating wildlife fires is particularly challenging.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Dennis, DNA intelligence, why is this such an exciting area at the moment?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> Well, because it has opened up whole new possibilities for investigation of crime. So up until fairly recently, the way DNA was used in forensics was that there was biological evidence found at a crime scene, so it might be a bloodstain or saliva left on a glass or a drink bottle, and you then had a suspect and you took a reference sample from that suspect and you compared the two. And if they matched, then there was some evidence linking that individual with the crime, not guilt but there was certainly an association with that crime. And so you'd look at the other evidence to corroborate that.</p><p>But if there is no suspect that matches that crime scene evidence or there is no database hit, so the other way you can obtain a match is to search your DNA profile against a criminal DNA database. If you don't get a match to either of those, then traditionally that has been a bit of a dead end. But we now know that we can find other information about the donor of that DNA that might help us narrow a pool of suspects.</p><p>So, for example, we are able to predict the ancestry of that individual. And so these ancient lineages can be mixed, as they have done over the history of human evolution to produce different populations that can be combined in different ways to produce the people that we all are. And our job then is to predict what that individual's ancestors came from, and there techniques that we can use to do that but it's not always an easy task, especially in the modern world where there has been a lot of immigration, many marriages between cultures that didn't occur 100 years ago but which now do, so our genetics are very, very complex. But we do have tools that help us to make those estimations.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And when you make that sort of explanation in court, do they say, 'Oh yeah, that makes sense'?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> No, no, they do not. I will draw a distinction actually, that is not meant for court, that is meant for investigators because that information is designed to lead a forensic investigator to the suspect. Once you find your suspect, you can then take a standard DNA profile and match it to the crime scene evidence and that's much more easily understandable for the court.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Yes, well, when you think the DNA is about 3 billion base pairs, that's an enormous code. And what you get are bits of it, and so you're looking for patterns that might fit in here, there or somewhere else, and so it's not an infallible thing, is it, necessarily?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> It is not. I mean, certainly modern DNA profiles, the way that it's presented in court is as a probability. So, what's the probability that this profile would occur in a random individual in the population? Of course the more rare the chance, the more improbable that it will be found in a random member of the population, the greater the strength of that evidence because it's less likely to come from somebody else. But we don't always get full, clean, beautiful profiles, we often get very degraded profiles where we only see some of the markers that we are looking for, and in those instances the probability that a random member of the population could be the source is much greater, and so then that's a difficult job, is to explain that to the court about this reduced strength of the evidence.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And you're listening to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Science Show</emphasis> on RN, with a panel at the World Science Festival, on forensics and the future.</p><p>David, you may have gathered I'm fairly old-fashioned, and I do not have a mobile phone and therefore I cannot be zapped, as far as I can tell, and when it comes to banking I keep all my coins in a kangaroo scrotum under the bed. Am I safe these days?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> You're safe. We should all have kangaroo scrotums.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> How vulnerable is everybody else? What are you looking at in the ways of the complexity of the crimes these days? You hinted at it before but what's going on?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> So the most recent surveying done by the Commonwealth government suggests that around 1.2 million Australians a year are falling victim to cybercrimes. But the more complex ones, and we are looking at anywhere between 200,000 and 400,000 people a year, is where criminals are looking through an online environment or off-line to start with but then online, to steal and misuse your personal information, and where that can lead to then applying for credit in your name, such as a mortgage or a personal loan or a mobile phone account or a government service. And at the moment if you're in that boat you will on average spend around 24 to 30 non-consecutive hours trying to respond to that event. You will probably have to engage at least eight different organisations about 20 times, and it will be on you to prove it. Most of our time is spent through counselling and coaching via knowledge exchange, it's about educating, and a lot of the people that are impacted by these types of crimes benefit from now that greater knowledge, and they feel more confident and comfortable about engaging online. So it's certainly impacting a lot of people and increasingly so.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And how many of you would there be, because surely with so much going on we need about several hundred, David?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> No, we've got about 30 people now on the books. We started off with one and a half people in a garage six years ago. And I was very fortunate, I was working in a very senior position in government in a national security agency, and I was at an event like this in Melbourne, it was a bunch of financial planners and investors and I was presenting on investment fraud in my capacity of working for government. At the end of the conference we were milling about and I had an accountant from Sydney approached me, and he said, 'The tax office has just said that five of my clients have had their tax file numbers compromised, but they haven't told me anything about what I need to do about it.' And he was literally in tears, he was seeing his small business just slip through his fingers.</p><p>So I picked up the phone and I spoke to a colleague who heads up serious non-compliance at the tax office, he lives in Perth, and I spoke with another colleague who is a senior member of the Attorney General's Department. And I scribbled on the back of this conference agenda what was a response plan, and I rang this guy back and I said, 'Look, I've made a couple of enquiries, here's the five things that we recommend you do.' And his emotional state changed like that. And I thought why doesn't that exist? And at the time, by some miracle, all states and territories had agreed to this national identity security strategy, and one of the key pillars was a service that supports the community when this thing happens, and they knew the cupboard was bare, nothing had been done.</p><p>So I had a conversation, I said, 'Look, do you want me to explore whether we should set this up?' And they said, 'Sure Dave.' And so I did an 18-month feasibility study, spoke to community groups around the country, and what came away from that observation was: 1: it's real, it's en masse; 2: what people need is pragmatic support; and, 3: they don't want an IT geek, they want someone who could speak English and translate and can support them emotionally because it's quite a traumatic situation. So our counsellors say if you are not harmed by the crime, you most certainly will be by the response, that's the reality.</p><p>So the journey is very much a complex one, but it's one we had to make the decision early on; do we hire a bunch of IT people or do we hire a bunch of behaviouralists and then educate them in cyber and cyber forensics. And we went very much with the behaviouralists. And so they are an amazing team. And then the decision was, well, where do you put it? I said, well, I run a call centre, you may as well run it from the Sunshine Coast, so hence we moved from Canberra to the Sunshine Coast.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And if you think you've been zapped, where do you go? Who do you call first?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> Well, most crooks are after your money, so it's not a bad idea having a chat to your financial institution in the first instance, but IDCARE is a free service and it's anonymous, we don't need to know who you are, in fact it's better we don't know who you are. We know we're a target. We've had attempts by foreign governments infiltrating IDCARE, and our natural defence is we don't know who you are, we know your first name and your post code, so if that's compromised, so what. If you come to IDCARE, you come early and we will give you that tailored response plan. Most of you probably haven't heard of it, but we get referrals from the Department of Human Services. So everyone in this room has a Medicare card, mostly. We get referrals from the tax office or from the police or from the major banks or from Telstra. So we are one or two degrees of separation from you, you just don't know it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> So much for that, and the third discussion is really going into the courtroom proper, and Dennis, when it comes to collecting the DNA and making sure we've got some sort of carriage, you don't just pick it up and put it in your pocket.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> DNA is ubiquitous, we all have it and we all shed it. And the problem is that there are many people who access a crime scene after the crime has occurred, and we have to make sure that the integrity of the DNA that has been collected from the crime scene isn't contaminated or polluted with other sources of DNA. So we have very rigorous procedures in place to try and guard against that sort of occurrence. You also have to remember that DNA collected at a crime scene could have been deposited before the crime was committed as well as after the crime is committed.</p><p>The other term that is used a lot in forensics and is very important is what we call 'chain of custody', accounting for the evidence from the time it's collected at the crime scene to the time it goes to court, who has had access to it, where has it been stored, under what conditions has it been stored. And we have to be able to demonstrate all of those things in court because they are frequent challenges, and for good reason. One of the worst things that could possibly happen in a DNA lab is that samples get mixed up, and I don't need to explain to you how that could lead to a grave...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Has that happened?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> Well, it has certainly been implied, yes. Modern forensic labs have very good, rigorous processes in place, but you can't be complacent because yes, it can be the difference between guilt and innocence and has a profound effect on someone's life.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> One of the profoundly difficult areas of forensic science, and it's not just for DNA, it's for evidence in general, is about what we understand around the transfer of materials. So you're all sitting down on the chairs that you're sitting on, some of the fibres from your clothing will transfer to the chairs and you will pick up the fibres of clothing of people who've sat there before you, and what does that manifest itself like, and how long do those fibres persist after you get up and walk about?</p><p>And it's the same with DNA. If I shake Dennis's hand and then pick up my water bottle, then it's quite conceivable that I will transfer some of his DNA to an item he's never touched. And so it's the meaning of the trace in the context of a case that is really important. So that idea of transfer persistence or background abundance or how frequent things are is also something that is really, really important for us as forensic scientists to be able to understand and explain our evidence once we get into the courtroom.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> I mean, most of the challenges around DNA evidence these days are not around the science. The science is pretty well bedded down, it's how did it get there.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And Maiken, is your science also bedded down? You've been using pigs for a long time on your body farm to see how long things take to decay, and when you take an estimate from the bacon, does it match in court? If you said what the pig does and what the human does is kind of equivalent, does that stand up anymore?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maiken Ueland:</emphasis> Pigs have been used because they have a similar internal anatomy, they have similar internal bacteria and they lack a heavy fur, which most humans do. There has always been these discussions on whether they decompose the same way that a human would, and we don't actually know. And there's some people that say if you want to figure out how a human decomposes, you have to use humans.</p><p>So when we opened AFTER in 2016, one of the very first studies that we did was to look at a comparison on visual changes between a human and pigs with the direct comparison between the two. And what we found in our unique environment is that human does not equal pig. They cannot really be used. And what we found was that the pigs go through the stages of decomposition in a very uniform manner. So the entire being would show one stage at a time, whereas the humans would go through something we call differential decomposition. That means that the way of determining times of death for a human is a little bit more complex because one part of the body will look a lot older than another part. It doesn't mean that you can't use pigs at all because humans can only be done at these very specialised facilities like AFTER, and it takes very specific ethic and legal requirements to use humans for research. But if you are going to use pigs you have to be very cautious and there needs to be some form of error that is being introduced in your time of death estimate.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And do you have many humans on your farm these days?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maiken Ueland:</emphasis> We have 68 donors and we've been open for four years, so it's quite a substantial number, a lot more than what we predicted. We thought we'd maybe get 10 donors our first year, and we had 22. So it was a bit overwhelming, but it just shows the amazing support that we've had from the community and the massive support we've had from our donors.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> And if I made an offer, would you have me?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maiken Ueland:</emphasis> Of course!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> She'll sign you up on the spot.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Niamh, why was the 2009 US National Academy of Sciences report on forensics so important for you? And you mentioned Sue Black before, how is she involved?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> It was a real watershed in forensic science history, not just in the US. And what the NAS Report, as it's called, essentially said is that there isn't really very much science behind them at all, so things like fingerprints, ballistics, matching bullets to guns, things like shoe prints or looking at the marks that your shoes make, tool-mark comparison, all of these comparative sciences had very little underpinning valid science to enable us to call them science in the first place. And that was quite shocking to many people. It was quite revealing. Since that time there has been a lot of research money released, particularly in the United States. We needed to make a change, we needed to try to look to see how are we going to input proper scientific work to underpin the forensic science evidence that is presented in the courts.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2016 and a further report came out from the US called the PCAST Report, and this report said you've had seven or eight years now to try to address the deficiencies you were told about in 2009, and you actually haven't addressed any of them, and in actual fact while there are some studies now looking at error rates in things like fingerprint comparison and there has been certainly advances in DNA technology, you still really haven't addressed these issues.</p><p>So when Sue and I worked together at the University of Dundee when I went over there, we said we need to try to do something about it, and we formulated a bit of a mad plan, and that plan was to bring forensic scientists into the same domain as all of the other people in the chain-the people who work at the crime scene, law enforcement, the scientists, the lawyers and the judges-and let's bring us all together to have an open, frank discussion for the first time about the challenges that forensic science faces and let's just lance the boil a little bit.</p><p>And so we did that and we had the most marvellous conversation in the Royal Society where they funded us to bring people from around the world together. And as a consequence of that conversation we were tasked with doing two things. One of the things was saying all of these challenges that we are now all agreeing forensic science faces, could the pair of you just fix that please, that would be great, fantastic. Okey-doke. And the other was we have a real issue and everybody here has said it, about how we communicate our science, and if we can't communicate it, then you can't understand what it is that we are trying to tell you because you, the public, are the people that actually make the decision, not us.</p><p>So Sue and I then went off and we wrote a grant proposal, there was a charitable trust called Leverhulme in the UK at the time and they had decided they wanted to fund centres for disruptive research, and we thought that sounds like us, so we're going to give that one a go. And we wrote a quite outrageous grant proposal into this trust, and we got shortlisted, much to our surprise, and what the trust did was they gave us an award of \u00a310 million, so it's not small, for 10 years, so it's not a short timeframe, in order to go out and to disrupt the forensic science ecosystem.</p><p>And we bring people from around the world-Australia, America, other parts of the world-together with forensic scientists from those areas, together with some of the leading scientists in the field in an area we are interested in, together with the judges, and we bring all of these people together to say we have a problem and the problem is we don't understand, let's say transfer and persistence of DNA, how are we going to solve it? And we will sit there with all of these individuals, articulate the problem and start to work out a solution, and we use graphic artists to write the conversation for us. And these are the best communication tool I have ever come across because what we do in these conversations is if there's anybody sat around the groups that we work with-so judges, lawyers, scientists, forensic scientists, police officers-who are saying something that somebody else in the group doesn't understand, then they are allowed to play a 'blah, blah, blah' card, and you pick it up and you go...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Blah, blah, blah!</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> And it's great because what it tells you is it says 'I don't understand what you're saying to me', and the understanding in that piece of communication is so preciously important because if I can't understand you, we can't work together to solve the problem. And it's these simple things that make us stop, that are done with good humour and done with the right reasons that actually make us pause when we are trying to construct interdisciplinary research and really, really moves the conversation further forward. What we are able to do in two days of the strategic conversations is more than we've done in many, many, many years of trying in regards to solving issues in forensics science.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Maiken, imagine in your future at night, you've got two individuals in a car, and there's been something going on. What are the surprises that you might be looking out for?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Maiken Ueland:</emphasis> Well, we've spent years doing what we call baseline research. We've had our individuals in very standardised situations, so that we can see what happened in an as controlled environment as possible. We are in an outdoor scenario, so it's never going to be controlled as it would be in a laboratory, but as controlled as possible for us.</p><p>And then what we are doing now is we're moving more towards case-based scenarios, and we deal a lot with the police. I'm getting their advice on what kind of crimes they see regularly. And the situation there is looking at what happens in an enclosed environment. So when individuals are placed and sealed off, what happens to the decomposition rate there.</p><p>But one of the biggest findings we have had overall at the facility is that we see a process called mummification. And this is when the skin gets very dry and leathery and it slows down the decomposition. So where we expected based on the pig data and based on data from the US that the donors, for example, would become skeletonised, which is the endpoint after maybe a year, we are seeing that the decomposition rate is being slowed down and it takes a year-and-a-half to two years before we get to that skeletonisation. And this is having a massive impact on how we determine time since death. And we are also seeing this mummification very early on, which is very unexpected, and we see it year round. So we see it in all seasons, whereas mummification is something we always thought happened in very dry, hot environments, whereas in Sydney apparently it happens all the time. So now that we are moving on to these more case-based scenarios, we are learning more and more. And it has really shown us why we think these facilities are so important.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Let's now look at the future. And David, I don't want to tell you about some of the horror stories...well, the villains have now got quantum computers, but we'll come to that, that's something like a million times faster than ordinary computers.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> Look, I think spoofing is going to continue on because I think technically the way a phone determines whether or not a phone number is spoofed or not isn't there at the moment, so the software application within your phone doesn't discern that it's not me calling you, it's someone else but it looks like it's me. So we think that is certainly predictably going to increase over the year.</p><p>We featured on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Four Corners</emphasis> a few weeks ago in relation to romance scams and relationship scams, and 38 people, post that Monday episode, rang IDCARE and because of that episode said, 'I now realise it's a scam.' I think if anything in the environment, the more that you have that conversation at home and with your friends, the better and more resilient we will be as a community. So if that is any litmus as to how many other people are out there experiencing these things that currently don't know, then that's I think a really important take-away, is to have those conversations.</p><p>We've got a lot of young people who are getting jobs for the first time, they sit around the dinner table at night, the parents ask them, 'How was the first day at work?' And they say, 'I just did some transactions.' And mum and dad will go, 'Tell us about that.' 'I got money into my account, I withdrew it, I had to buy some bitcoin and then I sent it overseas.' And the next thing you know they are laundering money on behalf of organised crime. That's detected first because of that conversation at home. Investment fraud works because somebody is alone and they've got a superannuation balance and they want to invest. That's a conversation that also needs to be had with family and friends. That's how we can really disrupt the criminals, is by ensuring that we are having those conversations. The crooks will always leverage technology. Our challenge is how that technology can present evidence that can give a court confidence that this is the particular outcome or result that has occurred.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> So Dennis, finally, what are your concerns about the issues for the future in DNA forensic work?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> I think most of the issues are going to revolve around genetic privacy. As more and more of the genome is revealed in the course of forensic and medical investigations, then more and more information about us is going to be made available. I'll paint a sort of picture of where I think the field of biometrics is going, all the things about our biology that make us who we are. So you can imagine that DNA is collected at a crime scene, you might search a database, find no hits, no matches, that DNA could then be used to predict your fingerprints, there is evidence to suggest that's possible. That means that we can then search a fingerprint database, so we can cross-interrogate databases.</p><p>We then find no fingerprint match, so then we go the next step and we produce a molecular photofit of that person's face. Again, there is evidence to suggest that that may one day be possible. Those facial characteristics could be uploaded to border crossings through the country so that if our offender tries to leave the country, their face might appear on CCTV, the facial metrics from the CCTV image could automatically match the DNA image that is predicted from DNA. That person could be pulled aside, questioned, a DNA sample taken, a cheek swab taken and then matched or not to the crime scene evidence. Some people might think that's a good thing, some people might think that's a dystopian future.</p><p>One of the very interesting developments in DNA is the use of genealogy databases in the US to solve crimes. Police are now submitting DNA to these companies, and perhaps some of you in the audience have used companies like 23AndMe or Ancestry.com. Well, there's another company called Family Tree DNA who do a similar thing and they have now announced that they are going to work with law enforcement to enable law enforcement to access their records so that DNA at a crime scene can be used to find putative relatives of the offender. And then family trees can be constructed in these genealogical databases to identify cousins or genetic relatives of the offender, to narrow a pool of suspects.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> For us the challenge is multiple. One is the object changes every day. So it's not a body or it's not DNA. Every day there is a new technology in the marketplace, and the most recent I guess pre-trial report that I was involved with last week was the alleged perpetrator had breached a domestic violence order, and the allegation was that they had sent text messages to the complainant, and that was in contravention of that order. They were recommending that it wasn't them, their number had been spoofed.</p><p>So spoofing is where I call you and your caller ID looks as though it's something when in fact it's not. So we are seeing that as a general trend across the community at the moment where banks or MyGov or the tax office, the criminals are spoofing those numbers, so you are receiving a text message, it's entering the legitimate historical string of your messages, but it actually is being sent by a criminal. So that is now starting to escalate. It was occurring in North America over the last few years and now we are starting to see it-surprise, surprise-in Australia.</p><p>So in this particular context if the allegation is that there has been a breach of a domestic violence order through communication and then the defendant is saying, 'I'm sorry, my number was spoofed,' what we look for there is, well, what's the point of truth? In communications, telcos, if they do one thing right, it's billing. So the bill is often a very good point, looking at a call charge record, which is then used for the billing purpose, as to whether or not that transaction, that communication was evident in the call charge record. And in this particular case it was evident and evident in spades. And there's another attributes around that communication as well. So every mobile phone has unique identifiers, so not just your number but the device itself, and a call charge record is you're able to look at what type of communication was it, when was it sent, over what duration, to what receiver or who was the originator, who was the receiver or terminator, and the relevant mobile identifier. And so it was quite evident, it was quite probable that in fact the phone number wasn't spoofed.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> And another aspect is what we're going to do at the crime scene of the future. We've talked about a digital crime scene, but also can we use digital tools like virtual reality or augmented reality to help us understand and investigate crime scenes in the future. And I think the other really key and critical area for me as we move further forward and there's two, one is around digital evidence. Digital evidence is going to be massive in our futures. We've heard about cybersecurity and how to keep ourselves safe, but what are we going to do with the vast amounts of evidence that are coming from mobile phones, from other digital devices, and how are our courts going to cope with that. So we are working with law enforcement and the judges and trying to work out just a strategy for how do we do that and how do we do it correctly and properly.</p><p>And then the last one is how are we going to teach the scientists to communicate, because that's the last really important piece, is to turn forensic scientists into forensic science communicators because they absolutely have to be able to communicate to you who have to make the decision about guilt or innocence and we have to be able to empower you to be able to make that decision effectively.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> How are you doing that, are you bringing people like Amelia Fox or Alan Alda?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> Not so much Amelia Fox. Alan Alda, yes actually. So we work with the Alan Alda Centre for Science Communication in Stony Brook in New York. We have a grant with them now also, and they have come and trained all of our team in science communication, so all of our PhD students, all of our postdocs, all of our staff are trained science communicators, and we pass that information out, we work with all of the science centres in the region, with the schools, in that region and beyond. So we work very closely with Alan.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> He loves science. Very keen.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> He does, he's fantastic, he's absolutely lovely, a really good supporter of this kind of work.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> Whatever you think of Amelia Fox, so many people in the theatre and in television, the actors really do investigate some of the ideas and some of the science, which is...</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> Yes, when we work with Val, so I work with her from time to time on her books, and she is an author that puts a huge amount of effort into getting the science right, as many of them do. But at the end of the day, getting the science right and showing the meticulous nature of it is not going to fit into 45 minutes of a <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Silent Witness</emphasis> episode.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> A final thought, I'd like you all to comment briefly in about two-and-a-half minutes. One of the things that you're illustrating is, one of my favourite words, consilience. And William Whewell, who first named the first person, who was a woman, to be called a scientist, way back, also loved consilience because what it does is takes many, many lines of evidence to find out whether something is true or not, as much as you can, no absolute truth, but...if you have 20 or 30 lines of evidence, you're pretty damn sure they are...you know, in climate science, this is what they are doing, you're measuring the temperature, you're looking at the chemistry of the atmosphere, you're looking at the way that animals change and go away, things decay, all those things together make you pretty damn sure that something is going on. So would you say that consilience is what you guys are all about?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Niamh Nic Daeid:</emphasis> I think that what you're saying is a really interesting suggestion, but we have to put it into the frame of the crime scene to court process. When you get to the courtroom, forensic science, the scientific part is a small part of a big chain, but we are actually quite a circumstantial part of it. And so within that little part there all of the little bits and pieces that make up the scientific block of evidence. I agree with what you're saying, so long as each of those individual parts are themselves scientific.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Dennis McNevin:</emphasis> I hark back to what I said before. I mean, there are no certainties. We are operating in a realm of uncertainty and that's the court, it has to decipher all the evidence that is put forward and put together a complex jigsaw puzzle where each piece has an element of uncertainty to it, and then you've got to come up with a conclusion based on all of those clues that are put together.</p><p>To carry on from what Niamh was saying and what you were suggesting...what's the term you used, 'consilience'? That's a word I'm going to put in my dictionary. There was a famous case in Australia of Farah Jama who was convicted of a crime that he didn't commit in Victoria here in Australia, based on DNA evidence alone. So this guy was convicted of rape based on a vaginal swab that had his DNA on it. Now, we haven't got time today to explain how that occurred but it didn't occur because he raped that woman, it occurred because of a very unlikely chain of events that could never have been predicted. But because the audience saw the DNA evidence, they said 'we don't need to know anything else' and they ignored all the other circumstantial evidence that was exculpatory. It was only the DNA that was inculpatory. You're working in a complex environment with many uncertainties.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">David Lacey:</emphasis> Yes, 99.9999% of cybercrime never ends up in court, and the reason why that's the case is that criminals are mostly overseas. So where cyber forensics plays its role is to know that, that's where the threat is originating from, and determine how did they do it so that we can then look for measures and countermeasures to defeat it in the future. So it's a very broad church, cyber forensics, and the roles that it can play.</p><p>Where it's a domestic incident, where it is that 0.00001% of cases, absolutely, the crime scene of the future is the culmination of all of these disciplines. But as was said before, it's a small sliver of what is actually presented in court.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Robyn Williams:</emphasis> There you are, that's the future. Be very, very scared, but safe at the same time. Would you please thank the panel?

Between the freeway and the burning forest there are small farms with not much growing and everything dry and ready to flare.</p><p>The belly of the fire has wandered across the railway line, is in the town and within reach of houses. It is being thumped to death.</p><p>It's about 2pm and the fire is clinging to the feet of Mount Macedon, between the eastern and western spurs.</p><p>You can smell the smoke up here, but it's not thick at 2900 feet. It stays low, coming out of every part of the blackened fish-forest like steam. It is white; dirty in parts where the flames have found finer fuel.</p><p>The smoke is heavy and white at the nose of the fire, on the north-western point. The wind is coming from this direction and all the smoke rolls into itself, feeding itself and choking the town. East of Macedon it spreads over grass plains to Gisborne, to Sunbury.</p><p>There are large ponds at the head and tail of the fire. Three water-bomber helicopters are doing a grasshopper ballet, into the ponds to fill with water and springing back into the air.</p><p>You hear them on the radio, talking about the bombing runs over the western flank. You see the helicopter following the burning perimeter.</p><p>You hear: \"OK, I'm dropping the water now.\"</p><p>And then, after coming up from the smoke: \"Did I get it?\"</p><p>\"Nice one,\" is the reply.</p><p>\"Was it a bit late, Mike?\"</p><p>\"Yeah, but it was effective.\"</p><p>It goes on like this through the hour.</p><p>A Dromeder plane arrives to drop foam. Two helicopters are parked on the Macedon football field. There is no crowd watching.</p><p>Half the town has been closed. Police cars are parked across the street. Other streets are moving. You see cars on front lawns. People in their pools. A man is climbing on to the roof of his house to see what he can see. He's wearing red underpants and thongs.</p><p>Meanwhile, the radio has been talking about the western flank. \"The whole western flank is a time-bomb . . . but we're not doing too bad,\" says someone I recognise as Mike.</p><p>The helicopters keep bombing the western flank.</p><p>The talk turns to food. One pilot wants to know if it has arrived. \"We've been waiting for the refreshments to come out and . . .\"</p><p>There is a brief bitch about air-attack firefighters always being forgotten.</p><p>Then the pilot says: \"Seeing there's no food . . .\"</p><p>And he goes back to the pond.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Photo: Dousing the flames: Fires at Mount Macedon yesterday are water-bombed by helicopter.

When they arrived at Les Torrensan's house in Mulgoa Road, he was close to tears. The fire, spreading from adjoining bush, ruined hectare upon hectare of crops on his property.</p><p>\"There's 15 years of work and vegetation just ruined,\" he said. \"I could see it all just jumping the road, just a law unto itself.\"</p><p>The middle of a new house he was building on the property caught alight, but he managed to douse the flames. \"I was meant to be going to a Christmas party today,\" he sighed. \"But I just can't leave not now.\"</p><p>In the lower Blue Mountains, Hala Swallow and husband Ian had watched a fire since it started as a whiff of smoke at a local swimming hole, Blue Pool, in Glenbrook Creek on Monday. Despite water bombing by helicopters, the fire kept coming and early yesterday afternoon they decided to evacuate. Ms Swallow called out: \"Oh, Ian, we have left a big ham in the fridge.\"</p><p>He called back: \"Well, it will be well done when we get back. Get in the vehicle.\"</p><p>Many fled with them as flames threatened thousands of homes and closed roads and rail lines.</p><p>Martyn Hurley, living near the railway line at Glenbrook, had the fire sweep through on Monday and yesterday went looking for his two pet goats. He found one, so badly burnt it could not stand on its hoofs.</p><p>Fires ravaged lookouts and destroyed tractors and a National Parks and Wildlife Service depot at Glenbrook. Jon Jackson, of Warrimoo in the Blue Mountains, suffered burns to the back from flying cinders after he left his Christmas dinner to run with a hose and buckets to help.</p><p>In Canberra, police drove through streets with loud hailers, warning western suburbs residents to prepare for evacuation when a forest fire at Stromlo threatened to spread. It was later contained.</p><p>The Governor-General, Peter Hollingworth, thanked firefighters for saving Government House at Yarralumla, after flames went within 200 metres of its boundaries on Monday. \"I'd particularly like to ... express our appreciation to the emergency service, to the firefighters who've had to do a typically Australian thing, and that is work on Christmas Day to contain these fires that are all around.\"</p><p>Back at Mulgoa, Fred Grotto kept watch on his tractor as flames came within metres of two diesel fuel tanks. He would not leave his property. \"It's a nice Christmas, isn't it?\" he said.</p><p>Across the road, Mark Harrold was out the front of his property, his clothes and faces covered in ash. In his left hand he cradled a tiny possum, burnt and barely alive. \"I've just found this on the road and I want to try to help it ... Our house is in danger and we don't know how close it will come but the best we can do is stay out here fighting.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yif5w7k4p0frvodjo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2001</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8B-H3J0-TXN5-R196-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"515\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2001 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"12\" year=\"2001\"><dateText>December 26, 2001 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Sydney</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Nsw</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Accidents And Emergencies/Accidents/Fires/Bushfires</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST0009Y72</classCode><className>CHRISTMAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLZB</classCode><className>EMERGENCY SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DN66</classCode><className>PUBLIC LANDS REGULATION &amp;

He has always disliked comfort.</p><p>His fascination with dangerous work took him out of a middle-class Massachusetts upbringing and anthropology studies to a job felling trees, where he almost severed his foot.</p><p>From there he learned at a local port about a fishing boat that had sunk in violent weather and reconstructed the tragedy in forensic detail in The Perfect Storm.</p><p>He speaks with excitement now about changes in the world, such as the trial of former Yugoslav president Slobodan Milosevic.</p><p>\"The massacres in Bosnia and the ethnic hatred there were much worse than in Afghanistan, but the West is blind to Western problems.\"</p><p>Before coming to Australia, Junger was back in Kosovo writing about the trafficking of women through brothels.</p><p>He will keep reporting on the relationship between Islam and the West, \"the most important story in the world\", but when he returns to New York he has to make time to begin a new book \"non-fiction but it's not about war or the sea.

Geoff Bates, of the Katoomba Scenic Railway, was at the Wentworth Falls fires speaking to a fireman the other day. When Elvis water-bombed the blaze, the fireman said, there were 15 phone calls of complaints from residents about the helicopter's noise.</p><p>A crew of four firefighters from Mt Tomah was sent to Lake Burragorang to help clear firebreaks. Bill Johns, of Mt Tomah, says: \"The lake is laden with huge carp, up to a metre long. Suddenly a volcano of fire erupted on the top of the escarpment above the crew. Out of the blue arrived Elvis. As he swooped over to drop another load of water, one of the crew, Col, looked up and said, `I wonder what would happen if Elvis sucked up a carp? The headline would be Firefighter killed by falling carp. He would have carped it.\"'</p><p>\"We're really into water conservation on the far North Coast,\" reports Anne Hay, of Golden Beach. \"The Northern Star reported that a fire, threatening Brooms Head Caravan Park, was contained `after around 30 drops of water' from the Westpac helicopter.\"</p><p>Which brings us to the old, old Bushfire Urban Myth. A reader, Karry, says she found some old clippings from a San Francisco newspaper that told this story:Fire authorities in California found a corpse in a burnt-out section of forest while assessing the damage done by a forest fire. The deceased male was dressed in a full wetsuit, complete with dive tank, flippers and facemask. A post-mortem revealed that the person died, not from burns, but from massive internal injuries. On the day of the fire, the person went for a diving trip off the coast, some 35km away from the forest. The firefighters called in a fleet of helicopters with very large buckets. The buckets were dropped into the ocean for rapid filling ...</p><p>It had to happen . Don Christian reports: \"Our local retirement village, a wonderful complex known as Fingal Haven, has an ornate front entrance with Fingal Haven mounted on a rock wall or it did have. Some local wit or vandal, depending upon your view, removed the G, leaving what some would judge to be the appropriate name.\"</p><p>A reader , so ashamed to have spent so much time with a calculator that he/she wishes to be anonymous, has taken issue with Yet Another Paper at the weekend. It said that repainting of the Eiffel Tower \"began last month for the 18th time in its history. It will take 25 workers two years to cover the monument in 50,000 tonnes of lead-free brown paint\". Says our calculating reader: \"Assuming a six-day week with no weather breaks or holidays, that's about three and a bit tonnes per worker per day!\" That work ethic is what has made France great.</p><p>We forgive Bruce Moore, now in Kathmandu and without his library to consult, who thought it was Sir Humphrey who gave the definitions of MBE, OBE, etc (Column 8, yesterday). As readers have told us, it was his private secretary, Bernard.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:column8@smh.com.au\">column8@smh.com.au</email>(no attachments, please).Phone 9282 2207 Fax 9282 2772.(Include name, suburb, daytime phone)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yif6g1e5nskxwwkdjo</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2002</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P6W-1CJ0-TXN5-R20N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"503\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2002 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"01\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>January 8, 2002 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Fire Departments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MEU4MjlBNENBOEQxNDU5NTkyM0Y5M0YzMEEyODU3NEY7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Njg1MkM3RkYyNzIxNEVFRkJFMTI2NUM4NUU1ODdEM0Q</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000725</classCode><className>FIREFIGHTERS &amp;

It also under-</p><p>estimated the speed at which fires can develop and how they behave under different wind speeds.</p><p> This means firefighters are putting themselves in more danger than they realised every time they confront fires.</p><p> The research also applies to hazard reduction burning and back-burning (small fires deliberately lit in front of the main bushfire line to starve the fire of fuel).</p><p> The CSIRO division of forestry and forest products is midway through a four-year $6 million research study, named project Vesta, into the behaviour of forest and grass fires.</p><p> Bushfire services still rely on fire behaviour models -- developed by fire researcher Alan McArthur -- when planning how to combat a fire situation.</p><p> \"What we have found is that fires accelerate more rapidly than we thought and it only takes a couple of minutes for it to happen,\" CSIRO research scientist Jim Gould said. \"We hope to have a good prediction system within two years and we felt it was important to tell [bushfire services] of the weaknesses in the system and help them. They often put themselves in risky situations.</p><p> \"It would be hard to say if past deaths could be directly related to the inaccuracies \u2026 there are too many factors involved. This type of research is for public good. This is one of the largest undertakings in fire science.\"</p><p> The CSIRO provides the information as a public service and does not gain commercially from any agency adopting its new modelling.</p><p> It will continue to update bushfire services to changing information.</p><p> \"We are developing new equations which reflect a new relationship between wind and fire now that it is better understood,\" said Dr Gould.</p><p> A spokesperson for the Rural Fire Service said the findings were significant.</p><p> \"They more or less confirm the strategies already adopted by the Rural Fire Service,\" the spokesperson said. \"We were expecting results more or less along these lines and we have incorporated them in our training.\"</p><p> The research has found that a linear relationship exists between fire spread and wind up to 15km/h. However, the most dangerous aspect for firefighters is the discovery that over and above this wind speed, fire spread becomes far more rapid.</p><p> Dr Gould said there was a high potential for grass fires by the end of February and if the wet weather eases, forest fire danger could become very high due to the availability of fuel.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DAITEL-DTM0001121027055114</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THEDAILYTELEGRALTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:44K8-YHB0-0197-851G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244786</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"487\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Daily Telegraph (Sydney, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2000 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"01\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>January 12, 2000, Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>HAVE INC\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>SIC3357 DRAWING &amp; INSULATING OF NONFERROUS WIRE\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST000DRET</classCode><className>PRESCRIBED FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>N110000CC</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE, FORESTRY, FISHING &amp; HUNTING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

He was a disinterested schoolboy when his father insisted that they pay a visit to the deposed leader's home in Dharamasala. What stayed with Iyer, then 17, was a vision of swirling mist rather than the Tibetan monk's conversations on emptiness and reality. That was in 1974 and ever since Iyer has followed the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama's </nameText></person>passage \"down from the mountaintop\".</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Open Road is an account of this enduring friendship. As Iyer travels with <person><nameText>Tenzin Gyatso, </nameText></person>he explores how exile can bring opportunity. Even though the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama </nameText></person>still travels on the yellow identity card of a refugee, he views loss as transformative. For Iyer - who lost all his possessions, including eight years' worth of books, in a forest fire in Santa Barbara in 1990 - this is deeply instructive.</p><p>Pico Iyer, essayist, journalist and accomplished travel writer, portrays the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama </nameText></person>from three angles - in public, private and in practice. On the international stage, Iyer watches how Westerners project their dreams on to him. In part, because Tibet wears \"the contours of a fairy tale\"; in part, our need for the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama </nameText></person>to be \"an emissary from some other world that doesn't exist\".</p><p>Yet, the Nobel Peace Prize winner couldn't be more down to earth. He's not in the business of peddling the view that compassion falls from the heavens. It takes hard work. The <person><nameText>Dalai Lama </nameText></person>starts his meditation at 4.30am every day - and can do it while listening to the BBC World Service.</p><p>Iyer notices that the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama </nameText></person>is frequently dismissed when he speaks in English and is ignored when he talks philosophically. (Most people refer to his \"presence and warmth\".) He recounts how one Canadian journalist described the Tibetan leader, \"as not exactly the brightest bulb in the room\". Deliberately, Iyer believes, the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama </nameText></person>has spent the past two decades compressing millennia of Buddhist teaching into a modern doctrine of simple human ethics. But his \"everyday humanity\" comes at a cost. No one would dare ask the Pope if \"he has dreams of women\", yet the doctor of metaphysics is seen as fair game for any question.</p><p>So it's startling to be reminded that <person><nameText>Tenzin Gyatso </nameText></person>is still a student. In a telling detail Iyer recounts how, when the photographer Manuel Bauer, who spent more than three years photographing the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama </nameText></person>- in meditation, weeping, watching TV bare-chested - showed him the photos to check none violated his privacy, his subject questioned only one picture. It seemed to show, because of the perspective, that he was sitting higher than one of his teachers.</p><p>Such vignettes give this intimate and insightful portrayal of one of the world's iconic leaders great warmth. Iyer succeeds in de-cloaking the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama, </nameText></person>showing his many faces and, as with his other travelogues, does so with an excellent eye for detail. His descriptions of Dharamasala, a \"wild globalised village\", where Tibetan boys \"roam around like packs of wild dogs\" preying on starry-eyed Western women and Israeli backpackers seek hedonism and spiritual highs, are spot on.</p><p>It is there, among his own people, that Iyer records one of \"the most moving moments\". Witnessing the Tibetan leader with newly arrived refugees, Iyer describes how \"when the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama </nameText></person>came into the room, it was as if the whole place began to sob and shake\".</p><p>And this strikes at the core of the <person><nameText>Dalai Lama's </nameText></person>dilemma. <person><nameText>Tenzin Gyatso </nameText></person>\"serves two constituencies - his own people and the world\". The wider community wants him to be \"a wise man, sitting above all nation-states and offering global counsel\".</p><p>Meanwhile, his compatriots are desperate for a solution with China, as the latest wave of unrest in Tibet would indicate. As the exiled leader tries to follow the non-violent approach and still appease the younger generation of frustrated Tibetans, he's caught between a \"monk's vision and a guerilla's\".</p><p>Iyer has no answers. As much as he tries to be an objective journalist, he admits, \"Something changed in me each time I left his company, even as I was telling my friends, heatedly, that humans never really change.\" In a sense, The Open Road tells us as much about the author and his subject as it does about ourselves. So often in trying to fathom this simple Buddhist monk, people become caught up in the mist. Iyer brings us back into focus.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>PHOTO: <person><nameText>Tenzin Gyatso .</nameText></person>.. the 14th <person><nameText>Dalai Lama. </nameText></person>Photo: Kate Geraghty</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-5km0e6lahs084w7w5yq</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4SVM-0G40-TXN5-S1NB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"729\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>First Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"06\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>June 28, 2008 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><classCode>CC0003LT7</classCode><className>BBC WORLD SERVICE TELEVISION LTD</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Review</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UDR</classCode><className>NON FICTION LITERATURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001905</classCode><className>JOURNALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000CFKZ</classCode><className>MEDITATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00099LO</classCode><className>BUDDHISTS &amp;

He noted that Europeans were moving towards a greater unity in foreign policy, meaning other voices could be lost in the crowd.</p><p> \"We are at the very beginning of this process and it will take some years to achieve,\" said the Foreign Minister who was yet to consult with Asian leaders about possible reform of the system.</p><p> \"But it's a process that ultimately has to happen and I think somebody has to promote the process.\"</p><p> Mr Downer, in New York to address the UN General Assembly tomorrow (about 2.30am Saturday AEST), reiterated Australia's support for calls to ensure the United States paid its arrears to the UN.</p><p> The US Administration agreed to pay up to $\u00a0US800 million ($\u00a0A1.1 billion) of the estimated $\u00a0US1 billion it owes the world body, but the Congress in Washington continued to delay the payment.</p><p> Mr Downer said he would prefer if the US paid back \"the full amount, but if Congress were to agree to ($800 million) that would obviously be considerable progress\".</p><p> The Foreign Minister revealed here today that Indonesia had initially rejected Australia's offer of help to counter the forest fire crisis in the region.</p><p> Fire authorities in Australia believed the situation would not have reached disaster stage if they had been allowed to assist earlier.</p><p> \"Their initial reaction was they thought they could handle the matter on their own, they weren't very enthusiastic initially,\" he said.</p><p> \"But as time went on clearly the situation remained bad, even got somewhat worse and so they came back to us and said yes they would like some help.\"</p><p> Mr Downer said Indonesia had asked Australia to help about a week after assistance was first offered.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1997</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3SJJ-4MF0-0048-T3M2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"468\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1997 AAP Information Services Pty.

The Tully fire chief, Mr Bob Long, said the area needed only a spark to start a forest fire that could run out of control for days. \"\"Every day of sunshine dries out the forest floor,\" he said. Mr Long said it could take the rainforest years to recover if a fire erupted now. \"\"If people don't observe the voluntary fire ban, lives could be lost as well as major properties,\" he said. Mission Beach and Bingil Bay were inhabited areas particularly at risk. The Innisfail deputy fire chief, Mr Bruce Dade, said the risk area covered from Mission Beach to Babinda and no rain was in sight. \"\"Foliage blown from trees is feet deep in some places in the rainforest,\" he said. \"\"It's tinder dry and it would only need a match for fires to start everywhere.\" Mr Dade said the fire risk was one of the most serious in the area for years. Surveys have found extensive damage to areas of the Barrier Reef worst hit by cyclone Winifred 12 days ago. Winifred tracked adjacent to the outer Barrier Reef from Cape Melville south, crossed the reef off Innisfail and hit the coast at Silkwood. Ground surveys found coral destruction 15i deep on reefs in the cyclone's path. According to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, surveys of the area only three weeks before the cyclone allowed scientists to see the before-and-after effects of a cyclone on the reef.</p><section sectionType=\"source\"><bodyText><p>QNP</p></bodyText></section><p>Scientists hope to find evidence to explain differences in the structure and composition of coral reefs in the Great Barrier Reef region. The Local Government Minister, Mr Hinze, said modern buildings in Babinda and Innisfail were not damaged by cyclone Winifred, proving the benefits of building regulations introduced four years ago.

Australian companies are reporting the non-payment of bills by many Indonesian customers.</p><p>Economists said IMF assistance was essential to prevent corporate bankruptcies and the disastrous social and political consequences of widespread lay-offs. The economic difficulties come at a time when Indonesia is facing crop reductions because of drought, a forest fire crisis, and heightened political volatility.</p><p>Growth forecasts have been revised down and price rises are expected for politically sensitive food items and petrol.</p><p>Both the stock and money markets reacted modestly to the IMF announcement with the rupiah moving up from 3640 to the US dollar to 3565 and the stockmarket gaining almost 1 per cent.</p><p>The IMF is expected to increase pressure for the scrapping of Indonesia's national car project - which granted exclusive tax and tariff concessions to one of Mr Suharto's sons - and of the expensive national program to develop an Indonesian jet. That project is controlled by the Minister for Technology and close presidential ally, Dr Jusuf Habibi.</p><p>Monopolies on products such as rice and flour are likely to be challenged and analysts say the overcrowded and under-performing banking sector will face closures and mergers.</p><p>\"Indonesia now has to be mentally ready to face the consequences and put itself on a strict diet. There's no use in pursuing nationalist policies like the car and the plane if they cost too much,\" said the economist Christianto Wibisono.</p><p>\"If the corporates go bankrupt, lots of people will lose their jobs, there will be political turbulence and social riots. So our present position is one of whether or not we want to survive. We have no choice.\"</p><p>Another analyst said: \"Propping up private companies may be money down the drain but the question you have to ask is what happens if you don't prop them up. People are already being laid off. This is not a good scenario.\"</p><p>The national car project is backed by loans of more than $A1 billion from local banks and has attracted formal protests in the World Trade Organisation from Japan, the European Union and the United States over unfair trading conditions.</p><p>But Mr Suharto refused to cut back the project last month when a 25 per cent reduction in infrastructure spending was announced. Some commentators say an IMF-forced cut will be rejected.</p><p>PAGE 1 Business: Reports.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8H-NRD0-TXN5-S0NV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">AGEMLB-4yhv204a5ko1junfu5us</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AGEMLB1997</dc:source><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2010-05-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"490\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1997 The Age Company Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Age (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"10\" year=\"1997\"><dateText>October 10, 1997 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.region\"><classificationItem><className>Indonesia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Company/International Monetary Fund</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D9JR</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001768</classCode><className>US DOLLAR</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001937</classCode><className>ECONOMY &amp;

They were arrested after Colombian authorities claimed they had spent five weeks in a large area controlled by the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, in which an explosion could pass unnoticed or be mistaken for a small forest fire.</p><p>A swab taken from the clothing of one is believed to have yielded traces of vapour bomb ingredients, and two others showed up drugs and explosives.</p><p>The arrest of the Colombia Three, as the British media have dubbed them, could not come at a worse time for the Sinn Fein leader, Mr Gerry Adams, who had been planning a trip to Cuba that was to include an audience with President Fidel Castro, who has been a staunch supporter of the IRA and Sinn Fein.</p><p>Washington has strenuously objected to the meeting.</p><p>But the arrest of Connolly, who British sources maintain was instrumental in setting up the Castro-Adams meeting, brings another element cocaine into the equation.</p><p>The FARC rebels being trained by Connolly and his associates support themselves in part through the sale of cocaine. Although there is no direct evidence that the IRA men were handling the drug, their involvement with FARC has created a tremor inside the CIA and British intelligence agencies.</p><p>Some reports say the United States is examining whether to effectively outlaw Sinn Fein as a result of the Colombian arrests. This would have a disastrous impact on its funding; Americans contribute almost $A1.5 million a year to the party's coffers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>ILLUS: Arrested ...

A meteor exploded over New Zealand in daylight today, prompting hundreds of calls to emergency services around the country. Radio New Zealand said a forest fire near Napier on the east of the North Island appears to have been started by falling debris. The Carter Observatory in Wellington said the explosion and smoke around 4.15pm was heard and seen by people as far apart as Rotorua in the north and Nelson at the top of the South Island.</p><p>Daredevil dies in Norwegian jump</p><p>OSLO. A Norwegian parachutist who frustrated police and entertained the public with daredevil leaps from some of the world's tallest buildings has been killed in a jump from a cliff. Thor Axel Kappfjell, 32, became an icon to fixed object jumpers in Norway for his leaps from the World Trade Centre, the Empire State Building and the Chrysler Building in New York, the Eiffel Tower in Paris and even the Norwegian Prime Minister's office in Oslo. He was killed early yesterday when he jumped off the 1000-metre-high Kjerag cliff over the waters of Lysefjord, near Stavanger.</p><p>Minister stable after suicide bid</p><p>ANKARA. Turkey's State Minister for the Economy, Mr Hikmet Ulugbay, was in a stable condition today after a three-hour operation following an apparent suicide attempt last night, a senior hospital official said. \"He is now under control and in a stable condition. There is no reason to worry about him,\" Dr Mehmet Haberal, chief doctor at Ankara's Baskent hospital, said. Mr Ulugbay, 60, a key figure in efforts to reform Turkey's deficit-ridden economy, had suffered no brain damage, he said.</p><p>Japanese are in the hot seat</p><p>TOKYO. Japan's high-tech toilets are giving a whole new meaning to the phrase \"in the hot seat\". Consumers keen on toilets equipped with heated seats and automated warm-water bidets are being warned of possible dire consequences after fires were sparked by worn-out wiring on older models. At least four fires this year have been traced to older versions of the \"Washlet\" toilets.</p><p>Clinton to visit Indian reservation</p><p>RAPID CITY, SOUTH DAKOTA. President Clinton, below, will become the first president in 63 years to visit AmericanIndian country on Wednesday, touring the historic Pine Ridge reservation to dramatise the grinding poverty many Indians face.

Belanglo serial killer's eighth victim.</p><p> If so, she would be the first victim dumped outside that notorious forest.</p><p> Backpacker murder squad police are reviewing the murder of Dianne Pennacchio, found stabbed to death in a state forest almost 200km south of the Belanglo State Forest \"graveyard\".</p><p> Detectives say the murder of the Queanbeyan mother, in September 1991, involved similar elements to many of the Belanglo forest killings.</p><p> Two detectives from Task Force Air have spent the past week in Queanbeyan studying evidence from the Pennacchio case, the first non-Belanglo murder confirmed under active investigation by the squad.</p><p> Mrs Pennacchio, 29, was last seen late at night leaving a hotel at Bungendore, east of Canberra, to hitch a ride home to nearby Queanbeyan.She never arrived.</p><p> Her decomposed body was found two months later in the Tallanganda State Forest, south of the Bungendore-Queanbeyan road.</p><p> Two forestry workers found the body face down, hidden alongside a log and covered with pine needles, about 10m from a forest fire trail.</p><p> Virtually all the Belanglo forest victims have been found in almost identical bushland settings.</p><p> Task Force Air commander, Superintendent Clive Small, had earlier said that the similarity of the Belanglo body sites could well mark the \"signature\" of a serial killer.</p><p> He said that specialist officers would analyse the detailed findings so far, but suggested that a pattern may be emerging from the nature and location of the death scenes.</p><p> \"All we can do is follow the perimeter of the pine forest where we have found the bodies near all the fire trails,\" he said.</p><p> Mrs Pennacchio was savagely stabbed to death, as most of the Belanglo victims were believed to have been.</p><p> Police say there was no sign of a struggle where Mrs Pennacchio was found, suggesting she was killed elsewhere and dumped in the forest.</p><p> More than one person may have been involved, too, because a lone killer would have found it hard to lift and carry her heavy frame.</p><p> Police also believe that Mrs Pennacchio was probably sexually assaulted, based on the position of her jeans when found.</p><p> Some detectives believe that at least one of the Belanglo victims may also have been sexually assaulted, and no signs of struggle were found there, either.</p><p> But if Mrs Pennacchio was murdered by the Belanglo forest killer, she was the only victim who was married, a mother, not a backpacker and nearly 30.</p><p> A task force spokesman said that numerous other crime scenes have been visited by the squad's 35 detectives, but police have refused to name individual cases.</p><p> END OF

Get used to being looked at and judgment passed over you and your vehicle.</p><p>Hummer began with the US Army Humvee in the 1991 Gulf War, then gradually became gentrified as people like Arnold Schwarzenegger began buying the civilian H2.</p><p>The H3 is the smallest, most civilised and least confronting Hummer yet.</p><p>However, it is hardly on Gore's must-buy list with a weight of 2.2 tonnes, a petrol appetite of 13.7 litres every 100km and CO2 emissions of 327g every kilometre.</p><p>Owners should be aware that about every 6000-7000km, it will generate its own weight in CO2. But the vehicle can't be written off for environmental reasons.</p><p>If you need a vehicle that will cover almost any terrain in comfort, then the H3 has a legitimate job to do and it does it well.</p><p>On the Australian launch in the hills surrounding the Yarra Valley wine district, the H3 mastered deep-rutted red soil, overflowing bog holes, sloppy claypans, steep boulder-strewn hills and forest fire trails.</p><p>The H3 feels stable and quiet on highways, wallows through corners with a fair amount of body roll and gets jiggly over potholes with its off-road-oriented rear leaf springs.</p><p>Soft, dry sand should be no problem. After all, with the right tyre pressure and plenty of momentum most 4WDs run through sand.</p><p>Steering is typically American -- vague.</p><p>The American vehicle is built in right-hand drive in South Africa. However, the designers have not done a great job in the left-to-right conversion process.</p><p>The heavy rear door is still hinged on the left which means you have to venture out toward passing traffic to load the vehicle.</p><p>And the foot-operated parking brake in the American version is replaced by an ancient umbrella-stick handbrake in the RHD model.</p><p>These went out with Hawaiian shirts and it's easy to see why. They are impossible to release with a ham fist.</p><p>You have to learn the brake's mechanical subtleties then execute a precise series of movements -- pull the button, then turn the handle, release the brake about halfway then wiggle it a bit more to get it all the way in. Don't forget to hold your tongue in the right position, too. Rush it or try to muscle the handbrake and it just won't release.</p><p>Handbrake aside, the interior is slightly better than the US version with a classy brushed aluminium centre stack and quality trim.</p><p>The seats are comfortable and look far enough apart to easily fit five adults.</p><p>The rear middle seat also has a pull-out drinks container.</p><p>The high floor means plenty of clearance and this is where the H3 excels as over rutted sand and dirt tracks there are no unnerving scraping sounds.</p><p>While the floor is high, the roof is low and the windows very narrow.</p><p>With no rear parking sensors, it is advisable to be vigilant of children and small animals when backing out of your garage.</p><p>Strangely, the flat-fronted Besser-block styling which the engineers admit has not been designed for aerodynamics has little wind or road noise at any speed.</p><p>Bodywork is a mixture of metal and plastic.</p><p>The reason for the plastic panels is to keep weight down, reduce scratching from brushes with scrub such as lantana and they are cheaper to replace.</p><p>Under the bonnet is a raucous 3.7-litre five-cylinder Vortec petrol engine specially designed to fit the H3. It quietens down at highway speed, but it is a little underdone for the 2.2 tonne vehicle. More appropriate diesel and V8 models are coming in 2009.</p><p>It is mated to a five-speed manual which has a truck-like throw without being notchy or vague.</p><p>A four-speed auto is available for an extra $2000, but it is slow and hunts around, as well as being even less economical.</p><p>The H3 sits on 16 x 7.5 inch alloy wheels with 75 per cent high-profile tyres which are good for ride quality, noise and over rocky terrain, but not much chop for twisty tarmac.</p><p>Standard features in the H3 are cruise control, electro-chromatic rearview mirror with eight point compass, power windows, fog lights and halogen headlamps, remote entry with panic alarm, single in-dash CD, cloth seats and 60/40 split rear seats.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QNMINR-MIN200803141015541624</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NORTHERNMIN2008</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4S25-20M0-TX5J-V0DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244804</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"709\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2008 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Northern Miner (Australia)</publicationName><edition>1 - Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"03\" year=\"2008\"><dateText>March 14, 2008</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST10244945</classCode><className>US ARMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>ST0009X46</classCode><className>DESERT STORM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"68\"><classCode>ST000D8B1</classCode><className>GREENHOUSE GASES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST10244945</classCode><className>US ARMY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX000594</classCode><className>EMISSIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>STX001724</classCode><className>TIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>ST00097CN</classCode><className>ARMIES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"74\"><classCode>PE0009TN2</classCode><className>AL GORE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>PE0009U5H</classCode><className>ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC336</classCode><className>SOUTH AFRICA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>GT111</classCode><className>AFRICA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

On the technician's monitor, images from a US satellite already show fresh pinpricks of light, each a 1.6 kilometre-wide forest fire.</p><p>Carbon emissions from the Amazon burnings are estimated to be half those of Japan's industry and urbanisation, and thus to contribute significantly to global warming. Since June, teams of woodcutters have been felling underbrush and branches that by now are almost dry enough to set ablaze massive tree trunks.</p><p>By the month's end, most of Amazonia's airports will be closed by the choking, dense pall of smoke that obscures the sun for weeks. Car crashes among smoke-blinded drivers have started again, and at least one wildlife park has been torched.</p><p>In April, President Jose Sarney issued an angry challenge to his international critics. He dismissed World Bank estimates of deforestation as exaggerated and promised to control this year's burning by deploying an army of forest wardens from the Government's new environmental institute.</p><p>But after suffering budget allocation delays, the institute has been paralysed by a month-long strike by 80 per cent of the wardens. Without co-operation from the armed forces, it is forced to charter commercial aircraft. \"We just can't get people into the areas where deforestation is taking place,\" said its president, Mr Fernando Cesar Mesquita. But he added that 1989's deforestation would follow a declining trend seen last year.</p><p>\"I think this year the burned area will be much smaller and the situation is now under control,\" Mr Mesquita said. The 1986 inflation-fighting economic plan produced a domestic boom and spiralling land prices that encouraged cash-rich farmers to carve out new cattle ranches, he said, but that money had been spent.</p><p>\"The moment of truth came when the Government stopped its incentives program. Until then, all occupation of Amazonia had been encouraged by the administration. From now on, anyone wishing to make an investment must use his own money,\" said Mr Mesquita.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yhnu3vz06g1j6m2ic08</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD1989</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P7G-YNN0-TXN5-R1YK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"415\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 1989 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"1989\"><dateText>August 12, 1989 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001451</classCode><className>RAIN FORESTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009OG7</classCode><className>MAMMALS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

A forest fire 13km away is threatening the Cariboo region of British Columbia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fortunately, the Echo Valley Ranch &amp; Spa is as green as a ranch can get. It is so well watered that the helicopters water-bombing the fire are using the ranch's well-stocked trout pond to refill their buckets. Smoked trout now.</p><p>Impeccable timing on my part I'd spent the previous morning fly-fishing before the choppers took their fill.</p><p>Norm and Nan Dove bought the property 22 years ago. Their original plan to live on the ranch and build extra accommodation for visiting family and friends soon changed.</p><p>Walking around the ranch one morning, Norm says: ``We thought perhaps this was a little too indulgent to have all for ourselves.''</p><p>Over the next five years, the Dove lodge and cabins were built and they opened for business. The cedar wood used in the construction of the lodge and cabin buildings was also used on the Thai spa creating a beautiful continuity across this East-meets-West ranch.</p><p>The 65ha property is surrounded by four unique biomes: the canyon, with its hoodoos and sand spirals; grasslands, where ranches run between 10,000 and 15,000 head of cattle and farm hay; the marble mountain range, which you look out to from the property; and the flatlands, with lakes and marshes.</p><p>Guided day trips head in all directions. You can explore by foot, horse, 4x4 and plane the ranch has a private landing strip.</p><p>I stayed in a premium room in the Lookout Lodge, where I could appreciate the view to Mt Bowman. The simplicity of the room, with wooden floors and furniture, plush king bed, feathery pillows and thick white linen, created a sense of luxurious country hospitality.</p><p>That same feeling extends to the kitchen, where chef Jason Folk serves meals along the kitchen bench. You can help yourself to as much or as little as you like before settling at one of the long communal tables.</p><p>Dinner on the first night was a tender beef osso bucco that I could pull apart with my fork. On the last night, there a barbecue around the campfire ribs, lamb cutlets, roast duck, salmon, beef rissoles for burgers, salad, roast potatoes, coleslaw and fresh watermelon.</p><p>Breakfast each morning was a variation of sausages, crispy bacon, fried eggs, salmon and vegetable omelet, roast tomatoes, mushrooms, french toast with maple syrup, strawberries, fruit salad, yoghurt, cereal and toast.</p><p>Lunch consisted of grilled tuna, cold cuts of roast duck, turkey, ham and beef, hearty soups, fresh vegetables, leafy greens and, of course, dessert apple pie or creamed rice. The cookie jar is always full.</p><p>Don't be fooled by all the good country eating, there were plenty of vegetarian options and they work with food intolerances, too.</p><p>Folk's farm-to-fork approach is easily achieved, with an organic vegie patch metres from the kitchen.</p><p>Echo Valley is a place to recharge your batteries in whatever way works for you.</p><p>Frisbee with Norm and Nan's eight border collies is my pick, although a hammock the location of which I refused to disclose was a nice spot to listen to the wind and the tic-tic-tic of the sprinklers.</p><p>The BaanThai spa pavilion, designed by Thai architect Dr Pinyo Suwankiri, is beautiful. Inside the pavilion, imported teak furnishings, Thai silk and hand carvings create an authentic space, and the ginger tea is the first step towards calm.</p><p>My Thai massage was a combination of gentle stretching, pressure-point release and massage. Similar to Chinese meridians, the goal is to unblock your sen lines, releasing built-up toxins, restoring energy flow, increasing circulation and have you walking out feeling great.</p><p>The following morning, I traded a sleep-in for Thai yoga. I learnt how to massage and apply pressure to different parts of my face to stimulate lymphatic drainage and help improve circulation. Gentle poses followed by jovial Thai music and dancing had everyone in stitches at the end.</p><p>There's a third element that helps make the ranch unique its relationship with the indigenous First Nations people.</p><p>A close friendship with Rose, one of the few hereditary chiefs of the Shuswap people, means outdoor adventure organiser Darrel Nippard can take guests to the High Bar Indian reserve for a 4x4 tour of the Fraser Canyon and river.</p><p>On the tour, we explore the remnants of fortune-seeking Chinese gold miners. An old stone dam and wooden flume from the mid-1800s still stands. The arid desert is covered in sage bush and tiny cactus.</p><p>Nippard taught us about his favourite pastime panning for gold. Our group of seven managed to find about $1.50 worth of gold dust between us. Not the early retirement I was looking for or the giant nugget the kids were chasing, but fun just the same.</p><p>Further up the river, we tried our luck salmon fishing. A net on the end of a long pole produced results in seconds as the salmon made their annual migration upstream to lay eggs.</p><p>Nippard has a wealth of knowledge when it comes to edible foods. Cactus that tastes like watermelon and a tart purple berry half the size of a blueberry were ``good eating''.</p><p>Back at the ranch, indigenous artist Michael Blackstock had arrived to do his third tree carving next to one of the ranch's springs. Water is very much a living thing for First Nations people. Blackstock carves faces into trees near each spring as a way to protect this vital life source. I was lucky to witness the blessing ceremony for all three carvings the following day, where tobacco smoke and dry leaf circled the trunk of each tree.</p><p>There are 35 Tennessee Walking Horses for you to ride.</p><p>Horseback adventures range from lessons and beginner trails to day rides.</p><p>Wranglers are at the ready to help you get the most out of your ride.</p><p>Try as they might, they couldn't completely get me over my nervous indifference towards horses.</p><p>I am, however, a step closer to understanding how my 164cm frame could control such a beast granted they gave me one ready to retire.</p><p>The writer was a guest of the Echo Valley Ranch &amp; Spa.</p><p>Go2</p><p>CARIBOO</p><p>Getting there</p><p>By air: Fly to Vancouver and arrange a charter flight to the ranch.</p><p>By road: Echo Valley is 435km from Vancouver, a five-hour drive.</p><p>By rail: Catch a train to Kamloops station, a two-hour drive from Echo Valley. Transfers can be arranged through the ranch.</p><p>Staying there</p><p>Echo Valley Ranch and Spa, see evranch.com</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">QCOUML-SML201209302E08434223</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">QCOUML2012</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:56PD-8KF1-F0JP-W25B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244788</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1078\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2012 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sunday Mail (Queensland, Australia)</publicationName><edition>2 - State - Main Country Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"09\" year=\"2012\"><dateText>September 30, 2012 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009RTQ</classCode><className>MOUNTAINS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0008ZJS</classCode><className>FISHES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001511</classCode><className>RURAL COMMUNITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"75\"><classCode>STX001035</classCode><className>LAKES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>STX001614</classCode><className>SPORT FISHING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N112111MM</classCode><className>BEEF CATTLE FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>N112100CC</classCode><className>CATTLE RANCHING &amp; FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>STX002247</classCode><className>HELICOPTERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><classCode>GS002</classCode><className>QUEENSLAND, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GS168</classCode><className>BRITISH COLUMBIA, CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC339</classCode><className>CANADA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

And, finally, is our bush adapted to fire and if so how?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Fire plays a complex role in Australian ecosystems. We live in a fire-prone environment because of our climate. Short, wet winters and a warm spring promote rapid growth. Long, hot, dry summers (which run to April) accompanied by north winds and low humidity dry off undergrowth and create the tinder and fuel for forest fires. Many other parts of the world do not have environmental and climatic conditions to make their areas so fire prone. Wet or short summers, cooling breezes or lack of flammable material make other regions safer.</p><p>But of course it takes a spark to start a fire. The primary natural fire starter is lightning. We don't have many summer storms, so lightning is less of a risk than in other locations. So on the face of it, we may be more fire prone but should have fewer fires than, say, the fir forests of the United States.</p><p>But the vast majority of fires here and throughout the world are started by people (either indirectly or directly). In Adelaide, the Kaurna people have been firing the plains for up to 40,000 years to clear undergrowth, to catch and kill animals, create paths and promote new growth, and to establish new plant species.</p><p>The flora of our environment is adapted to such events. Fire triggers many seeds to open. Either the heat cracks the shells, or chemicals in smoke start the seed growth. In other types of plants, burning to its roots stimulates underground runners to spread the plant. Many trees have buds beneath the bark which will sprout new branches when the limbs burn. So fire promotes biodiversity.</p><p>But we can have too much of a good thing. Obviously, very frequent fires will kill off all the plants and there will not be new seeds. Such areas become choked with a few weedy species whose seeds blow in from surrounding areas.</p><p>Alternatively, no fires is also not an option. Localities which have not suffered a fire for very extended periods also wind up with only a few species. Those short-lived plants, which need fire to germinate their seeds, will have long since died off and their seed is gone. Also the numbers of large trees which are usually controlled because the seedlings are regularly burned will increase in number and grow huge. So instead of a mixture of plants, we have a dense forest. Fire is tough on the animals in the area, and many species may be destroyed if fires are too large and too frequent. But burnt-out trees have hollows and the new shoots of the many new plants provide food. So, provided the area can be recolonised by animals from other areas, a fire can provide new resources.</p><p>The role of fire is one of the most complicated components of our environment. It is bad, but also good. Frequent small ''cold'' fires may reduce the chance of a big firestorm by removing fuel load and weeds, but may not be hot enough to stimulate natural germination of native species and will, of course, kill animals.</p><p>But not burning at all is also not the answer. Getting the balance right is a huge challenge for firefighters and biologists.</p><p>Professor Chris Daniels, University of Adelaide, is co-editor of Adelaide, Nature of a City (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.biocity.edu.au\">www.biocity.edu.au</url>).</p><p>BURNING ISSUES</p><p>* Fire-stick farming by the Kaurna people established a patchwork of environments on the Adelaide plains.</p><p>* Early settlers, unused to bushfires, were amazed at the speed a fi re could travel.</p><p>* Aborigines kept away from thick stringybark forests in part because of fear of forest fires.</p><p>* The 1983 Ash Wednesday fires eradicated the brown bandicoot from the Kyeema Conservation Park south of Adelaide.</p><p>* The small size and number of leaves on grey box trees is a protection against fire: There simply is not much to burn.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ADVSUN-ADV0602181W02497535</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ADVSUN2006</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4J92-5V80-TX52-N349-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244790</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"665\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2006 Nationwide News Pty Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>THE ADVERTISER</publicationName><edition>State Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"02\" year=\"2006\"><dateText>February 18, 2006 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DOX0</classCode><className>WILDFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp; SAFETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000726</classCode><className>FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DOQL</classCode><className>AUSTRALIAN BUSHFIRES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001987</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp; WOODLANDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9M</classCode><className>SEVERE SUMMER WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"70\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00096SH</classCode><className>TELEVISION ADVERTISING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX018</classCode><className>ADELAIDE, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A board meeting in the West Indies today will discuss Lara's future.\"I have not been reading the papers, but have heard Brian and the board have been making statements,\" Richardson said after a closed training session here yesterday.\"All these comments are being made and I don't think it is really good. \"\"Whatever our problems we have to remain quiet and get together,\" Richardson said. Richardson spelt out his belief that the game is bigger than individual players.\"Cricket will always be here. We have just got to play it hard, enjoy it and move on. The players move on but the game will always be here. \"Richardson, who spent almost a year out of cricket with chronic fatigue problems, can empathise with Lara.Lara has been quoted as saying \"cricket is ruining my life\" which is an extraordinary statement about a game which has given him more than $3 million in career earnings in a land where many people cannot afford a meal.\"</p><p>It can be really tough,\" Richardson said. \"People expect you to do well and you don't have much time to focus on what you have got to do.Sometimes you just want to be in your room, but everyone wants you to do this or do that. Everyone wants a piece of you.\"It gets on top of your after a while. It is unfortunate that Brian is going through that at the moment. It's life. But there are ways of dealing with it. Sometimes you just have to cut yourself off from people. \"The West Indies today faces Sri Lanka at the Adelaide Oval and he is adamant his side can regain the winning habit.\"There will be times when things do not go so well but we are just having a lull at the moment,\" he said. \"With hard work we will be back where we were 10 years ago.

He was arrested around 4pm and held overnight for his own safety while investigators searched his house.</p><p>He was not present at his remand hearing in the Morwell Magistrates Court yesterday and did not apply for bail.</p><p>His legal aid lawyer said the man was in a \"fragile mental state\".</p><p>Two of the accused man's supporters in court during the remand later told journalists to \"back off\".

Now, everybody is coughing. That's why I can't go to the office and the kids stay at home too,\" said Ina.</p><p> Many offices were shut and teachers complied with an Education Department order to close down schools.</p><p> The Health Department said it had distributed 20,000 masks.</p><p> On the streets, traffic slowed down as visibility was cut to only a few metres. Many cars switched on their headlights for safety.</p><p> Visibility in the major coastal oil city of Balikpapan was also reduced to metres, forcing disruption to some flights, airport officials said, adding that the runway remained open.</p><p> Pedestrians and motorcyclists donned masks as the smoke thickened in the city, some 125km south of Samarinda, while new fires erupted around the boomtown.</p><p> The fresh blazes were mostly to the west and south-west of Balikpapan, within 10km of the city, and were razing forests and bushland.</p><p> Large fires were also raging in the Bukit Suharto forest area, about 40km to the north, with flames licking at the main highway linking Balikpapan and Samarinda.</p><p> Yesterday, Nurdiansyah, an official in the governor's office in drought-affected East Kalimantan province, said more than 127,000ha had been blackened since fires started there in January.</p><p> At least 400 fires are burning in six districts, including two forest conservation parks.</p><p> He said cloud-seeding efforts have failed so far to produce significant rain to ease drought and wildfires.</p><p> Meteorologists have blamed the weather phenomenon El Nino for keeping seasonal heavy monsoon rains from falling.</p><p> Last year wildfires across Indonesia produced a thick smoke haze that threatened the health of millions over much of South-East Asia.</p><p> The new fires have raised fears that the haze might return over a wide area, perhaps even worse this year.</p><p> Officials have blamed forestry and plantation companies as well as farmers for starting fires to clear land cheaply.</p><p> Fires have also been reported on Sumatra island.</p><p> Dozens of fires had been deliberately lit by farmers and plantation and timber firms, sending sparks and hot ash across the area's rugged jungles and forest canopies to start fresh blazes elsewhere, they added.</p><p> \"It is much worse than last year and it is getting even worse,\" said Hartmut Abberger, of the German-funded Integrated Forest Fire Management \u00a0Project in Samarinda.<br/></p><p> \"When anyone starts a fire now, it is almost impossible to control.\"</p><p>AP was</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">AAPNEW1998</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S8P-BVX0-0048-T391-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">160586</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"525\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>AAP NEWSFEED</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1998 AAP Information Services Pty.

Shaunagh O'Connor discovers the secrets of a life less ordinary</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> SEBASTIAN Junger would still be sleeping on the floor had his girlfriend not insisted he get a bed like a normal person.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But comfortable bedding is not a priority for the foreign correspondent who likes things rough, dirty and dangerous in the world's trouble spots.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> And the author of The Perfect Storm isn't into shopping expeditions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I think a lot of men are like that. I'm just not that interested in my surroundings, materially speaking,\" he says.</p><p>The bestselling American writer, whose The Perfect Storm became a movie starring George Clooney, doesn't need possessions to be a happy man.</p><p> On a tour of Australia to promote his latest book, Fire -- a collection of previously published pieces of journalism -- Junger seems to have the world at his feet.</p><p> He's \"doing a job that I'm absolutely in love with\" and goes so far as to say he's at the peak of his life.</p><p> All the doubts about his worth and ability that he says so haunted him during his 20s have fled.</p><p> \"That's probably the greatest blessing -- that I don't live with self-doubt.\"</p><p> Adding to such blessings are the Storm movie deal, the money that goes with being a key figure in the publishing industry, a movie-star physique and outrageously good looks.</p><p> Junger, who works for Vanity Fair and has written for Harper's and National Geographic Adventure magazines, has carved himself a profitable niche as the man who reveals the amazing stories no one else has considered writing.</p><p> The Perfect Storm was a factual account of the freak killer seas that sank the fishing boat Andrea Gail off the coast of Gloucester in the US.</p><p> Fire reproduces Junger's investigative magazine pieces, filed after trips to war-ravaged and terror-filled Kashmir, Kosovo and Sierra Leone, and into the heart of an enormous US bushfire.</p><p> He won't say too much about his next project, but it will continue the work he does to bring enlightenment to his readers, this time with a US-based event.</p><p> He wants to keep writing, become a father one day, make some television documentaries.</p><p> \"I feel like I'm running out of life -- like everyone is, but I want to do it all.\"</p><p> Junger is one of those writers who always wanted to be published but never quite got around to it.</p><p> \"I've just turned 40, and when you turn 40 you think about your life. I couldn't believe it had been 10 years since my writing got going, and, looking back, how lost and confused I was.\"</p><p> At that time, 10 years ago, Junger was working as a tree climber, a well-paid but life-threatening job lopping branches off enormous trunks.</p><p> He had a well-documented accident involving a chain saw, a tall tree and a deep gash to his leg.</p><p> \"It didn't hurt at all,\" he says now. \"It hurt later when they stitched it.</p><p> \"If you're badly hurt like that you go into shock almost immediately. I pulled it open to see if my achilles was intact.</p><p> \"It was completely undisturbing to do that. I couldn't pull someone else's leg open, but once you're injured you have a clinical detachment.\"</p><p> The incident gave him the idea to write a book about dangerous jobs. That never eventuated, but submitting pieces on the topic to magazines meant editors got to know him \"as the dangerous-jobs guy\".</p><p> He took himself to the forest fire that gives Fire its title and also to Bosnia on a self-appointed work assignment, teaching himself journalism along the way.</p><p> Next came a book contract to write Storm and a characteristically anti-establishment move on Junger's part to reject the life of bestselling author to pursue foreign correspondence.</p><p> \"In America, if you write a bestseller the next thing you do is sign a book contract to write your next book. No one departs from that,' he says.</p><p> \"It's stupid to, because that's when you're worth the most amount of money.\"</p><p> Junger, the once solitary, focused child from a happy, nuclear Boston family, was his school's star long-distance runner.</p><p> He studied cultural anthropology at college purely for interest's sake, and has his physicist father to thank for his writing style: explanations of what a war zone looks like, how a forest fire grows, what an Albanian's body looks like two months after it is shot by Serbs.</p><p> \"He gave me this curiosity about how human society works, about history, about how the natural world works,\" he says.</p><p> \"He would explain things to me, like why the moon has phases and how eclipses work. He couldn't walk down the street without explaining how something worked. It drove my sister crazy, but I loved it.\"</p><p> Junger sports just the right amount of jet-lag stubble, hiking boots and jeans. On the cord around his neck is a boat hook given to him by his best friend, who has the matching one.</p><p> The two small, heavy pieces of metal are designed to interlock without ever wrenching apart, Junger explains.</p><p> After a book tour through Germany, Junger will return home to his apartment in New York and a hug from girlfriend and fellow journalist Victoria Bruce, author of No Apparent Danger, a publication about a tragic volcanic eruption.</p><p> The pair have been a couple for a year, but Bruce lives in Maryland, more than three hours away by car. So where is the relationship going?</p><p> \"I don't know. I don't want to leave New York and she doesn't want to leave Maryland, so you can draw your own conclusions,\" Junger says, laughing at the personal question.</p><p>J UNGER got to know the politics of Afghanistan before September 11 on one of his assignments and has his own take on the terrorism emanating from that country today.</p><p> \"It doesn't take that much organisation to do some car bombs in the US, and they're not doing it. The best they have come up with thus far after September 11 is the shoe bomber, and that guy didn't have his s . . . together, \" he says.</p><p> \"That's the al-Qaeda operative they sent to hurt the US in retaliation for the operation in Afghanistan? That's what they came up with? Then they have some work to do.\"</p><p> Junger's comfortable body language shifts to an embarrassed squirm when asked what he makes of his sex-symbol status, earned through a combination of brain and brawn.</p><p> It's flattering, he says, but it's also \"a little excruciating\".</p><p> \"But if you don't block it out you'll find yourself a 45-year-old man going downtown to have a facial,\" he says.</p><p> \"That's where it leads to. You end up having to play that game. You don't want to turn into that guy.\"</p><p>FIRE</p><p>by Sebastian Junger, Fourth Estate,</p><p>rrp. $27.95</p><p> WHERE filmmakers once looked to books for inspiration, they're now increasingly turning to the novella-sized articles found between the pages of the likes of Vanity Fair and Esquire magazines.</p><p> Sebastian Junger saw his Vanity Fair story of a monster storm become a book, and then a movie, The Perfect Storm.</p><p> Proof of Life started as a Vanity Fair article about kidnap negotiators.</p><p> Another Russell Crowe vehicle to have its germination in the pages of Vanity Fair\u00a0 was The Insider. The story of a tobacco industry whistle-blower and the aftermath of his 60 Minutes appearance became the film.</p><p> An article in New York Post about the lead singer of a Judas Priest tribute band hand-picked to replace the band's real-life lead singer inspired the Mark Wahlberg film Rock Star. But things quickly turned sour with filmmakers removing all reference to Judas Priest when they asked for script approval.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DHS0203091W04520066</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">HERALDSUNLTD</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:459G-YP50-015G-T18N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">244784</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1251\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Herald Sun (Melbourne, Australia)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2002 Nationwide News Pty Limited</copyright><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"03\" year=\"2002\"><dateText>March 9, 2002, Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC MAGAZINE\u00a0</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"53\"><className>\u00a0NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY\u00a0</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001865</classCode><className>WRITERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp;

For a band formed by philosophy students at the University of Glasgow and known for their arch literary references and homage to musical heroes, the audiences of screaming girls seemed incongruous. Inexperienced, flustered and riding on the unexpected success of their first album, Rattlesnakes (1984), the Commotions stumbled through various capital cities before hightailing it back to the UK.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">They did not return.</p><p>Despite a shifting line-up, the Commotions managed two more records - Easy Pieces in 1985 and Mainstream in 1988. The constant borrowings continued; Mainstream opens with the famous first chord from the Beatles's Hard Day's Night, before reprising the themes and melodies of earlier outings. The \"pretentious pop\" label that clung to the band probably didn't help them sustain mainstream success.</p><p>By 1990, Lloyd Cole had moved to New York and become a solo artist. As a survivor of the Scottish music scene, he brought a love of whisky/beer \"boilermakers\" to his new city. \"Within my limited circle,\" he said later, \"my first year in New York is semi-legendary.\" But Cole did go on to make some impressive albums - the inevitable Lloyd Cole in 1990, Don't Get Weird on Me, Babe in 1991, Bad Vibes in 1993 and</p><p>the excellent but commercially unsuccessful Love Story in 1995.</p><p>By now, sales had dwindled, Cole was no longer a marketable commodity, and the record contract ended. He remained known principally for that first magic album, Rattlesnakes, recently named by New Musical Express as one of the Top 50 albums of the '80s. That debut included sublime moments such as Perfect Skin, the title track, and Forest Fire. Cole could craft a lovely simile (\"her heart is like crazy pavement, upside down and back to front\") and memorable tunes.</p><p>His voice could carry the ennui of being mid-twenties, heartbroken at midnight, but ready to pull on the black poloneck and hit the streets again.</p><p>The shy but amiable English-born Cole found New York disappointing. Work was hard to find, and promised new projects died without issue. A series of acoustic club dates to promote the solo albums won critical success but did not lift sales. Cole eventually joined a new band, the Negatives, and an album is expected in the next few months.</p><p>Late last year, he quit New York for a quiet life in western Massachusetts with his wife and two small children. He joked about teaching creative writing - a perhaps necessary new career, given meagre returns from a decade in the Big Apple.</p><p>Lloyd Cole was a fleeting star, remembered only in discounted \"best of\" collections or as a contributor to the soundtrack of There's Something About Mary.</p><p>At 38, he has described himself to Time Out as \"kind of old and on the scrap heap\". Yet he has produced an impressive body of songs, showing that wit and intelligence can count for something in pop music. His solo albums reveal a growing depth and maturity, a journey from meaningless stardom to something more engaging.</p><p>And all done with self-deprecating humour. \"Lay your head upon my shoulder/ let it rest there for a while,\" he sings on his last record. \"I guess that I'm still good for something/ once in a while.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMHRLD-4yi4mz4jmkw12o7an9cg</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMHRLD2000</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4P8B-H2Y0-TXN5-R0RF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">314237</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"538\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2000 John Fairfax Publications Pty Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Sydney Morning Herald</publicationName><edition>Late Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"04\" year=\"2000\"><dateText>April 1, 2000 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JXS</classCode><className>ARTS &amp; HUMANITIES EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009HPZ</classCode><className>STUDENTS &amp; STUDENT LIFE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009V3K</classCode><className>CREATIVE WRITING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009UHV</classCode><className>MUSIC</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009QS2</classCode><className>REPORTS, REVIEWS &amp; SECTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009P1Y</classCode><className>SOCIAL SCIENCE EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009JZJ</classCode><className>LANGUAGE ARTS EDUCATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX000290</classCode><className>CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS &amp; TEENS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>STX001009</classCode><className>FOREST FIRES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001184</classCode><className>MUSIC INDUSTRY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N512210MM</classCode><className>RECORD PRODUCTION &amp; DISTRIBUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp; PERFORMERS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>GX601</classCode><className>NEW YORK, NY, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GX014</classCode><className>SYDNEY, AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GS148</classCode><className>NEW YORK, USA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GS137</classCode><className>MASSACHUSETTS, USA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC676</classCode><className>SCOTLAND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><classCode>GC301</classCode><className>AUSTRALIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>GC329</classCode><className>UNITED KINGDOM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",
