Since the success of a coastal protection project at Pulau Tekong in 2010, NParks has continued to employ nature-based solutions for coastal resilience, with a recently completed project at Kranji Coastal Nature Park. An upcoming coastal protection project will be along approximately 2.2 km of the northern coastline at Pulau Ubin, complemented by a mangrove restoration project at Sungei Durian, located along Pulau Ubin's southern coastline. These projects exemplify NParks' strategies to build climate resilience through the City in Nature vision, a key pillar of the Singapore Green Plan 2030.</p><p>In announcing details for the latest edition of the Singapore Red List, Minister highlighted that several species such as the Lesser Mousedeer and Sunda Slow Loris have improved conservation statuses. This is significant as it signals that the resilience of these species have improved in Singapore. This can be attributed to the biodiversity conservation efforts throughout Singapore, including habitat enhancement and species recovery efforts under the NParks Nature Conservation Masterplan as well as increased capabilities and support from the scientific and nature community. In addition, 13 plant and 13 animal species will be added to NParks Species Recovery Programme, bringing the total number to 80 plant and 40 animal species. This will contribute to NParks' new target to have 100 plant and 60 animal species under the programme by 2030.</p><p>Making these announcements at the 10th edition of the Festival of Biodiversity, which was also officiated by President Halimah Yacob, Minister thanked the community for their contributions towards conserving Singapore's natural heritage, including partners of the Biodiversity Roundtable, which has doubled in numbers since the first Festival of Biodiversity in 2012, and Aramco Asia Singapore for their support towards the Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef programme.</p><p>New CoralAID Mineral Accretion (CAMA) units and marine educational programme, supported by Aramco Asia Singapore</p><p>Under the Plant-A-Coral, Seed-A-Reef programme by NParks' registered charity and IPC, Garden City Fund, NParks will be assessing the efficacy of establishing CoralAID Mineral Accretion (CAMA) units in Singapore's waters to enhance coral growth, as coral recruitment and growth is a slow process. For the first time in Singapore, the new initiative will trial the use of mineral accretion technology to stimulate the growth of hard corals by subjecting them to low-voltage electricity. The trial is supported by an initial seed funding of around $200,000 by Aramco Asia Singapore through the Garden City Fund. In addition, Aramco Asia Singapore will support a new educational programme on local marine biology and marine conservation efforts for schools and the general public from 2021 to 2022. These new initiatives aim to strengthen the resilience of Singapore's coral reefs together with the community.</p><p>Festival of Biodiversity 2021 - 10 years of celebrating Singapore's natural heritage</p><p>Much of what Singapore has achieved in our push to become a City in Nature is due to the strong support of the larger nature community. The Festival of Biodiversity, organised by NParks in collaboration with the Biodiversity Roundtable, is an annual event that showcases and celebrates the community's efforts to conserve Singapore's natural heritage. The Festival aims to deepen appreciation and build stronger ownership of our rich biodiversity among Singaporeans. The United Nations designates 22 May as the International Day for Biological Diversity to increase understanding and awareness of biodiversity issues. This year's theme, \"We're part of the solution\" is aligned with NParks' efforts to partner the community in protecting Singapore's biodiversity and enhancing ecological and climate resilience.</p><p>Since the first edition of Festival of Biodiversity 10 years ago, the number of partners who have helped organised the Festival has grown from under 30 to 67 today, including nature groups, schools, work groups comprising academics, individuals and other stakeholders, as well as members from the Friends of the Parks initiative. The number of citizen scientists has also grown from 470 in 2015 to over 9,000 in 2021, and they are part of NParks' growing volunteer base. As of 2021, NParks has more than 54,000 volunteers. NParks will continue to partner the community and enable more Singaporeans to become active stewards of our biodiversity and environment.</p><p>Source: National Parks Board of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0057033889</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63PR-GP51-DXMP-K234-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"863\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 25, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><classCode>CC00093PJ</classCode><className>SWORDFISH FINANCIAL INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>NAICS333316 PHOTOGRAPHIC &amp;

That treaty -- touted as the biodiversity equivalent of the Paris Agreement on climate change -- aims to halt and reverse biodiversity loss.</p><p> It was my first time attending an international event of this scale.</p><p> The experience of running from room to room and meeting all sorts of people was incredibly overwhelming. </p><p> But it proved enlightening in a few ways. </p><p> Semantics For one thing, it showed the difficulty in getting almost 200 countries to agree on a road map to protect nature. </p><p> I sat through a discussion where negotiators actually debated for 10 minutes over whether to include a full stop and a comma in a sentence.  </p><p> While situations like these can seem amusing, I also recognised the repercussions of a single word change on countries. For example, in a discussion on international commitments for funding, some parties pushed for the word \"should\" instead of \"could\".</p><p> Within the UN negotiations, \"should\" is stronger language that translates to heavier obligations for contributors for funding. </p><p> It is little wonder then, that negotiations progress at a snail's pace, as the negotiations require consensus from all parties to proceed.</p><p> One of the key expectations from COP16 was that countries would agree on indicators that would allow progress in protecting and restoring nature to be tracked.</p><p> But at the end of the two weeks, parties were still unable to adopt a set of indicators for the monitoring and implementation of the global biodiversity framework.</p><p> One key obstacle was the establishment of a novel biodiversity fund to support the implementation of the global biodiversity framework, as developed nations could not agree on how much they were willing to pay to conserve nature around the world. </p><p> That is not to say there were no wins. </p><p> The establishment of a separate fund, dubbed the Cali Fund, encourages companies that use genetic information from nature in pharmaceuticals, for instance, to contribute a portion of revenue earned to ensure the continuity of the habitats that provided these genetic resources in the first place.</p><p> Also formalised was a permanent subsidiary body that recognises and empowers indigenous people and local communities, as well as communities of African descent, as key stakeholders in conservation, enshrining their right to participate in multilateral decision-making.</p><p> Some negotiations dragged on for too long over pedantic squabbling, but others did produce a text that all parties were comfortable adopting.</p><p> Divergent perspectivesSecond, the experience at COP16 showed that different groups -- whether businesses, environmental groups or indigenous peoples -- had entrenched positions on certain issues that may seem hard to resolve.</p><p> The biggest disappointment for me was the discussions on implementing nature-based solutions in addressing climate change.</p><p> These solutions refer to the use of approaches focused on using ecosystems as tools for mitigation, such as the role of forests in carbon sequestration, and adaptation, such as how natural ecosystems can help purify rainwater and prevent floods.</p><p> But the private sector seemed to use it as more of a buzzword, framing discussions on protecting or restoring forests as opportunities for investments into carbon projects. </p><p> Activists and indigenous communities criticise such approaches as anthropocentric, short-sighted \"false solutions\" that enable polluters to continue emitting without addressing the root causes of the crisis.</p><p> Nature's decline is closely interconnected with the climate crisis.</p><p> The COP16 biodiversity summit took place just weeks before the UN climate conference COP29, and the expectation is that discussions on protecting nature will continue there.</p><p> The best solutions for biodiversity would be the ones that benefit climate the most; it will just take a bit more effort and resources to implement meaningfully, which would not be possible if finance negotiations for climate -- one of the key areas expected to be discussed at the event -- stall once again.</p><p> Cities in natureUltimately, negotiations are predicated on parties' national priorities, which are primarily influenced by domestic politics.</p><p>Singapore prides itself as being a City in Nature, with many policies focusing on bringing biodiversity into urban areas.</p><p> That said, Cali, where COP16 was held, prides itself on its biodiversity, and its residents certainly show it. </p><p> Respect for nature is deeply embedded in their culture, with children learning about the sanctity of biodiversity at a young age, taught through legends and stories through their families.</p><p> Singaporeans' appreciation for nature tends to be rather utilitarian. The local focus is often on ecosystem services such as mental health and recreational benefits, urban heat and flood mitigation. Some of these certainly are side effects of Singapore's unique land-use constraints, but it is  interesting to observe a city on the opposite side of the world whose residents really walk the talk.</p><p> Dubbed \"the People's COP\", COP16 puts people front and centre as critical to addressing the imminent biodiversity crisis. </p><p> However, if these ambitions for protecting nature are to become a reality, a fundamental shift in our relationship with nature is needed -- not only from policymakers but from the full array of stakeholders in nature: all of us. We must embrace a broader perspective: One that values nature not only for the services it provides, but also for its intrinsic worth.</p><p> Mr Muhammad Nasry Abdul Nasir is the executive director of the Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity, an advocacy group pushing for stronger biodiversity policies locally. He is also an undergraduate at the Asian School of the Environment at Nanyang Technological University. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Mr Muhammad Nasry Abdul Nasir saw a very different side of conservation during the COP16 conference in Cali, Colombia.

Rain gardens that help cleanse stormwater run-off, support more native biodiversity and enhance flood protection have been incorporated. Plants grown using soil bio-engineering techniques also help stabilise the soil.This is just one example of how nature-based solutions and engineered solutions are being integrated to create \"green-grey\" infrastructure that helps Singapore mitigate and adapt to climate change, said Koh Lian Pin, professor at the National University of Singapore and the director of its Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. Alongside moves to decarbonise the economy through the use of cleaner energy production systems, nature-based solutions are also part of the toolkit in the transition to a circular economy.Termed \"closing the loop\" by some, this refers to a production and consumption model where the life cycles of products are extended as long as possible through reuse or recycling. Nature-based solutions are, simply put, about using nature to improve the state of the world. </p><p>These solutions could provide over one-third of the cost-effective climate mitigation needed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, said GenZero, an investment platform dedicated to decarbonisation solutions. According to a report by state investment firm Temasek in collaboration with the World Economic Forum and strategic economics consultancy AlphaBeta, nature-based opportunities across 3 systems - food, land, and ocean; infrastructure and the built environment; as well as energy and extractives - could deliver US$4.3 trillion of annual economic value and generate 232 million jobs by 2030 in Asia-Pacific. Opportunities for nature-based solutionsThe phrase \"nature-based solutions\" may be relatively new, but the concept behind it is not. Humans have been planting trees for centuries to control erosion, for example. Suvro Sarkar, analyst at DBS Group Research, said that forest and wetlands conservation as well as active afforestation and reforestation still remain key focus areas. Others include blue carbon projects, which involve harnessing the power of carbon sequestration through algae, mangroves, seagrasses and other plants in coastal areas. Soil carbon and agriculture projects could also help in reducing emissions from soil degradation and food production practices. But new opportunities have risen in today's modern economy. The development of carbon markets can play a major role in financing these nature-based solutions. Koh said that governments and businesses are sourcing for nature-based carbon credits mainly from international voluntary carbon markets or from carbon project developers directly. \"Most of these credits derive from forest conservation projects and reforestation projects, which generate carbon emission avoidance credits and carbon dioxide removal credits, respectively,\" he said. According to global asset manager BlackRock, there is tremendous growth potential for voluntary carbon markets, as corporates, industries and governments race to meet their net-zero commitments. The total addressable market for voluntary carbon markets is expected to grow by between 15 and 60 times by 2030. Based on forecasts from Trove Research, a data and advisory company specialising in climate strategy and carbon markets, the value of carbon offsets will grow from US$2.8 billion in 2021 to US$63 billion in 2030.It also projected that the carbon credit price has to at least double from US$10 per tonne in 2020 to between US$20 and US$30 per tonne in 2030 in order to incentivise sufficient investment in carbon offset projects for the demand.Singapore has jumped on this growing market through the launch of Climate Impact X, a carbon exchange jointly established by DBS Bank, Singapore Exchange, Standard Chartered Bank, and Temasek.Ho Pei Hwa, analyst at DBS Group Research, said that companies developing tools and platforms to make the trading of carbon credits easier and more transparent in the future will be keenly watched. Circular economy initiativesSimilar to nature-based solutions, reusing and recycling are not new ideas. But the focus now on environmental, social and governance (ESG) considerations has created market opportunities in areas such as product redesign and waste management. Meghan Sharp, head of Decarbonization Partners - a joint venture between BlackRock and Temasek that invests in decarbonisation solutions - said they are looking at an opportunity in the synthetic leather space, where the material is made out of mushrooms. Mycellium, which is a part of a fungus from which mushrooms grow, is said to be able to reduce carbon footprint by 5 times as it is bio-degradable. Ellen Martin, director of impact and insights at The Circulate Initiative - the non-profit arm of investment management firm Circulate Capital - noted that global players such as PepsiCo and Unilever have committed to having all of their plastic packaging be fully reusable, recyclable or compostable by 2025. \"This in turn creates demand for recycled products and materials and encourages innovations in the waste management space that may not have otherwise been realised,\" she said.DBS Group Research said Internet of Things solutions could be used to manage waste collection, whereby devices could be used to sort out waste for efficient recycling. Artificial intelligence could also be utilised to better predict demand for goods and services, so that companies can better manage their inventory to minimise use of resources or wastage. It also added that the sharing economy could be digitalised through the development of mobile applications that promote the donation of used items, as well as the repairing and recycling of electronic items. An emerging technology-based approach to the circular economy model is the development of carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) capabilities. CCUS is a collective term that refers to a range of solutions that essentially allow carbon dioxide, produced through the burning of fossil fuels, to either be stored underground or converted into other useful substances, thereby preventing it from reaching the Earth's atmosphere. According to Ho, CCUS is one of the most cost-effective solutions available for the large-scale reduction of emissions. Currently, about 40 million tonnes of carbon is captured each year. However, CCUS deployment must increase by about 140 times for the amount of carbon captured to reach 5.6 Gigatonnes, said the Global CCS Institute. This amount would account for a fifth of emissions reductions needed by 2050.Due to Singapore's limited land space, Sarkar pointed out that the use of waste-to-energy plants and CCUS could be key tools in carbon recycling. The issues inhibiting the scaling of CCUS are down to costs and uncertainties around its performance. While the technology has been around for decades, it is still considered immature, and the cost to capture and store post-combustion emissions remain very high, said Ho. \"This needs to be resolved through incentivising and ramping up research and development in this field and implementing carbon taxes worldwide. Higher prices of carbon compliance could act as a tipping point towards reaching economies of scale for CCUS technologies,\" said Ho. Making that transitionAccording to a 2021 survey conducted by the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), 51 per cent of a sample of 51 cities and regions from 21 OECD countries do not yet have a circular economy initiative, though they are planning to. Only 12 per cent indicated that they did not have plans to develop one, while the remaining 37 per cent already have programmes in place. Some of the biggest obstacles cited by respondents to transiting to a circular economy include the lack of financing, financial risks, and an inadequate regulatory framework. \"Focusing on a more sustainable way of living has never been more urgent, with global temperatures on the rise, more frequent occurrences of extreme weather events and more,\" said DBS Group Research. \"In our view, a circular economy can alleviate the challenges that come about with global warming, though significant progress is still needed.\" However, moving from a linear economy to a circular one requires a transformation of global supply chains, and this cannot be accomplished in isolation, said Martin. While companies are working with suppliers to pilot new materials and production methods, governments can support the growth of circular solutions and influence the way businesses operate through enabling policies such as regulations defining recycled-content requirements, she said. \"Policymakers also have the opportunity to facilitate more private investments into the circular economy by introducing financing mechanisms that reduce or share risk,\" added Martin. She also suggested companies can start their transition with small steps before advancing to more significant business model shifts. \"From a product development perspective, companies can look at replacing hard-to-recycle materials such as multi-layer plastic film with more sustainable alternatives. This in turn ensures that end-products can be reintroduced into the economy and are kept out of landfills,\" she added. On top of the long-term challenge of mitigating climate change, governments are also tackling other more-present problems, such as supply chain disruptions, energy security concerns and inflation woes. Koh said many will have to reconcile and, in some cases, triage these competing priorities. \"However, there are opportunities to leverage science and technology to help inform government and business decisions on which solutions to prioritise, where to target our actions and how to execute them for maximum benefit while minimising trade-offs,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Incorporating rain gardens helped naturalise this concrete canal at Tampines.

As we experience warmer days and more unpredictable rainy seasons, South-east Asian countries are increasingly looking to nature to help us cope with the effects of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore is recognised as a champion of urban greenery or so-called urban \"nature-based solutions\", and its experience and know-how benefit other countries. </p><p> Yet let's not forget that Singapore is an exception when it comes to urbanisation in Asia-Pacific: Being a landlocked city-state, its horizontal growth is limited by the social and environmental costs of land reclamation. </p><p> Most importantly, Singapore's unique socio-economic policies mean that it is likely the only country in the region without informal settlements or slums -- neighbourhoods often with precarious housing and limited access to infrastructure.</p><p> According to United Nations estimates, more than one billion people live in informal settlements globally, and South and South-east Asia are currently home to most of them. The residents of quickly growing informal settlements are disproportionately affected by hazards such as heatwaves and floods.</p><p> This makes it important to study the win-win potential of nature-based solutions for informal settlements: Not only could these solutions help address current climate hazards -- by providing shade for heat mitigation or absorbing water for flood reduction -- but they could also help improve living conditions more broadly, by supporting food production or fostering social cohesion. </p><p> And the cherry on top is that nature-based solutions also help address the unfolding biodiversity crisis in the region by promoting an ecosystem-based approach and restoring or protecting current ecosystems.</p><p> What we know about nature-based solutions  in informal settlementsTo move from theory to practice, we recently reviewed hundreds of documents from South-east Asian and the Pacific countries to examine the state of the art. </p><p> We found 37 projects that are already using such solutions in informal settlements -- a figure that is a lower bound of the actual number of projects, as not all projects are documented, let alone in English-language literature. </p><p> Yet these projects demonstrate that at least six types of nature-based solutions are used in the region, including tree planting, constructed wetlands and coastal reforestation.</p><p> These projects are concentrated in eight countries (shown on the map) and are implemented by governments, communities and non-governmental organisations, such as the Asian Cities Climate Change Resilience Network, the Asian Coalition for Housing Rights and the Cities Alliance. </p><p> Most of the projects are located in Indonesia and Vietnam, but Cambodia, Fiji and Thailand also have experiences with nature-based solutions in informal settlements. </p><p> Our review showed that while mangrove planting and other well-established nature-based solutions can be useful to combat the effects of climate change, lesser-known types of solutions are also key to prepare cities in Asia-Pacific for the future.</p><p> Experiences from South-east Asian cities show that various types of projects, ranging from community gardens to constructed wetlands, can also improve the access to food, health and culture in informal settlements. </p><p> Large projects such as the Revitalising Informal Settlements and their Environments programme in Indonesia and initiatives funded by The Rockefeller Foundation in Thailand, for example, demonstrate that nature-based solutions can offer multiple benefits, including improving water quality, preventing soil erosion, providing habitat to native species and beautifying cities.</p><p> We also found that \"grassroots\" low-cost initiatives, such as community gardens, play important roles for people living in informal settlements. These solutions, often developed by residents and local organisations, are important to improve food security, create bonds between community members and provide spaces for recreation and connection with nature.</p><p> Future of nature-based solutions in informal settlementsWhile these initiatives show that nature-based solutions can help communities across the Asia-Pacific be better prepared for the effects of climate change, some challenges remain for their implementation. </p><p> Some of these projects, such as an aerated lagoon in Vietnam's Ho Chi Minh City, occupy a significant amount of land -- a precious resource in informal settlements -- while some types of urban farming require expensive maintenance efforts. </p><p> Many of these projects are also not being monitored, so we don't know if they are effective and sustainable in the long term. It is important that these projects continue to be implemented, but also that they are managed adaptively to ensure they continue performing as expected and providing all their benefits to their communities.</p><p> So where to go from here? </p><p> We need more research on how nature-based solutions are being designed, installed and maintained. The examples found in the Asia-Pacific region show that they are more effective when they are connected to local needs and when communities are deeply involved in their implementation and use. </p><p> It is key, for example, to understand and design solutions that are appropriate to each context, as some communities might perceive nature as untidy or dangerous. Addressing these concerns during project implementation is essential to ensure that communities feel represented and can be important stewards of nature in the city.</p><p> While the story of how Asia-Pacific cities prepare for climate change is still being written, there is no doubt that nature will play an important role. </p><p> The experiences with nature-based solutions in informal settlements demonstrate that having nature in cities can provide vulnerable communities with invaluable opportunities to produce food, clean the rivers and cope with hot days.</p><p> If we can leverage their benefits and make sure that nature-based solutions are well-designed and maintained, it is clear they can make our cities more biodiverse, liveable and prepared to deal with the effects of climate change.</p><p> Erich Wolff is a research fellow at Nanyang Technological University's Asian School of the Environment.

Countries in the region also need assistance to phase out coal.</p><p> But the recently concluded UN Climate Change Conference COP29 could offer some hope, with developed countries agreeing to channel US$300 billion (S$402 billion) a year to developing countries by 2035. The ultimate aim is to raise US$1.3 trillion annually by 2035 for countries in need, through various forms of finance. </p><p> But the US$300 billion core amount was criticised as woefully insufficient by climate-vulnerable countries and civil society, who expected richer countries -- who were historical emitters -- to commit more. </p><p> It is also uncertain how the amount will be raised. While developed countries will take the lead, the COP29 decision stated that the amount will come from \"a wide variety of sources, public and private, bilateral and multilateral, including alternative sources\".</p><p> Mr Gao Xi, a research associate at the NUS Energy Studies Institute (ESI), said: \"Most South-east Asian countries are coastal, making them particularly vulnerable to threats such as typhoons, floods and droughts caused by climate change. Frequent extreme weather events often result in significant financial losses and social disruptions.\"</p><p> In 2024 alone, the Philippines was struck by six typhoons within a span of 30 days -- between October and November -- killing more than 170 people, displacing more than 214,000 people and causing damage worth about 470 million pesos (S$10.8 million). While the archipelago is prone to tropical storms, such back-to-back typhoons within a month is unusual. </p><p> As most countries in South-east Asia are still developing and have relatively weak economic foundations, climate finance is necessary for the region to take climate action, added Mr Gao, with money particularly needed for clean energy generation, low-carbon transport and coastal defence.</p><p> According to the International Energy Agency, Asean will need US$21 billion in investments annually from 2026 to 2030 just to upgrade its energy infrastructure. And to build resilience against climate impacts, the region needs US$422 billion until 2030.</p><p> The finance outcomes from the UN conference in Azerbaijan could also benefit other developments in South-east Asia, such as the future regional power grid and carbon trading, which can also benefit Singapore. </p><p> Funding the  Asean power grid The funds pledged at COP29 could provide crucial support for accelerating the development of the Asean power grid. </p><p> One of the region's decades-long ambitions, the complex power interconnection will enable electricity trade across borders -- for both energy security and access to greener energy. </p><p> The regional ambition made progress with the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore electricity import pilot in 2022, which transmitted 100MW of hydropower from Laos to Singapore, via Malaysia and Thailand. This was later extended to include another 100MW from Malaysia's electricity grid in October 2024, but this includes a mix of energy sources, including coal and natural gas. </p><p>Singapore is also laying the groundwork for the regional grid by committing to import 5.6GW of clean electricity from Cambodia, Vietnam and Indonesia. </p><p> Asean envisions a power grid by 2045, and climate finance has the potential to address the unique challenges of financing such a large-scale, multi-country initiative, said Mr Beni Suryadi, acting executive director at the Asean Centre for Energy based in Indonesia. </p><p> Several key challenges make traditional financing for the Asean power grid difficult. One is cross-border investment risks, since the giant grid will involve multiple countries with different regulatory frameworks and tariffs.</p><p> Another is the high upfront capital required, especially for building the grid and transmission infrastructure. The resulting long payback periods can put off traditional investors, who seek quicker returns, noted Mr Beni.</p><p> Climate finance can loosen these gridlocks. These funds often come in the form of concessional loans with low interest rates, grants, or guarantees which lower the financial risks for private investors. When forms of finance like green bonds, blended finance and funding from the World Bank or the Asian Development Bank are injected into a mega-project first, the risks are lowered for private investors to participate. </p><p> Blended finance refers to bringing together monies from the public sector, the multilateral development banks, philanthropies and the private sector. </p><p> \"This is where climate finance can step in -- by bridging these gaps, mitigating risks, and enabling investments that otherwise might not materialise,\" he added. </p><p> As a wealthier developing country, Singapore would not be a recipient of the US$1.3 trillion, and instead would contribute voluntarily to climate finance. But the island-state would be a beneficiary, nonetheless, of the Asean power grid, which would enable it to import low-carbon and renewable electricity to reduce its carbon emissions. </p><p>Singapore's National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) said the Asean power grid would maximise the region's diverse renewable energy potential by matching renewable resource-rich areas with those that need to buy clean energy. </p><p> \"By doing so, it can reduce the region's dependence on fossil fuels, increase resilience against fluctuations in global energy markets and make progress towards our decarbonisation targets,\" the NCCS spokesperson added. </p><p> But while the Asean power grid is undoubtedly a worthy project, directing climate finance to it would not be straightforward, as it would be considered an electricity transmission project, said Mr Beni. </p><p> Whether transmission projects are considered to be green and contribute to reducing carbon emissions is still a question to be settled.</p><p> \"At the moment, climate finance for transmission infrastructure projects is still nascent, while the needs are huge,\" he added. </p><p> South-east Asia: Between the devil and the deep blue seaSouth-east Asia is in a tricky position when it comes to receiving climate finance as stipulated by COP29. On the one hand, Myanmar, the Philippines, Thailand, Vietnam and Cambodia were, until 2019, among the 20 countries most exposed to climate risks, according to the Global Climate Risk Index, which is published by non-profit organisation Germanwatch. </p><p> But South-east Asia is expected to continue its fast economic growth, accompanied by more greenhouse gas emissions, noted Dr Kim Jeong Won, a senior research fellow at ESI. </p><p> This growth has reclassified many Asean nations as middle-income countries, reducing their eligibility for development financing, she added. </p><p> Among the developing nations, the least developed countries and small island developing states are recognised as having the greatest need for support. </p><p> Given the competition for funding, a significant gap already exists between the required investments and actual finance that the countries have received. For example, only 9.7 per cent of investments from the UN's Green Climate Fund -- the world's largest fund of its kind -- has been channelled to South-east Asia. </p><p> Similarly, only 6.3 per cent of investments from the UN's Adaptation Fund has been allocated to Asean countries, said Dr Kim. </p><p> She added: \"South-east Asian countries are expected to compete for limited bilateral and multilateral public funding with other low-income developing countries.\"</p><p> If they want to attract a greater share of private funding, it is vital that countries develop more innovative finance models and attractive climate-related projects, she noted. </p><p> Ms Lau Xin Yi, sustainable finance lead for South-east Asia at the Carbon Trust consultancy, is looking at a newer type of finance tool called climate transition bonds.</p><p> The proceeds from these bonds can be used for a wider range of decarbonisation projects, including those in hard-to-abate sectors such as steel, cement and petrochemicals.</p><p> Despite guidelines to prevent greenwashing, Ms Lau noted that about 90 per cent of the transition bonds issued globally has been dominated by Japan's issuances.</p><p> \"Climate transition bonds can help South-east Asia unlock more capital needed for its low-carbon transition. More capital will be channelled towards clean technologies, but how transition is achieved will vary across sectors and regions,\" said Ms Lau. </p><p> More incentives to  protect Asean forestsA bright spot at COP29 was an agreement on carbon trading, achieved after nearly 10 years of negotiations. </p><p> Carbon trading is governed under a segment of the Paris Agreement known as Article 6, which was finalised at COP29. This means countries can trade carbon credits in two ways -- either under a UN-managed carbon programme or through bilateral agreements.  </p><p>Singapore is currently collaborating with more than 20 countries in carbon markets, including the Philippines, Vietnam and Cambodia. </p><p> With Article 6 in place, NCCS said countries that do not have their own national registry to transfer credits can also now use an international registry or receive support from the UN to create their own system. </p><p> \"This reduces the barriers to entry, encouraging more countries to start engaging in carbon markets cooperation, including with Singapore.\"</p><p> Mr Anshari Rahman, director of policy and analytics at Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero, said that carbon markets can unlock financing for deserving and untapped technology, and nature-based solutions in the region.</p><p> South-east Asia, which is home to the world's third-largest tropical forest basin after the Amazon and the Congo, would have more incentives to protect it, if it were to receive carbon credits arising from nature-based projects. </p><p> Mr Olivier Levallois, founder of Hamerkop Climate Impacts, said some examples are a peat swamp conservation project in Indonesia's Tanjung Puting National Park, and a carbon forestry programme in Timor-Leste that also benefits small-scale farmers.</p><p>Singapore has also mandated that carbon project developers must contribute 5 per cent of their share of proceeds from carbon credits towards the host country's adaptation efforts. This is another way of raising climate finance. </p><p> \"Considering Singapore's position as a regional carbon trading hub, it should benefit from this early-stage excitement, with more project developers getting involved and capital flowing into carbon projects,\" added Mr Levallois.</p><p> Mr Anshari noted that progress on Article 6 at COP29 helped to shore up market confidence for carbon markets, which have been under scrutiny for years. </p><p> Mr Levallois said the next steps are to work towards carbon projects, set up regulatory frameworks and develop carbon monitoring methods. A crucial aspect of this process is to increase demand for credits. </p><p> \"The market needs to have stronger demand signal, and it is unclear yet whether companies will suddenly trust these (Article 6) mechanisms and make funding available to address their climate impacts,\" he added.</p><p> Mr Anshari said: \"We are closely tracking the development of the infrastructure and tracking systems required to operationalise Article 6 decisions, and we expect to see meaningful progress in 2025 with the first few (carbon) projects to be registered under the (UN) by COP30 in Brazil.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Children playing on a flooded street in Hat Yai district on Nov 30.

Many countries will not have the resources to cope with the worsening impact of climate change. </p><p> The Adaptation Gap Report published in October stated that additional adaptation finance of between US$194 billion (S$260 billion) and US$366 billion a year is needed by 2030.</p><p> Finance sources come from international public finance, countries' domestic expenditure and private finance. It has been challenging to garner private finance to fund adaptation projects as these are often not profitable. </p><p> The proposed Long Island project, which will be reclaimed off East Coast Park, will not only serve as Singapore's response to the threat of rising sea levels and inland flooding, but also create up to 60,000 new homes, which will be a mix of both public and private housing. </p><p> The sea level around Singapore is expected to rise by 1m by the end of the century. When coupled with high tides and storms, this could make the Republic vulnerable to heavy flooding.</p><p> Mr Lam said during a panel discussion on Dec 9 at the Singapore Pavilion of the COP28 summit: \"Unfortunately, adaptation doesn't attract as much finance because the returns (on investments) are the prevention of losses. </p><p> \"And prevention of losses is something you don't see until the loss actually happens.\" </p><p> Multi-functional coastal protection solutions that Singapore has adopted could be viable for other cities to attract private-sector finance, he added.</p><p> To ensure more adaptation finance is given to rural communities to protect them from sea-level rise, some revenue from carbon projects involving nature-based solutions, like the planting of mangroves, can be directed to adaptation, said Mr Lam.  </p><p> Mangroves are not only coastal guardians against sea-level rise, but also huge stores of carbon dioxide, trapping the planet-warming gas in their roots. </p><p> The other panellists were Ms Hazel Khoo, national water agency PUB's director of coastal protection; Ms Meike van Ginneken, water envoy for the Netherlands; and Mr Takahiro Konami, director of international affairs office at Japan's Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism.  </p><p> Ms van Ginneken pointed to the latest figures by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, which found that only 9 per cent of private finance has gone to adaptation.</p><p> She suggested that the bulk of public finance be channelled to more adaptation projects, and for private finance to be used for renewable energy, which helps to mitigate climate change.  </p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) had launched a US$5 billion blended finance initiative to channel finance to projects that would otherwise not be profitable, such as those in clean energy, nature-based solutions, and waste and water management.  </p><p> MAS told The Straits Times that the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership is \"not precluded\" from investing in climate adaptation projects if it meets the risk-return and climate-impact criteria for the investment themes under the partnership. </p><p> Ms Khoo said multi-functional coastal protection solutions also enable Singapore to optimise its space constraints.  </p><p> \"Beyond that, we also want to see whether we can employ nature-based solutions that can be incorporated with engineering measures so that we can enhance our marine biodiversity and natural development at the same time,\" she added. </p><p>Singapore is conducting eight islandwide site-specific studies of its coastlines to determine the most suitable coastal protection solutions for each segment. </p><p> Asked whether Singapore has plans for coastal infrastructure at each of the coastlines, Ms Khoo said: \"There are a lot of opportunities for hybrid solutions, but I wouldn't say that at this point in time, we will be able to nail down specifically what works at each segment of the coastline. </p><p> \"We are learning a lot from other countries, we have learnt from Japan and we want to see what they have done there to inspire us to similarly think about the type of approach towards nature-based solutions.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Waves near the Pulau Ubin jetty.

It was launched by the South-east Asia Climate and Nature-based Solutions (Scene) Coalition at the Conference of Parties, or COP28, in Dubai on Dec 2. </p><p> Speaking to The Sunday Times, Ms Dewi Ratna Sari, project manager in charge of the team developing the NbS tool, said: \"There is still a very limited number of carbon projects, because not many front-line NGOs doing forest protection or restoration have the capacity to document their information and to generate project documentation.\" </p><p> There are more than 100 front-line NGOs in Indonesia that are keen to use the Web-based tool, which was also demonstrated to NGOs in the Philippines. </p><p> Carbon projects reduce, capture or avoid carbon emissions. They can involve renewable energy installations, sustainable agriculture practices or nature-based solutions like forest conservation and restoration. </p><p> To start developing a carbon project, NGOs must first quantify the potential amount of carbon that will be offset. To calculate this, they must use methodology or protocols specific to the type of project. Project activities are then detailed in a design document certified by internationally recognised organisations, including Verra, Gold Standard, American Carbon Registry and Climate Action Reserve. </p><p> Prior to the tool, the process of documentation was cumbersome because front-line NGOs typically found it difficult to access data such as the area of forest covered by the project, or the amount of carbon stored by the forest, said Ms Dewi.</p><p> \"With this tool, what they need to do is draw the area, and then we will flesh out all the data,\" said Ms Dewi, who is also the Innovative Forest Financing Project lead with the World Resources Institute (WRI) Indonesia, one of the eight NGOs of the Scene Coalition. </p><p> Using data analysed by Google Earth Engine from satellite images, the NbS tool maps out land that is covered by the forest and provides historical data on deforestation and carbon stored by the forest. </p><p> The tool also forecasts the deforestation risk from the amount of carbon lost should a carbon project fail to take place. Additionality -- a term financiers use to justify the impact of a carbon project -- would be the difference between what is calculated to be the carbon currently stored by a forest and the loss from potential deforestation. Buyers would then purchase carbon credits, with one credit equivalent to one tonne of carbon emissions, to offset their own carbon emissions. </p><p> In line with Scene Coalition's focus on forest conservation to mitigate climate change while benefiting local communities, the tool also features metrics measuring benefits to the communities in the area covered by the project. These include income, education and employment in forest-related sectors. </p><p> In June 2023, Google.org, the philanthropic arm of Google, provided US$1 million (S$1.3 million) to develop the NbS tool. </p><p> Apart from WRI Indonesia, other NGOs that are part of Scene Coalition include Conservation International, The Nature Conservancy, IDH-the Sustainable Trade Initiative, BirdLife International, WWF-Singapore (World Wide Fund for Nature Singapore), Wildlife Conservation Society and Mandai Nature. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-AF5N9LF</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69SK-FJ31-DYX4-0012-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"591\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Now, it's very different and if we are not careful, it can be lost,\" said Dr Zia, 47.</p><p> These ecosystems are crucial in humanity's bid to tackle climate change. </p><p> Mangroves are coastal defenders. Their sturdy roots can withstand the impact of strong waves and prevent soil erosion. Their tangled webs of roots trap sediment from the tides, enabling the mangroves to keep pace with sea-level rise, protecting inland communities. Mangroves are also powerful carbon stores -- they can absorb three times more carbon than tropical rainforests. </p><p>Indonesia is home to more than a fifth of the world's mangroves. </p><p> Over the years, the mangroves have thinned as they make way for fishing, agriculture, settlements, and illegal and legal logging.</p><p> But all is not lost. Dr Zia is sowing hope -- not least among his students -- at a restoration site in the Banyuasin district of South Sumatra.</p><p> \"It's like my baby is born into the world,\" he said, describing the growth of a mangrove seedling. </p><p> Banyuasin lost around 10,000ha of mangroves from 2014 to 2019. The district covers an area of approximately 1.2 million ha, with around 130,000ha of mangroves inside and outside Sembilang National Park.</p><p> At the Banyuasin villages, the communities have noticed that the felling of mangrove trees had increased the susceptibility of the area to flooding when the tides are high. </p><p> The Sungsang Mangrove Restoration and Ecotourism (Smart) project aims to restore the mangroves, so as to improve their potential to absorb more planet-warming carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere. The project is a collaboration between Sriwijaya University, the Centre for International Forestry Research and World Agroforestry (CIFOR-ICRAF), the South Sumatra Watershed Forum, and the Banyuasin District Government. Singapore's Temasek Foundation is supporting the project.</p><p> Since the project started in 2021, it has already achieved its goal of restoring 15ha of damaged mangroves -- equivalent in size to 21 football fields -- with more than 40,000 seedlings planted over that area.</p><p> Restoring a mangrove is hard work and can even be discouraging when seedlings are damaged.</p><p> \"What you see now wasn't like this three years ago,\" Dr Zia said, pointing to a restored mangrove plot that was once failed agricultural land. \"It is not alakazam and it suddenly happens -- it's a process.\"</p><p> This area, one of four zones, is the biggest at 7.7ha, with more than 31,000 mangrove seedlings planted.</p><p> Seeds are first planted at a nursery. After three to four months, seedlings are collected and transported to the site, where about 30 people do the planting.</p><p> The restoration team began working with around 10 species and eventually decided on four that are suitable for the environment: Bruguiera gymnorrihiza, Kandelia candel, Rhizophora mucronata and Rhizophora apiculata.</p><p> One of Dr Zia's students, Mr Muhtadi S. Kel, 25, said: \"I learnt how patience is important because it was very easy to get pessimistic during the first period of planting because many seedlings died. But we persevered.\"</p><p> Seedlings are at risk of attack by natural predators like crabs and getting washed away by strong currents. To protect the seedlings from these threats, they use a bamboo sheath to surround the plant.</p><p> \"If you plant but you don't monitor, I can guarantee you that the seedlings will not grow. Planting is easy but making sure the mangroves grow well is very difficult,\" said senior scientist Herry Purnomo, country director for CIFOR-ICRAF in Indonesia.</p><p> At this site, only about 50 per cent of planted seedlings survive, he said.</p><p> Monitoring is critical so damaged seedlings can be replanted. It is done through an app-based system. The app captures information such as how many mangrove plants stay alive, which ones die and where, and pest infestations.</p><p> The researchers also pointed to the importance of getting the support of the local community for the restoration efforts, without which the replanted stands of mangrove trees could be cut down again. </p><p> Many coastal communities throughout South-east Asia, including the villages in Banyuasin, rely on nature for their livelihoods.</p><p> To support their families, mangroves in the area had been cleared to make room for agriculture use such as coconut plantations.</p><p> Understandably, the villagers were not supportive of the initial mangrove restoration efforts, as they were afraid their livelihoods would be compromised, said Dr Zia. \"When I first asked for directions, they pointed me the wrong way,\" he added. </p><p> Currently, three alternative income-generating activities are being explored at the site -- the sale of mangrove seedlings to companies, ecotourism, and crab-rearing. </p><p> Former fisherman Ratam, who like many Indonesians goes by one name, now earns an income from the sale of mangrove seedlings to state-owned companies.</p><p> So far, some 30,000 seedlings have been sold, amid a global resurgence of interest in nature-based solutions such as mangrove restoration as a way of tackling climate change.</p><p> On the ecotourism front, the village hopes the restored mangrove site can be an eco-education tourism hub, attracting students, researchers and visitors.</p><p> Some 1,300 visitors have visited the mangrove ecotourism area -- their visits boosting local incomes with food sales, homestays and transportation.</p><p> A group from the nearby Marga Sungsang Village approached CIFOR-ICRAF to restore mangroves in their village to support the creation of a crab farm. </p><p> They told Dr Zia: \"We know that without mangroves, there are no mangrove crabs.\"</p><p> Said Dr Zia: \"Usually, projects start from the top down but this project started from the bottom up. So I was very surprised.\" He noted how silvofishery -- a farming method where mangrove conservation is integrated with food production -- was a collaborative effort between villagers and CIFOR-ICRAF.</p><p> The first harvest in 2024 produced around 240kg of crabs.</p><p> \"We are now targeting harvest for the new year and Chinese New Year, and we hope we can produce 1 tonne of crabs to sell,\" said Mr Tahang, 50, head of the crab silvofishery group.</p><p> Said Ms Heng Li Lang, head of climate and liveability at Temasek Foundation: \"We hope that this pilot programme can scale further to drive greater impact for the people and the planet today and for generations to come.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Left: Visitors climbing down from a treehouse on a sandbank island known as Pasir Hitam in Banyuasin Regency in South Sumatra.

Ways must be found to win popular support to accelerate the shift to a low-carbon future. It requires a fair transition, one that overcomes the anxieties over costs that have led to pushback within many populations. But it also means overcoming the short-sightedness that is now the norm in most societies, so as to ensure fairness not only today but also for future generations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Likewise, the challenge of meeting the needs of steadily ageing societies, without sending the invoice to the next generation. And so too, dealing with AI (artificial intelligence) -- the most profound technological change of our times, with benefits as well as risks that are likely to grow exponentially in the coming decade and beyond. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> We can address these long challenges only by stretching our economic and political horizons. And by finding ways to rebuild optimism and solidarity within our societies, so that people can imagine how the future can be better for all. The collective belief in the future has to be both the means and the end.</p><p> Building a realistic optimism We are starting from a difficult place. Confidence in the future has been on the decline in most societies. They are also more divided. A survey of 19 high- and middle-income societies by Pew Research in 2022 found the majority feeling more divided than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Only three countries avoided this, including Singapore, where 75 per cent of people felt more united than before the pandemic. On top of all this, confidence in the multilateral order is at its lowest point.  </p><p> Yet, to tackle problems like climate change, we must first recognise the scale and seriousness of the challenge -- not so we add to the mood of despondency, but so we build realistic optimism. </p><p> The world is far behind the actions it needs to stay within 1.5 deg C of global warming, and to prevent accelerated warming after we hit 1.5 deg C. The best scientific estimates tell us that the remaining carbon budget, or the maximum amount of emissions the world can make so that global warming remains below 1.5 deg C, is likely to be used up in about five years' time. </p><p> Even more worrying: there is radical uncertainty as to what comes next. The planet is losing its critical buffers against warming -- the natural ecosystems on land and in the oceans, that have been soaking up more than 50 per cent of carbon dioxide that the world emits, are losing that ability. It is also beginning to cross tipping points -- such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and the shift in the Amazon from being a huge carbon sink to being a net emitter -- which can lead to runaway global warming. </p><p> The implications are clear. First, tackling climate change will be much more costly, and vastly more complex and difficult, if we defer action. We must act early, especially to develop scale in clean energy and green technologies, so that they become as affordable and as reliable as what we do with fossil fuels. </p><p> Second, clear and credible public policies are key to achieving the scale and speed that is required. Carbon pricing has to be the centrepiece. It will help catalyse the needed shift in private investments towards green opportunities in every sector, and also provide the revenues needed to support the transition and ensure poorer segments of the population are not disadvantaged. But it is generally understood that carbon pricing, within socially realistic limits, will not on its own be adequate. Targeted regulations in specific sectors, which in many cases such as in aviation and maritime transport will have to be internationally managed, are needed to provide certainty for businesses and spur innovation. </p><p> We also need public investment in R&amp;D and to build out new grids and other public infrastructure for a clean energy future. But higher spending will be a problem in many countries -- given already large public debts, and interest rates which are no longer low. They have to find a pragmatic path, to protect future generations from exploding debt burdens, but also protect them from the huge costs that climate change will cause. </p><p> Europe epitomises this challenge. Eminent former leaders like Italy's Mario Draghi and Germany's Angela Merkel -- who had herself pushed for Germany's conservative \"debt brake\" laws when she was the country's chancellor -- have now proposed that the public sector be allowed to borrow for a transitional period for investments in the green transition and other critical needs.  </p><p> Third, and the most challenging governance task: we need international coordination to solve the climate crisis. Otherwise, we risk carbon leakage -- where higher-emitting companies and activities shift to countries with more accommodating policies. But besides their differing levels of political will, the complexity comes from the fact that countries have been using different sets of measures to encourage decarbonisation. Europe has been relying on the full mix of carbon pricing, regulation and subsidies, whereas China has introduced only limited pricing and the US has eschewed it altogether. Finding some equivalence between the measures taken by these major emitters so as to determine their \"effective\" carbon pricing rates will be a difficult matter. But it cannot be avoided.  </p><p> Reframing the debateWe need a new understanding in trade, investments and technology transfers, to enable the world to benefit from China's low-cost clean energy technologies, such as its solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. And likewise, to take advantage of innovations in the United States, such as in hydrogen power, carbon capture and other next-generation clean technologies. The key goal must be to maximise scale, affordability and the speed of the global transition, recognising that the world is far behind in the race against climate change. It will be aided by not limiting market access to products and technologies based on where they come from, but instead pursuing the solutions that still exist for win-win economic outcomes. </p><p> We must also overcome the perennial tensions over climate financing for the developing world, which are not getting us anywhere. The debate has to be reframed; from viewing it not as a matter of how much aid should be given from rich nations to poor, but as investment in the global commons that all nations will benefit from. Dollar for dollar, investments in climate transition in the developing world in fact have a more significant impact on global emissions than in the advanced economies. </p><p> Blended finance, where we bring together monies from the public sector, the multilateral development banks and the private sector, and where possible philanthropies, is an important way to scale up these investments. That's why Singapore launched the Fast-P (Financing Asia's Transition Partnership) programme this year, to help spur the transition to low carbon in Asia. </p><p> The good news recently has been in carbon markets. Consensus on how to operationalise Article 6 of the Paris Agreement -- governing how countries can trade carbon credits -- was finally achieved at COP29 in Baku, with Singapore playing the role of co-facilitator. It will also add impetus to efforts to develop a voluntary carbon market with credible standards and verification mechanisms. The challenge is in the doing. An example is the Transition Credits Coalition that MAS (Monetary Authority of Singapore) is working on, to make possible an early phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Asia.</p><p> Finally, we need a new narrative on climate change that has appeal to populations. Pushback has come from those who feel they have to bear the costs of decarbonisation today, in exchange for benefits to society in the distant future. Part of the solution must be to ensure that adjustments are fair to ordinary households. But decarbonising the economy can itself be a growth opportunity in the coming decade itself -- with heightened investments creating many jobs and new businesses. It is an opportunity for clean air today -- remember that millions of people each year die from air pollution caused by fossil fuel-based energy, with many more suffering from ill health. And nature-based solutions will help give populations clean water supply, and provide a buffer against flood and other weather extremities. So while the largest benefits come decades later, the dividends for populations from climate action begin flowing early. </p><p> AI: focus on early wins, and avoiding the worst possible harmsThe second looming issue is AI. It presents massive opportunities for improved well-being -- from better healthcare to productivity in every sector. But there are also major risks. There are bleak scenarios of how AI will remove a large segment of jobs, including those of the middle class. No one can say for sure that it won't happen. There is also the prospect of AI systems moving beyond our control, as most AI programs get to be written by AI itself. And as Dr Henry Kissinger warned in his final book, AI poses a global security dilemma of an existential nature. More immediately, there's the risk that AI poses for democracy itself, by accentuating misinformation and social polarisation. We already see this today, but it will only grow in the next decade and beyond.</p><p> Yet, we must have a sense of realism when we think of how we should regulate AI. There will remain a fundamental mismatch between the pace at which AI is developing and regulators' ability to set rules around it. We cannot delay AI until we are perfectly sure it is safe; in fact, we should assume that there will be some bad. Our approach should be to maximise the benefits of AI and minimise the risk of the worst possible harms to safety and society, and not think we can regulate AI comprehensively to avoid all that could be bad.</p><p> Look for early wins. In healthcare, for instance, through much earlier and better diagnosis and treatment. In learning, with the potential that AI offers for personalised tutoring, through life. In improving farming yields. And in virtually every sector, to improve the productivity of those in the workforce by having an AI tool to augment your own capabilities.</p><p> Further, not every problem created by AI will be best solved by trying to regulate AI. The real solutions to avoid job and income losses, which could come in both advanced and developing countries, lie in other economic and social strategies. We've got to double down on preparing young people and the workforce of today for an AI era. Countries may have to introduce new wage subsidies, or use progressive tax and transfer systems to mitigate inequalities. Every society has to be ready with these strategies, to ensure we can benefit from AI whilst buffering its downsides.</p><p> Critically, too, we will need international cooperation to govern AI. It must involve the US and China talking directly with each other. But we must carry on with the important work of building a broad coalition of interests that can make the most of expertise from every source.  </p><p> Don't send the invoice to the next generation The third long challenge: preserving optimism as societies age. Almost every higher-income country is ageing, and a few emerging countries too. We will see this go further in the next 30 years, changing the nature of society.</p><p> However, many systems of financing healthcare and pensions are unsustainable, and are now likely to pose a major burden on the next generation. Unfortunately, most are also dealing with this challenge late in the day, when a large segment of the population is already retired or close to doing so. Reforms are still possible, but now come at greater political cost, which many democracies are finding insurmountable.</p><p> Healthcare spending will have to go up, if we are to provide quality and affordable care for growing older populations. The costs have to be paid for fairly, across a population. We should start by recognising that there is no such thing as free healthcare for people anywhere -- even in the systems like the UK's where you pay little or nothing when you turn up in hospital, people pay for it through taxes or mandatory national insurance contributions.</p><p> But a key lesson from most countries is that to keep the system fair, and keep healthcare costs from going up excessively, we have to avoid a heavy reliance on just one source of payments. We need a balance between government subsidies, co-payments by individuals when they are treated, and insurance policies -- as we have in Singapore, for example. It is also how we ensure that those who can afford it get less subsidies and pay their fair share.</p><p> More importantly, staying healthy and keeping healthcare costs down doesn't just depend on healthcare systems. In fact, much of it depends on our habits and the social environment around us as we age. Are we staying active? Do we have regular friends? Do we have hobbies? Are we still learning something and staying curious? Are we countering the ageing brain? That's all critical in staying healthy, and to living long and satisfying lives. And in Singapore, we are very serious about making this possible.</p><p> Rebuilding solidarityFinally, as I mentioned at the start, we have to rebuild the collective belief that the future can be better for all. We have to find ways to get beyond the zero-sum thinking that is now prevalent within many societies -- where each group feels that its future is pitched against another. Find ways to address the concerns of segments in each population who feel that the elite do not understand their day-to-day problems. And find ways to rebuild a sense of common humanity, by sustaining the international rule of law and norms of conduct, and by pitching in to strengthen the global commons.</p><p> Yet, solidarity, a sense that our lives are connected and indeed enriched by what we do for each other, is a neglected dimension of democracy. We understand very well the importance of justice, and the freedoms that different democracies are organised around, but it requires something more for democracies to work well in today's world. Where we're not just individuals wanting to be equal and free, but we have bonds of reciprocity with one another, and we know it's those bonds that will help us tackle the challenges we now face and take us forward.  </p><p> Solidarity has to be rebuilt into how we practise democracy, how societies are governed, and how we respect one another in our lives.</p><p> This is an abridged version of a speech by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, in delivering the inaugural JY Pillay Lecture on Governance on Nov 27.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Tackling climate change will be much more costly, and vastly more complex and difficult, if we defer action, says the writer. photo: REUTERS</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-KPEJ9LC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJM-ST61-JCF2-800Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2473\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

In the process, they stir up a bounty of nutrients, unleashing resources long buried in the seafloor for other creatures. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Animals like the grey whale are ecosystem engineers -- species that exert an outsized impact on their environments -- due to their ability to create, modify and even destroy a habitat. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> It's not just in nature where \"ecosystem engineers\" can be observed. They can also be found in the nature conservation space.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Financial institutions -- banks, asset managers and insurers -- are coalescing around the notion that the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems can turn a profit. And like the grey whale that unearths resources for others as it seeks out tasty morsels on the seafloor, the financial sector's quest to seek a return on investment from nature for shareholders could also unlock new resources to conserve forests and safeguard seas. </p><p> In April, Singapore investment company Temasek convened the Ecosperity Week sustainability conference where \"nature positivity\" -- a buzzword that encapsulates the goal to halt and reverse nature loss -- was discussed by the bankers and investors in the room. </p><p> Having reported on the environment for over a decade and usually meeting wildlife biologists, conservation managers and environmental groups in the circuit, it was a pinch me moment to hear Ms Razan Al Mubarak, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the world's largest conservation network, extolling the importance of nature's protection to the suits in the room. </p><p> \"Investing in nature-based solutions is a key opportunity, and it is projected to create over 390 million jobs by 2030, as well as unlock US$10.1 trillion (S$13.8 trillion) in business opportunities,\" she said. </p><p> Will the involvement of profit-driven entities in nature, a cause traditionally funded by philanthropy and governments, engineer the landscape in a way that improves conservation outcomes? Or, given capitalism's reputation for extracting value through destruction, could they go the way of the beaver -- an ecosystem engineer with the propensity to raze entire woodlands? </p><p> More whale than beaverMy view is that the financial sector -- if guided by the right policies and regulatory frameworks -- would be more ally than adversary.</p><p> Why? The facts speak for themselves. </p><p> More than half of the world's gross domestic product, equivalent to an estimated US$58 trillion, is moderately or highly dependent on nature, according to a 2023 report by professional service firm PwC. </p><p> Yet, the Global Biodiversity Framework -- a United Nations pact agreed on by almost 200 nations -- estimates the biodiversity finance gap to be US$700 billion a year between now and 2030. This refers to the difference between the funding available for conservation and the amount that it requires. </p><p> Closing the gap requires the repurposing of US$500 billion per year in harmful subsidies, such as those that incentivise the overharvesting of the ocean, for instance, and mobilising the remaining US$200 billion from all sources -- including the private sector. </p><p> Relying on philanthropic funding and governments to fund nature's protection, as has been the case for decades, will simply no longer be enough, given the scale of the problem. </p><p> The World Wide Fund for Nature estimated in 2022 that there has been an average decline of 69 per cent in species populations since 1970. </p><p> As highlighted by the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, the financial sector can put \"capitalism's profit motive to work to protect and restore nature\", and serve as a powerful engine for closing the funding gap. </p><p> Nature in perilThe realisation that there is money to be made in conservation comes amid a global reckoning of nature's true value, as the interrelationship between biodiversity loss and the climate crisis becomes clearer. </p><p> Given the flurry of net-zero targets made by governments and corporations around the world, the business case for climate-friendly investments like renewable energy plants or energy efficient technology is apparent. Moreover, some of the losses wrought by climate impacts -- infrastructure damage, loss of lives and livelihoods -- are quantifiable.</p><p> But the protection of nature has traditionally been treated as an issue separate from the climate crisis. The signs of nature in peril are also far more insidious compared to climate impacts -- what is the effect on bottom lines if a species is hunted into oblivion? </p><p> Yet, the two planetary crises are closely interlinked. Studies have shown that the clearance and burning of tropical forests account for about 20 per cent of global annual greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p> And the cumulative loss of species can compromise nature's ability to provide. Just as it takes many nails to ensure the stability of a bookshelf, an ecosystem also requires many species to thrive. The loss of a nail or two might not compromise a shelf's ability to hold books -- but how many \"nails\" can a habitat lose before it collapses? </p><p> There is a silver lining in that there has been a growing awareness of the links between nature's decline and climate change. </p><p> The annual UN climate change conferences, which usually focus on decarbonisation, are increasingly touching on the role of nature. </p><p> At COP26 in 2021, some 140 nations signed the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use outlining a global vision for forest protection.</p><p> That COP also saw countries reaching an agreement on a framework that will allow carbon credits to be used to meet national climate targets -- a pivotal milestone in the creation of a global financing mechanism for forest conservation. By protecting a forest from being cut down, land developers can sell carbon credits from the emissions savings to an emitter elsewhere, who can use the credits to offset its emissions.</p><p> The following year, nature-based solutions were referenced for the first time in the COP27 decision text. At COP28 in 2023, there were also discussions on other financing schemes to protect nature, such as debt-for-nature swaps in which sovereign debt of a developing country is cut in exchange for nature conservation measures.</p><p> The Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures has also provided a set of recommendations to enable companies to assess, report and act on their nature-related dependencies, impacts, risks and opportunities. </p><p> It is now clear that nature is a key element of discussions on the climate -- and policymakers and business leaders must respond. </p><p> The business of conservationThere are already signs of how the financial sector's involvement is opening new revenue streams for nature. </p><p> Revenue from carbon credits can fund the protection and restoration of forests and mangroves. In a sign of how there is money to be made in this space, Temasek in 2022 launched GenZero, an investment platform company that counts among its investment focus areas nature-based solutions that protect and restore natural ecosystems. </p><p> On May 28, GenZero announced that it is co-funding the initial phase of an ecosystem restoration project in South Africa, which involves the replanting of spekboom -- a succulent native to the region -- across 10,000ha of degraded land. When the project is scaled up to 100,000ha of land, the carbon project developer, Imperative, estimates that it will help to remove over 30 million tonnes of planet-warming emissions over its lifetime. </p><p> Other innovative financial products include insurance schemes that pay out for the restoration of coral reefs -- habitats that can reduce shoreline erosion -- when a tropical cyclone damages them. </p><p> In November 2022, the first ever pay-out by the Mesoamerican Reef Insurance Programme was triggered when the Turneffe Atoll off the coast of Belize was hit by Hurricane Lisa. The Asian Development Bank has also approved US$3.8 million to develop climate risk financing and insurance solutions to protect coral reef ecosystems in Fiji, Indonesia, the Philippines and Solomon Islands.</p><p> Individual species like the critically endangered black rhinoceros are also benefiting from novel financing products such as the rhino bond -- the world's first wildlife conservation debt instrument issued by the World Bank. </p><p> In April 2024, conservation groups and representatives from 10 tiger range countries such as Bhutan, Cambodia and Malaysia, gathered in Bhutan for the Sustainable Finance for Tiger Landscapes Conference, which discussed ways to raise US$1 billion from global public and private investors and institutions for tiger conservation by 2034. </p><p> Despite optimism over the increased attention being paid to nature and the interest in increasing financing flows to its conservation, concerns have rightly been raised by non-government organisations about whether outcomes will be compromised when profit-making becomes a focus. </p><p> Carbon credit project developers have been flagged for infringing on the rights of communities living on the land, and there have also been allegations that carbon credits sold from certain projects do not represent genuine carbon emissions reductions.  </p><p> But it is worth noting that the financial sector's interest in nature is not blooming in a vacuum -- governments, multilateral organisations and businesses are also recognising that healthy ecosystems are integral for a prosperous future. </p><p> Enhanced scrutiny of such projects and regulatory frameworks that increasingly factor in the need to prevent nature loss -- such as England's \"biodiversity net gain\" law that requires developers to achieve a net gain in biodiversity through restoring lost habitats on-site or elsewhere -- are also helping to shape the trajectory of conservation efforts. </p><p> Just as ecosystem engineers help biodiversity in nature by unlocking nutrients from the environment, so too can financial institutions enhance the impact of conservation activities, creating a future where both people and planet can thrive.  </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Southern Cardamom project in south-west Cambodia protects 497,000ha of tropical rainforests.

Fear not. Plenty of positive steps are being taken to hasten the green transition. This week, two key announcements underscored the importance of protecting and restoring nature in the global effort to combat global warming. </p><p>On May 28, investment firm Temasek's green investment platform GenZero announced it is co-funding the initial phase of an ecosystem restoration project in South Africa. The first phase focuses on 10,000ha of degraded land, replanting it with carbon-absorbing native shrubs. When fully scaled up, the 100,000ha project is estimated to remove more than 30 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere over 40 years, generating tradeable carbon credits in the process. On May 27, the governments of Singapore and Ghana signed a bilateral carbon credit agreement to support investment in projects that will channel financing towards efforts to cut carbon emissions and support local communities. In 2023, Singapore and Papua New Guinea signed a similar agreement. Singapore has a key role in driving the green transition, which hinges on ramping up funding for innovations that cut emissions across a swathe of industries and saving nature. In late April 2024, Decarbonization Partners, a joint venture between Temasek and BlackRock, announced the close of its first investment fund, raising US$1.4 billion (S$1.9 billion) from more than two dozen investors. Decarbonization Partners provides late-stage venture capital to private firms with proven technology that can help decarbonise industrial sectors, from transport to energy generation to heavy industry. GenZero, which started in 2022 with $5 billion in seed funding from Temasek, is also investing in technologies that cut emissions, in addition to nature-based solutions. Globally, though, the green financing challenge remains daunting and needs major support from governments and investors. The International Energy Agency says limiting global warming to 1.5 deg C is still possible, but investment in clean energy needs to reach US$4.5 trillion per year by 2030 - it was US$1.8 trillion in 2023. The good news is that there is enough money and technical know-how for the world to go truly green. As Singapore President Tharman Shanmugaratnam noted in a recent speech, the global capital market is valued at about US$250 trillion, meaning there is sufficient money to accelerate the green transition. The money is available from an increasingly wider pool - including an estimated US$6 trillion managed by 4,500 family offices globally. And there is a growing number of investment partnerships involving philanthropies that are co-investing with public and private sources of capital. So, the good news is that the green transition is there for the taking. Singapore's role as a finance hub and access to deep pools of capital will be key for achieving a greener and cleaner future at home and abroad.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C4T-24S1-JCF2-83W4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"491\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Ways must be found to win popular support to accelerate the shift to a low carbon future. It requires a fair transition, one that overcomes the anxieties over costs that have led to pushback within many populations. But it also means overcoming the short-sightedness that is now the norm in most societies, so as to ensure fairness not only today but for future generations.</p><p>Likewise, the challenge of meeting the needs of steadily ageing societies, without sending the invoice to the next generation. And so too, dealing with AI - the most profound technological change of our times, with benefits as well as risks that are likely to grow exponentially in the coming decade and beyond.</p><p>We can only address these long challenges by stretching our economic and political horizons. And by finding ways to rebuild optimism and solidarity within our societies, so that people can imagine how the future can be better for all. The collective belief in the future has to be both the means and the end.</p><p>Building a realistic optimism</p><p>We are starting from a difficult place. Confidence in the future has been on the decline in most societies. They are also more divided. A survey of 19 high and middle-income societies by Pew Research in 2022 found the majority feeling more divided than they did before the Covid-19 pandemic. Only three countries avoided this, including Singapore, where 75 per cent of people felt more united than before the pandemic. On top of all this, confidence in the multilateral order is at its lowest point.</p><p>Yet to tackle problems like climate change, we must first recognise the scale and seriousness of the challenge - not so we add to the mood of despondency, but so we build realistic optimism.</p><p>The world is far behind the actions it needs to stay within 1.5 degrees C of global warming, and to prevent accelerated warming after we hit 1.5 degrees. The best scientific estimates tell us that the remaining carbon budget, or the maximum amount of emissions the world can make so that global warming remains below 1.5 degrees, is likely to be used up in about five years' time.</p><p>Even more worrying: there is radical uncertainty as to what comes next. The planet is losing its critical buffers against warming - the natural ecosystems on land and in the oceans, that have been soaking up more than 50 per cent of carbon dioxide that the world emits, are losing that ability. It is also beginning to cross tipping points - such as the melting of the Greenland ice sheet, and the shift in the Amazon from being a huge carbon sink to being a net emitter - which can lead to runaway global warming.</p><p>The implications are clear. First, tackling climate change will be much more costly, and vastly more complex and difficult, if we defer action. We must act early, especially to develop scale in clean energy and green technologies, so that they become as affordable and as reliable as what we do with fossil fuels.</p><p>Second, clear and credible public policies are key to achieving this scale and speed that is required. Carbon pricing has to be the centrepiece. It will help catalyse the needed shift in private investments towards green opportunities in every sector, and also provide the revenues needed to support the transition and ensure poorer segments of the population are not disadvantaged. But it is generally understood that carbon pricing, within socially realistic limits, will not on its own be adequate. Targeted regulations in specific sectors, which in many cases such as in aviation and maritime transport will have to be internationally managed, are needed to provide certainty for businesses and spur innovation.</p><p>We also need public investment in R&amp;D and to build out new grids and other public infrastructure for a clean energy future. But higher spending will be a problem in many countries - given already large public debts, and interest rates which are no longer low. They have to find a pragmatic path, to protect future generations from exploding debt burdens, but also protect them from the huge costs that climate change will cause.</p><p>Europe epitomizes this challenge. Eminent former leaders like Italy's Mario Draghi and Germany's Angela Merkel - who had herself pushed for Germany's conservative 'debt brake' laws when she was the country's Chancellor - have now proposed that the public sector be allowed to borrow for a transitional period for investments in the green transition and other critical needs.</p><p>Third, and the most challenging governance task: we need international coordination to solve the climate crisis. Otherwise we risk carbon leakage - where higher emitting companies and activities shift to countries with more accommodating policies. But besides their differing levels of political will, the complexity comes from the fact that countries have been using different sets of measures to encourage decarbonization. Europe has been relying on the full mix of carbon pricing, regulation and subsidies, whereas China has introduced only limited pricing and the US has eschewed it altogether. Finding some equivalence between the measures taken by these major emitters so as to determine their 'effective' carbon pricing rates will be a difficult matter. But it cannot be avoided.</p><p>Reframing the debate</p><p>We need a new understanding in trade, investments and technology transfers, to enable the world to benefit from China's low-cost clean energy technologies, such as its solar panels, wind turbines and batteries. And likewise, to take advantage of innovations in the United States, such as in hydrogen power, carbon capture and other next-generation clean technologies. The key goal must be to maximise scale, affordability and the speed of the global transition, recognising that the world is far behind in the race against climate change. It will be aided by not limiting market access to products and technologies based on where they come from, but instead pursuing the solutions that still exist for win-win economic outcomes.</p><p>We must also overcome the perennial tensions over climate financing for the developing world, which are not getting us anywhere. The debate has to be reframed, from viewing it not as a matter of how much aid should be given from rich nations to poor, but as investment in the global commons that all nations will benefit from. Dollar for dollar, investments in climate transition in the developing world in fact have a more significant impact on global emissions than in the advanced economies.</p><p>Blended finance, where we bring together monies from the public sector, the multilateral development banks and the private sector, and where possible philanthropies, is an important way to scale up these investments. That's why Singapore launched the FAST-P programme this year, to help spur the transition to low carbon in Asia.</p><p>The good news recently has been in carbon markets. Consensus on how to operationalise Article 6 of the Paris Agreement - governing how countries can trade carbon credits - was finally achieved at COP29 in Baku, with Singapore playing the role of co-facilitator. It will also add impetus to efforts to develop a voluntary carbon market with credible standards and verification mechanisms. The challenge is in the doing. An example is the Transition Credits Coalition that MAS is working on, to make possible an early phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Asia.</p><p>Finally, we need a new narrative on climate change, that has appeal to populations. Pushback has come from those who feel they have to bear the costs of decarbonisation today, in exchange for benefits to society in the distant future. Part of the solution must be to ensure that adjustments are fair to ordinary households. But decarbonising the economy can itself be a growth opportunity in the coming decade itself - with heightened investments creating many jobs and new businesses. It is an opportunity for clean air today - remember that millions of people each year die from air pollution caused by fossil fuel-based energy, with many more suffering from ill-health. And nature-based solutions will help give populations clean water supply, and provide a buffer against flood and other weather extremities. So while the largest benefits come decades later, the dividends for populations from climate action begin flowing early.</p><p>AI : focus on early wins, and avoiding the worst possible harms</p><p>The second looming issue is AI. It presents massive opportunities for improved well-being - from better healthcare to productivity in every sector. But there are also major risks. There are bleak scenarios of how AI will remove a large segment of jobs, including those of the middle class. No one can say for sure that it won't happen. There is also the prospect of AI systems moving beyond our control, as most AI programmes get to be written by AI itself. And as Henry Kissinger warned in his final book, AI poses a global security dilemma of an existential nature. More immediately, there's the risk that AI poses for democracy itself, by accentuating misinformation and social polarisation. We already see this today, but it will only grow in the next decade and beyond.</p><p>Yet we must have a sense of realism when we think of how we should regulate AI. There will remain a fundamental mismatch between the pace at which AI is developing and regulators' ability to set rules around it. We cannot delay AI until we are perfectly sure it is safe; in fact we should assume that there will be some bad. Our approach should be to maximise the benefits of AI and minimise the risk of the worst possible harms to safety and society, and not think we can regulate AI comprehensively to avoid all that could be bad.</p><p>Look for early wins. In healthcare, for instance, through much earlier and better diagnosis and treatment. In learning, with the potential that AI offers for personalised tutoring, through life. In improving farming yields. And in virtually every sector, to improve the productivity of those in the workforce by having an AI tool to augment your own capabilities.</p><p>Further, not every problem created by AI will be best solved by trying to regulate AI. The real solutions to avoid job and income losses, which could come in both advanced and developing countries, lie in other economic and social strategies. We've got to double down on preparing young people and the workforce of today for an AI era. Countries may have to introduce new wage subsidies, or use progressive tax and transfer systems to mitigate inequalities. Every society has to be ready with these strategies, to ensure we can benefit from AI whilst buffering its downsides.</p><p>Critically too, we will need international cooperation to govern AI. It must involve the US and China talking directly with each other. But we must carry on with the important work of building a broad coalition of interests that can make the most of expertise from every source.</p><p>Don't send the invoice to the next generation</p><p>The third long challenge: preserving optimism as societies age. Almost every higher income country is ageing, and a few emerging countries too. We will see this go further in the next thirty years, changing the nature of society.</p><p>However, many systems of financing healthcare and pensions are unsustainable, and are now likely to pose a major burden on the next generation. Unfortunately, most are also dealing with this challenge late in the day, when a large segment of the population is already retired or close to doing so. Reforms are still possible, but now come at greater political cost, which many democracies are finding insurmountable.</p><p>Healthcare spending will have to go up, if we are to provide quality and affordable care for growing older populations. The costs have to be paid for fairly, across a population. We should start by recognizing that there is no such thing as free health care for people anywhere - even in the systems like the UK where you pay little or nothing when you turn up in hospital, people pay for it through taxes or mandatory national insurance contributions</p><p>But a key lesson from most countries is that to keep the system fair, and keep healthcare costs from going up excessively, we have to avoid a heavy reliance on just one source of payments. We need a balance between government subsidies, co-payments by individuals when they are treated, and insurance policies - as we have in Singapore for example. It is also how we ensure that those who can afford it get less subsidies and pay their fair share.</p><p>More importantly, staying healthy and keeping healthcare costs down doesn't just depend on healthcare systems. In fact, much of it depends on our habits and the social environment around us as we age. Are we staying active? Do we have regular friends? Do we have hobbies? Are we still learning something and staying curious? Are we countering the ageing brain? That's all critical in staying healthy, and to living long and satisfying lives. And in Singapore, we are very serious about making this possible.</p><p>Rebuilding solidarity</p><p>Finally, as I mentioned at the start, we have to rebuild the collective belief that the future can be better for all. We have to find ways to get beyond the zero-sum thinking that is now prevalent within many societies - where each group feels that its future is pitched against another. Find ways to address the concerns of segments in each population who feel that the elite do not understand their day-to-day problems. And find ways to rebuild a sense of common humanity, by sustaining the international rule of law and norms of conduct, and by pitching in to strengthen the global commons.</p><p>Yet, solidarity, a sense that our lives are connected and indeed enriched by what we do for each other, is a neglected dimension of democracy. We understand very well the importance of justice, and the freedoms that different democracies are organised around, but it requires something more for democracies to work well in today's world. Where we're not just individuals wanting to be equal and free, but we have bonds of reciprocity with each other, and we know it's those bonds that will help us tackle the challenges we now face and take us forward.</p><p>Solidarity has to be rebuilt into how we practise democracy, how societies are governed, and how we respect each other in our lives.</p><p>This is an abridged version of a speech by President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, in delivering the inaugural JY Pillay Lecture on Governance organised by the Singapore University of Social Sciences on 27 November 2024.</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: The Istana, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065379182</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJX-K841-DXMP-K11D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2546\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 27, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001965</classCode><className>SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE &amp;

Plans for the development include three masses of reclaimed land covering around 800ha, with a reservoir in between.</p><p> \"I feel the Long Island development is relevant to Singapore's needs, as the planning investigates multifunctional optimisation of the land and seascape changes, including protection against sea-level rise,\" said Emeritus Professor Chou Loke Ming from the National University of Singapore's Department of Biological Sciences.</p><p> Prof Chou -- alongside other marine biodiversity experts including Mr Lester Tan, marine lead for Nature Society (Singapore) -- stressed that the seaward part of the Long Island should incorporate eco-engineering and nature-based solutions, so that the future land masses can be conducive for marine creatures' relocation or return after the reclamation. </p><p> \"Nature-based solutions will be best to compensate for the loss of marine life from the Long Island footprint. If tidal conditions require armoured protection such as sea walls, then design it to incorporate large tidal pools, bays or lagoons that can enhance marine biodiversity.\"</p><p> The experts also suggested planting mangroves and building artificial coral reefs, which can serve as living breakwaters and armour against storm surges and rising sea levels.</p><p> The last major reclamation in the south-east between the 1960s and 1980s -- which gave rise to Marine Parade and East Coast Park -- wiped out much of the teeming intertidal habitats and marine life there. But in recent decades, nature has made a comeback along the artificial shoreline. </p><p> Corals have recolonised man-made sea walls along the coast and at Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal, which also has some seagrass patches nearby.</p><p> The shore between the National Service Resort and Country Club near Tanah Merah and the National Sailing Centre is known to be a nesting hot spot for critically endangered hawksbill turtles and the coastal horseshoe crab, said Mr Tan.</p><p> \"All these will be, unfortunately, habitats that we may lose with the Long Island construction,\" he said. </p><p> Reclamation has already claimed about 60 per cent of Singapore's original coral reefs. </p><p> Even if biodiversity-rich sites are avoided during reclamation, seagrass and corals -- home to a host of marine creatures -- are very sensitive to sedimentation, noted Mr Muhammad Nasry, executive director of environment group Singapore Youth Voices for Biodiversity.</p><p> As part of the five-year environmental and engineering studies, innovative and cost-effective nature-based solutions will be explored for the Long Island.</p><p> Another biodiversity hot spot that could be affected is the Southern Islands -- home to the largest diversity of marine life in Singapore and its remaining healthy reefs.</p><p> Dr Jani Tanzil, facility director at St John's Island National Marine Laboratory, said sediment plumes and other pollutants spilling over from works could impact the Southern Islands, including the Republic's only marine park -- Sisters' Islands Marine Park. </p><p> Apart from standard environmental mitigation measures such as using sediment curtains to control pollution and accounting for the changes to water movement due to construction, Dr Jani hopes that construction timelines can work around periods that are more sensitive for marine life, such as during a marine heatwave or a coral spawning season. </p><p> The authorities have also been eyeing the southern waters to set up fish farms in the future, which, if not managed well, can also add pressure to the marine environment. </p><p> Noting this, Dr Jani pointed out that there must be a whole-of-government approach in managing not just land use but the seascape as well. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Hawksbill turtle hatchlings emerging from a hatching site at East Coast Park on July 17.

Each credit represents one tonne of emissions.</p><p> TNC's Singapore country director Thomas Brzostowski said: \"Many companies and investors in Singapore want access to high-quality credits, but there's just not enough out there, particularly from this part of the world.\" </p><p> He noted that only about 16 per cent of global impact investments flow into the Asia-Pacific. </p><p> The South-east Asia Green Economy 2023 report, published in June, stated that an estimated US$400 billion (S$542 billion) of investments in nature are needed to meet the region's 2030 climate goals. </p><p> Formed in 1951, TNC has undertaken conservation projects in more than 70 countries and territories. It has protected more than 50 million hectares of land -- about 700 times the size of Singapore. By 2030, it hopes to conserve land areas that amount to 9,000 times the size of the island state. </p><p> TNC's expansion to the Republic was supported by the Economic Development Board. It joins the likes of international conservation groups such as WWF-Singapore and BirdLife International, which have offices here. </p><p> TNC recently joined forces with seven other conservation-related organisations to form the South-east Asia Climate and Nature-based Solutions (Scene) Coalition, which aims to drive investments and scale up nature-based solutions in the region.</p><p> Dr Brzostowski outlined three priorities for the coalition over the next three to five years: a virtual map-based tool to guide community frontliners, a portfolio of high-quality nature-based projects that can be emulated by others, and an incubator programme to support the frontliners in conservation projects. Community frontliners could include villagers or grassroots organisations that want to restore their peatlands and mangroves, for instance.</p><p> \"But many of them lack seed funding to pay for initial feasibility studies or access to technology, or (don't) understand how to complete the documentation needed for nature-based projects,\" noted Dr Brzostowski.</p><p> The incubator programme will guide promising frontline communities in sharpening their projects across various stages -- from feasibility studies to carbon sales. The coalition is refining the programme and is planning to start it in 2024. </p><p> \"These grassroots organisations could be a turning point, which will hopefully lead to some exponential growth in the number of carbon projects or credits,\" he said.</p><p> Dr Lahiru Wijedasa, Asia forest coordinator at BirdLife International, which is part of the coalition, noted that nature-based carbon credits are lower in supply in this region, mainly due to regulatory reasons.</p><p> He explained: \"As the nature-based solutions market has moved at a rapid pace in the past 10 years, countries have struggled to keep pace. But now in South-east Asia, the policies and regulations are becoming clearer.

This leaves out many nature-based projects that inherently have higher level of uncertainties over quantifying carbon and permanence than technology-based solutions such as direct air capture.</p><p> This climate-centric world is one of the three possible scenarios that could play out for carbon markets, indicated a report released by GenZero on Friday (Apr 12), a Temasek-backed investment platform focused on decarbonisation. </p><p> The second plausible scenario is one where carbon markets are bifurcated due to geopolitical and ideological differences between power blocs. In this scenario, the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (Asean) could emerge as a regional market with member countries agreeing on a common set of quality principles and operating carbon trading among themselves, noted Rahman. </p><p> The third one is a fragmented market where countries trade carbon credits based on bilateral partnerships. In the context of Asean, this could mean the proliferation of bilateral agreements between countries willing to cooperate, rather than a regional market. </p><p> GenZero's chief executive officer Frederick Teo said that these scenarios are not predictions of where carbon markets would be headed, and that there is no preference over any of the three as there are both positives and negatives in each. </p><p> Instead, scenario planning involves understanding the various ways in which macroeconomic trends and geopolitics can shape carbon markets, and distil the \"no-regrets\" actions that carbon market participants and regulators can take today, noted Teo. </p><p> The three scenariosRegardless of which scenario will play out in the future, the report stated that carbon markets would have a role to play in decarbonisation in all three, though at varying degrees. </p><p> For the first scenario where countries collaborate to prioritise climate action, there would be vibrant carbon trading between standardised carbon markets, with a strong focus on high-quality solutions, and enough financing for costly breakthrough technologies. </p><p> Rahman noted that there would probably be a strong multilateral process in defining quality projects, with Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement -- which governs rules on an international carbon trading system -- being operationalised at scale and carbon prices trading higher in this scenario. </p><p> However, stringent requirements on quality, while helpful in weeding out low-integrity projects, will also reduce financing for solutions that rely on estimates to quantify its climate impact, such as nature-based solutions. These solutions are typically cheaper, more readily available, and can be implemented at scale. </p><p> This can eventually reduce the overall supply of carbon credits, and thereby the size of the voluntary carbon market as companies will be more liable to compliance mechanisms. </p><p> However, voluntary carbon markets will play a bigger role in scenarios where the world is ideologically divided into two power blocs, or fragmented by nationalistic interests. </p><p> An ideologically bifurcated carbon market will emerge in a divided world, with the western bloc -- led by the United States and Europe -- focusing on developing high-tech solutions, while the China-led eastern bloc will look at scaling up low-cost nature-based and community projects. </p><p> Carbon markets can eventually be an important bridge for climate collaboration between the power blocs, where trading occurs where their principles converge. </p><p> In the case of a fragmented world, governments will look towards carbon markets to channel financing towards under-funded climate solutions and remain one of the best ways to set a price on carbon. Countries will develop their own domestic carbon markets and trade bilaterally, though prices would vary significantly.</p><p> The lack of a central authority guarding the quality of carbon projects can be challenging for project developers located in jurisdictions lacking in climate ambition. Local carbon markets can go through boom-and-bust cycles when low-quality projects do not take off over integrity concerns. </p><p> Narrow definitions on quality climate solutionsTeo said that the report does not attempt to define what constitutes a quality carbon project. But it seeks to highlight the trade-offs involved in such concerns. These typically revolve around price, technological readiness and the durability of the solution. </p><p> \"If you take a particularly restrictive definition around this, if the (solution) does not last for 1,000 years then it is not good enough -- and therefore will not be accepted -- then those solutions that can be good for 100 years will be priced out,\" he said.</p><p> \"Then those things that can help us address the climate crisis and buy us time to the end of the century will not be funded and will not work.\" </p><p> While there needs to be a minimum level of quality to preserve confidence in the market, the report noted that there needs to be an appreciation of the practical realities that may not be able to satisfy the requirements if a very high bar is set. </p><p> Ongoing integrity concerns in the carbon market have led to a decrease in prices of carbon credits, and the size of the voluntary market over the last year.</p><p> Hence, the report argues that carbon markets need greater regulatory oversight by governments and standard setters to ensure alignment on a set of quality principles for market participants to have a common base when evaluating the pricing and quality of projects. Still, they should not be overly prescriptive. </p><p> There also needs to be better understanding of how carbon markets can support a company's decarbonisation plan, and the claims that companies can make when using offsets, so that there can be clearer demand signals. </p><p> In the context of Asean, how carbon markets evolve in the region will depend on member states' ability to meet their net-zero targets as well as willingness to cooperate, said Rahman. </p><p> \"Irrespective of how global trends evolve, Asean can better leverage carbon markets through well-designed policies that clarify the role of carbon markets in decarbonisation, and harness digital technologies for environmental integrity,\" he noted.</p><p> \"Corporates in the region can take steps to identify where carbon markets best fit within their sustainability and decarbonisation strategy. By providing a clear demand signal to the market, they help encourage supply to be developed that would ultimately fit their requirements,\" the GenZero's director of policy and analytics added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Many nature-based projects inherently have a higher level of uncertainties over quantifying carbon and permanence than technology-based solutions such as direct air capture.

Good afternoon.</p><p>2. Let me start by congratulating the Singapore Reinsurers Association for the 20th anniversary of its flagship event, the Singapore International Reinsurance Conference (SIRC).</p><p>a. Since its inception in 1991, the SIRC has grown into a leading forum for reinsurers, insurers and reinsurance brokers to discuss topical issues facing the global reinsurance industry, and as a networking platform for reinsurance deals.</p><p>b. Today, we have about 3,300 delegates gathered here from over 65 countries, including a strong bench of global and regional leaders.</p><p>3. This year's strong turnout reflects the strength of Singapore's insurance industry.</p><p>a. Gross premiums for general insurance grew 7.5% year-on-year to reach S$13.5 billion in 2023.</p><p>b. Brokerage revenues increased by 9% year-on-year to S$847 million.</p><p>c. At the same time, Singapore's reinsurance premiums grew 31% year-on-year to S$27.6 billion in 2023, accounting for about 21% of Asia's reinsurance market.</p><p>4. This comes on the back of a resilient global reinsurance industry.</p><p>a. Global reinsurance capital has grown by 3.7% since end 2023 to reach a new high of US$695 billion in the first half of 2024, a level not seen since 2021.[1]</p><p>b. This was driven by retained earnings, more disciplined underwriting, and improved investment performance.</p><p>c. The industry has returned to profitability, with reinsurers' return on equity reaching 17.6% in the first half of 2024.[2]</p><p>5. This puts the reinsurance industry in a strong position to support the growth of Asia, as it navigates four key transitions in the years ahead - namely, climate, energy, digital, and demographic.</p><p>Climate transition</p><p>6. I will start with the climate transition. This is something which the insurance industry is familiar with, given its traditional role in providing natural catastrophe insurance coverage.</p><p>7. It is not so much that climate change is happening, but the pace at which it is accelerating which is of increasing concern. This is in turn challenging risk projections based off historical data.</p><p>a. In the past five years, annual insured losses from natural catastrophes averaged US$106 billion, up from less than US$83 billion in the previous five-year period.[3]</p><p>b. Latest models indicate the insurance industry needs to be prepared for an average annual insured loss of US$151 billion, or higher.[4]</p><p>8. Asia is particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change. It also suffers from a significant protection gap, particularly in terms of catastrophe coverage.</p><p>a. Total economic losses in the Asia-Pacific region for 2023 amounted to US$65 billion, of which 91% was not insured. This compares with a 30% protection gap in the United States.[5]</p><p>b. Based on the current trajectory, global temperatures are expected to increase by about 2.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels without more aggressive actions. Under this scenario, Asia could lose about 20% of its GDP by 2048 from 2021 levels, whilst ASEAN collectively could lose about 29% of its GDP.[6]</p><p>9. There is therefore both an imminent need and opportunity for the insurance industry to address the underinsurance gap arising from climate change, even as the world scrambles to mitigate the global impact of climate change.</p><p>a. To do so, the industry will need to work closely with governments, academia and technology providers, to enhance its risk models, scenario analysis and data on the physical impact of climate change in Asia.</p><p>b. I therefore encourage the insurance industry to tap on Singapore's growing applied climate risk research ecosystem.</p><p>i. Singapore has close to 10 institutions[7] which provide research and insights on the physical impact of climate risk and related issues in the region, such as sea level rise, extreme weather events, climate impact modelling, and nature-based solutions.</p><p>ii. Insurers, risk modelling firms, and brokers can leverage the work of these institutions as a foundation to layer on economic impact assessments, data and risk models, and hence enhance their assessments, disclosures and portfolio risk management strategies.</p><p>c. With these analyses, the industry can also better advise clients how to reduce their risk - for example, manufacturers could raise their factory floor, install flood barriers or elevate critical machinery above base flood elevation, in anticipation of frequent flooding as a result of sea level rising.</p><p>d. In turn, this will enable the industry to offer tailored products to provide sustainably priced, effective insurance coverage against natural catastrophes over the longer term.</p><p>Energy Transition</p><p>10. Let me move on to the energy transition.</p><p>11. Unlocking renewable sources of energy is key to enabling Asia to grow its economies while transitioning towards net-zero.</p><p>a. Asia accounts for half of global greenhouse gas emissions, as most of its energy needs today are being met through fossil fuels, including coal.</p><p>b. Moreover, much of Asia is developing, and its energy needs are still rising.</p><p>c. It is critical that we catalyse investments into renewable energy generation and transmission.</p><p>i. In fact, investments in renewable energy generation in Asia Pacific are poised to double during the current decade to US$1.3 trillion by 2030.[8]</p><p>1. This comprises a sizeable pipeline of renewable energy infrastructure projects, including solar, hydropower and wind.</p><p>ii. To enhance electricity connectivity within ASEAN, the International Energy Agency estimates that an overall grid investment of about $21 billion annually is needed from 2026 to 2030 and a further $31 billion annually from 2031 to 2035[9].</p><p>12. Amidst the energy transition, there are opportunities for specialty insurers and reinsurers to step up risk financing and insurance solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies.</p><p>a. It is estimated that Asia Pacific will account for a quarter, or US$59 billion of cumulative global renewable energy insurance premiums between 2022 and 2035.[10]</p><p>13. Yet compared to natural catastrophe insurance, there is less historical track record of risk assessment and loss profiles for renewable energy development in Asia.</p><p>a. Such projects will also be exposed to risks from potential damage from physical elements, such as heavy winds and storms, as well as the additional risk arising from the integration of energy storage systems with renewables.</p><p>b. To bridge these gaps, the industry must work closely with the renewable energy sector to develop new risk assessment frameworks, risk engineering methodologies, and sector-specific solutions.</p><p>c. This will improve the financial viability, risk management, and resilience of renewable energy and decarbonisation projects in the region.</p><p>14. There is also room to deploy solutions such as parametric insurance covers, as well as pre- Final Investment Decision, or pre-FID, insurance solutions[11], such as technology performance guarantees[12] and counter-party credit covers[13].</p><p>a. Parametric insurance covers can address specific coverage needs which may not be supported by traditional insurance, given the highly customisable nature.</p><p>i. MAS is studying ways to support the growth of parametric insurance, including through research on the regulatory treatment of such solutions in the region as well as information on independent and reliable data resources.</p><p>b. I encourage the industry to study pre-FID stage insurance solutions for projects in Asia, especially where projects are facing uncertainties.</p><p>i. This is a nascent space in the region, and there is room for the industry to innovate and pilot solutions offering protection during critical early stages of project development.</p><p>15. Insurers can also support the energy transition by investing directly in green infrastructure.</p><p>a. In fact, insurers are some of the world's largest institutional investors, holding more than US$40 trillion in assets.[14] In the Asia-Pacific, insurance assets are estimated to be about US$10 trillion.[15]</p><p>b. The long duration of infrastructure investments makes such assets a good match for the long-term liabilities of say life insurers.</p><p>c. To facilitate greater allocation of assets to infrastructure, MAS had recently issued a public consultation proposing a differentiated capital treatment for infrastructure assets that meet certain criteria to enjoy diversification benefits or lower risk charges than other debt and equity assets.</p><p>d. MAS will also be piloting a differentiated risk capital treatment for insurers' investments in environmentally sustainable infrastructure.</p><p>i. This allows insurers in Singapore to build their experience and capabilities in investing in sustainable infrastructure assets, and to gain deeper exposure to such assets.</p><p>ii. We will share more details of this pilot soon.</p><p>16. Taken together, these moves can potentially unlock Asia's sizable infrastructure investment gap, which is estimated at US$815 billion annually.[16]</p><p>Digital transition</p><p>17. I will touch on the digital transition next.</p><p>18. By 2030, the digital economy in the Asia-Pacific is expected to reach $2 trillion or more, driven by factors such as -</p><p>a. The boom in e-commerce, especially in countries such as China, India, Indonesia and Vietnam;</p><p>b. Innovations in fintech, especially digital payments; and</p><p>c. AI and cloud services, as businesses invest in these technologies to drive innovation.</p><p>19. At the same time, the risks associated with cyber threats will also increase. This will in turn drive the demand for the cyber insurance market in Asia.</p><p>a. The Asia-Pacific cyber insurance market is estimated to double from 2023 to 2027[17], as companies seek coverage for data breaches, ransomware attacks, and other cyber threats.</p><p>b. Reinsurers are developing more sophisticated cyber risk models to address this evolving threat.</p><p>i. For example, we have seen the industry develop dynamic cyber risk underwriting based on monitoring platforms making real-time risk assessments.</p><p>c. In tandem, I urge the industry to work with businesses and consumers to put in place robust cybersecurity measures.</p><p>i. Such ex-ante mitigation can help insurers better manage cyber risks, while encouraging businesses to adopt best-in-class systems and practices from the get-go.</p><p>Demographic transitions</p><p>20. Last but not least, the changing demographics in Asia - in particular, a combination of ageing populations, urbanisation, and increasing wealth - will fuel the demand for life and health reinsurance.</p><p>a. Many countries in Asia, such as China, Japan and South Korea, are experiencing rapidly aging populations. Singapore is no exception - we project to attain 'super-aged' status by 2026, with about one fifth of our population aged 65 years or older.</p><p>b. At the same time, life expectancy is expected to increase. This will drive demand for long-term healthcare, pensions and financial products that provide security in old age.</p><p>c. Likewise, the rise of the middle class in Asia, coupled with greater urbanisation, will fuel greater demand for life insurance, health insurance and savings-related products.</p><p>d. These trends will give rise to growing liabilities, and reinsurers can share the risk associated with longer lifespans and rising medical costs.</p><p>e. The rise of digital platforms and insurance technology - or InsurTech - will also increase the reach of insurers. This expansion in coverage will lead to a higher volume of complex risk, and therefore the opportunity for reinsurance to manage the risk portfolio.</p><p>f. Asia accounts for 39% of the global life market, and is expected to grow by over 5% annually over the next decade, outpacing the global average[18].</p><p>Growing Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub</p><p>21. I have outlined four transitions in Asia that will drive the demand for reinsurance - climate; energy; digital; and demographics.</p><p>22. Amidst this demand growth, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub.</p><p>23. First, we will double down on developing a marketplace of insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>a. Today, Singapore serves as the Asia-Pacific hub for 12 top global insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>b. Among reinsurers alone, 16 of the top 25 reinsurers in the world have made Singapore their regional hub, covering not just ASEAN, but also markets in North and South Asia and even Australia.</p><p>c. We also have a well-developed network of about 150 brokers in Singapore today.</p><p>d. We encourage insurers to expand their presence in Singapore -</p><p>i. By leveraging our concentration of underwriting expertise here, including in complex property, casualty and specialty lines; and</p><p>ii. By building on the databases and models available, such as on climate change that I had spoken about earlier.</p><p>e. By strengthening our ecosystem of insurers, reinsurers and brokers, we can position Singapore as the hub for the development of risk financing solutions for Asia.</p><p>24. Second, we will work with insurers and reinsurers in Singapore to deepen their capabilities, in particular in AI.</p><p>a. There is good potential for the insurance industry to harness AI to improve productivity, customer service, and core operations including underwriting, actuarial analysis, and claims processing.</p><p>i. For example, it is estimated that generative AI can boost the insurance industry's revenues by 20% and cut their costs by 15%.[19]</p><p>b. To support the scaling of AI with confidence, Singapore is developing a strong foundation of AI governance that balances the need for innovation with the responsible use of AI.</p><p>i. In this regard, MAS is working in partnership with leading insurers here under Project MindForge to develop a risk framework for the responsible use of GenAI for insurance use cases, including in AI-assisted underwriting and customer engagement.</p><p>ii. MAS will also be issuing a set of good practices next year for addressing AI model, technology and cyber risks.</p><p>c. In tandem, we must build up our talent pool to harness the potential of AI.</p><p>i. MAS and the Institute of Banking and Finance have commissioned a Jobs Transformation Map study on how GenAI will change job roles in the financial sector, and to identify the new skillsets needed. We will publish the findings and recommendations early next year.</p><p>d. I encourage the insurance industry to tap on the guidance and support available to develop and deepen your AI capabilities.</p><p>25. Third, we will continue to expand insurance capacity through alternative risk transfer instruments.</p><p>a. One such example is sovereign insurance solutions.</p><p>i. Singapore is part of the Southeast Asia Disaster Risk Insurance Facility (or SEA-DRIF), an ASEAN+3 initiative in partnership with the World Bank to provide climate and disaster risk insurance solutions for the region.</p><p>ii. SEADRIF has made US$4.5 million in payouts to support flood response in Laos, including a US$3 million payout in September 2024 following Typhoon Yagi.</p><p>b. Another example is insurance-linked securities (ILS).</p><p>i. Singapore is supporting the development of ILS markets in Asia to unlock additional risk financing capacity for peak catastrophe risks.</p><p>1. Of the 28 catastrophe bond issuances[20] in Singapore over the past 5 years, 13 issuances have covered perils in Asia, providing US$1.6 billion in coverage.</p><p>2. Whilst this is a good start, Asia currently accounts for less than 5% of the global catastrophe bond market.</p><p>ii. With their strong credit rating, good in-country relationships and sovereign support programmes, multilateral development banks can bring scale to ILS issuances in Asia by partnering sovereigns on programmatic issuances.</p><p>1. For example, they can provide a ready platform from which to issue catastrophe bonds, offering faster time to market and cost savings compared to individual countries building issuance capabilities on their own.</p><p>iii. There is opportunity to channel some of the growing flow of investments from private wealth and institutional investors in Asia towards ILS - and to this end, MAS is partnering with the ILS industry to promote ILS as an asset class for private wealth and investment portfolios.</p><p>c. Through such alternative risk transfer instruments, we can unlock additional risk financing capacity, and complement that provided by traditional insurers and reinsurers.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>26. Let me conclude. As Asia undergoes four fundamental transitions in the years ahead, there are opportunities for the reinsurance industry to play a key role in its growth and development, to insure a dynamic, sustainable and resilient Asia.</p><p>27. Through strengthening our insurance ecosystem, deepening capabilities, including in AI, and developing alternative risk transfer markets in Asia, we will reinforce Singapore as Asia's leading reinsurance hub.</p><p>28. I wish you a fruitful conference ahead.

Examples of solutions include conservation, restoration and improved management of natural ecosystems such as forests and wetlands.</p><p> \"As we focus our efforts on transitioning away from fossil fuels to renewable energy, we must not forget to turn off the tap of carbon emissions, resulting from deforestation,\" said Dr Koh during the dialogue, which was organised by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs.</p><p> \"In fact, even if we manage to decarbonise, we still may not be able to meet our climate goals, unless we also figure out the science and the practice of implementing nature-based climate solutions.\"</p><p> Carbon dioxide, which is produced by human activities such as the burning of fossil fuels for energy, is the main greenhouse gas driving climate change. Decarbonising means reducing the amount of carbon compounds released, including carbon dioxide, through methods such as using alternative sources of energy.</p><p> A 2017 paper, published in scientific journal Proceedings Of The National Academy Of Sciences, found that natural climate solutions can provide 37 per cent of cost-effective carbon dioxide mitigation needed till 2030 for a greater chance of holding global warming to less than 2 deg C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p> Another panellist, DBS chief sustainability officer Mikkel Larsen, noted that firms have a role in going green and highlighted Climate Impact X (CIX), a new global carbon exchange and marketplace announced last week.</p><p> CIX, a joint venture funded by DBS Bank, Temasek, Standard Chartered and the Singapore Exchange, will offer platforms and products that cater to the needs of different buyers and sellers of carbon credits. Carbon trading essentially treats carbon as a commodity that can be bought and sold between less and more pollutive firms.</p><p> The CIX will allow carbon credits to be sold through standardised contracts in an exchange, catering primarily to multinationals and institutional investors.</p><p> A broader spectrum of firms that want to participate in the voluntary carbon market will be accommodated as well, with projects in a marketplace that can help them meet sustainability objectives.</p><p> Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu, who was one of the dialogue's keynote speakers, also mentioned the CIX in her speech.</p><p> She noted that it would focus on carbon credits generated through nature-based solutions, and technology, to gather data on emission reduction and removal projects to verify the quality of carbon credits generated.</p><p> \"This is timely as the NUS Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions estimates that preservation of tropical forests alone can generate US$46 billion (S$61 billion) worth of carbon credits annually, and there is potential in South-east Asia to generate large volumes of carbon credits from regional re-forestation projects and mangrove ecosystem,\" she said.</p><p> In addition, Ms Fu and Indonesia's Minister for National Development Planning Suharso Monoarfa, who also gave a keynote address during the dialogue, referred to the importance of countries working together.</p><p> \"In this changing world, we realise the importance of collaboration at a global level, especially among Asean countries, to scale up conservation and restoration,\" said Mr Suharso.</p><p> \"In the regional effort, especially in Asean, we can build a collaborative platform to facilitate knowledge sharing and learning between experts... government and other related stakeholders.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A forested area being cleared by burning in Indonesia's Riau province in 2010.

SGX Group is part of the 1,200-strong TNFD Forum, which helped develop the beta version of the framework released in March 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The TNFD's 14 disclosure recommendations aim to inform better decision-making by companies and capital providers, and ultimately contribute to a shift in global financial flows towards \"nature-positive outcomes\" and the goals of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework, which was borne out of the UN Biodiversity Conference (COP 15) in December 2022.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">TNFD says its recommendations build on those of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and are consistent with the global sustainability standards of the International Sustainability Standards Board.</p><p>Although the TNFD establishes a voluntary reporting framework, it could quickly become a market standard, much like the TCFD became the global baseline for corporate climate disclosure, say Arne Klug, Gillian Mollod and Sylvain Vanston, research analysts from MSCI ESG &amp; Climate Research.</p><p>\"Currently, consistent data on nature and biodiversity is scarce, which affects models that depend on it,\" says the MSCI team. \"By design, the TNFD takes its approach from the TCFD. Both initiatives are designed to harness risk management and disclosure to help channel capital towards sustainable outcomes.\"</p><p>The TNFD framework extends the TCFD's four pillars - governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets - to nature. The TNFD includes a core set of 14 indicators for reporting across sectors, together with recommendations for sector-specific reporting. The framework also recommends a set of additional disclosure metrics.</p><p>Businesses and investors who want to be TNFD-aligned would, at minimum, report data for the core disclosure metrics, say Klug, Mollod and Vanston in a Sept 21 note.</p><p>British pharmaceutical and biotechnology giant GSK, formerly GlaxoSmithKline, has announced plans to publish their first TNFD disclosures from 2026, based on 2025 data. The TNFD will announce an inaugural list of \"TNFD adopters\" - companies that have indicated their intention to adopt the recommendations - at the World Economic Forum at Davos in January 2024.</p><p>For now, the MSCI researchers warn of challenges like complexity, a lack of transparency in supply chains and limited data. \"For investors and financial institutions, collecting data on corporate supply chains or pinpointing specific impacts by location could continue to present significant hurdles. The TNFD framework aims to provide guidance on how to reduce those gaps in the future.\"</p><p>Though challenges remain, the TNFD adds impetus to the standardisation of nature-related financial reporting, they add. \"The inaugural framework offers companies, investors and financial institutions a new global baseline for measuring and reporting biodiversity-related risks, dependencies and impacts.\"</p><p>Nature-based solutions</p><p>The science is clear - there is going to be no path to reach global climate goals without unlocking the power of nature-based solutions, says Thomas Brzostowski, interim Singapore country director at The Nature Conservancy (TNC).</p><p>\"It's just that simple and that important. Forests, wetlands, grasslands, mangroves and other ecosystems serve as these vital carbon sinks, and protecting these ecosystems, restoring degraded habitats and supporting farmers and landowners with regenerative land-use practices have the potential to realise about one-third of the emissions reductions needed to limit global warming and keep the climate within safe boundaries,\" says Brzostowski in his keynote speech at the Singapore Carbon Market and Investor Forum on July 19.</p><p>Such natural assets play a really critical role in helping to protect people and coastal infrastructure from the increasingly severe impacts of climate change, rising sea level storms and more, he adds. \"However, only about 8% of global climate investment currently goes to nature-based solutions for climate, despite being a third of the solution.\"</p><p>The global environmental non-profit group officially expanded into Singapore in July, growing its Asia-Pacific network that already spans Australia, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, India, New Zealand, Mongolia and Myanmar.</p><p>Supported by the Singapore Economic Development Board, TNC says its new office at The Great Room in the Afro-Asia Building will serve as a strategic global centre for partnerships, innovation and scientific research, focused on addressing the \"interconnected crises\" of climate change and biodiversity loss.</p><p>Over the past 70 years, TNC has helped to \"protect and improve the management of [some] 125 million acres or 50 million hectares of land\", says Brzostowski, \"about the size of Spain\". \"But we know we need to do more, faster. The world has years, not decades, to tackle the integrated biodiversity and climate crises.\"</p><p>Brzostowski, who has been with TNC since 2016, moved from New Zealand to set up the Singapore office. Here, TNC aims to drive sustainable solutions by supporting the growth of a \"high-integrity market\" for nature-based solutions like carbon credits.</p><p>Through the Southeast Asia Climate and Nature-based Solutions Coalition, TNC and seven other environmental and conservation non-profit groups across Southeast Asia are accelerating the adoption of nature-based solutions in the region.</p><p>By partnering trading companies and the finance sector, TNC says it will help address \"commodity-driven land conversion\", such as the clearing of forests, peatlands, mangroves and other natural areas for agriculture.</p><p>Finally, TNC hopes to collaborate with leading academic and research institutions \"to deepen the understanding of nature's role in addressing climate change\".</p><p>\"Over the next few years, more and more investors will be asking how businesses plan to support the [Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity] Framework, targets and transition strategies towards promoting nature-positive outcomes,\" says Brzostowski. \"Publicly disclosing progress against science-aligned targets and setting supportive global climate and biodiversity goals is a critical part of the integrity of environmental markets. Thankfully, there are a number of initiatives growing around the world to help companies navigate this very complex and ever-evolving space.\"</p><p>Investing in 'biodiversity champions'</p><p>Compared to the work of the TCFD, which aims to standardise the reporting of emissions, putting a single number to biodiversity loss is more challenging, says Sonya Likhtman of US-headquartered investment manager Federated Hermes. \"There are lots of issues, and bio-diversity can mean a very different thing, depending on the company.\"</p><p>But there are lots of things that can be measured, adds Likhtman. She lists the five main drivers of biodiversity loss: changes in land and sea use, direct exploitation of species, climate change, pollution and invasive alien species.</p><p>\"Carbon is still an important metric that's related to biodiversity. You can't just do carbon by itself; you have to also look at water, waste, deforestation and land use change,\" she says. \"It's about choosing the metrics that are most material to that company or sector and that's what the TFND is working towards.\"</p><p>Likhtman is lead engager for the firm's Biodiversity Equity Fund and also works in EOS, the stewardship and engagement team at Federated Hermes. \"We engage on behalf of our own funds, and also on behalf of a set of external stewardship clients.\"</p><p>At these meetings, her agenda is shaped by what is material to each company. \"Sometimes we have an engagement that's focused on one issue, and it's a real deep-dive with an expert in that company; sometimes it's a higher level, maybe we're meeting a board or management member.\"</p><p>The F&amp;B industry, in particular, is highly dependent on biodiversity and ecosystem services, says Likhtman. \"Agricultural systems, healthy soils, water flow, a stable climate, pollinators - all of those ecosystem services are so valuable to the industry. So, there's a business imperative to act to ensure the long-term availability of these inputs from nature.\"</p><p>Here, Federated Hermes touts its Biodiversity Equity Fund. Launched in April 2022, it is the only global fund that invests in \"biodiversity champions\", says fund manager Ingrid Kukuljan. \"In our opinion, biodiversity loss poses the biggest systemic threat to our planet, and we believe that businesses that are addressing this problem will be the long-term winners as they are exposed to scalable and secular growth factors.\"</p><p>As of March 31, its top five holdings are: Tetra Tech (5.58%), Aecom (5.52%), Tomra Systems (4.74%), Kerry (4.67%) and Brambles (4.29%).</p><p>New York Stock Exchange-listed Aecom and Nasdaq-listed Tetra Tech are leading global providers of professional infrastructure consulting services, says Kukuljan. They provide solutions to land and water pollution, as well as the encroachment of the built environment on biodiversity, she adds.</p><p>Meanwhile, Oslo-listed Tomra Systems is a global solutions provider that minimises waste in the food, recycling and mining industries, says Kukuljan. \"Tomra has a large installed base worldwide with 81,000 reverse vending machines, about 13,000 food sorting installations, 8,200 recycling units and 190 mining machines.\"</p><p>Dublin- and London-listed Kerry is a leading developer of taste and nutrition solutions for the F&amp;B and pharmaceutical markets. Kerry's supply chain impacts biodiversity, and some raw materials pose a higher risk of tropical deforestation, says Kukuljan. \"These include palm oil, soy, coffee and cocoa.\"</p><p>In turn, Kerry has committed to a number of 2025 targets, including no deforestation across \"high-risk supply chains\" and 100% reusable, recyclable or compostable plastic packaging. For palm oil, soy, coffee and cocoa, 100% of direct volumes will be deforestation- and conversion-free by end-2025, notes Kukuljan.</p><p>Forest conversion is the clearing of natural forests to use the land for another purpose, such as agriculture, mining or urban development.</p><p>Finally, Australia-listed Brambles operates the world's largest pool of reusable pallets, crates and containers through a \"share and reuse\" model, says Kukuljan, which enables a circular economy and reduces demand for natural resources. \"The average lifespan of a Brambles pallet is 10 years, in comparison to under one year for white wood.\" White wood refers to general exchange, non-rental pallets.</p><p>Conservation and nature financing has histor\u00adically been the remit of public finance, says Likhtman, and the role of private finance was not always recognised. \"But there is a huge gap in how much needs to be financed and [this is] an important role for private finance to play.\"</p><p>The most important point is to get started, she adds. \"We can't wait until we've solved climate change to get going on biodiversity. These are issues that go hand-in-hand and they're very closely interlinked  So, raising the topic with companies is already very impactful. What are you doing about the risks associated with biodiversity loss? How are you thinking about your impacts and dependencies on nature and ecosystem services? Bringing that to companies' attention, I think, is a very important step.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69C4-0S71-DYX1-V000-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1945\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 The Edge Publishing PTE.

Chinese and Japanese Gardens, along with Lakeside Garden, are the three gardens that make up the 90 ha Gardens.</p><p>With the rejuvenation of Chinese and Japanese Gardens now complete, visitors can enjoy a refreshed array of features and amenities, including new floral and aquatic gardens, visitor pavilions and galleries, as well as recreational and community spaces nestled within a scenic lakeside setting. At the same time, several familiar landmarks and features at both gardens have been retained or enhanced for new uses, following feedback by the public supporting their preservation. In all, the completion of the Gardens expands the variety of nature-based experiences for visitors of all ages, further realising its vision of being a people's garden.</p><p>Furthermore, the Gardens brings to fruition larger plans to ensure green spaces are within easy reach and further integrated into our urban landscape, providing a healthy living environment in our City in Nature.</p><p>In conjunction with the opening of Chinese and Japanese Gardens, the largest edition of Lights by the Lake will be held at the Gardens from 8 to 22 September 2024. For the first time since the opening of Lakeside Garden in 2019, the festivities will extend beyond Lakeside Garden to Chinese and Japanese Gardens, offering an exciting slate of activities and programmes at each of the three gardens, such as lantern displays, light shows, cultural performances and the NParks Concert Series in the Park: Rockestra.</p><p>To commemorate the occasion, the Guest-of-Honour Senior Minister Lee Hsien Loong unveiled a commemorative plaque and planted a Syzygium aqueum tree during the opening event earlier today. He was hosted by Minister for National Development and Minister-in-charge of Social Services Integration Desmond Lee, and joined by Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations Grace Fu, and Advisers from Chua Chu Kang GRC, Jurong GRC, West Coast GRC, Bukit Batok SMC, Hong Kah North SMC, Pioneer SMC and Yuhua SMC.</p><p>Rejuvenation of Chinese and Japanese Gardens</p><p>Built in the mid-1970s, Chinese and Japanese Gardens are deeply steeped in heritage. In 2014, it was announced that both gardens would be combined with Jurong Lake Park (now known as Lakeside Garden) to form Jurong Lake Gardens, and serve as the centrepiece of modern Jurong. Following extensive public consultation, rejuvenation works began in 2019 to sensitively enhance Chinese and Japanese Gardens, while preserving their natural ambience and distinctive cultural character. Tropical horticulture was another key focus, with the landscaping and planting palette carefully curated to bring out the colours and textures of the tropics.</p><p>Chinese Garden</p><p>Familiar landmarks that are synonymous with Chinese Garden, such as the Grand Arch, Cloud Pagoda, Twin Pagoda, Bonsai Garden, Stoneboat and Tea Pavilion, have been retained and spruced up with verdant landscaping and new amenities such as the Jurong Lake Gardens Gallery and Bonsai Gallery.</p><p>Furthermore, visitors can explore various newly added features, including the Cascading Creek, a riverine habitat with a boardwalk to showcase the different flora and fauna found along the river of a typical Southeast Asian forest, Water Wall Court, a serene courtyard enveloped by 3 m-high waterfalls, and Harvest Moon Terrace, which mirrors the Silver Moon Terrace at Japanese Garden across the lake, and features picturesque waterfront cabanas adorned with lanterns that are lit nightly.</p><p>The addition of the new Pagoda Plaza and Ficus Lawn also provides more open spaces for community events and gatherings amidst nature.</p><p>Japanese Garden</p><p>Highlights at the rejuvenated Japanese Garden include new curated gardens that interweave greenery with waterscapes, such as the Water Lily Garden, which houses the largest collection of water lilies in Singapore, and Sunken Garden, a valley-like garden with vertical green walls and a cenote[1]-inspired water feature.</p><p>Visitors can get closer to nature by venturing through a rustic trail lined with seasonal flowering trees at the Floral Ridge, or immersing themselves in the tranquillity of a Japanese-inspired garden at the Floral Garden.</p><p>Japanese Garden also has a variety of indoor and sheltered spaces suitable for large-scale and intimate events, such as the Guesthouse, a multi-purpose hall made of mass-engineered timber that can accommodate up to 1,000 people, as well as the adjacent Guest Pavilion and Teahouse. Visitors can also retreat to the Breathing Gallery, an indoor vivarium[2] showcasing terrestrial and aquatic species in terrariums, aquariums and paludariums.</p><p>Altogether, the rejuvenated Chinese and Japanese Gardens will complement Lakeside Garden's existing offerings, providing the public with even more recreational options within the first national gardens in the heartlands.</p><p>New and existing features at the Gardens commemorated in SingPost stamp series</p><p>Singapore Post Limited (SingPost) will be launching the Jurong Lake Gardens stamp series, which showcases four new and existing features at the Gardens - the Grand Arch at Chinese Garden, Water Lily Garden and Guesthouse at Japanese Garden, and Rasau Walk at Lakeside Garden.</p><p>From 9 September 2024, members of the public can purchase the Jurong Lake Gardens stamp series at the General Post Office, all philatelic stores and online at: shop.singpost.com.</p><p>Continued focus on sustainability</p><p>The rejuvenated Chinese and Japanese Gardens continue the Garden's emphasis on sustainability, with solutions that contribute towards greener outcomes and efficient operations. These include using environmentally sensitive materials such as mass-engineered timber and carbon dioxide mineralised concrete, leveraging nature-based solutions such as detention ponds for irrigation, and implementing a smart water management system that helps clean and restore water.</p><p>The second phase of the Gardens' development, which encompasses Chinese and Japanese Gardens as well as the northern section of Lakeside Garden, has achieved the Building and Construction Authority's Green Mark 2021 Platinum Super Low Energy certification for its best-in-class energy efficiency and use of intelligent energy management strategies.</p><p>This green push is in line with the Singapore Green Plan 2030, a nationwide movement that charts Singapore's sustainable development.</p><p>Shaping a people's garden through community involvement</p><p>The community played a key role in the rejuvenation of Chinese and Japanese Gardens, which saw contributions from a diverse range of stakeholders. During NParks' public engagement exercise from November 2016 to April 2017, over 14,000 suggestions were gathered for Jurong Lake Gardens Central (now known as Chinese and Japanese Gardens) and East, and incorporated into their design where feasible. NParks also took into consideration suggestions from industry stakeholders and practitioners on how best to sensitively carry out the rejuvenation works.</p><p>Various features within Chinese and Japanese Gardens also exemplify community stewardship. For instance, at the Floral Garden at Japanese Garden, NParks also worked with JTC to develop the design concept and partnered students from the ITE College East, Nanyang Academy of Fine Arts, Ngee Ann Polytechnic and Singapore Polytechnic, as well as volunteers from Friends of Jurong Lake Gardens to design and co-create five community plots.</p><p>In addition, residents, volunteers from Friends of Jurong Lake Gardens and Nature Kakis Network, and donors contributed to the greening of Chinese and Japanese Gardens by supporting tree planting efforts on site, which also furthers the OneMillionTrees movement to plant one million more trees throughout the island.</p><p>Furthermore, the strong support of donors has been key in helping the Gardens take shape. A key partner is Tote Board, who enabled the development of key features across the Gardens through its funding support, including SkatePark @ Lakeside Garden, the Ficus Lawn at Chinese Garden, and the Guesthouse and Teahouse at Japanese Garden. Additionally, Micron Technology donated S$1 million through the Garden City Fund, NParks' registered charity and IPC, towards supporting the Gardens' sustainability efforts through the implementation of a smart water management system that helps clean and restore the water in the Water Lily Garden and the larger Japanese Garden. Donations from Mr Jimmy Koh and Mr Han Jok Kwang also contributed towards the development of Chinese and Japanese Gardens.</p><p>Largest edition of Lights by the Lake, with over 300 lanterns on display</p><p>From 8 to 22 September 2024, the third and largest edition of Lights by the Lake will be held at the Gardens, with the festivities spanning Chinese and Japanese Gardens as well as Lakeside Garden. Hand-crafted lanterns depicting Chinese folklore and the Gardens' biodiversity will be displayed and lit at night, with over 300 lanterns in total - the most number of lanterns displayed to date.</p><p>Visitors of all ages can look forward to a myriad of exciting activities and programmes, including dazzling light shows, movie screenings, cultural performances, funfair games and a food market. As part of the festivities, the NParks Concert Series in the Park: Rockestra will also return to the Gardens for the first time since 2019, with a medley of popular Mandarin, English and hits performed by local artistes.</p><p>Lights by the Lake 2024 will feature activities in support of the President's Challenge this year.

The compost contains between 18 per cent and 23 per cent of humic acid, which retains moisture in soil. </p><p> KinRoss chief technical officer Arthur Ku explained that the liquid culture -- containing over 70 species of microorganisms found in black soil in forests -- is \"trained\" to adapt to differing conditions of temperature and soil salinity, for instance, in a process that has been patented by the company. </p><p> Mr Ku said the culture was developed in response to worldwide demand for rejuvenating farmlands. </p><p> Mr Bilguundemberel Munkhdemberel, counsellor of economic and trade affairs at the Mongolian Embassy in Singapore, said that increased desertification is making it difficult for grasslands and forests to thrive in Mongolia, which has a land size of 1.5 million sq km. </p><p> Soil rejuvenation could improve agricultural yields and food security, as well as absorb 125 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (CO2) -- the main greenhouse gas -- under a Mongolian government campaign to plant a billion trees by 2030. </p><p> Said the Mongolian counsellor: \"We used to be heavily reliant on imports. But after Covid-19, every nation understood that food security is a strategic issue.\" </p><p> He was speaking on the sidelines of the signing of a memorandum of understanding (MOU) at the Agri-Food Tech Expo Asia last Tuesday. </p><p> The collaboration will see KinRoss, Clean BotanEco, DNZ Venture Global and the Asia Carbon Institute using nature-based solutions to generate carbon credits. </p><p> DNZ Venture Global will use the standards set by the Asia Carbon Institute to register for carbon credits. Each credit represents a tonne of CO2 reduced or avoided, and can be sold to buyers looking to reduce their own emissions. </p><p> According to the Global Land Outlook 2022 by the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification, around 25 per cent of the earth's land is already substantially degraded and less productive, negatively impacting the well-being of at least 3.2 billion people. </p><p> Clean BotanEco chief executive Bayarjargal Batsukh said that in Mongolia, the demand for soil rejuvenation will come from some of the government agencies and 52 private companies -- including mining firms -- that have committed to growing over 820 million trees as part of the one-billion-tree campaign. </p><p> As at Aug 23, private and government organisations, as well as schools and the armed forces, had planted over 14 million trees. </p><p> Mr Bayarjargal said four glasshouses spanning 72 sq m each will be set up in Mongolia to showcase the results of using KinRoss' composting liquid culture. </p><p> There are also plans to use the culture in projects during spring from April to May on a trial basis, to demonstrate to clients how land can be rejuvenated, he added. In addition, there are plans to set up a facility to produce 2,000 tonnes of compost by June 2024. </p><p> The MOU comes just months after the governments of Singapore and Mongolia agreed to collaborate on carbon credit projects. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>At the signing of a memorandum of understanding at the Agri-Food Tech Expo Asia last week were (from left) Clean BotanEco chief executive officer Bayarjargal Batsukh, Asia Carbon Institute founder John Lo, KinRoss CEO Dennis Ng and DNZ Venture Global co-founder Leong Wai Keong.

opportunities centred on coastal habitats are among the ideas and suggestions that Singaporeans have given at engagements on the Long Island reclamation project to be developed off East Coast. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Since the start of 2024, public agencies have held engagement sessions on plans for the project, which will help to meet several needs, such as coastal protection, flood resilience and boosting Singapore's freshwater supply.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Technical studies, including environmental impact assessments, engineering studies and soil investigation works, will begin later in 2024 and last about five years, ahead of the development of the project, which is slated to yield about 800ha of land.</p><p> The Urban Redevelopment Authority (URA) said that between November 2023 and May 2024, agencies received more than 500 submissions via online public feedback channels, such as the URA website and by e-mail.</p><p> In addition, six engagement sessions have been held as at mid-May, involving East Coast residents and businesses, East Coast Park users, nature groups, sports and recreational groups, as well as members of the public.</p><p> National Development Minister Desmond Lee on May 14 hosted the sixth such engagement, which was the first to be opened to the public.</p><p> Temasek Junior College student Justin Goh, 18, was among the 60 participants at the session held at The URA Centre in Maxwell Road.</p><p> He said that among the ideas he raised was how to develop or reclaim Long Island -- current conceptual plans show that it will comprise three land tracts -- in a manner that is environmentally sustainable.</p><p> Mr Goh also suggested that coastal habitats, such as tide pools, brackish water and mangrove habitats could be formed on the new island, which could give future users direct contact with nature, and serve educational purposes.</p><p> Echoing Mr Goh's sentiments was Ms Izavel Lee, who represented environmental group LepakInSG at the May 14 engagement.</p><p> She was primarily concerned about Long Island's impact on biodiversity -- especially during its construction phase -- and hopes that the environmental studies would thoroughly document and suggest mitigating measures to protect marine life, such as seagrass patches and corals near Tanah Merah Ferry Terminal.</p><p> URA said that through the upcoming technical studies, agencies will explore combining engineering and nature-based solutions to develop innovative designs that will \"better integrate coastal protection measures with land reclamation\".</p><p> Mr Goh said other attendees at the May 14 engagement raised issues such as accessibility between Long Island and the mainland, as well as between the island's land tracts.</p><p> Also on participants' minds, he added, was the hope that the decision-making processes on Long Island would be transparent, and continue to be open for citizen participation.</p><p> Singapore Sailing Federation chief executive Leslie Tan, who attended an engagement session in February, said he was most concerned that access to the sea would be limited when Long Island is developed, adding that losing access \"would be devastating\" for the sea sports community.</p><p> Mr Tan noted that free and open access to the sea is now challenging, with only about 10 per cent of the shoreline allowing sea access -- East Coast Park being the largest such opening.</p><p> Mr Tan said the waters off East Coast provide the safest conditions in Singapore for a full range of sea sports, and accommodate those of all abilities, from beginners to world-class athletes. </p><p> He added that the area is where various regattas, events and races -- about 50 yearly, including activities such as sailing, stand-up paddleboarding, and triathlons -- are held, which are \"important for developing a vibrant, active and healthy nation\".</p><p> Addressing participants at the engagement session on May 14, Mr Lee noted that the Long Island projects will take decades to be completed, adding that the Government will work with various groups at each stage of planning, and that \"the process is as important and as impactful as the final outcome\".</p><p> \"With each stage, we are going to create something and we have to decide what to do with the piece of land that we start to develop,\" he said, noting that not all of it has to be for economic gain, and that the exact use of the land can be discussed, or even left \"to the future generation to decide what they want to use this land for\".</p><p> But referencing rising sea levels, Mr Lee emphasised that the Long Island project is primarily an issue of coastal protection, and not reclamation for the sake of creating land for more opportunities.

At the same time, the nation's financial institutions have been active in making climate-aligned investments. Until recently there has been a focus on the role that nature-based solutions can play in addressing climate change, but the broader importance of nature to local and global economies is now receiving increased attention. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Around the world, we are witnessing the rapid degradation of natural capital assets such as clean waters, healthy soils and carbon-storing rainforests. In Singapore, we recently saw an oil spill that deposited more than 400 tonnes of fuel into the city's waters and onto its beaches, forcing tourism and recreational-activities operators to shut down as a massive cleanup effort got under way. Had the spill been larger, it is not hard to see it having a catastrophic impact on local businesses and supply chains.</p><p> Understanding the new realityAs companies increasingly grapple with understanding and responding to their exposure to nature loss, the scale of the nature-repair task is daunting. The United Nations' Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework sets a target of US$200 billion funding per year to be spent on nature repair by 2030. In response, the global financial sector is urgently considering the part it will play in providing the finance that is required. </p><p> The issue is particularly acute in South-east Asia, which is home to much of the natural capital that is under threat and where many businesses are highly exposed to supply-chain risks from regional nature damage. Despite this, the task of financing the shift to nature-positive business practices also represents a huge opportunity for Singapore, as the finance and commercial hub of the region. </p><p> The Singapore Green Finance Centre and Pollination recently hosted a roundtable for the city's leading financiers to share how they are responding to the need for nature investment, what challenges and opportunities they are seeing, and what changes might be needed to increase the flow of finance.</p><p> As a largely public good, nature has not provided a traditional commercial return unless it is being exploited. Nature management and conservation have almost exclusively been the preserve of governments, philanthropists, and conservation groups. Given the scale of finance required, valuing the preservation and repair of nature in real economic terms is now fundamental and private sector financing will be key.</p><p> Our roundtable discussion made clear that finance sector leaders understand this new reality. Those gathered were already engaged in high-level discussions about how to respond to the emerging demand for nature investment. </p><p> We were energised by the determination to lead in the space -- seen as necessary for Singapore to maintain its status as a global finance hub -- but also saw a sector looking for partnerships and enabling policy to guide how and where to direct its resources.</p><p> While we can see the impact that reporting and disclosure frameworks such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD) have had on putting nature on the corporate agenda, moving beyond reporting and compliance relies on investors securing a return from nature investing or gaining a greater understanding of how nature investing can protect future economic stability and company returns.</p><p> We heard from finance sector leaders looking for government signals and settings to help establish clearer local and regional direction, including a desire for regional bodies, such as Asean, to be active in establishing rules, metrics and tools for the nature shift.</p><p> Overwhelmingly, there was support for Singapore playing a lead role in financing nature, just as it has done with establishing climate finance and carbon markets. One change worth considering might be for governments to require companies to report on their nature-related risks based on a TNFD framework, just as they now do in Singapore for climate. </p><p> Ultimately, governments may need to think about imposing obligations on companies to manage their impact on nature and make mandatory investments to ensure their operations are nature-positive. There could also be a potential role for public funding incentives to encourage large-scale private nature investment.</p><p> Hungry for the right toolsOne challenge that many of our participants named was the lack of agreed metrics, available data and a shared taxonomy for financing nature. It is often said that \"you can't be what you can't see\". It is just as difficult, though, to repair what you cannot measure, or to invest in something that does not have an agreed value.</p><p> Financiers are hungry for the tools and understanding they will need to \"turn on the tap\" and let nature finance flow in a way that can deliver better-understood returns for investors and for the environment. This includes research and case studies, standards for identifying and measuring natural capital, as well as the regulatory infrastructure to allow for frictionless comparison, translation, and trading across regional jurisdictions, so that finance can flow to where it is most needed.</p><p> While frameworks such as the TNFD and Science Based Targets initiative have been helpful, the discussion called out the fact that such frameworks often emerge from Western economies and flagged the need for rules and guidance that better reflect Asian contexts.</p><p> All of this is important, but the task at hand is urgent and we do not have time to wait for ideal conditions before getting started. The most important thing is to stop waiting and start financing, course-correcting along the way as new research, data and cases emerge. If the nature-finance plane is going to be built at the same time it is being flown, better to have a spanner in your hand and a voice in the debate than to continue being an observer.</p><p> Martijn Wilder is CEO of climate and nature investment and advisory firm Pollination.

Mr Speaker, Sir, on behalf of the Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, I beg to move, \"That the Bill be now read a Second Time.\"</p><p>2. The Sewerage and Drainage Act, or SDA for short, was enacted in 1999, and the last Sewerage and Drainage (Amendment) Bill was in 2012. The SDA provides powers to regulate the construction, maintenance, improvement, operation and use of sewerage and drainage systems, and the discharge of sewage and trade effluent.</p><p>3. Over the past decades, the SDA has allowed PUB to regulate discharges into our sewerage system. This ensures that the used water received at our Water Reclamation Plants, or WRPs, can be effectively and efficiently treated and sent to the NEWater Factories for further treatment to produce NEWater. NEWater, an ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water, plays a critical role in Singapore's water supply. It is delivered to key customers like wafer fabrication plants and is also used to top up our reservoirs during dry spells.</p><p>4. We have also taken steps to improve our stormwater drainage system over the years. In 2008, we completed the Marina Reservoir by damming up the Singapore River. This alleviated flooding in the low-lying areas in the city centre and provided us with a new source of catchment water. Over the years, we have continued to develop innovative drainage solutions. Just this September, we marked the opening of Alkaff Lake at Bidadari Park, which not only functions as a stormwater retention pond to prevent floods in the Bidadari Estate during heavy rain, but also serves as a recreational space to bring people closer to water.</p><p>5. But our work is not done. Findings from Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study, or V3 study, project that Singapore will see longer and more frequent dry spells by 2100, averaging one every 10 to 60 months. We also expect more extreme daily rainfall across all seasons which will increase the likelihood of flash floods. As a weather-resilient National Tap less affected by dry spells, NEWater's importance will thus grow, and we must take further steps to protect the quality of our used water which affects how we are able to treat it into NEWater. We will also need to ensure that our stormwater drainage system continues to be protected and kept in good working order, so that it can withstand more frequent extreme weather events.</p><p>6. Our proposed amendments to the SDA seek to achieve these two objectives: Better secure our used water system and in turn safeguard the production of NEWater; and also enhance our flood resilience by better protecting the stormwater drainage system and keeping it in proper working order.</p><p>7. We will also introduce amendments related to PUB's operations, to better support their operational needs as Singapore's National Water Agency.</p><p>8. Let me elaborate on each group of amendments.</p><p>SECURING OUR USED WATER SYSTEM</p><p>9. First, on securing our used water system.</p><p>10. Singapore has an extensive sewerage system with about 3,600 km of sewers and 48 km of Deep Tunnel Sewerage System, or DTSS. As Singapore develops further, our sewerage system will also expand. Last year, PUB completed tunnelling works for Phase 2 of the DTSS, comprising 98 km of deep tunnels and link sewers. Our sewerage system channels used water from industries and households to our water reclamation plants which provide the treated used water as feedstock to our NEWater factories to produce NEWater.</p><p>11. To better secure our NEWater supply, we must: Leverage technology to better protect the sewerage system; and take stronger actions against illegal discharges.</p><p>2.1 Leverage technology to better protect the sewerage system</p><p>12. A key feature of the Bill is to support the use of technology to better protect our sewerage system.</p><p>13. General Waste Collectors, or GWCs, collect sewage, greasy waste and organic sludge for disposal at WRPs. Their tankers need to be registered with PUB annually and they are only allowed to collect authorised waste.</p><p>14. However, some GWCs may illegally collect unauthorised waste or dispose any collected waste directly into sewers instead of our WRPs to avoid paying for the costs of treatment or disposal. In 2021, PUB investigated two such cases, but the cases could not be established as PUB was unable to verify their collection routes.</p><p>15. To deter such illegal actions, Clause 42 amends Section 74 to empower regulations to be made to impose requirements for these tankers to be installed with tracking and locking devices. These devices provide GPS tracking, and geo-fenced smart-locking capabilities to allow the discharge valves of GWC tankers to only open at designated points in our water reclamation plants.</p><p>16. Aside from illegal discharges, our sewerage system is also impacted when contractors physically damage our sewerage system such as when a piling rig punctures a sewer. Clause 42 will also enable regulations to require the installation of tracking devices on piling and soil investigation rigs. This will provide real-time alerts to PUB and contractors if their rigs are near our sewerage system, so that preventive actions can be taken where necessary. Clause 43 enacts a related amendment to the Public Utilities Act 2001 for large water supply pipelines.</p><p>17. Prior to introducing these measures, PUB engaged the industry to seek their feedback. GWCs welcomed the change as they could at the same time use the GPS devices for fleet management. Contractors were also supportive as the GPS devices would help them avoid damaging the sewers during works, which could result in much higher costs and delays.</p><p>18. Since April 2023, the industry has already implemented these requirements. All GWC tankers registered with PUB have installed GPS devices. Tracking devices have also been installed on piling and soil investigation rigs deployed to projects in the DTSS or trunk sewer protection corridor. Hence, the amendments seek to regularise these requirements.</p><p>19. With recent improvements in technology, contractors now have more advanced methods such as probing with plastic drill bits and sonar detection to identify buried services including sewers before carrying out activities such as excavation or drilling works. The industry often prefers these advanced methods as they are less intrusive and more efficient than physically digging a trial trench. Clause 9 thus provides for PUB's acceptance of such alternative methods.</p><p>2.2 Take stronger actions against illegal discharges</p><p>2.2.1 Current approach towards illegal discharges</p><p>20. Today, we have a suite of end-to-end measures to deter illegal discharges into the sewerage system. Upstream, we have a thorough vetting process before granting approvals for discharge. Our officers conduct regular inspections and monitoring throughout the network. When illegal discharges are detected, we may issue stop work orders, revoke approvals for trade effluent discharge, and impose penalties on offenders. We also communicate regularly with companies that discharge trade effluent to remind them of the important role that they play in protecting our sewers.</p><p>21. Thus far, most companies have acted responsibly. But there are some irresponsible offenders, including some recalcitrant ones, whose actions have threatened our used water system. Illegal discharges can disrupt NEWater feedstock. Toxic and harmful discharge can kill the microorganisms used to treat used water at the WRPs. This results in the water being unfit for further treatment at NEWater factories. To rectify the impact, PUB would have to temporarily halt the NEWater production process and ramp up our other National Taps to make up for these disruptions. Illegal discharges also jeopardise the safety of the people who work hard to maintain our used water system. When companies illegally discharge high concentrations of volatile organic compounds such as benzene and toluene, workers that maintain our sewers and operate our water reclamation plants may breathe in the toxic fumes. These highly flammable compounds also create fire and explosion risks. Even as PUB takes all necessary measures to ensure the safety of its workers, we should seek to eliminate such hazards in the first place. PUB also has to expend resources to investigate and carry out extensive sampling to identify the source of the illegal discharge and take remedial actions. This is costly, and time-consuming.</p><p>2.2.2 Principles used to guide the formulation of the tightened penalties</p><p>22. To enhance deterrence, we have reviewed the penalties under the SDA and propose to enhance these to ensure the penalty regime remains effective. We will implement changes in two areas - raise maximum penalties and introduce mandatory minimum penalties. In our review, we considered three objectives: First, penalties should better reflect the severe impact to our water supply. Irresponsible actions can cause disruptions to the NEWater production process. They can also endanger workers operating and maintaining our used water sewerage system and working at our WRPs.Therefore, the penalties should better reflect the gravity of such irresponsible actions. This is done both by raising the maximum penalty and introducing minimum penalties. Second, the penalty quanta should be substantial enough so that companies are not incentivised to flout the law instead of taking the necessary measures. Third, the penalty quanta should be generally aligned with those of similar offences in other Acts. For example, we aligned the maximum penalties in the SDA with that of similar offences in the Environmental Protection and Management Act 1999. In setting the minimum penalty quanta, we also considered that several Acts had mandatory minimum penalties of about 20% of the maximum penalty.</p><p>2.2.3 Raising maximum penalties</p><p>23. The first enhancement is to raise maximum penalties. Clause 12 of the Bill will amend Section 16(5) to increase the maximum penalty from $20,000 to $50,000 for repeat offenders who discharge trade effluent without approval or not in accordance with conditions of that approval or regulations. Clause 13 will amend Section 16A(6) relating to the discharge of dangerous or hazardous substances without approval or not in accordance with conditions of that approval or regulations, which causes injury, death, damage to sewers, or severe disruption to treatment, by doubling the maximum penalty for repeat offences. The maximum penalty for repeat offences will be raised from $200,000 to $400,000. Clause 14 will amend Section 17(4) to increase the maximum penalty from $40,000 to $100,000 for offences relating to the failure to comply with PUB's order to stop and/or treat the discharge of hazardous substances. Clause 42 will amend Section 74(2) to double the maximum penalty from $15,000 to $30,000 for repeat offences under regulations.</p><p>24. Penalties for sewerage offences, such as carrying out unauthorised sewerage works, will also be raised to match corresponding increases in penalties for drainage offences. These actions impact the conveyance capacity of our sewers and may result in leaks or even sewer overflows, which pose public health and environmental pollution risks. Clause 7 will amend Section 11(4) to increase the maximum first-offence penalties for the alteration of sewerage system without approval, from $20,000 to $50,000. Maximum penalties for repeat offenders will be increased from $20,000 to $100,000. Clause 10 will amend Section 14(4) to increase maximum first-offence penalties for carrying out works affecting or likely to affect the sewer or sewerage system without approval, from $20,000 to $50,000. Maximum penalties for repeat offenders will be increased from $20,000 to $100,000. Clause 17 will amend Section 20(1) to increase the maximum first offence penalties for the damage caused to a public sewerage system, from $40,000 to $50,000. Maximum penalties for repeat offenders will be increased from $40,000 to $100,000. Clause 17 will also amend Section 20(2) relating to damage caused to the public sewerage system, increasing the penalty for repeat offences from $200,000 to $400,000.</p><p>2.2.4 Introducing mandatory minimum penalties</p><p>25. The second enhancement is to introduce minimum penalties for four offences relating to illegal trade effluent discharge, across both first and subsequent offences. Clause 12 will amend Section 16(5) to insert a mandatory minimum penalty for discharging trade effluent without approval or not in accordance with conditions of that approval or regulations. This will be $4,000 for the first offence, and $10,000 for repeat offences. Clause 13 will amend Section 16A(5) to insert a mandatory minimum penalty for discharging dangerous or hazardous substances into any public sewerage system without PUB's approval or not in accordance with the conditions of that approval or regulations. Mandatory minimum penalties will be set at $10,000 for the first offence, and $20,000 for the second offence. Clause 13 will amend Section 16A(6) to insert a minimum penalty for discharging dangerous or hazardous substances without approval or not in accordance with the conditions of that approval or regulations, which causes injury, death, damage to sewers or disruption to treatment. This will be set at $40,000 for the first offence, and $80,000 for repeat offences. Clause 14 will amend Section 17(4) to insert a minimum penalty for failing to comply with an order to stop and treat discharge of hazardous substances into the public sewerage system. This will be set at $20,000.</p><p>26. There are other offences in legislation with minimum penalties, such as the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea Act 1990, which has a minimum penalty for the discharge of oil or oily mixture from ships.</p><p>27. While the intent of the amendments to the penalty regime is to increase deterrence, we recognise that this measure cannot work in isolation. PUB will continue to work closely with companies, including through engagement sessions to share best practices, to ensure that their trade effluent is managed and discharged responsibly.</p><p>ENHANCING FLOOD RESILIENCE</p><p>28. Next, let me move on to the amendments intended to enhance flood resilience.</p><p>29. In Singapore, we adopt a holistic \"Source-Pathway-Receptor\" approach to manage stormwater. At source, we try to slow down surface runoff at developments to reduce peak flow into public drains. At locations where stormwater runoff is generated, we require new developments of more than 0.2 hectares to implement solutions. Solutions could include detention tanks or nature-based solutions to slow down stormwater runoff entering the public drainage system. Along the pathways, or the routes through which stormwater is conveyed, PUB designs drains and canals to convey stormwater efficiently. To enhance our pathways, we raised design standards for drains in 2011 to cater for more intense rainfall events. We also implemented important drainage improvement projects like the Stamford Diversion Canal for this purpose. Finally, at the \"receptors\" where floodwaters may propagate to and affect infrastructure, receptor solutions provide additional flood protection for buildings and key infrastructure. For example, MRT station entrances are required to be elevated above ground level with a minimum crest level to prevent stormwater from entering the MRT stations.</p><p>30. The stormwater drainage is one continuous system - actions affecting one part of the system can have severe impact elsewhere in the system. To provide an example, in 2021, there was a construction firm that was doing road-widening works. In the process, they blocked off a roadside drain and diverted the flow to a new drain section that was still under construction. They did so without PUB's approval, and this irresponsible action eventually led to a flood. Traffic came to a standstill for about 2 hours, 13 vehicles were partially submerged, and 1 person was taken to hospital.</p><p>31. The proposed amendments will introduce measures across the system to improve stormwater management.</p><p>3.1 Protecting the stormwater drainage system from silty discharges and obstruction</p><p>32. The capacity and function of drains and reservoirs can be compromised due to unauthorised modifications, or obstructions caused by debris and silt. This can cause stormwater to back up and flood surrounding developments. We will raise penalties to deter damage or unauthorised modifications to the stormwater drainage system. Clauses 21 and 22 amend Sections 23(4) and 24(4) respectively to increase the maximum first-offence penalties for the alteration of stormwater drainage system without approval and interfering with drains that cause flow obstructions respectively, from $20,000 to $50,000. Maximum penalties for repeat offenders will be increased from $20,000 to $100,000. We aligned the penalty quantum to that of Section 26 which relates to works affecting the stormwater drainage system. Clause 23 amends Section 26(5) to double the maximum penalty for repeat offenders who carry out works or activities which could affect any stormwater drainage system or lead to the discharge of silt directly or indirectly into any stormwater drainage system from $50,000 to $100,000. Clause 24 amends Section 30(2) to increase the maximum penalty for first offences for causing damage to the stormwater drainage system from $40,000 to $50,000 and raises the maximum penalty for repeat offenders from $40,000 to $100,000.</p><p>33. We want to be comprehensive and consistent in our coverage of activities that may affect the stormwater drainage system. Currently, the SDA only regulates construction activities that affect the stormwater drainage system and non-construction activities in State Land drainage reserves. Clause 22 expands the SDA to also prohibit non-construction activities that cause obstruction to all drains, including those outside of State Land drainage reserves.</p><p>34. PUB has silt control powers for the discharge of surface water containing silt from construction activities into the stormwater drainage system. However, non-construction activities such as sand stockpiles for landscaping works also have the potential to cause silty discharge. For example, we have seen a case of a contractor improperly storing material like soil and sand near Punggol Reservoir, resulting in silt being washed into the reservoir during rain. Clause 23 amends Section 26 to extend PUB's silt control powers to non-construction activities and discharges into reservoirs.</p><p>3.2 Keeping stormwater drainage systems and flood protection measures in proper order</p><p>35. Managing flood risks is a collective effort. With more intense weather events, it is not feasible to expand our drains to cater for every extreme rainfall event. Premises owners and occupiers have a part to play in ensuring the flood resilience of their own premises, which also affects the surrounding developments and connected drainage system. Clause 20 will introduce new Sections 22A and 22B to require owners of premises to keep their stormwater drainage systems, drains, and flood protection measures in proper order. Clause 42 amends Section 74 to enable regulations to be prescribed towards these requirements in relation to flood protection measures. For example, requiring minimum platform levels at new developments and redevelopments, and requiring crest levels for all entrances, exits or openings to basements or underground structures like tunnels and underground MRT stations.</p><p>AMENDMENTS RELATED TO PUB'S OPERATIONS</p><p>36. Finally, a third group of amendments are technical in nature and relate to PUB's operations to safeguard the sustainability of our water supply. It has been 12 years since the last Sewerage and Drainage (Amendment) Bill was passed. These amendments update the SDA provisions so that they stay relevant and effective in supporting PUB's operations in today's context.</p><p>4.1 Supporting PUB's Operations</p><p>37. When there are any illegal alterations, works or damage that affect the public sewerage system, stormwater drainage system, or drain, clauses 7, 10, 17, and 21 to 24 provide for PUB to urgently step in to carry out rectification works to restore the function of the public sewerage system, stormwater drainage system, or drain, and recover the cost of the rectification works from the culprit. Currently, PUB is unable to recover the costs if it steps in to carry out rectification works, even when it is clear that the damage was caused by the responsible party. PUB can only recover costs if the party responsible for the damage had first defaulted on PUB's written notice to perform rectification works.</p><p>38. Clause 33 amends Section 43 to ensure that PUB officers have powers of entry to deal with emergency situations involving public sewerage systems and stormwater drainage systems, such as chokes or pipes that had developed structural defects over time, so that PUB can undertake urgent rectification work necessary for the service or safety of the public. This amendment mirrors existing powers of entry in emergency situations in the Public Utilities Act 2001. Emergency situations are those that involve damage or obstruction to a public sewerage system or stormwater drainage system where PUB assesses that rectification work is necessary for the service or safety of the public.</p><p>39. Clause 34 amends Section 44A to allow officers to take videos in addition to photographs, and require the production of video surveillance footage, during investigations to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of investigations.</p><p>40. Works to sewerage and drainage systems must be completed in accordance with plans approved by PUB, to protect public safety. To ensure this, Clause 27 amends Section 33 to enable PUB to issue a written notice requiring developments to apply for a Compliance Certificate which will complete the works certification process and penalise those that fail to comply with the written notice. Clause 29 will amend Section 36 to clarify who are the owners or occupiers of premises who may be directed to carry out rectification works. This is aligned with the existing provisions for sewerage matters.</p><p>4.2 Regularising PUB's Existing Practices and Other Amendments</p><p>41. I spoke earlier about protecting our sewerage system. Clauses 9 and 10 will amend Sections 13A and 14 respectively to regularise our existing practice of protecting sewers under construction and constructed sewers that have not yet been commissioned. The Clauses will require companies to ascertain locations of such sewers to prevent damage to them. Clause 42 amends Section 74 to empower regulations to be made for the issue of stop work orders so as to stop the discharge of trade effluent, when needed to protect the public sewerage system.</p><p>42. When taking over public drains or sewers constructed by other agencies and developers, PUB needs to impose a Defects Liability Period, or DLP. Clause 27 amends Section 33 to formally allow PUB to impose the DLP and to provide PUB with recourse should defects arise during the DLP or any warranty against defects is not assigned to PUB.</p><p>43. Clause 41 inserts a new Section 73A which allows PUB to issue administrative exemptions from legislated requirements on a case-by-case basis, in instances where stakeholders face specific compliance constraints. For example, new developments with a small footprint might not be able to meet PUB's Minimum Platform Level requirement as this could lead to additional amenities such as ramps required for barrier-free access. In such cases, PUB may allow the installation of flood protection systems like flood barriers to give the same level of flood protection.</p><p>44. Clause 40 amends Section 70 to provide for composition sums collected by PUB under the SDA to be paid into the Consolidated Fund.</p><p>45. Clause 38 inserts a new Section 60A to make it clear that certain drainage and sewerage systems built on private land do not form part of the land and do not belong to the landowner.</p><p>46. We are standardising and clarifying terms used in the SDA, both through Clause 2 which clarifies terms such as \"sewerage system\" defined in Section 2, and through other Clauses which remove overlaps in the use of the terms \"sewage\" and \"trade effluent\" throughout the Act.</p><p>47. Clause 26 inserts a new Section 32A to enable the incorporation by reference of PUB's Codes of Practice for both sewerage and drainage to enable PUB to enforce the requirements more effectively.</p><p>48. And finally, Clause 35 amends Section 47 to remove the right of appeal to the Minister in relation to three provisions, where there is already recourse to the Courts.</p><p>CONCLUSION</p><p>49. In summary, we must protect our sewers from damage and take errant companies to task to better secure our used water system. This will safeguard our weather-resilient NEWater tap. We must also protect our stormwater system to enhance flood resilience. This will prepare us to adapt to extreme weather patterns that will come with climate change.</p><p>50. The proposed amendments to the SDA I have elaborated on will provide PUB with the legislative powers to do so, and I invite premise owners, developers and stakeholders to work with us and play a part in securing our water future together.</p><p>51. The proposed amendments related to PUB's operations will allow PUB to be more effective in fulfilling its mission to tame stormwater, reclaim used water, and ensure a safe and reliable supply of water for all.</p><p>52.

I am glad to join you for the 7th Annual Global Research Alliance for Sustainable Finance and Investment conference, or GRASFI, at the Singapore Management University or SMU.</p><p>Fostering Credible Transition, Creating Sustainable Impact<br/><br/>Climate change is a clear and present danger for the world. This is the first time that GRASFI is gathering physically here in Asia. I hope this experience will be valuable to deepen your understanding of Asia. Asia is a big and complex region, with countries at different stages of development, and with a range of economic and social needs and resources.</p><p>On one hand, we emit about half of global emissions. These emissions are expected to grow, driven by economic and development needs, including extending electricity to rural populations.</p><p>On the other hand, Asia is rich in biodiversity, which is affected by climate change, but also offers a promising range of nature-based solutions. Asia is home to around a fifth of the world's rainforests. The waters in South-East Asia, near Singapore, harbour one of the world's most extensive seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves.</p><p>The theme of the conference \"Fostering Credible Transition, Creating Sustainable Impact\" is most apt. With the right policies, strategies, and technologies, we can pursue sustainable growth for the benefit of people and planet.</p><p>While climate change affects all states around the world, for tropical island states like Singapore, it is an existential risk.</p><p>Small island states are the first to experience the impact of climate change.</p><p>Singapore's latest National Climate Change Study projects that mean sea levels in Singapore could rise by up to 2 metres by 2150.</p><p>But climate change will set off other complex changes in the world's ecology, that ultimately impacts all of us, wherever you live.</p><p>These include tipping points in our ice sheets, seawater and forests, which could amplify and accelerate climate change.</p><p>It is critical that we address this existential challenge and avoid the tragedy of the commons. Every one of us has a stake, and everyone must do his or her part. This complex problem with multiple dimensions must be dealt with at multiple levels, with a range of policy instruments, and by mobilising a wide range of stakeholders.</p><p>At the global level, we need to forge a consensus for a sustainable and equitable model of growth.</p><p>International frameworks and agreements are the foundation of this, with the UNFCCC process and the Paris Agreement at the heart of it.</p><p>Singapore is a strong supporter of this multilateral approach, including serving as ministerial facilitators in the negotiations leading up to the Paris Agreement, and more recently on mitigation and carbon credits.</p><p>Global institutions, such as the World Bank and IMF, play important roles in mobilising climate finance. I am glad that the World Bank Group has a presence in Singapore, including an Infrastructure and Urban Hub to serve the region.</p><p>At the country level, we must do our parts to decarbonise our economies, and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>We can all contribute in our own way, regardless of our size, or our level of development. For instance, even though Singapore emits less than 0.1% of global emissions, we have set ourselves a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and a little earlier for the public sector.</p><p>To achieve this, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 - a roadmap to mobilise our industries and citizens towards sustainable growth.</p><p>When I was the Finance Minister, I introduced a carbon tax as a price signal for carbon emissions. The government has also issued green bonds We have since laid out a schedule of carbon tax levels until 2030.</p><p>The proceeds from our carbon tax will be used to help companies in Singapore decarbonise.</p><p>And under our S$28 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan, we are supporting R&amp;D into new climate technologies and solutions like sustainable building materials, carbon capture and storage, and alternative fuels like biofuels and hydrogen.</p><p>Do find out more about these projects from GRASFI participants from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and SMU, which have strong science and technology capabilities, and research programmes in several areas of sustainability.</p><p>We trust that these initiatives can enable us to boost resilience here in Singapore, and enable us to serve the region as a pathfinder and testbed for green solutions.</p><p>And at the industry level, companies will need to keep pace with greater consumer preferences for sustainable products, and emerging climate regulations like sustainability reporting and cross-border carbon taxes.</p><p>Companies can either pivot their business models and portfolios to contribute and benefit from new opportunities, or risk being disrupted by others or boycotted by consumers.</p><p>Last week, I presented an award for transformation to Sembcorp Industries, a local energy company which had pivoted from oil and gas to renewable energy. They had also achieved impressive total shareholder returns through this transformation.</p><p>As part of our wider efforts in Singapore to transform our economy - also known as Industry Transformation 2.0 - we have added two new pillars to the existing four pillars, by including sustainability and resilience.</p><p>Sustainable Finance as a Catalyst for a Greener and More Resilient Future<br/><br/>Among the many stakeholders, the financial sector plays a critical role. Significant financing is needed to accomplish these ambitions at the global, country, and industry levels. We must mobilise financial resources and allocate these effectively to meet the diverse needs.</p><p>McKinsey estimates that Asia alone needs more than US$3 trillion annually to achieve net-zero by 2050.</p><p>But public finances in many countries are stressed, especially after the COVID-19 pandemics.</p><p>To meet the needs for investment and capital, we will need to more effectively mobilise some of the estimated US$400 trillion of private capital.</p><p>Sustainable finance - the pursuit of financial returns alongside environmental and social objectives - will be a critical enabler.</p><p>As a global financial centre, Singapore hopes to play our role in advancing sustainable finance, for our region and the world.</p><p>Last year, we launched the Finance for Net Zero Action Plan, which seeks to achieve four strategic outcomes.</p><p>One, to promote consistent, comparable and reliable climate data and disclosures to guide decision making and safeguard against climate risks; Two, to build up a climate resilient financial sector with deep capabilities in risk management practices like climate scenario analysis and stress testing; Three, to support financial institutions in developing credible science-based transition plans; and Four, to promote innovative financing solutions such as blended finance and voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>Many of you here are experts and practitioners in sustainable finance. You have an impressive list of topics and speakers for the coming sessions. Let me take this opportunity to suggest three areas where academics, industry, and government can work together to advance sustainable finance.</p><p>The first area is to develop better definitions and outcome measures of sustainable finance. This reduces the risks of green washing, and helps guide companies and investors in decision-making.</p><p>Taxonomies which define sustainable activities, are the foundation of this.</p><p>I am glad that efforts are underway to align these taxonomies across jurisdictions, including between Singapore, China and the EU. This will facilitate cross-border transactions by financial institutions in these jurisdictions.</p><p>We can also work together to improve how we measure the impact of finance on sustainability.</p><p>For example, the conference paper by Ayako Yasuda and Keer Yang from UC Davis suggests that clearer labelling of sustainable finance products helps investors make better investment decisions.</p><p>Similarly, the Singapore Green Finance Institute (SGFIN) developed a corporate impact pricing model that leverages AI to analyse the impact of environmental performance on stock prices.</p><p>And the Singapore Green Finance Centre is developing an Impact Weighted Account Framework to help companies better assess the sustainability impact of their operations and investments.</p><p>These initiatives help us measure outcomes, and to channel capital into activities that are impactful.</p><p>Second, to shape regulations to facilitate sustainable finance flows, while keeping down regulatory costs to companies.</p><p>For example, we have seen an increase in sustainability disclosure regulations in many jurisdictions, with some countries looking to progressively implement the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosure standards including listed companies in Singapore from FY2025, and large non-listed companies from FY2027.</p><p>By working together, we could better develop reporting frameworks that are simple yet effective.</p><p>I am glad that the conference will examine the impact of regulation, and on ESG ratings and disclosures, over the next few days.</p><p>Good regulations can also catalyse the flow of financing to impactful causes such as energy infrastructure, and deep tech innovations to accelerate decarbonisation.</p><p>For example, in the Handbook on Scaling Up Blended Finance by the Network for Greening the Financial System, regulatory and practical barriers were often cited as obstacles to scaling up blended finance transactions in emerging markets.</p><p>Third, while definitions, outcome measures, and regulations are important, ultimately, any system is operated by people. We must therefore uplift our skills and broaden our talent base.</p><p>As part of Singapore's Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map, we will invest $35 million over the next three years to upskill and reskill our finance professionals.</p><p>This includes expanding the range of sustainable finance training courses for working professionals, undergraduate and polytechnic students.</p><p>I encourage all of us here to develop new teaching modalities to make sustainable finance more accessible. For example, SGFC leveraged SMU's teaching infrastructure to deliver executive courses, and provide a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that is open to the public.</p><p>While we do our best with our current state of knowledge, we need to recognise that sustainability, and sustainable finance is a complex and fast-evolving field. So we must continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge, and deepen the capabilities of our industry.</p><p>This will require us to bring together multidisciplinary research and real-life application, and bridge the varied fields of science, technology, economics and finance.</p><p>Academic institutions, including Centres of Excellence like the SGFC and SGFIN, can play an important role by bringing academics and industry together to study important issues such as carbon markets, climate adaptation, transition finance, and nature. Our Centres of Excellence are also crucial in ensuring that the research uncovered can be applied by industry through practice notes and whitepapers, and through training courses across the career spectrum - from undergraduate to executive and C-suite levels.</p><p>Through research networks like GRASFI, we can bring together the best minds around the world, to explore, to learn and to share.</p><p>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me conclude. Climate change is an existential challenge, and one of the most complex challenges facing humankind.</p><p>Every one of us must do his or her part, and make adjustments at the global, country, industry and personal levels.</p><p>Academic researchers and practitioners like yourselves can help guide global efforts for decarbonisation and sustainable growth in an objective and science-based manner.</p><p>We will need to push the frontiers of innovation across different fields -in science and technology to better understand climate science and to develop new solutions; as well as in economics and finance to optimise price signals and fiscal incentives; and in the social sciences to shape norms and nudge behaviours.</p><p>By bringing together experts from all over the world, GRASFI is an important platform to exchange perspectives and learn from each other's experiences.</p><p>I wish you a successful conference, and continued collaborations in this complex and critical work. Thank you.</p><p>[Category: Professional Services, Events]</p><p>Source: Prime Minister's Office, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0064832396</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CW3-SRS1-JB5M-W0X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2193\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 2, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp;

This commentary aligns with industry sentiments, as upGrad's Ronnie Screwvala previously highlighted the reputational damage caused by Byju's struggles.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Once a funding darling during the pandemic, Byju's now grapples with sustainability and profitability issues, exacerbated by a funding winter. The company's massive layoffs, delayed financial reports, and a sharp valuation drop have further tarnished its image. Legal troubles and shareholder discontent, including attempts to oust Raveendran, compound the crisis.</p><p>The sector's broader challenges are underscored by potential consolidations, like the rumored acquisition of Unacademy by K-12 Techno Services.

I am delighted to be here at the Global-Asia Family Office Summit. Earlier this year, I joined the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) as a board member, and I have enjoyed meeting with management and professionals running our financial industry, ranging from banks to asset managers, insurers and capital market entities. Today, I look forward to speaking with the community of family offices in Singapore.</p><p>Continued growth in wealth management sector</p><p>2. The family office community in Singapore is a vibrant and growing space. From just 400 single family offices awarded MAS tax incentives as at 2020, it grew 3.5 times to 1,400 at the end of last year. In the first 8 months this year, we added another 250 to reach 1,650 single family offices. Growth has continued to be robust, and we expect the number of new single family offices for 2024 to surpass the 300 that we added in 2023.</p><p>3. To those who have recently chosen to set up your family office here, a warm welcome to Singapore. You have joined us at a good time - Asia's prospects ahead are bright and the growth momentum remains strong. The Asia Pacific region is expected to grow by 4.9% in 2025, faster than any other part of the world. And Singapore as a hub in Asia will benefit from this positive development, growing together with our region.</p><p>4. As a strategic gateway to Asia, Singapore remains a trusted financial centre and well-regarded destination for asset and wealth management. Growth in assets under management, or AUM, last year was driven by increase in valuation and net inflows across traditional and alternative assets, as well as in wealth management and many other activities. The wealth management AUM recorded a growth of more than 8% in 2023, continuing the trend of growth in the past few years. And overall, the 5-year compounded annual growth rate of wealth management AUM came up to about 10%.</p><p>5. Wealth owners choose Singapore for many reasons - our strong rule of law, robust and predictable regulatory regime and a comprehensive ecosystem of wealth managers and professional service providers are also some of the reasons. Equally important to wealth owners who spend time here is our high quality of life, our safe and secure environment which is family-friendly, and our excellent connectivity with the rest of the world, as well as our world-class education and healthcare systems.</p><p>6. Local banks like the Bank of Singapore and UOB, as well as global private banks such as Citi, HSBC and Nomura, have announced their plans to continue expanding their teams and offerings in Singapore. A survey conducted by MAS with a group of leading private banks in Singapore earlier this year found that client assets in the first quarter of 2024 grew by 9.5% compared to the same quarter one year ago. And this was echoed by BCG's Global Wealth Report which projected that Singapore would grow by 8.5% per annum between 2023 to 2028, faster than any other global wealth centres.</p><p>7. Singapore's high standards of regulation foster a reputable environment for genuine investments and wealth management activities to flourish and bloom. And this is our strength and our branding. We will continue to provide a trusted and stable environment, giving investors assurance and confidence - in Chinese, what people would say \"Trustworthy, reliable, and safe\" as a sense of assurance. We need to strike the right balance between having robust regulation and growth, and continue to be the key to success of our wealth management sector. We do not want to dilute our focus on providing this safe, trusted environment, which will require robust regulations. But robust regulations and proper safeguards can go hand in hand with an environment that is also business-friendly - and that is what we want to achieve.</p><p>8. I would like to reassure our industry stakeholders that Singapore will continue to welcome legitimate wealth, genuine investments and complementary international talent from around the world. And the more turbulent and disruptive the external environment becomes, the more we must remain open, welcoming, stable and secure to differentiate ourselves.</p><p>9. MAS will continue to focus on providing a conducive environment for wealth owners and family offices. For example, in response to industry feedback, MAS recently provided guidance to financial institutions on how they can implement risk-proportionate due diligence checks on the source of wealth of their customers to avoid undue delays in bank account opening timeliness. MAS has also streamlined the tax incentive application process, to reduce the waiting time for family office funds. We will work together with our industry partners to improve our processes to make them simpler, better and faster.</p><p>Impact created for Singapore</p><p>10. The family office ecosystem has added diversity to our financial sector and created value for Singapore's economy and society. I would like to acknowledge and express my appreciation to the family office community for your contributions to Singapore.</p><p>* Family offices have created good jobs in Singapore, both directly, when you hire your investment professionals locally, and indirectly, when you engage the services provided by our private banks, fund managers, as well as legal and tax firms.</p><p>*The patient capital that families bring, along with your business know-how and networks, can greatly contribute to nurturing our local ventures and innovation activities. Take for example, Tres Group, whose S$20 million investments spurred the growth of GetGo, the largest carsharing platform in Singapore, with the mission to promote sustainable mobility.</p><p>* Family-led enterprises have also been key contributors to climate mitigation and adaptation causes. For example, the Olayan Group donated towards the Asia Climate Solutions Design Grant launched by MAS in partnership with Convergence. The grant defrays the cost of early-stage preparation and design of innovative blended finance solutions. The grant has supported projects coming from clean energy transition to nature-based solutions, catalysing a pipeline of investible projects that would otherwise be under-capitalised.</p><p>Conducive and rich ecosystem of service offerings</p><p>11.There is further potential for family offices to grow and contribute. To achieve this, we must strengthen the value proposition of our family office ecosystem, through three key areas:</p><p>* First, families' interest in philanthropy and doing good by giving back to help others in society.</p><p>*Second, families' interest in investing as private equity or venture capital.</p><p>*And third, to build talent and capabilities in the family office space.</p><p>I'll touch on each one briefly.</p><p>12. Starting off with philanthropy. Many family offices are already keenly aware of the important role they can play in contributing to the broader community and helping the less fortunate. Indeed, we are seeing growing interest from family offices to become a \"force for good\" - so not just to do well, but also to do good -and establish a legacy that extends beyond financial gains and wealth accumulation.</p><p>13. For example,</p><p>* The Ishk Tolaram Foundation supports education and skills training for dyslexic pre-schoolers and autistic talent to pursue engineering careers.</p><p>* The Tsao Foundation contributed significantly to eldercare solutions in the community and brings together stakeholders to implement programmes and policy research on effective ageing.</p><p>14. Yet many families are often faced with questions like how to give, and what organisation to give to? Like a trekker looking upwards towards Mount Everest, wondering how to take your first step that will pave your way to reach the summit. This is why Singapore is developing a range of initiatives to support your philanthropy and impact journey.</p><p>* This includes mountain guides to support you on your climb. We have been systematically deepening the pool of professionals in Singapore with expertise in philanthropic advisory and impact capital.</p><p>* In 2021, MAS and the Institute of Banking &amp; Finance launched the Philanthropy Advisory Technical Skills and Competencies to provide guidance on the skills and competencies that professionals should possess to support the philanthropic aspirations of high-net-worth individuals and families. This served as a resource for training providers in the design of relevant training curriculum.</p><p>* We then set up a dedicated Centre for Sustainable Finance and Private Wealth in 2022, founded by the University of Zurich, to equip finance professionals in Singapore with the knowledge to drive sustainable investment strategies for their clients in Asia. More than 800 professionals have participated in training courses since its inception, acquiring valuable skills in sustainable finance, impact investing and mobilising private capital for sustainable development.</p><p>*The Wealth Management Institute has also seen significant enrolments in sustainable finance courses: in the last 2 years, it saw more than 2,000 enrolments into sustainable finance courses.</p><p>*And earlier this year, the Asia Centre for Changemakers, hosted under the WMI, launched the Certified Impact Philanthropy Professional, Asia's first-ever dedicated certification mapped to industry skillsets for philanthropy advisors.</p><p>* Now, besides mountain guides to help family offices who want to scale to the summit, we also want to provide you with climbing mates who share your passion and who can climb the mountain together with you. We are growing a community with the \"Impact Philanthropy Partnership\" that is led by WMI and the Private Banking Industry Group, where families can share on their philanthropic experiences and build a network of like-minded peers. There is no need to climb the summit on your own. You will have mountain guides to help you, and you will have climbing mates to make your journey together.</p><p>* And of course, you must also have good climbing gear and we are catalysing the growth of tools and structures, such as Donor Advised Funds, and deal-share, due diligence and impact monitoring platforms to make it easier to give by handling the administrative work and research.</p><p>* And finally, to provide a conducive climate for your climb. We have introduced tax policies to encourage donations both locally and overseas. Singapore has been granting 250% tax deductions on donations to local Institutions of Public Character for more than a decade. For overseas donations, we have seen growing interest from family offices in the Philanthropy Tax Incentive Scheme launched at the start of this year to provide qualifying donors with a 100% tax deduction.</p><p>15. Philanthropy is a long journey, but we believe that with skilled mountain guides, like-minded companionship, good climbing gear, and a conducive climate, you will be successful in your philanthropic ascent. And I hope that you will tap on these resources and be a part of our journey as we develop Singapore into a global centre for philanthropy.</p><p>16. Beyond philanthropy, we also want to give wealth owners the best opportunities in preserving and growing your wealth. As I mentioned earlier, we need to do well so that we can continue to do good. To achieve this, Singapore is home to more than 300 private equity and venture capital fund managers, many who are keen to partner family offices like yourselves on co-investment opportunities.</p><p>* MAS has been working closely with the industry to develop Singapore's private markets over the last few years. We enhanced the operating environment for VC investments through calibration of our regulatory framework for VC managers. Singapore currently has four private market platforms that are established in Singapore, such as ADDX and Capbridge, and we are working to anchor more of such players here.</p><p>* And to further strengthen linkages between family offices and the local investment and innovation ecosystem, the Economic Development Board and MAS will continue to work closely with Enterprise Singapore and SGInnovate, and we have set up several platforms to connect local companies to potential investors like family offices. This is another area which you can deploy your wealth, which is to help grow the start-up ecosystem. And hopefully, you can also get good investment returns.</p><p>Skills development for the industry</p><p>17. And finally, we believe that good talent is the bedrock of a successful family office ecosystem. I am pleased that WMI is supporting the development and upskilling of Singapore's family office-related workforce. With over 5,000 enrolments since 2020, feedback of the programmes have been positive and have provided valuable networking opportunities for learners with educators and other industry professionals.</p><p>18. Now importantly, WMI is not resting on its laurels. Earlier this morning, WMI announced that they will be embarking on two new flagship programmes - the Changemaker Impact Endeavour Fellowship Programme to support Asia's philanthropists bringing about effective change and impact, and a new Dalio Investment Principles programme to build stronger portfolio management capabilities among family offices principals and investment teams. Two good new initiatives.</p><p>19. These programmes will complement WMI's existing suite of training programmes for family office principals and professionals, and take our family office ecosystem to greater heights. I want to thank Ms Foo Mee Har and her team at WMI for their good job and for playing this important role to grow the wealth management sector from strength to strength.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>20. Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude the speech by reiterating that Singapore will continue to enhance our ecosystem of service offerings, underpinned by trust, strong regulation and supportive government policies. This is a place that you can put your money for investments for the long-term and be assured of the stability and trust here. My colleagues and I are confident that the sector has much potential to grow further in the years ahead, and we want to work together with all of you to contribute more opportunities for Singapore and create more good jobs for Singaporeans. We also want to help you, in the process of investing here and setting up your family office, to do well and do good, to achieve the impact and legacy that you want for your families.</p><p>21. Thank you for being here today, and I hope that the Summit will bring you insightful learnings, foster meaningful connections, and facilitate greater positive impact for Singapore and the region. Thank you very much.</p><p>[Category: Banks, Asset Management/ Mutual Funds, Financial/ Capital Market, Events]</p><p>Source: Monetary Authority of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0064919259</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D08-P481-JB5M-W096-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2559\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"09\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>September 16, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>Securities Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RkFFMTQ3ODhCRDYyNDkyN0IwQkEyQzRCRDlFMEM5ODc7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"51\"><className>Business Development Companies</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QzYyN0Y1OUJBOEFDNDA1RUJGOTgxNkJCNERFM0UwMkI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NEZBNjUwRkEwQjJGNDgzQzlEMzMyNEE1RDAyOTY4RkE</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N521100MM</classCode><className>CENTRAL BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

At this pace, the year's total could come close to a record US$300 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The surge is no aberration. A rapidly developing policy and regulatory framework now requires countries and companies to do more to protect nature, and plug an estimated biodiversity finance gap of US$700 billion a year.</p><p> For a growing number of investors, meanwhile, biodiversity restoration is seen as a potentially more cost-effective way to tackle global warming and meet net-zero goals.</p><p> Credit ratings agency Fitch said in a recent study that nature-positive portfolios are growing in popularity.</p><p> There is, then, every reason to believe that biodiversity bonds will account for an ever larger share of the US$6.5 trillion ESG bond universe.</p><p> Gaining prominenceSovereigns and supranational institutions have been spearheading the development of biodiversity-related capital. The European Union and the World Bank were among the first to issue such debt.</p><p> They collectively account for around two-thirds of all biodiversity-related ESG debt issuance to date, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF).</p><p> Corporate borrowers are also entering the fray in response to regulations and reporting standards requiring companies to consider biodiversity protection as part of their net-zero planning.</p><p> Two types of corporate biodiversity bonds have been in the ascendancy.</p><p> The first is the use of proceeds (UOP) bond, which raises money for sustainability projects. </p><p> Issuance of such bonds has grown in the past few years even as other types of ESG debt have flagged amid fears of a lack of transparency. </p><p> Among the most popular UOP nature bonds have been those that fund terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation objectives -- both recognised as an eligible UOP category by the International Capital Market Association.</p><p> These represent some 16 per cent of all new biodiversity bonds issued in 2023, up from 5 per cent in 2020, according to Fitch.</p><p> Among the issuers was Chilean pulp and paper company CMPC -- which issued UOP bonds for sustainable forest and water management, and the restoration of native forests.</p><p>Finnish forestry company Stora Enso issued green bonds with proceeds earmarked for sustainable forest and water management, as well as pollution control, among others.</p><p> The Bank of China recently issued two biodiversity bonds with net proceeds allocated to biodiversity conservation projects as well as environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources and land-use projects.</p><p> The second type of biodiversity bond popular among corporate issuers is the sustainability-linked bond (SLB). The distinguishing feature of SLBs is a change of terms -- such as coupons -- should the issuer fail to meet performance objectives.</p><p>Brazilian pulp and paper company Klabin recently sold an SLB maturing in 2030, with 2025 as the trigger for the pricing of the next interest rate.</p><p> The company's 2030 goals include:</p><p> Hot spotsCorporate biodiversity bonds have been popular among issuers based in emerging markets. They have accounted for nearly two-thirds of all biodiversity-related corporate bond issues. </p><p> Asian-based borrowers are becoming more active in the market, accounting for nearly 20 per cent of all newly issued bonds. That is nearly as much as the combined amount issued by borrowers based in the United States and the eurozone.</p><p> Emerging-market corporate borrowers look likely to make greater use of biodiversity bonds. This is because populations in these countries, which are home to the world's most diverse ecosystems, are more heavily dependent on nature for their well-being and prosperity -- be it through agriculture, fisheries or tourism. </p><p> According to estimates from BloombergNEF, all the top 20 funding priorities for global biodiversity protection are located in emerging markets.</p><p> Emerging countries are also keen to finance nature-based solutions -- considered effective from a cost point of view -- for climate adaptation, as they brace themselves for the effects of global warming.</p><p> Nature risk and premiumGrowing investor demand for biodiversity bonds may also reflect the favourable financial performance of the asset class.</p><p> The IIF noted that the median return of biodiversity fixed income funds stood at just over 10 per cent -- outpacing conventional peers, which it calculated delivered 6.7 per cent last year.</p><p> The analysis chimes with a growing body of academic research that has uncovered the existence of a \"biodiversity risk premium\" in the fixed income market.</p><p> One study, which analysed the credit risk term structures of infrastructure companies, found that companies that manage biodiversity risks had up to 93 basis points better long-term financing conditions.</p><p> The difference was greater over longer lending periods -- the slope showing one to 10 years was steeper than that for one to five years.</p><p> The credit default swap curve, the researchers concluded, indicates that investors perceive those risks as long-term issues in an industry especially vulnerable to a triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.</p><p> Biodiversity becoming materialBiodiversity has yet to become a mainstream investment in the green bond market, with only some 8 per cent of the total raised in the market directly funding nature protection efforts. </p><p> In comparison, over 50 per cent of funds are for renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p> The use and setting of biodiversity performance targets has significant room to improve as the current framework makes it difficult to quantify and monitor biodiversity gain or loss accurately.</p><p> Bodies such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures and the Finance for Biodiversity Foundation are working with scientists to refine data monitoring and collection processes.</p><p> A more standardised biodiversity finance architecture should help investors ramp up their capital commitments for companies with nature restoration projects.</p><p> It could be a matter of time before nature-related bonds follow the same path as climate-related ones to become a standard environmental feature in the global sustainable fixed income market.</p><p> Sabrina Jacobs is senior client portfolio manager, emerging market fixed income, at Pictet Asset Management, where Philipp Buff is senior investment manager, developed market fixed income</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Emerging-market borrowers are more likely to make use of biodiversity bonds because populations in these countries are more dependent on nature for their prosperity.

Congratulations to CDL on the opening of the Singapore Sustainability Academy Annex (SSA Annex) today.<br/><br/>I see many familiar faces here from recent events like Go Green SG and the Youth4Climate challenge.<br/><br/>The growing tempo of events is a good sign that the sustainability movement here, and around the world is picking up momentum. Today's launch is another occasion for us to gather and exchange ideas.<br/><br/>Taking Action to Address Climate Change<br/><br/>Sustainable development, especially tackling climate change, is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.<br/><br/>It is encouraging that commendable strides have been made, especially since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.<br/><br/>Improvements in technology have reduced the production costs of renewable energy significantly.<br/><br/>Various industry sectors, including building owners and real estate developers, are developing plans to decarbonise their sectors.<br/><br/>Many financial institutions and investors have also adopted sustainability targets and Net-Zero transition plans.<br/><br/>There are also many efforts to look at nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>But we need to do more and act faster.<br/><br/>According to the latest IPCC report, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels.<br/><br/>This is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 Celsius, and to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>But global emissions last year continued to rise above 2022 levels.</p><p>So we are moving in the wrong direction, including in Asia, which accounts for about half of global emissions.<br/><br/>Globally and in the region, we are seeing the results of climate change, with extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and storms.<br/><br/>Singapore is very vulnerable to climate change. Temperatures have risen steadily over the past 40 years, and rising sea levels pose existential risks for our island nation.<br/><br/>It is important that we prepare ourselves for climate change early - starting with our goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>We have put in place policies such as a carbon tax and mandatory sustainability reporting. These are not always easy for companies to adopt, and we will need to help our companies adjust.<br/><br/>We have also launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, as a national roadmap to guide sustainable development.<br/><br/>And just a few days earlier, the National Research Foundation, or NRF, launched the new CREATE Thematic Programme in Decarbonisation to help decarbonise the energy and industry sectors together with international research partners.<br/><br/>These plans and policies aim to help Singapore increase our resilience to climate change, and contribute to global efforts.<br/><br/>We hope to be a pathfinder and testbed for green solutions, and catalyse a sustainability wave in the region and beyond.<br/><br/>Partnerships to Accomplish our Sustainability Agenda<br/><br/>The agenda that I have laid out is ambitious and will require all of us to play our part.<br/><br/>As Sherman spoke earlier, CDL is leading by example to make sustainability an important pillar of your business ethos and strategy.<br/><br/>2030 and 2050 net zero targets guide your operations towards greater sustainability, and you have contributed to shaping industry practices in emerging areas such as sustainability reporting and sustainable finance.<br/><br/>CDL has also played an active role in sustainability education, and I was happy to join your initiatives like the CDL Green Gallery at the Botanic Gardens, and the 7th edition of the Youth4Climate Festival which was held in Bedok earlier this month.<br/><br/>This spirit of active citizenry is reflected in the setting up of the SSA in 2017 as a ground-up initiative and zero-energy facility dedicated to sustainability capacity building and thought leadership.</p><p>I am glad that the SSA has hosted over 1,000 events and 35,000 visitors since its launch. Imagine if every visitor here brought three good ideas, you would have collected over 100,000 ideas. And if only half of those ideas are implemented, you will have at least 50,000 good actions that are taken.<br/><br/>So congratulations to CDL, and I hope that you will inspire more companies to follow suit.<br/><br/>While such individual ground-up efforts are important, we can make even greater progress by forging partnerships with like-minded partners.<br/><br/>The challenges of climate change are multi-faceted - from understanding climate science, to changing the behaviours and preferences of everyone.<br/><br/>To innovate and tackle these challenges, we will need to bring together the multiple perspectives of experts in a wide range of areas including science, technology, business, and social sciences.<br/><br/>The SSA fosters such partnerships by providing a convenient physical space, and curating a calendar of events, to bring these stakeholders together.<br/><br/>Onsite partners like the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS), UN Global Compact Network Singapore (GCNS), World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), CDP, GRI and Ocean Geographics add additional expertise to these engagements.<br/><br/>Today, as we inaugurate the new SSA Annex, let me highlight two areas of achievements by the SSA.<br/><br/>First, the SSA has done well to raise public awareness on sustainability and mobilise collective action, by bringing together efforts across the Public, Private and People sectors.<br/><br/>For example, the Second Public Consultation for the Good Samaritan Food Donation Bill was held at the SSA earlier this year, and MP Mr Louis Ng presented his draft bill to reduce food waste for public input.<br/><br/>Similarly, talks and workshops at the SSA have helped demystify topics such as carbon accounting and reporting, the circular economy, biodiversity, decarbonisation and climate adaptation.<br/><br/>So with an expanded SSA Annex, we can expect more of such initiatives from CDL and your partners!<br/><br/>Second, SSA has helped corporates to transform and incorporate sustainability into their business models and practices.<br/><br/>Companies often have a substantial impact on the environment across their industrial processes, supply chains, and product life cycles.<br/><br/>But not all of them have the resources or expertise to understand sustainability issues, especially our SMEs.</p><p>Many companies also struggle to navigate global environmental regulations.<br/><br/>So, while companies should naturally compete in the business field, they will also benefit by working together to pool expertise and share their experiences on challenges that everyone is facing.<br/><br/>This is the spirit behind the Industry Transformation Maps or ITMs - with sustainability being a core pillar across each of the 23 ITMs in ITM 2.0.<br/><br/>We must help our companies and workers build up a strong foundation of sustainability knowledge and skills.<br/><br/>The SSA has contributed to this over the years, by hosting talks and trainings at the SSA to build capacity among our companies on green buildings, nature conservation and the adoption of sustainable energy.<br/><br/>These are conducted with partners like the Singapore Environment Council, SEAS, the Nature Society, the World Green Building Council and the Singapore Green Building Council.<br/><br/>Similarly, under the Enterprise Sustainability Programme, Enterprise Singapore works with partners like GCNS to equip companies with skills like carbon accounting and greenhouse gas management.<br/><br/>Such training courses not only allow companies to tap on expertise from qualified trainers, but also helps them network and learn from each other.<br/><br/>In turn, these new skills position our companies and workers to better seize new opportunities in a carbon-constrained world.<br/><br/>To seize such new opportunities, our focus in Singapore must go beyond training and capacity building, to working with companies to develop, innovate and scale up climate solutions.<br/><br/>These solutions can help us achieve our targets under the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, by bringing down emissions in the buildings and real estate sector, which contribute to some 20% of Singapore's carbon emissions.<br/><br/>The Green Buildings Innovation Cluster Programme, or GBIC, has been an important platform to bring together different stakeholders to innovate and develop such solutions to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings.<br/><br/>These stakeholders include our Autonomous Universities and Research Institutions, building owners such as JTC and CDL, and building solution providers like ST Engineering and Building Systems Diagnostics (BSD).<br/><br/>Under our National Research Foundation RIE 2021-25, we are devoting $28 bil to our R&amp;D efforts. One of the four big domains in our R&amp;D efforts is on Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS). Under our USS R&amp;D programme, we have a range of interesting research that is ongoing in our universities as well as in the research institutes, including how AI and sustainability could be complementary.<br/><br/>GBIC also supports the Super Low Energy Building Smart Hub, which includes a database of technologies undergoing testing in Singapore.</p><p>I had seen some examples of these low-carbon building materials and energy-efficient designs when I visited NUS's College of Design and Engineering.<br/><br/>So I encourage everyone here to contribute to our innovation ecosystem, and be part of the solution.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me conclude.<br/><br/>We need to take urgent action to reduce global emissions, and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>We must all do our part, and work together to pool our resources and expertise, and support each other to achieve our sustainability objectives.<br/><br/>So as we inaugurate this new Annex, let us use this space to:<br/><br/>i. push the boundaries of sustainability thinking;<br/><br/>ii. work together to mobilise collective action;<br/><br/>iii. help our companies transform and embrace sustainability; and<br/><br/>iv. develop innovative solutions that can be scaled to serve the region and beyond.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Sherman and the CDL team on the launch of the Annex!

Or by voters, who do not seem to care about climate change.</p><p> The CSDS-Lokniti 2024 pre-poll survey indicates that Indian voters are primarily concerned with unemployment and inflation.</p><p> Anthropocentric world viewA detailed review of the election manifestos revealed that, except for the regional party Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam, none of the major political parties in India have concrete grassroots-level plans to mitigate the impact of climate change.</p><p>India's electoral scene features only a modest and oblique reflection of issues related to climate change. </p><p> In forest-adjoining areas throughout the country, it is sincreasingly common for wild animals to enter human settlements and cause damage. This is mostly caused by food and water shortages in summer, and alterations in wildlife habitats because of climate change.</p><p> In the Wayanad constituency where Congress leader Rahul Gandhi is contesting, human-wildlife conflicts have already become a hot electoral issue.</p><p> A poster on a street wall in a village on the Kerala-Tamil Nadu border read: \"It is the people who vote in elections, not the animals that are encroaching into human settlements. Stop animal rule!\"</p><p> Such sentiment arises from a prevalent anthropocentric world view, where the state forest and wildlife departments are criticised for prioritising animals over human beings.</p><p> In Lok Sabha constituencies in the Western Ghats, the authors observed that environmental concerns hardly influence electoral politics, despite the fact that the daily lives of people in those regions are closely intertwined with nature.</p><p> Perhaps the best illustration of this would be the popular protests a decade ago, against the Madhav Gadgil-K Kasturirangan committee reports. These reports aimed at safeguarding the ecologically fragile Western Ghats, a 1,600 km-long mountain range from Gujarat to Tamil Nadu, by restricting human construction and certain types of agriculture.</p><p> The inhabitants of the Western Ghats, which is identified as one of the world's eight \"hottest hotspots\" of biological diversity, managed to win a Lok Sabha seat in the 2014 election with the support of Left parties, and succeeded in stopping the committee's pro-environment recommendations from being implemented. </p><p> Even though the Western Ghats are one of the worst-hit areas in terms of climate change-triggered casualties, especially from landslides and agricultural loss, the electoral politics of the region largely revolve around conventional issues.</p><p> The attitude in the Western Ghats is in stark contrast to Europe, which votes in early June to elect the next European Parliament. A poll conducted by Euronews and Ipsos in 18 countries found that 52 per cent of voters prioritise the fight against climate change over other issues.</p><p> The so-called \"climate voters\" in Europe are mostly young people. One of the hot topics during elections is the European Green Deal, which aims to make the continent climate-neutral by 2050.</p><p> A World Wide Fund for Nature survey showed that European political parties are particularly focused on combating climate change, as they \"shared support for ending fossil fuel use, transitioning to 100 per cent renewable energy and adopting nature-based solutions to tackle climate change\".</p><p> In Europe, green parties that have been actively pushing environmental issues since the 1970s now hold a major share of the vote in many countries, and are putting the climate agenda at the forefront of elections. </p><p> While not a key issue in the Lok Sabha elections, more extreme temperatures have begun to establish new standards for how Indian voters engage with and assess candidates during campaigning.</p><p> An incident encountered during fieldwork in a Lok Sabha constituency in South India, where there is a tight contest between two high-net-worth candidates from the Indian National Congress and the Bharatiya Janata Party, illustrates this. A fruit seller devised his own \"political thermometer\" to compare candidates based on their body language during roadshows. </p><p> This campaign tool is less popular in the 2024 general elections due to rising temperatures.</p><p> \"Just look at his downcast face, wearied under the sunlight. Is this AC (air-conditioned)-living guy going to speak for us in parliament? Two days ago, the other candidate passed through this junction in an open jeep. As he did during previous elections, he stood energetically despite the scorching heat, raising his hands to the people with a smile,\" he said. </p><p> In another constituency, people held high regard for an MP who spent hours wearing a local costume and coordinating rescue operations during floods.</p><p> Conservative electoral landscapeAmid the climate crisis, the long-held expectation for any Indian politician to \"be with the people\" now also encompasses standing with them through their lived experiences of climate change.  </p><p> However, Indian democracy is yet to breed a new category of climate voters as its electoral landscape is still conservative, with practically very little space for environmental politics or green agendas. 360INFO</p><p> Sajan Thomas teaches political science at St John's College, Anchal, India, which is affiliated with the University of Kerala.

Another edition of the World Economic Forum (WEF) has come to an end -- but what have we learnt? </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Compared with a year ago, the world seems a somewhat different place. Right before the start of the gathering in Davos, WEF released its annual Global Risks Report, effectively a survey of some 1,500 global leaders across business, academia, government and others. Last year, the cost-of-living crisis topped the near-term concerns, alongside nature risks and geo-economic confrontation. This year, the tone is different. \"Misinformation and disinformation\" led the list of near-term fears, with \"societal polarisation\" not far behind. </p><p> In a year in which some four billion people are eligible to vote in an election, conversations at Davos struck a markedly more geopolitical tone. Among the first to open this year of elections, Taiwan has already gone to the polls to vote through a third term of the ruling government, while the United States election will take centre stage later in the year. Markets remain undecided on the outcome, even as discussions on geopolitical conflicts seeped their way into the Davos formal and informal nightcap sessions.</p><p> One thing remains unchanged. While perceptions of near-term risks have shifted, nature risks top the 10-year outlook. Extreme weather events, critical changes to Earth's systems and biodiversity loss head the list of concerns. And with good reason. 2023 was, like the preceding year, the warmest year on record. At a nature dinner organised by Lombard Odier to kick off the week in Davos, Professor Johan Rockstrom reminded the audience that it is now inevitable that the world will overshoot the key 1.5 degree Celsius target, with a best outcome likely seeing increases to at least 1.7 deg C or 1.8 deg C in the coming decades, before we have a hope of returning to the 1.5 deg C target.</p><p> On the Promenade, a central road running through Davos, the sustainability billboards have largely disappeared. Instead, discussions on how to tackle transitions to net zero and, increasingly, a nature-positive economy, have moved from the outdoor signboards to panel discussions and fireside encounters. </p><p> Virtue-signalling is no longer the name of the game; figuring out who has the right strategy and partnerships to quickly adopt cleaner, greener and more efficient business models that can disrupt entire industries is the new play in town. A lone billboard that still declares \"sustainability is just a few steps away!\" feels eerily out of place. Inside the improvised meeting rooms that transform a skiing village into a meeting place for the global who's who, it is all too clear that these transitions will be far from easy, but may yet allow those with the right strategy to leapfrog forward.</p><p> Getting behind AIOutside, other billboards vie for attention. Replacing the proclamations of net-zero commitments are the new signs advertising each business' respective breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI). A year ago, the sudden emergence of generative AI was already the word on the snowy streets of Davos. In 2024, AI and discussions on its myriad disruptive effects were on the agenda everywhere. The shift in advertising focus from sustainability to AI is perhaps a sensible one: one represents the challenge, whereas digitally enabled optimisation and innovation may well be a central part of the solution. </p><p> Besides AI, the wooden interiors of the Davos chalets and meeting rooms perhaps provided an appropriate setting for the other topic that ascended up the WEF agenda: nature. From sessions on risks to the global food system, to a heavily over-subscribed \"nature positive dinner\", WEF participants sought to come to grips with an inevitable and increasingly clear realisation: for all the maladies and opportunities facing the global economy, the economy is vitally dependent on the ecosystem services provided by natural capital, the world's single most productive asset. </p><p> The solutions too are beginning to emerge. Recognising the not-so-hidden value of nature is but a mere first step. Encouraging markets to adequately value and allocate capital to its preservation and restoration is the much greater challenge. Shortly before Davos, the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures announced that an initial cohort of 320 businesses had signed up to its much-awaited framework aiming to drive the disclosure of nature risks and opportunities. In other roundtables, financial institutions looking to engage on nature recognised that allocation capital to nature-based solutions at scale, in fact, requires us to reconsider asset allocations -- with nature emerging as a new asset class. </p><p> At Lombard Odier's own \"re-nature\" dinner, speakers and the audience explored opportunities to put theory into action, highlighting investment opportunities around the development of regenerative value chains. Coffee is a US$225 billion example, dominated by production from tropical monocultures, often characterised by falling yields and degraded soils, and with as much as half of all coffee production at risk from climate change. Transforming extractive models to ones based on agroforestry and rewilding, and a shortening of value chains to consumers, may be part of the solution to begin to drive more capital to nature at speed and scale. </p><p> Keeping up with a fast-moving worldSo in the end, did Davos 2024 change the world? Perhaps that would be too high an expectation. The world is moving quickly, and perhaps the business community assembled at Davos was struggling to keep up. But, in a year where concern over misinformation and societal cohesion is rife, this year's theme of Rebuilding Trust appeared well-chosen. According to the Edelman Trust Barometer released just before the event, global levels of trust in institutions and leaders have been on the decline, but businesses today are more trusted than government leaders. With innovation and new global challenges facing business leaders and investors, maintaining that trust requires a balancing act. </p><p> To investors, there are plenty of takeaways. Transitions to a decarbonised economy are accelerating. Parallel concerns over energy security, energy affordability and clean energy all point to the single solution of a further ramp-up in investment in new energy systems. Transformation of value chains to more regenerative alternatives will drive investment to new technologies, business models and nature-based solutions. AI will accelerate all of these transitions, enabling solutions that outcompete existing alternatives in terms of efficiency, environmental impact and financial returns.

However, while most people say they love plants, they claim they do not have time to care for them or have a green thumb.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Plants are living things. It's not like a piece of furniture where we can put it in a corner and be done with it,\" says Veeraghanta. \"We discovered that service and maintenance were the two biggest bugbears for most people.\"</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">She founded Naturethings amid Covid in April 2021 as a \"nature-as-a-service\" platform to help clients care for and maintain their plants. The platform uses services supported by artificial intelligence (AI) to cater to the needs of end-users in urban settings.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A WhatsApp chatbot would give regular check-ups and health scans of the plants. Naturethings also added programmes that built daily habits around interacting with green spaces.</p><p>From there, Naturethings evolved into an online marketplace to enable people to shop for goods and services related to plants and plant care, including expert advice on plant maintenance and design consultation via WhatsApp video calls. Given the community of over 15,000 followers and active users of the platform, the AI was able to learn fast.</p><p>Founding team</p><p>When the clients of Naturethings returned to the office after Covid restrictions were lifted, there was an increased demand from corporates to introduce green spaces into their offices. That laid the foundation for the current iteration of Naturethings' B2B (business-to-business) platform.</p><p>As Naturethings evolved, others became convinced of its business model and joined the company. One of the first to join the founding team was Ashwin Dhanasri, Veeraghanta's college friend from Jawaharlal Nehru Technological University. Based in Hyderabad, India, Dhanasari joined the company as CTO in 2021, and is building the digital twin technology for Naturethings.</p><p>Veeraghanta's brother, Pavan Veeraghanta, a construction and sustainability leader in the UAE, was initially an adviser to the company as it moved into the commercial real estate space. Based in Dubai, he has been involved in 150 construction and real estate services projects, the latest being Dubai's Museum of the Future. To build the operations and sustainability charter, he quit his full-time job to join Naturethings as COO in 2022. While he continues to be based in Dubai, he has set up a secondary base in Singapore.</p><p>Last year, when Naturethings moved upstream from maintenance to landscape design, Veeraghanta was introduced to Kenneth Lim, a Singaporean tech professional and self-taught landscape designer and horticulturist.</p><p>Lim founded SyncScape in 2007 to undertake landscape design projects. Since then, he has designed the gardens of over 100 houses across Singapore, from terraced houses to Good Class Bungalows. \"Doing such projects energises me,\" he says. \"There's a spiritual side to plants because there's a connection between humans and plants.\"</p><p>Bridge between tech and nature</p><p>For the last 27 years, Lim has been working in the tech sector. \"Traditionally, people in horticulture know little about tech, and people in tech know little about plants. I'm the natural bridge between the tech and natural worlds.\"</p><p>He has found the right fit in Naturethings, where he came on board as the latest member of the founding team and the head of design in 2023. Before, Lim was already a consultant for corporate clients on landscaping issues, but on an ad hoc basis. A particular 314-room, 27-storey hotel downtown was completed in 2016, and the owner was concerned that the green fa\u00e7ade looked patchy even after several years. Lim was brought in as a consultant.</p><p>When inspecting the property, he immediately saw the issue: the intervals between the planter boxes for the facade grilles were too wide. Lim's solution was to insert additional planter box layers of green in between, so instead of intervals of four levels, it was every two levels. The previous variety of plants grew downwards instead of upwards, creating these bald patches. He, therefore, chose plants that climbed upwards. The result? \"The fa\u00e7ade is now very green,\" declares Lim. \"It's no longer patchy.\"</p><p>Generational gardeners</p><p>Lim has also found a kindred spirit in Veeraghanta, as their interest in plants and gardens was passed through the generations: Lim's through his grandfather and father, and Veeraghanta's through her great-grandmother and grandmothers.</p><p>Veeraghanta's great-grandmother had a PhD in Botany and recently passed away at 103. Her maternal grandmother was an urban farmer who \"cooked using everything she grew in her garden\".</p><p>Her paternal grandmother had a vast garden, and her interest lay in flowers, specifically those associated with religious rituals. \"Her house was always open, so people could come in and pluck the flowers from her garden for those rituals,\" recalls Veeraghanta. \"It was like a neighbourhood community gathering place.\"</p><p>However, Veeraghanta followed a different path. After she graduated from business school in India, she took up leadership roles at multinational companies such as Procter &amp; Gamble, Tata Group and lastly, LVMH's Mo\u00ebt Hennessy Diageo in 2017. She was initially based in Jakarta but later relocated to Kuala Lumpur. After over two years with the French multinational firm, she left and moved to Singapore in January 2020, at the start of Covid.</p><p>In July 2020, she was selected to join Antler as an \"entrepreneur in residence\". She had made a pitch to Antler on a version of Naturethings, and after several iterations, she met some of her early ex-founder friends. But her idea for the business has evolved since then.</p><p>Digital twin technology</p><p>Naturethings has been engaged to provide landscaping and biophilic design in the offices of a Fortune 500 corporate real estate services firm in Paya Lebar Quarter (PLQ) Tower 3 and at Six Battery Road in Singapore. As these are actual workplaces, \"the users' primary goal is not to come in and admire the greenery\", says Veeraghanta. \"We want to understand how greenery can contribute to productivity and the corporate ESG goals.\"</p><p>The firm created a digital twin of the office spaces for the corporate client. The plants were also installed with sensors. A digital twin replicates what is happening on the physical site, and the model is helpful, as clients can monitor everything on their dashboard, says Veeraghanta. \"We can already track the density and biodiversity on the site.\"</p><p>Using the digital twin of the space, Naturethings was able to \"deploy optimal evidence-based green solutions at each of the eight zones [of the office at PLQ3], bringing in a high degree of confidence in managing the maintenance via sensors linked to the AI models\", she adds.</p><p>The most significant change is in the communal area, where the low set of plants behind the sofa seats have been removed and deployed elsewhere. Instead, there are now corners with a profusion of plants.</p><p>Naturethings has also created seasonality in the eight zones of the office. \"The office occupants will be able to feel the innate changes in mood and vibrancy coming from how the plants and trees change with the seasons,\" says Veeraghanta.</p><p>Over time, the AI will be able to capture spatial data and augment human action in terms of the maintenance of the plants. She adds: \"In the future, our clients can leave the monitoring and tracking of plant health to us, and focus on managing the overall health of their spaces and the well-being of their employees.\"</p><p>Hospitality sector</p><p>Beyond the commercial space, Veeraghanta also sees potential for such greening in the hospitality sector. Lucrum Capital is in talks with Naturethings to pilot its digital twin technology to manage and optimise the maintenance of the green spaces in the upcoming 115-room Mama Shelter Singapore hotel. Naturethings will also manage the urban farm on the rooftop, including experiences such as farm-to-table and farm-to-bar concepts.</p><p>Naturethings was the Start-up winner of the Insead Business as a Force for Good Award 2024. \"As a tech company, we are a pioneer in urban nature-based solutions,\" says Veeraghanta. \"We see our role as enabling a dated, fragmented industry of biophilic design and landscaping to leapfrog into the 21st century.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBB-C8N1-DYX1-V00G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1385\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Edge Publishing PTE.

million to help those in the financial services sector pick up new skills to better serve sustainable financing demands in the region. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> More than 50,000 people in jobs from sales to risk, compliance and legal, will have new sustainable finance-related job tasks added to their critical work functions, from a \"moderate to high degree\", according to a study commissioned by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and Institute of Banking and Finance Singapore (IBF). </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This comes as the sustainable finance market in Asean is expected to amount to $4 trillion to $5 trillion in the next decade, with financial institutions playing a key role in helping to catalyse the transformation needed.</p><p> The largest demand drivers behind the region's sustainable financing needs are the energy, and construction and real estate sectors, such as deploying renewable energy, electricity distribution and the greening of commercial buildings. </p><p> Speaking at the launch of the Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map at the Ecosperity conference on April 17, Minister of State for Trade and Industry Alvin Tan said: \"If Singapore is to be Asia's leading sustainable finance hub, we must equip our workforce to be ahead of complex and fast-evolving sustainable finance-related issues and opportunities.\"</p><p> Therefore, Singapore's financial services sector workforce should aim to acquire new skills within the next three years to seize these available opportunities, MAS, IBF and Workforce Singapore said on April 17.  </p><p> Mr Tan noted that more than 25 financial institutions in Singapore are already planning to upskill their staff over the next three years.</p><p> According to the Jobs Transformation Map report by KPMG Singapore, some 20 unique job roles, particularly those in sales and relationship management, have been identified as high-priority roles for upskilling. </p><p> For instance, a relationship manager in corporate banking will have to know the decarbonisation pathways for certain sectors, and how sustainable finance instruments like green bonds work, to be able to explain these to his client. </p><p> The report also anticipates that about 4,000 to 5,000 new sustainable finance-related jobs will be required over the next decade, ranging from sustainability risk to sustainable strategy. </p><p> This comes as financial institutions are increasingly prioritising sustainability as a core business strategy for their organisations. </p><p> \"Specialised and deep sustainable finance skill sets will be required to perform these job roles,\" the report added.  </p><p> To help develop these sustainability finance specialists over the next three years, MAS said it has set aside $35 million in the Financial Sector Development Fund to support professionals in acquiring these new skills. </p><p> One of the top technical skills required for sustainable finance is climate change management -- where one is able to ensure that climate risks are integrated into a firm's wider risk management strategy, and identify opportunities to develop products that support climate change mitigation and adaptation. </p><p> One must also be able to effectively and accurately measure sustainability outcomes from investments and financial products. </p><p> Institutes of higher learning will be expanding their suite of sustainable finance courses. </p><p> For instance, more than 65 new executive courses will be made available in 2024, conducted by institutes like the Singapore Green Finance Centre, which was launched by Singapore Management University and Imperial College London, as well as the Sustainable and Green Finance Institute at the National University of Singapore (NUS). This builds on a base of more than 100 such courses available currently.</p><p> The Singapore Green Finance Centre has launched three online courses on sustainability stewardship, carbon markets and sustainable investment management targeted at mid-career professionals looking to pivot into the space. </p><p> A fourth online course, which is an introduction to sustainability and sustainable finance with a focus on Asia, will be made available to the public for free in a bid to raise awareness among them.</p><p> Two new undergraduate programmes on sustainable finance will also be developed by Nanyang Technological University (NTU) and NUS.  </p><p> NTU's bachelor of accounting in sustainable management will be available for enrolment from August 2024.  </p><p> Ms Nikki Kemp, executive director of the Singapore Green Finance Centre, is hoping to collaborate across different universities here to offer a wider variety of training courses, particularly in nature-based solutions and climate science, as these are emerging areas of focus in the finance sector. </p><p> She also hopes for more resources to be poured into developing the academic capacity locally to support more such courses in future. </p><p> Meanwhile, the Asia Centre of Carbon Excellence was launched on April 17 to help bring together a group of international experts focused on innovative and novel carbon project development, carbon policy and capacity-building.</p><p> Launched jointly by climate consultancy South Pole and Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero, the core focus of the centre is to unlock new approaches to mitigate global greenhouse gas emissions as quickly as possible.</p><p> For instance, in the near term, the centre will look at using carbon credits to scale up and commercialise the use of green hydrogen, which is thought to be a clean fuel as it does not produce any planet-warming emissions when burned.</p><p> The centre will also help support governments and businesses on using carbon markets to meet their national climate targets under the 2015 Paris Agreement.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>photo: MAS</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-018TIOE</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BTR-8501-JCF2-802K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"949\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Over three days, April 15 to 17, a mining giant guilty of destroying sacred land and carbon market players who were accused of fraudulent projects spoke alongside some of the biggest names in finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Last December's COP28 called for countries to lay the groundwork for a swift, just and equitable transition through urgent emission cuts and scaled-up financing. Through panels, presentations and partner events, Ecosperity Week 2024 furthered the conversation on Southeast Asia's renewable energy transition, blended finance and voluntary carbon markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu kicked off the week by announcing the launch of an emissions registry to aid businesses in their sustainability reporting. This comes as listed companies and large non-listed companies will be required to issue climate-related disclosures in FY2025 and FY2027 respectively.</p><p>Launched by the Singapore Business Federation in partnership with the Agency for Science, Technology and Research, PwC and Singtel, the Singapore Emissions Factors Registry will have a database of \"emissions factors\" tailored to Singapore's context. These will translate various business activities into corresponding greenhouse gas emissions. The registry is set to be launched by the end of 2024.</p><p>\"By requiring companies to disclose climate-related data, such as carbon emissions, we can increase market transparency and empower businesses to take greater ownership of their sustainability performances,\" said Fu. \"This data also allows consumers, investors and financiers to make more informed choices in their purchases and investments, directing finance to businesses with strong sustainability practices.\"</p><p>On the sidelines, a framework to guide private equity climate investing in Asia was launched by Fullerton Fund Management and the United Nations Development Programme. Fullerton is part of Seviora, an asset management group owned by Temasek.</p><p>Sustainable finance jobs</p><p>Over the next decade, Asean's sustainable finance market will amount to between $4 trillion and $5 trillion. More than 50,000 professionals in the financial services sector will face sustainable finance-related tasks. In particular, relationship managers and portfolio managers are among 20 job roles that will need urgent upskilling in sustainability.</p><p>That is according to the Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map study conducted by KPMG Singapore. In the study released on April 17, KPMG projects that about 4,000 to 5,000 new sustainable finance-related jobs will be created in Singapore over the next decade.</p><p>The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) announced on April 17 that it will set aside $35 million to support upskilling, reskilling and the development of specialists in sustainable finance over the next three years. Announced in conjunction with the study's findings, the amount will go towards the central bank's Financial Sector</p><p>Development Fund (FSDF).</p><p>Students can also opt for two undergraduate programmes focused on sustainable finance. Nanyang Technological University's new Bachelor of Accounting in Sustainability Management programme will accept its first cohort in August. Meanwhile, the National University of Singapore will introduce a sustainable finance specialisation within its business school \"in the near future\".</p><p>For working professionals, more than 65 new executive courses and a new executive masters in sustainable finance will be launched this year by various institutes.</p><p>MAS committed $400 million in grants and funding towards the FSDF in September 2022, when it unveiled its updated Financial Services Industry Transformation Map. That sum will go towards increasing the number of locals taking on more senior jobs within the sector.</p><p>Then, MAS projected that the financial sector would grow between 4% and 5% per year from 2021 to 2025, creating between 3,000 and 4,000 jobs each year.</p><p>DBS CEO weighs in</p><p>Getting the region to switch to green power is a costly and risky business, said DBS group CEO Piyush Gupta. These include high costs from upgrading grid infrastructure, integrating battery storage with the grid to tackle intermittency issues typical of renewable energy sources and the cost of land to build these renewable energy power plants.</p><p>Speaking on a panel on April 15, Gupta also highlighted risk premiums like currency volatility. As political regimes change, there is also uncertainty over the price off-takers would pay, he added. \"It's not easy for advanced countries to put these costs into their budgets.\"</p><p>Instead, Gupta believes blended finance and the carbon markets offer solutions to enable the private sector to channel funds from the Global North to the Global South. \"There are a whole bunch of different issues, which make financing not straightforward,\" said Gupta. \"Having said that, refinancing is available.\"</p><p>As at Dec 31, 2023, DBS has committed $70 billion worth of sustainable financing commitments, net of repayments, up 37.3% y-o-y.</p><p>\"For all countries, it's sometimes a hard choice,\" said Gupta. \"It's a choice between economic development for the people and sustainability. If anybody said that there is no compromise or trade-offs, they're kidding. If you're an elected government of a country with a democratic vote, you have to think: 'What do my people vote for? And therefore, how do I make the trade-off work in a sensible way?'\"</p><p>Don't forget about mining: Rio Tinto chairman</p><p>Falling investments in the global mining sector are putting the global energy transition at risk, said Rio Tinto chairman Dominic Barton on a critical minerals panel. Minerals like copper have seen a widening supply gap, driving up prices amid geopolitical uncertainty.</p><p>These minerals are at the cornerstone of the renewable energy transition, as they form key components in wind turbines, electrical grids and electric vehicles. But their supply hinges on the mining industry's reckoning with their social and environmental practices.</p><p>Some years ago, British-Australian mining giant Rio Tinto was mired in a series of sexual harassment scandals. Its controversies also extended to environmental issues. Barton took over as chairman in 2022 after Rio Tinto was caught destroying 46,000-year-old rock shelters in Western Australia, which were considered sacred by Aboriginal communities. \"It was just terrible; it was deeply embarrassing and it had very significant consequences,\" said Barton.</p><p>Barton, who is also chairman of impact investor LeapFrog Investments, spoke about the company's need for transparency in a bid to build trust and persuade the public of the role it plays in decarbonisation. \"The challenge for the industry is to be seen as part of the solution and not part of the problem.\"</p><p>Nature in focus</p><p>Under the theme of \"Renewing our vibrant spring\", nature featured prominently in this year's main conference. Razan Al Mubarak, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, urged delegates to boost investment in nature-based solutions and integrate nature into climate transition plans.</p><p>In her recorded opening address, the UN Climate Change High-Level Champion for COP28 told attendees to adopt deforestation policies and science-based targets. \"Assess and disclose your impacts and your dependencies on nature. The standards and frameworks now exist to enable action and incorporate these considerations in investment processes.\"</p><p>The most prominent standard comes from the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), which published in September 2023 its inaugural risk management and disclosure framework.</p><p>Emily McKenzie, technical director at the TNFD, said there is \"increasing recognition\" that nature risks are \"no longer a corporate social responsibility issue\". \"This is a central, core risk management issue, just like climate change, and it needs to come to the heart of strategy, of governance and risk and opportunity management.\"</p><p>The TNFD framework's 14 disclosure recommendations are divided across four pillars - governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. They aim to inform better decision-making by companies and capital providers, and ultimately contribute to a shift in global financial flows towards \"nature-positive outcomes\".</p><p>By January in Davos, there were already 320 early adopters, said McKenzie. \"I'm delighted by the uptake in this region - 42% of those early adopters are in Asia, with very strong uptake in Japan.\"</p><p>Singapore-listed food and agri-business Olam Group was one of the first movers in Singapore. Olam Agri has committed to release TNFD-aligned disclosures by 2025. Sunny Verghese, CEO of Olam International, said: \"Nature is not external to us, for businesses, for economies, for societies and communities [and] for the financial systems. Nature is embedded and intrinsic to this.\"</p><p>Verghese's comments reveal how quickly the conversation has progressed in a matter of years. A video aired on April 15 commemorating 10 years of Ecosperity Week conferences included his comments from 2021, where he said executives like him had committed to emissions reduction targets, but \"not one of us has a clue of how we are going to get there\". Today, those targets have advanced from counting emissions to accounting for nature.</p><p>Carbon players bounce back</p><p>That said, corporates may be more interested in nature-based solutions and the issuance of carbon credits. GenZero, Temasek's decarbonisation-focused investment firm, held the second edition of the GenZero Climate Summit as a partner event to Ecosperity Week, featuring panels on the carbon markets, climate tech and legal developments within the sector.</p><p>On April 17, Swiss carbon finance consultancy South Pole partnered its minority investor GenZero to launch the Asia Centre of Carbon Excellence (ACCE), with support from the Singapore Economic Development Board.</p><p>The ACCE will focus on thought leadership and policy advisory, collaborating with regional corporations and governments to explore carbon projects in Asia and globally.</p><p>South Pole did not participate in GenZero's main conference on April 16, which saw an afternoon of panels featuring fellow carbon market players Verra and Gold Standard, as well as representatives from the Integrity Council for the Voluntary Carbon Market (ICVCM) and the Voluntary Carbon Markets Integrity Initiative (VCMI).</p><p>Last year, a slew of media expos\u00e9s accused these carbon credit players of overstating the actual environmental impact of their products. Key players are now looking to rehabilitate their image after the CEOs of Verra and South Pole both resigned in</p><p>2023.</p><p>Margaret Kim, CEO of Gold Standard since 2019, veered on the defensive in her opening keynote, saying it is the \"entire ecosystem that has to change, from supply to demand\". \"We love debating over things. We love clickbait titles. But are we doing this to put positive pressure on actors to act with high integrity? Or are we doing it because it's just human nature to debate?\"</p><p>In a subsequent panel, representatives from VCMI and ICVCM managed to evade a question about the Science Based Targets initiative's (SBTi) controversial move earlier this month to approve carbon credits for Scope 3 emissions.</p><p>SBTi, formed after the signing of the Paris Agreement in 2015, is considered the most stringent criterion. Companies with SBTi-validated targets are said to be aligned with the goal of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels. Until April, the SBTi had not allowed companies to use carbon credits to offset their emissions.</p><p>The ICVCM focuses on the sellers in the voluntary carbon market, and - through a new benchmark launched in April - validates the integrity of carbon credit certifiers like Gold Standard and ACR, formerly the American Carbon Registry.</p><p>Meanwhile, the VCMI focuses on the buyers, and is involved with the integrity of the claims made by individuals and businesses buying carbon credits.</p><p>Mark Kenber, executive director at VCMI, acknowledged that \"there's been a lot of turmoil in the carbon markets over the last year because of scrutiny of projects\". \"We welcome that; we need that scrutiny, if that makes us all perform better. It enables people to see where things are failing, but also where things are succeeding.\"</p><p>But he added: \"The press, of course, don't publish the stories about 'This was a great project' because it's not as newsworthy.\"</p><p>Philanthropy takes centrestage</p><p>Temasek Trust's Philanthropy Asia Alliance (PAA) moved its annual Philanthropy Asia Summit ahead to coincide with Ecosperity Week this year. The fourth edition was held just six months after the previous summit, during which PAA was formally launched, said CEO Lim Seok Hui in her welcome remarks.</p><p>On the opening day, the conference unveiled a new digital impact marketplace initiated by Temasek Trust. It showcases a pipeline of early-stage businesses, charitable organisations and blended finance projects with \"strong impact potential\".</p><p>Temasek Trust, DBS Foundation and UBS Optimus Foundation announced on April 15 their strategic partnership to build Co-Axis, a \"digital catalytic capital marketplace\" that currently features over 70 curated impact opportunities from more than 40</p><p>countries.</p><p>By connecting them to funders like family offices, corporate entities, philanthropists, high-net-worth individuals and private foundations, the platform aims to help scale impact innovations that are tackling global sustainability challenges.</p><p>Former UK Prime Minister Tony Blair received top billing at the conference, where he spoke about his work at the non-profit Tony Blair Institute for Global Change. \"Government, in the end, has so much more power than anyone else, if it uses that power constructively. What philanthropy can do is work alongside the government to show it what could work and then can partner with at the local level in order to introduce change.\"</p><p>The best philanthropy, according to Blair, is the philanthropy that \"in the end, is sustainable over time, even when the philanthropic dollars stop\". \"In other words, it introduces systemic change.\"</p><p>Blair - post-war UK's second-longest-serving prime minister after Margaret Thatcher - also quipped about his decade at Downing Street, which ended in 2007. \"Ten years is quite a long time to be in government. I always say to people that you start at your most popular and least capable, and then you end at your most capable and your least popular.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BVX-FWG1-JCF0-4008-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2427\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Edge Publishing PTE.

However, it faces a narrow window of opportunity to step up green investment to rein in the rapid growth of greenhouse gas emissions that are driving climate change, says the report by Bain &amp; Company, GenZero, Standard Chartered and Temasek. </p><p> Titled South-east Asia's Green Economy 2024 -- Moving The Needle, the report outlines a range of opportunities for the region to cut greenhouse gas emissions and meet national climate targets, while also improving energy and food security. What is missing is US$1.5 trillion in finance, policy incentives and regional cooperation to make this happen, according to the authors. </p><p> A key theme of the report is that many of the green investments can be deployed now and rapidly scaled up to make a real difference in cutting planet-warming emissions that are also causing air pollution across the region. </p><p> \"In South-east Asia, we're seeing opportunities that are extremely actionable in the near term,\" said Ms Kimberly Tan, head of investments at GenZero, an investment platform founded by Temasek that is focused on accelerating decarbonisation. \"We believe that investments into the green economy could generate as much US$300 billion in annual revenues by 2030.\"</p><p> Nature and agriculture, transport and power generation represent US$220 billion of the total revenues. For example, investments in sustainable rice cultivation could cut water use and emissions of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Nature-based solutions such as protecting rainforests and replanting mangroves could suck planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2) out of the air while benefiting local communities -- mangroves are excellent fish nurseries and protect coastlines from storms. </p><p> Ramping up deployment of wind, solar and battery storage could help the region cut its reliance on coal and gas for power generation, while mandates on energy efficiency in buildings could also reduce electricity demand growth.</p><p> These are among 13 investable ideas across four sectorial themes: nature and agriculture, power generation, transport and buildings highlighted by the report, which was released on the sidelines of Ecosperity Week 2024 at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.</p><p> But the financing gap remains vast. The report says green investments in the region rose 20 per cent year on year in 2023 to US$6.3 billion. But this is a fraction of the US$1.5 trillion needed to accelerate South-east Asia's green transition and to meet its 2030 climate pledges under the United Nations Paris climate agreement. </p><p> Mr Dale Hardcastle, director of the global sustainability innovation centre at Bain &amp; Company, told a media briefing on April 11: \"Immense potential exists to accelerate the energy transition and build the green economy. We need to start with what we can do here and now, and not miss the opportunity at hand.\"</p><p> The region's 10 economies are rapidly growing and will need major investments in energy, especially renewable energy for power generation, in the decades ahead. </p><p> For instance, the 7th Asean Energy Outlook, a 2022 report by the Asean Centre for Energy, estimates that electricity generation capacity will more than double between 2025 and 2050 based on the region's current climate policies. Total energy-related greenhouse gas emissions will also double by 2050 to four billion tonnes of CO2 equivalent. </p><p> But with the jump in emissions come growing climate risks, notes the report, with Asean already one of the regions highly vulnerable to increasing heat, more intense storms and floods, and rising sea levels. </p><p> By 2030, the region needs to cut emissions by a total of 2.4 billion tonnes of CO2-equivalent if it is to meet national climate pledges, the report says. </p><p> Asked what is holding the region back, Mr Hardcastle offered three reasons.</p><p> \"There's the challenge of competing priorities for governments,\" he said. \"Leaders not only have to balance thinking about the post-Covid-19 world, but they also have to balance rapidly growing economies and the need to increase energy.\" He pointed to millions of people still without access to the power grid. </p><p> The second challenge is incumbency, which is the region's deep dependency on fossil fuels for energy. And in some Asean nations, coal, oil and gas are also major sources of export earnings. </p><p> Mr Hardcastle pointed to the region's large and young fleet of coal-fired power stations. Closing these down early and replacing them with renewable energy is a very costly challenge, though efforts are under way to try to figure out how to do this. </p><p> \"Thirdly, we've still not had sufficient incentives or access to capital to be able to move at the pace that we want,\" he said. But he noted progress in new types of financing that help lower the cost and risk of green investments, such as blended finance. This combines public and private money, such as grants, concessional loans and commercial capital. </p><p> \"The change and the transformation we're seeking... is unprecedented,\" he added. </p><p> Ms Tan pointed to the region's low level of renewable energy deployment and nascent electric vehicle industry. Much of its agriculture also remains unsophisticated compared with the large-scale farms in the West, mainly because many smallholders do not have access to technology. </p><p> \"Many of these decarbonisation investment ideas will take time, but you definitely need to act as soon as possible,\" she said. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-RJ8RT9G</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BT9-9TW1-JCF2-8020-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"965\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Nature-based solutions, such as protecting or restoring forests and wetlands, still need to mature in areas of monitoring and true value creation, they said.</p><p> Furthermore, solar photovoltaic solutions, which were 710 per cent more expensive than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired solution in 2010, now cost 29 per cent less than the cheapest fossil fuel-fired solution in 2022, they pointed out.</p><p> \"Clearly, as the levelised cost of electricity is lower, renewables would become the default choice for industry and transport,\" Shah and Dalal concluded.</p><p> The analysts were making their observations based on their study of Sustainalytics' global universe of 15,803 exchange-listed companies. </p><p> Their analysis of these companies' three-year carbon intensity suggested that of the 22 per cent of companies that disclose such data, 18 per cent reported stable or declining carbon intensity numbers. </p><p> If the sample was narrowed to the 962 listed companies in the six key Asean markets -- Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam -- the disclosure rate was 17 per cent. </p><p> Of the 166 Asean-6 companies reporting such numbers, more than seven in 10 companies reported a stable or declining carbon intensity trend over three years. </p><p> Of these 118 companies, 38 are listed in Malaysia, 35 in Thailand, 17 in Indonesia, 15 in Singapore and 13 in the Philippines. Vietnam had none since none of its companies disclosed such data.</p><p> Among the 15 Singapore-listed companies that achieved stable or declining emissions intensity over the past three years are palm oil producer First Resources and transport giant ComfortDelGro. </p><p> The analysts noted that First Resources' carbon intensity fell by more than 25 per cent in that period, while ComfortDelGro's fell between 10 and 25 per cent.</p><p> The carbon intensities of Sembcorp Industries, Singtel, ST Engineering, StarHub and Wilmar International were assessed to be \"stable\", given that emissions intensity rose or fell by under 10 per cent.</p><p> But despite the progress in decarbonisation, however slow, renewable adoption remains low in the region. Only 7 per cent of the companies representing the Asean-6 markets have a renewables programme, led by the Philippines, the analysts noted.</p><p> In comparison, 19 per cent of companies in Europe have a renewables programme, followed by North America and Canada at 10 per cent. </p><p> This shows that most companies across regions except Europe are early in their decarbonisation journey, the analysts said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-UI6C07U</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B16-J8W1-DYX4-00H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-01-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"546\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Singapore enjoys strong and longstanding economic, defence and political relations with the US. We also close strong people-to-people ties.</p><p>2. We have growing collaboration in emerging areas such as critical and emerging technology, the digital economy, and in clean energy and climate issues.</p><p>Key statistics</p><p>3. Singapore and the US are major trade and investment partners:</p><p>a) Top Trading Partners: In 2022, the US was Singapore's 2nd largest trading partner, while Singapore was the US' 17th largest trading partner.</p><p>i. The US has been Singapore's top trading partner in services for over 20 years with bilateral services trade at S$154.2 billion (approx. US$144.8 billion) in 2023.</p><p>ii. The US has consistently been among Singapore's top 3 trading partners in goods, and was Singapore's second largest goods trading partner in 2023 with $129 billion worth of goods trade.</p><p>b) Top Investors: Singapore is the top recipient of US investment in the Indo-Pacific and 7th worldwide.</p><p>i. US Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) stock in Singapore was S$651 billion in 2022.</p><p>ii.

These ecosystems also serve as a viable habitat for biodiversity, and provide people with increased food and water security.  </p><p> \"Yet, many lush forests and biodiversity-rich areas are being threatened with deforestation, in the face of lucrative businesses like timber and palm oil,\" said Ms Shakura, 33, who is pursuing her doctorate at the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. </p><p> The issue is particularly pronounced in South-east Asia, which is losing 1.2 per cent of its forests annually for agriculture, food and other raw materials.</p><p> To keep these forests intact, local communities would therefore need the financial incentives to do so.</p><p> So far, the lion's share of such efforts has come from government funding worldwide -- standing at 76 per cent, based on a Bloomberg New Economy Forum report in April. </p><p> This is insufficient to safeguard nature and biodiversity globally, and more private finance would be required to bridge the gap, said Ms Shakura. </p><p> According to the report, about US$160 billion (S$216 billion) a year goes into nature conservation and restoration efforts globally, but there is still a wide financing gap of at least US$803 billion annually.  </p><p> \"Yet, many investors are often not as willing to fund nature-based solutions, perhaps because of their risk appetite -- many want quicker returns, or feel that they need to see tangible results before deciding to put in their money.</p><p> \"But investing in nature requires one to play the long game. Think about how long it takes for a sapling to grow into a tree,\" she added.   </p><p> The good news is that interest from investors is growing, and Ms Shakura is currently working on more innovative ways of raising the much-needed finance for nature in the Asia-Pacific region. </p><p> One such way is to repurpose environmentally harmful subsidies, like agricultural subsidies, to support green efforts instead. A World Bank report in June found that agricultural subsidies are responsible for the loss of 2.2 million ha of forest per year, or 14 per cent of global deforestation. </p><p> Prior to taking up her course, Ms Shakura did an internship at Conservation International Singapore as part of her master's programme in biodiversity conservation. The stint opened her eyes to the issues that non-governmental organisations often face when it comes to implementing projects on the ground -- one of which is the need for early-stage financing.  </p><p> For instance, to reforest a degraded plot of land, financing is needed to begin planting new trees, followed by the need for tracking and monitoring equipment to measure the amount of CO2 that has been trapped and stored away from the atmosphere. </p><p> There is also the human aspect of these nature-based projects, which is to ensure that the livelihoods of indigenous people and local communities are being accounted for, said Ms Shakura. </p><p> \"For instance, are their knowledge and values being taken into consideration? These people are the custodians of their land, and we must think about how we can effectively empower them.\" </p><p> Her five-year stint with Temasek's sustainable solutions team also gave her insights into the business case for nature-climate solutions, and the enabling conditions for investments to be made into such projects.  </p><p> Ms Shakura will be attending the United Nations' climate summit, COP28, from Nov 30 to Dec 12. </p><p> She hopes to track how countries are integrating nature into their climate mitigation strategies, and whether sufficient finance is channelled into nature to see these mitigation goals come to fruition. </p><p> Reports have shown that less than 10 per cent of climate finance thus far has gone into nature, she noted.  </p><p> Countries have also pledged to halt and reverse forest loss by 2030, but there are indications that the world is off-track in achieving this target.</p><p> \"I hope to track the progress of this goal, and to check if the ambition is still there,\" she added.</p><p> As to why she decided to take the leap from the private sector to academia in January, Ms Shakura said: \"I see myself as playing the long game. Being in academia also allows me to (tackle the nature-financing issue) from a neutral perspective, whereas in the public or private sector, there are certain expectations to meet, be it looking after the economy or ensuring profitability. </p><p> \"But in academia, you get to integrate the viewpoints of different stakeholders and find innovative ways to address these problems.\"</p><p> Ms Shakura, who has a bachelor's degree in environmental engineering, got her start at the Economic Development Board, where she helped to bring cleaner, more energy-efficient water technologies to market.</p><p> But her interest in sustainability was inspired by her father, who at the time was working on air quality policy at the National Environment Agency. </p><p> \"I saw the importance of that, and thought to follow his footsteps,\" said Ms Shakura.</p><p> And what drives her to keep going, especially when the work seems unceasing'</p><p> \"My young daughter,\" said Ms Shakura. </p><p> \"Just thinking about her future, and the fact that our generation's actions will determine the kind of world she will live in... That really, really compels me to keep going, and to not give up.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ms Shakura Bashir, flanked by Ms Jamie Yeo (left) and Dr Naima Iram, at Pulau Ubin to help measure blue carbon as part of volunteering work with the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions.

At the UN Climate Change Conference 2023, also known as COP-28, the UAE COP-28 Presidency announced four paradigm shifts: (a) fast-tracking the energy transition; (b) transforming climate finance; (c) putting nature, people, lives, and livelihoods at the heart of climate action, and (d) ensuring inclusivity. The four paradigm shifts were aimed at galvanising the global community at COP-28 to close the implementation gap needed to keep the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.<br/><br/>2.These shifts are aligned with Singapore's climate ambition and the United Nations' (UN) 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda. Singapore's participation at COP-28 helped to further the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in several ways.<br/><br/>3. First, we supported the UAE COP-28 Presidency and the global shared climate agenda by, inter alia, co-facilitating ministerial consultations on climate mitigation and co-chairing the joint contact group for the First Global Stocktake of the Paris Agreement. These efforts contributed to the successful adoption of the UAE Consensus. The UAE Consensus calls on countries to transition away from fossil fuels, accelerate the phasedown of unabated coal power, phase out inefficient fossil fuel subsidies, and triple renewable energy and double energy efficiency globally by 2030. These are important initiatives that will better position the world towards achieving Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7 on Affordable and Clean Energy and SDG 13 on Climate Action.<br/><br/>4. Second, Singapore contributed to global efforts in strengthening resource resilience in key areas such as food and water, in line with SDG 2 on Zero Hunger and SDG 6 on Clean Water and Sanitation. Singapore was among 159 countries that signed the COP-28 UAE Declaration on Sustainable Agriculture, Resilient Food Systems and Climate Action. The Declaration's intent is to strengthen the resilience of agriculture and food systems to the impacts of climate through closer collaboration and partnerships. We also participated actively in key discussions like the Informal Ministerial Meeting on the Follow-up of the UN 2030 Water Conference, which continued discussion on key issues such as strategies to improve global water quality and sanitation.<br/><br/>5. Third, Singapore launched initiatives and platforms to facilitate cooperation towards the SDGs. These include the FAST-P (Financing Asia's Transition Partnership) blended finance initiative which aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion (S$6.7 billion) for Asia's energy transition, and agreements on carbon market cooperation with countries such as Costa Rica, Fiji, Rwanda, Senegal and Papua New Guinea. The COP-28 Singapore Pavilion also hosted more than 70 events that drew over 6,000 visitors, and served as a platform for facilitating partnerships in sectors such as finance, water and food, transport and nature-based solutions to address sustainable development challenges.<br/><br/>6. Singapore's active participation at COP-28 is a testament to our support for global efforts to implement the SDGs. Singapore supports the UAE Consensus and will work to implement its outcomes, including through the Singapore Green Plan 2030, which is our whole-of-nation blueprint aligned with the UN's 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.</p><p>[Category: Regulatory and Legal, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063614273</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8Y-B291-JB5M-W2H4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"708\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 6, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"77\"><className>Initiative &amp;

The bank had mobilised an additional USD 548 million in climate finance from the private sector last year.</p><p>Often viewed as the lead financiers for climate action, MDBs are financial institutions established by multiple member countries to facilitate financing and provide advisory services for developing countries.

The initiative aims to address climate, nature and debt challenges while supporting fair and affordable financing for developing countries.</p><p>In addition to debt-for-nature swaps, the partners plan to explore and scale-up risk mitigation and credit enhancement solutions such as guarantees that can catalyse private sector investment at significantly larger multiples than traditional financing methods.</p><p>Additionally, MDB <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.adb.org/news/cop28-multilateral-development-banks-mdb-joint-statement\">reaffirmed their commitments</url>\u00a0to work together to scale up climate action during the COP28 event.

The Updated USCP will intensify efforts in five areas: Regional Energy Transition; Low- and Zero-Emission Technologies and Solutions; Nature-Based Solutions and Carbon Markets; Urban Decarbonisation and Resilience; and Capacity Building. It demonstrates both countries' continued commitment towards climate action. The Joint Factsheet on the Updated USCP is appended.</p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</p><p>SINGAPORE</p><p>17 JUNE 2023</p><p>Joint Factsheet on the Updated US-Singapore Climate Partnership</p><p>STRENGTHENING THE</p><p>UNITED STATES-SINGAPORE CLIMATE PARTNERSHIP</p><p>The United States and Singapore are enduring strategic partners that enjoy close and multifaceted cooperation across a range of traditional areas and new frontier issues, including climate change.</p><p>The United States and Singapore are both committed to combating the climate crisis and accelerating the clean energy transition at home and across the Indo-Pacific. The window for climate action needed to keep a global temperature rise of 1.5 degrees Celsius within reach is narrowing rapidly. Recognising this, we are committed to making the 2020s the decisive decade for climate action, and to implementing our respective 2030 nationally determined contributions under the Paris Agreement and meeting our 2050 net-zero emission goals.</p><p>As part of these efforts to raise climate ambition and advance bold action , b oth sides launched the US-Singapore Climate Partnership in August 2021 during US Vice President Kamala Harris' visit to Singapore. The Partnership advances and strengthens both countries' collaboration on climate action, environmental governance and standards, sustainable development, R&amp;D, and low- and zero-emission solutions.</p><p>Following the August 2021 launch, implementing agencies from the US and Singapore have worked to update the Climate Partnership, and chart out its medium to longer-term direction and goals, in support of shared interests and priorities in the Indo-Pacific.</p><p>As we seek to further cooperate and accelerate respective action under the US-Singapore Climate Partnership, the two sides are intensifying efforts in the following five focal areas:</p><p>* Regional Energy Transition: Exploring cooperation to support the transition from fossil to clean energy in the ASEAN region, including through the development of regional power grid interconnections as part of a joint feasibility study on regional energy connectivity, and the mobilisation of public and private sector finance for renewable energy and infrastructure development, including through increased direct government support and for electrification of end uses, including zero-emission vehicles.</p><p>* Low- and Zero-Emission Technologies and Solutions: Working to scale demand and supply of innovative, near-zero emissions technologies and solutions in key sectors and markets, including in hard-to-abate sectors like shipping and aviation through efforts such as the development and implementation of aviation green lanes; engaging industry and promoting sustainability and the adoption of high-quality climate standards in Southeast Asia, including through the US-Singapore Partnership for Growth and Innovation; and leading by example to achieve net zero emissions from government operations through the Net-Zero Government Initiative.</p><p>* Nature-Based Solutions and Carbon Markets: Reducing emissions through nature-based solutions, such as blue carbon, forests, and sustainable land-use, and supporting the development of high-quality and high-integrity carbon markets.</p><p>* Urban Decarbonisation and Resilience: Collaborating through R&amp;D, pilots, and technology development mechanisms in sectors of mutual interest and advancing city-level climate ambition, implementation, and innovation bilaterally and globally, with a focus on key sectors including buildings, transport, and circular waste management, including through the Subnational Climate Action Leaders' Exchange (SCALE) and the US-ASEAN Smart Cities Partnership (USASCP).</p><p>* Capacity Building: Cooperating on third-party capacity building for countries in the region to meet the requirements of the Paris Agreement, such as joint regional workshops to build reporting capacity, and providing bespoke follow-up reporting-related activities for individual countries.</p><p>Under the Climate Partnership, the two sides plan to meet annually to take stock of progress and identify new areas of collaboration on climate action, environment and sustainability, and energy transition, that advance shared national interests.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Aerospace &amp;

The 1,270-unit project will include two-room flexi, three, four, and five-room flats, and will be located along Sembawang Road. </p><p> The BTO project is a stone's throw from the former Orto leisure park, which has relocated to 27 West Coast Highway near Haw Par Villa. </p><p> The last time a BTO project in Yishun was launched was in November 2022, said Nicholas Mak, Mogul.sg chief research officer. Response was \"lukewarm\", with 4,453 applicants vying for 2,994 units across the three projects in Yishun released for sale. </p><p> The upcoming project at Chencharu could enjoy a better response due to its proximity to Khatib MRT Station, Mak said. </p><p> In the longer term, the government is studying the possibility of introducing a new residential neighbourhood at Gillman Barracks, to house both public flats and private property. </p><p> Gillman Barracks has a storied history and is home to former colonial military buildings, Lee said. \"Besides providing more opportunities for Singaporeans to live closer to the city centre, the new residential neighbourhood can build on the character and charm of the former colonial buildings.</p><p> \"Residents will also have easy access to green and recreational spaces, such as the Southern Ridges and Labrador Nature Park Network,\" the minister added. </p><p> Gillman Barracks is predominantly zoned \"Reserve Site\" under the Master Plan 2019, and is currently occupied by offices, food and beverage outlets, lifestyle spaces and art galleries. Their tenancies will progressively expire by 2030. Environmental and heritage studies will start in the second quarter of 2024, and are estimated to complete around the first half of 2026. </p><p> Ismail Gafoor, PropNex's chief executive officer, said demand for both private and public housing will likely be robust if Gillman Barracks is developed for housing.</p><p> The last BTO sales exercise in the Telok Blangah area was in May 2021 at Telok Blangah Beacon, where 175 units drew 4,078 applications, at an application rate of 23.3, he said. </p><p> The median price of condominium units transacted in the vicinity of Gillman Barracks in Q4 2023 ranged from S$1,576 psf to S$2,191 psf, said Christine Sun, OrangeTee Group's chief researcher and strategist.  </p><p> New homes are planned for central parts of Singapore, such as Pearl's Hill, Mount Pleasant, Turf City and the former Keppel Golf course. The government is also freeing up land for redevelopment, such as through the relocation of Paya Lebar Air Base, Lee said. </p><p> As at February this year, the government has launched more than 67,000 HDB flats, two-thirds of its commitment to launch 100,000 new flats by 2025. </p><p> Private housing supply has also been ramped up. Some 9,250 units were launched under the Government Land Sales (GLS) programme in 2023, the highest annual supply in the last 10 years, said Lee. The H1 2024 confirmed list will supply another 5,450 private homes. </p><p> Lee noted that markets have moderated, with HDB and private residential prices rising more slowly in 2023, while rents have also stabilised. The quarterly increase in public housing rents moderated to 0.4 per cent in Q4 2023, down from 1.9 per cent in Q3, while private housing rents fell by 2.1 per cent quarter on quarter in the last three months of 2023 -- the first quarterly decline in over three years. </p><p> BTO application rates have come down from a high of 5.8 applications per flat in 2020, to 2.9 applications per flat last year. In the private housing market, transaction volume in 2023 fell by 13 per cent from 2022, and was at its lowest since 2016.</p><p> Alongside plans to provide more housing supply, the government will \"activate and curate networks of recreational spaces across the island incorporating sports, arts, nature, heritage and wellness\", Second Minister for National Development Indranee Rajah said. Cycling and pedestrian paths as well as park connectors will connect recreational spaces.</p><p> Responding to a question posed by MP Nadia Ahmad Samdin (Ang Mo Kio GRC) on the impact of the upcoming Long Island project on marine life, Indranee said that environmental studies will consider surrounding marine habitats such as intertidal flats and coral communities. </p><p> The government plans to reclaim about 800 hectares of land off East Coast to create Long Island. Agencies will explore nature-based solutions to minimise the environmental impact of the reclamation, Indranee said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The authorities are studying the possibility of introducing a new residential neighbourhood at Gillman Barracks.

Around 30 per cent of Singapore's land area is less than 5m above mean sea level.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The new Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI) Singapore was launched by national water agency PUB and the National University of Singapore (NUS). It will bring together expertise from various local universities, research institutes and industry players to create innovative coastal protection solutions. </p><p> Speaking at a dialogue at the launch at NUS, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu noted that there are a lot of uncertainties in measuring the impact of climate change on Singapore. </p><p> \"So, we have to look at this in a very dynamic way... if we do this too early, (and end up) protecting us too much, you waste a lot of resources. But if you made it too late, too little, you are not going to be in time,\" said Ms Fu. </p><p> \"Similarly, if you build the coastal protection solution too low, then you will find that, several generations later, you will need to enhance it,\" she added.</p><p> PUB chief executive Goh Si Hou said the CFI is the heart of PUB's $125 million Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme, and it will serve as the focal point to anchor and grow a collaborative research ecosystem in coastal protection. </p><p> This comes amid ongoing islandwide site-specific studies to determine the most suitable coastal protection measures for each of the eight different segments of coastlines.</p><p> CFI Singapore has begun its work with nine research projects in four areas -- coastal science research; monitoring, prediction and digitalisation of the coastal environment; innovative engineering solutions; and integrated nature-based solutions.</p><p> For example, one project will test the efficacy of hybrid nature-based solutions for coastal protection, such as perched beaches with seagrass meadows, and mangroves with rock revetments. Another project will focus on using modular solutions to enhance existing coastal protection infrastructure.</p><p> Each project will involve an expert as the principal investigator, and will be supported by several collaborators drawn from local and foreign universities, as well as industry players.</p><p> The centre will also look into the suitable conditions for mangroves, seagrasses and corals to grow -- especially in a hybrid configuration -- and their survivability under various climate change scenarios.</p><p> Ms Hazel Khoo, director of PUB's coastal protection department, said: \"We are a low-lying island with a high population density and limited land. With many competing land uses, our coastal areas are precious to us. </p><p> \"Our goal is to ensure our coastlines are not only well-protected, but can bring multi-functional value for Singapore.\" </p><p> The different coastal protection solutions will be implemented at each of the coastlines progressively, starting with the City-East Coast, which already has some natural coastal features. </p><p> Other areas include the Changi aviation hub, the recreational space at East Coast Park and the Greater Southern Waterfront, said Ms Khoo. </p><p> Focus group discussions will be held in October where members of the public can share their feedback on some shortlisted coastal protection solutions. </p><p> These could potentially include hybrid solutions integrating seawalls and revetments with natural ecosystems like mangroves, barrages, and even land reclamation bolstered with sea bunds to double as a coastal protection measure.</p><p> Ms Khoo said that PUB will be sharing with the public the trade-offs of these solutions, and their potential impact on the environment.</p><p> Explaining how the CFI and the larger Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme will work in tandem with the nationwide site-specific studies, Ms Khoo said that some of the solutions developed by the CFI could first be tested in the laboratory, or as part of a small-scale pilot before being implemented along the coastlines.</p><p> A living lab will also be included under the research programme, which will accelerate the adoption of coastal solutions by providing test-bedding sites. </p><p> Studies for the City-East Coast began in 2021, and are expected to be completed by 2025. </p><p> Suitable coastal adaptation measures for the area could then be implemented around 2030, she added.</p><p> The centre and its partner institutes -- which include the Nanyang Technological University (NTU), the Singapore University of Technology and Design, the Singapore Institute of Technology, and the Agency for Science, Technology and Research -- also aim to attract talent, create new research jobs and train PhD students. </p><p> For instance, NTU will be offering an undergraduate specialisation in coastal protection, and NUS will be offering a graduate certification programme in coastal protection and flood management. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu viewing exhibits at the launch of the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute Singapore on Thursday. st photo: Jason Quah</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-2F42VKO</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6945-S5B1-JCF2-819N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"860\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Investing in nature-based solutions is a key opportunity, and it is projected to create over 390 million jobs by 2030, as well as unlock US$10.1 trillion (S$13.8 trillion) in business opportunities,\" said Ms Razan Al Mubarak, president of the International Union for Conservation of Nature, the world's largest conservation network. </p><p> But for that to happen, annual investments in nature need to triple to more than US$500 billion annually, she said. </p><p> A key problem is getting businesses to fully take into account the true value of natural assets, or natural capital, and be willing to invest in their protection, the conference heard. </p><p> Businesses and the global economy are dependent on the materials nature provides and its many services, such as providing clean air and water. </p><p> Products from noodles to shampoos require ingredients from nature. \"Quite a lot of different companies and their supply chains actually depend on nature,\" said Mr Frederick Teo, chief executive of GenZero, a Temasek-owned investment platform. </p><p> And yet, very few companies have truly assessed both the value of nature to their businesses, and their own impact on it. </p><p> \"Only 5 per cent of companies have mapped their impact on nature. Less than 1 per cent have actually thought about the dependencies their business model has on nature,\" said Mr Peter Bakker, president of the World Business Council for Sustainable Development.</p><p> But there is hope, and new types of financing can help make the case for investing in nature. The key is making the climate connection. </p><p> \"One way of actually addressing the worst impacts of climate change, one of the cheapest and faster ways of doing this, is actually investing in nature,\" Mr Teo told The Straits Times. </p><p> \"For us, the way we are thinking about making it work is that we derive alternative revenue streams from our nature investments, which includes revenues from carbon credit sales,\" he said, pointing to money generated from projects that remove CO2 from the air or avoid CO2 or other greenhouse gases, such as methane, being emitted -- for instance, investing in more efficient rice cultivation, or reforestation or afforestation.</p><p> Other revenue streams could be timber from sustainable forestry, and products from sustainable agriculture. \"These (revenue streams) are quite useful because people now want to also provide a little bit of risk mitigation just in case something goes wrong with the carbon markets, or carbon prices decline dramatically,\" he said. </p><p> Speakers during panel discussions lamented the accelerating loss and destruction of nature, and how this will only threaten human livelihoods and economies. </p><p> It will also worsen the climate crisis because ecosystems including rainforests, mangroves, seagrass meadows, grasslands and soils soak up large amounts of planet-warming CO2 from the air, playing a key role in regulating the potent greenhouse gas in the atmosphere. </p><p> Damaging and destroying these key natural systems, for example by clearing for agriculture, mining and urban development, leads to more CO2 in the air and species loss, and affects the local climate. </p><p> Overshadowing the conference was confirmation from the US' National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration that the world's coral reefs are in the throes of a global bleaching event caused by record ocean temperatures. It is the fourth such global event on record, and Australia's Great Barrier Reef, in particular, is suffering severe and widespread bleaching -- its fifth in eight years. </p><p> Reefs are vital for fisheries and livelihoods for hundreds of millions of people. Their economic value has been estimated at US$2.7 trillion annually.</p><p> \"When global warming happens, you will have more species loss, and when you have more species loss, that will also result in more global warming,\" said Mr Sunny Verghese, CEO of Olam International. \"So these existential challenges of climate change, collapse of biodiversity, livelihoods and growing inequity are interlinked, and we need to address this as a whole system.\"</p><p> For Olam, as an agri-business supplying food and other materials, the health of the natural world is critical to the firm's bottom line -- especially pollinators, he said. </p><p> According to the World Economic Forum, about 75 per cent of crops depend on pollinators such as bees, birds and beetles. Yet recent declines in bees from pollution, land clearance and climate change have cost food producers, including Olam, millions of dollars in lost revenue. </p><p> Professor Partha Dasgupta, a leading thinker on the economics of biodiversity, told the conference that nature is a one-stop shop for products and services for humanity. Climate regulation is only one part of the services it provides.</p><p> \"We should not talk about climate and nature separately,\" he said. Nature provides goods that everyone needs, such as food, water, timber and ingredients to make pharmaceuticals -- \"the stuff we harvest and mine\", said Prof Dasgupta, the Frank Ramsey Professor Emeritus of Economics at the University of Cambridge.</p><p> But crucially, nature also provides services that are far less visible but essential. In addition to pollination, this includes nitrogen fixation, production of oxygen, water cleansing by wetlands and decomposition of waste.</p><p> And all of these natural services are interconnected, he said. </p><p> So how to speed up nature-based investments? Currently, a lot of nature investments rely on concessionary capital from government grants and philanthropic funding. But this is not enough. Debt financing at scale could really get nature investments moving, said Mr Teo, because it has a lower cost of capital than equity financing.</p><p> \"Debt financing is a way to unlock resources towards supporting nature,\" he said. Crowding in debt financing with concessionary capital and philanthropic funds will lower the costs and spread the risks of investments. </p><p> But the speakers, as in all climate and biodiversity conferences these days, noted that time was very short to pull the planet back from the brink of catastrophic impacts from climate change and loss of nature, such as faster melting of ice caps or loss of the Amazon rainforest. </p><p> British polar explorer Robert Swan, 67, had a final message for the conference: \"I believe the last great exploration left on Earth is for us as a species to survive on Earth. And the future heroines and heroes of that journey -- you're it. So I wish you luck on that journey.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Marine biologist Anne Hoggett inspecting bleached and dead coral around Lizard Island in Australia's Great Barrier Reef on April 5.

But this could exact costs on the community where such nature-based solutions are located, noted Ms Hum Wei Mei, head of environmental products at Singapore-based AirCarbon Exchange (ACX), which owns and operates carbon exchanges. </p><p> This is because for every dollar invested in carbon credits, a certain proportion would go towards verification as well as maintaining the quality and standards of the projects.</p><p> Said Ms Hum: \"It's also a question of where companies want that dollar to go. Do they want it to go to the companies that operate the satellites which are probably not owned by the community on the ground, or towards helping a logger switch trades to become a forest ranger or project verifier'\"</p><p> The transparency of carbon credits came into question after British newspaper The Guardian reported in January that 90 per cent of carbon credits certified by the world's biggest certifier of carbon credits Verra do not cut carbon emissions into the atmosphere as claimed. </p><p> For carbon credits traded on ACX, details such as transactions are recorded in a blockchain, with unique serial numbers as proof of identification. </p><p> Other forms of data for firms to improve their data disclosures were also discussed during the forum, which was held at Tower ClubSingapore in Republic Plaza. The one-off event, organised by the Singapore Institute of International Affairs (SIIA), brought together over 70 key regional corporate leaders, decision-makers, industry experts and policymakers.</p><p> City Developments Limited chief sustainability officer Esther An noted that because \"sustainability is still relatively new\" to many companies, especially small and medium-sized enterprises, gathering validated data has been challenging. She added: \"This is where artificial intelligence can come into the picture with tools to help us to get reliable data.\" </p><p> Senior Minister of State for Communications and Information Janil Puthucheary said that the cost-benefit analysis from technology on environmental sustainability \"is not clear at this point in time\". </p><p> Speaking at a fireside chat with SIIA chairman Simon Tay, Dr Janil said defining sustainability reporting standards would help in and bring about better clarity on the cost-benefit analysis from the use of technology.</p><p> \"We can foresee that we're going to end up using more technology in order to achieve those outcomes,\" said Dr Janil, citing the example of sensors that have enabled businesses to improve on accountability in sustainable practices and adjust business models accordingly. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-R35DO5U</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69NT-V5X1-DYX4-002K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"558\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.
