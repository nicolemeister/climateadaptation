His comments added to a growing chorus of voices calling for resources to help South-east Asia get to net zero, and reflect what is expected to be an area of focus in November as global leaders reconvene for annual climate negotiations at the 27th Conference of the Parties of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.</p><p> The sustainable finance market is increasingly impactful in South-east Asia, with issuance of labelled sustainable bonds in South-east Asia growing 77 per cent in 2021 to US$24 billion, according to data from the Climate Bonds Initiative. The negotiations and initiatives surrounding transition in the weeks and months ahead will potentially set waypoints that will help to guide the regional market for years to come.</p><p> Those waypoints must take South-east Asia deeper into the realm of climate adaptation, as opposed to simply climate mitigation. While mitigation seeks to reduce or avoid climate change through activities such as switching to renewable power or growing carbon-sequestering trees, adaptation seeks to prepare for climate change. That means looking into flood defences or developing resilient and diversified crops, for example.</p><p> Climate adaptation is significantly underfunded in the region. A study by researchers at the Iseas-Yusof Ishak Institute in February found that the region received almost three times as much in climate assistance for mitigation as it did for adaptation between 2000 and 2019.</p><p> Mitigation attracting the majority of financing is understandable. As long as it is possible to reduce climate change, all reasonable effort should be made to pursue those solutions. The ratcheting aspect of the Paris Agreement and the growing adoption of net-zero targets by the private sector have also driven resources towards mitigation.</p><p> Adaptation solutions, however, struggle because the need to act often precedes perception of the need to act. Adaptation solutions like building sea walls can be costly and take a long time to complete, so it is often necessary to begin work even before the risks become noticeable enough to spur action. Adaptation needs deliberate policy support.</p><p> Confronting transition in South-east Asia quickly leads to the realisation that any transition must be \"just\". Notwithstanding the economic opportunities of greening, migrating nations largely dependent on fossil fuel towards a net-zero future is an extremely costly endeavour. That burden needs to addressed in a manner that accounts for impact on jobs, cost of living and economic development in the transitioning countries, otherwise the political will and financial means to complete the task will be missing.</p><p> A just transition must leave room for climate adaptation in South-east Asia, which has numerous coastlines and sizeable agricultural sectors, and is one of the most vulnerable regions in the world to climate change. Without adequate preparation for the dire effects of global warming -- including rising water levels, extreme weather and biodiversity loss -- nations in the region could see their best-laid plans laid to waste in the face of mass migrations, famine and droughts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-D7LKF8</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66J3-M261-DYX4-0192-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"596\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The paper was jointly prepared with the Boston Consulting Group and business software provider SAP. These business openings include the expansion of nature-positive renewables, energy efficiency in buildings and organic food and beverages.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Climate adaptation is the acknowledgement that, despite all progress made in climate action, global temperatures will continue to rise. Hence, changes must be made to adapt to the results of climate change. </p><p> Climate mitigation, on the other hand, aims to slow and ultimately reduce the rate of global warming. This is most often done through investing in decarbonisation, slowing greenhouse-gas emissions and removing existing greenhouse gases from the atmosphere. </p><p> Both climate adaptation and mitigation are crucial in combating the climate crisis, the paper stated.</p><p> \"A focus on adaptation does not concede that the battle to mitigate the effects of climate change has been lost\", noted the report. Instead, effective implementation of corporate climate action requires integrated responses that link adaptation and mitigation.</p><p> Investments into adaptation could return four to nine times the amount put in, assuming a five-year investment period, the report estimated. These could include early-warning systems, global mangrove protection, climate-resilient infrastructure and improved dryland agriculture crop production. </p><p> But because the impacts of climate change differ with each country, adaptation must be considered on a country-specific basis. This means pursuing projects with local involvement that are focused on short-term risk reduction, as well as on investments that improve the resilience of systems and infrastructure.</p><p> Investment is required in a variety of areas for climate mitigation, including clean-energy infrastructure, transport to assist the growth in population mobility, and agriculture and forestry in countries with big farming industries.</p><p> Asia's ability to combat climate change is critical for the world. The region produces the largest share (51 per cent) of contemporary global emissions, and is also the biggest driver of global economic growth.</p><p> The region is expected to lead the way in clean-energy investment over the next decade, with opportunities to increase the small installation bases of solar and wind infrastructure, the report said. However, this will require countries to \"balance funding for climate action alongside competing agendas and national priorities such as big infrastructure projects, transport programmes or social campaigns\".</p><p> \"The world's success or failure in achieving its shared climate goals will be critically dependent on the performance of countries and companies in Asia,\" the report stated.</p><p> For now, the larger companies have been leading the way. City Developments (CDL) in Singapore, for example, with a network spanning 143 locations in 28 countries and regions, has been widely recognised for its climate progress, the report said.</p><p> CDL has driven a 24 per cent reduction in carbon-dioxide emissions-intensity per unit of net-lettable floor area since 2016, and has secured more than S$3 billion in sustainable financing over the past five years. Currently, over 80 per cent of its revenue comes from clean and energy-efficient building construction and management. It reported energy savings of over S$38 million in the past decade, from energy-efficient retrofitting and initiatives across all its commercial buildings. It is planning to do even more.</p><p> Esther An, chief sustainability officer at CDL, said at the roundtable discussion held with the launch of the report that it is important for companies to identify the top material issues that would enable them to create the impact they desire. CDL, on its part, has identified 17 such issues, including newer ones such as circular-economy solutions.</p><p> She did not disclose the amount CDL was spending on such areas, but said: \"There's definitely ROI (return on Investment) -- much faster than before.\"</p><p> The prevalence of family-run businesses in corporate Asia, however, presents a challenge to the region. It is estimated that small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) make up some 80 to 90 per cent of all companies in this part of the world.</p><p> \"So, we must have a mechanism of getting scale and volume in the mid-market,\" said Paul Marriott, president for Asia-Pacific and Japan at SAP. He added that making it easier for companies to get the kind of technology that larger companies typically have access to would be key to enabling the shift.</p><p> Working in favour of this is the interest SAP says it has seen from the SME quarter. Verena Siow, president and managing director for South-east Asia at SAP, said: \"We see huge interest from mid-sized companies because of two things: firstly, the regulations coming up in a lot of these countries; and secondly, smaller companies are interested in raising funding.\" </p><p> She added: \"If we have the solutions that Paul (Marriot) had shared, to enable (smaller companies) to record, to report and to act on sustainability, it would help them to build that foundation when they're small. As they grow, they can leverage on innovation and drive their sustainability strategy.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Asia-Pacific region is expected to lead the way in clean-energy investment over the next decade.

A life-saving treatment left unpublished, a solution to climate change ignored, a revolutionary idea buried in bureaucracy. This isn't a hypothetical scenario, it's the reality we find ourselves in.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Peer review was initially designed to hold research to a certain standard of integrity. Unfortunately, this has become a bottleneck, leading to the delay or even prevention of vital discoveries. It is clear that funding structures have been molded to prioritize research that can be patented and, more importantly, monetized. This has left crucial but \"non-commercial innovations\" without support. Instead of accelerating progress, these systems create barriers where only research with clear commercial potential moves forward, while ideas that could change the world never make it past the starting line.</p><p>Peer Review Is Essential, But It Needs Reform</p><p>Some will argue that peer review is the best way to maintain scientific quality, which I agree with. My question to you is what happens when it fails at its own purpose?</p><p>A<url normalizedValue=\"https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC1420798/\">study</url> published in the Journal of the Royal Society of Medicine found that peer reviewers frequently miss major errors in research papers, even when those errors are intentionally inserted as a test. If peer review is failing to catch mistakes, is it really the gold standard we assume it to be?</p><p>Thanks to PNAS's<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.pnas.org/about/article-journal-metrics\">transparency</url>, we can see that the average time from content submission to publication is around 6.6 months, peer review alone takes approximately 47 days. In fast-moving, ever evolving fields like medicine or technology, there is no room for delay of information, it can be the difference between a solution being implemented or remaining buried.</p><p>The COVID-19 pandemic exposed just how many holes there are in this system. When faced with an urgent crisis, scientists abandoned traditional publishing standards and instead used preprint servers to share findings instantly. If science could move that fast in an emergency, why should we accept a system that slows it down under normal circumstances?</p><p>Then there's the overwhelming issue of who gets published in the first place. It is believed that major journals historically have favored research from top universities, while independent researchers and smaller institutions fight to get their work past the initial review stage.<url normalizedValue=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.02188?\">Studies</url> have indicated a perception that papers from lesser-known institutions are judged more harshly. Instead of being an objective filter for scientific merit, peer review too often reinforces academic hierarchies.</p><p>A transparent and fair peer review process would ensure that all research is evaluated based on its quality, not its source. Open peer review models, where reviewer comments are published alongside research, have already been shown to improve fairness and accountability. Faster review processes, combined with broader acceptance of preprint servers, could prevent unnecessary delays. Science moves forward when ideas are tested, challenged, and refined. A broken system only holds that process back.</p><p>Who Controls What Science Gets Done?</p><p>If peer review determines what gets published, funding determines what gets researched in the first place, and this is just as concerning. A 2024<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/08989621.2024.2324913\">article</url> in Accountability in Research found that research into non-commercial treatments receives far less funding than research into newly developed, patentable drugs. This creates a system where financial incentives outweigh public health outcomes.</p><p>This bias extends beyond medicine, with studies on climate adaptation, soil regeneration, and ecological preservation struggling for funding because they don't provide immediate financial returns. The<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd.org/en/publications/oecd-science-technology-and-innovation-outlook-2023_0b55736e-en.html\">OECD</url> further validates that short-term financial incentives have led to an undeniable focus on applied research at the expense of long-term discoveries that could benefit humanity.</p><p>In 2021, UNESCO released a<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unesco.org/reports/science/2021/en\">report</url> explaining that even when vital research is funded and published, access remains a major barrier. The vast majority of scientific studies are locked behind paywalls, meaning they are only for the select few. In fact, 50% of published research is not freely available.</p><p>We have created a contradiction \u2013 research is often funded by public money, conducted in public institutions, and reviewed by unpaid academics, yet the final product is controlled by private publishers who charge exorbitant fees for access. This doesn't sound right to me.</p><p>Governments and independent research bodies need to shift funding priorities and ensure that non-commercial research receives the same level of support as profit-driven projects. A research model that deprioritizes short-term profit would allow for investment in solutions that have long-term benefits; this could be in the field of medicine, climate science, or technology. Expanding public-interest funding programs and increasing government-backed grants for research that cannot be patented would help level the playing field, ensuring that scientific discovery is driven by need, not just profit.</p><p>Decentralised funding models are emerging as an alternative to traditional grant structures. Platforms like ResearchHub, founded by Brian Armstrong, which uses blockchain technology and token incentives to support scientific collaboration and funding outside commercial constraints.</p><p>The internet gave us the tools to make scientific knowledge more open than ever, yet outdated publishing models continue to restrict it. Open-access platforms have begun to challenge this, but resistance from traditional academic publishers remains strong. If the goal of science is to expand human understanding, why are we still allowing corporate interests to decide who gets access to knowledge? Open-access publishing has proven to increase both the visibility and impact of research, while independent funding models demonstrate that science can thrive beyond corporate control. The real challenge is not just overcoming a system resistant to change. It's doing so without creating new barriers by shifting the financial burden onto academics.</p><p>Science Should Serve Humanity, Not Gatekeepers </p><p>Science is meant to push boundaries, challenge assumptions, and improve lives. Yet, the systems controlling it, peer review methods, funding models, and publishing restrictions are actively slowing progress. The issue isn't just profit but where it flows. Right now, too much of it goes to publishers that add little value while locking knowledge behind paywalls rather than supporting researchers and the advancement of science itself. A better system is possible, one that aligns financial sustainability with open access and genuine innovation.</p><p>The way we fund, review, and publish research today will shape the world of tomorrow, it's as simple as that. The question is no longer whether reform is needed, but whether we are willing to remove the gatekeepers standing in its way. If knowledge is truly meant to be for the benefit of all, then we need to start acting like it.</p><p>The greatest ideas, those that truly move humanity forward, shouldn't be trapped in bureaucracy \u2013 they should be free to change the world.</p><p>The post <url normalizedValue=\"https://mpost.io/the-invisible-hand-in-science-who-really-controls-research-and-publishing/\">The Invisible Hand in Science: Who Really Controls Research and Publishing?</url> appeared first on <url normalizedValue=\"https://mpost.io\">Metaverse Post</url>.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://mpost.io/wp-content/uploads/Expert-opinion-Ciaran-Murray-1920x1027-1-1-1024x548.jpg\">The Invisible Hand in Science: Who Really Controls Research and Publishing? - Image</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">MTVPST-477277075</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">MTVPST2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F6S-GFS3-RV3X-13FC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">485993</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1229\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025  Metaverse Post Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

The six severe storms have taken more than 160 lives and impacted over 10 million people, and caused damage worth an estimated 470 million pesos (S$10 million). </p><p> Speaking at a high-level event on climate adaptation, Mr Stiell noted that nearly half of the human population live in climate vulnerability hot spots, where people are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. </p><p> \"Personally, I find this deeply disturbing, highly offensive,\" he said. </p><p> Even as he made a renewed plea for countries -- especially the most vulnerable ones -- to start planning for climate change, Mr Stiell called for more innovative financing to channel money to countries that need to build resilience against climate impacts. </p><p> \"We can no longer rely on small streams of finance. We need torrents of funding. They need to be easier to access, especially for the most vulnerable countries that often face the biggest barriers,\" he said. </p><p> Countries previously agreed to have their national adaptation plans ready by 2025, to be implemented by 2030. </p><p> Such plans lay out a country's medium- and long-term solutions to limit the impact of climate change on communities. </p><p> To date, 60 countries -- mostly developing or least developed nations -- have submitted their national plans. South-east Asian countries on the list include Cambodia, Thailand, Timor-Leste and the Philippines. </p><p>Singapore's adaptation efforts are included in its climate targets document, which was last updated in 2022 and submitted to the UN. </p><p> Countries' adaptation costs could rise to US$340 billion (S$456 billion) per year by 2030, reaching as much as US$565 billion per year by 2050, Mr Stiell noted. </p><p> \"The funding exists. We need to unlock and unblock it.\"</p><p> He urged multilateral development banks to think beyond traditional grants and loans, and philanthropies, the private sector and bilateral donors to step up without increasing the debt faced by vulnerable countries. </p><p> \"The people who receive this investment will not disappoint. They want to adapt. Often, they know better than we do just how to adapt,\" he added. </p><p> Adaptation outcomes at COP29 are expected to be closely linked to a new climate finance goal, which will be the summit's primary outcome and define the success of the talks. </p><p> Developing countries are calling for developed nations to commit to US$1.3 trillion per year to help the more vulnerable countries meet their climate targets and adapt to disasters that disproportionately fall on them. </p><p> In its adaptation gap report published in early November, the United Nations Environment Programme found that public finance to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts increased from US$22 billion in 2021 to US$28 billion in 2022. </p><p> But this amount still leaves a huge adaptation finance gap, estimated at between US$187 billion and US$359 billion per year. </p><p> Furthermore, a lack of transparency and accessibility of some countries' climate risks would make the financial system more vulnerable and also hinder access to capital for climate adaptation, said Singapore-based Anjali Viswamohanan, who spoke at the meeting. </p><p> This was a problem highlighted in an analysis of adaptation policies of several Asian markets including China, India and Malaysia published by the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) in November. </p><p> Ms Viswamohanan, director of policy at AIGCC, cited a survey that found that 49 of 52 of the world's largest institutional investors -- managing roughly US$50.2 trillion in Asia -- have policies on climate risks and opportunities. </p><p> \"This means that a large number of financial institutions understand that climate risk is a financial risk and would be keen to see clear plans from policymakers to address these risks that private capital can contribute to,\" she told ST. </p><p> \"(But) if there is a misalignment (between the private sector and country) of what the risks are, you're not going to align on the type of financing, the type of projects that's required... you will not actually get projects that are investable.\"</p><p> Neighbouring countries also need to consider transboundary climate impacts such as air pollution or haze, and water shortage from a drought, she noted. </p><p> \"But several countries are not adequately thinking about or coordinating on these risks. We found very little concrete information on that in their adaptation plans,\" she added. </p><p> Beyond having a national plan in place, the local communities need to be the ones leading the projects, since every island or province faces differing climate impacts, noted Ms Maheen Khan, an international climate resilience adviser at WWF-Netherlands. She was speaking at a press conference by the World Wide Fund for Nature on the morning of Nov 18 at the summit. </p><p> \"Adaptation is local. So adaptation in Siargao in the Philippines will differ from that in Palawan,\" she said. \"We have to cater to the adaptation needs and risks of the local community, the village that we want to have a solution.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>UN climate chief Simon Stiell says half the human population live in climate vulnerability hot spots, where people are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-TOE970V</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFW-5DX1-JCF2-83MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It uses data to generate new things, such as text, images or code. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In Singapore, one of the first institutes of higher learning that embedded forms of AI, such as machine learning, in its curriculum is the Singapore University of Technology and Design (SUTD), which opened in 2009.</p><p> Established as Singapore's fourth public university, it aims to advance knowledge and nurture technically grounded leaders and innovators to serve societal needs with a focus on design and technology.</p><p> Professor Khoo Peng Beng, Head of Pillar at SUTD's School of Architecture and Sustainable Design, joined the university earlier in 2025. He says AI has light and dark sides -- such as job displacement and ethical uses -- that need to be rigorously addressed through the university's curriculum.</p><p> While the university is inventing AI systems of the future, it is also conducting research on the philosophy and ethics of AI, called \"Design AI\". This is an intentional approach, as it is widely accepted that AI and human intelligence are partners in innovation. </p><p> \"As newer technologies like AI evolve, we have to increasingly sharpen our ability to discern what is good, what is the truth and what is beauty,\" says Prof Khoo, 56.</p><p> He says that AI itself is agnostic to either good or evil applications, and is dependent on the intention of the human user.</p><p> \"Of overarching importance is to keep human and AI goals aligned,\" he notes.</p><p> As futurists and inventors, design students speculate on all sorts of future possibilities.</p><p> For instance, they conduct research about the design of greener cities, the future of work and the future of healthcare. </p><p> These thought experiments, and the examination of both AI's light and dark sides, allow students to constantly create provocative scenarios that spark engagement and stimulate debate.</p><p> Students in Singapore also have some of the best teachers. About 20 SUTD lecturers are ranked among the \"World's Top 2%\", a list of leading scientists compiled by Stanford University in the US. </p><p> \"Our students are exposed to an exceptional research environment from their first year in university,\" says Prof Khoo. </p><p> \"Every project is a thought experiment about a speculative future or an exploration of experimental possibilities of existing phenomena. This then allows us to steer ourselves and our world to a better and brighter future.\"</p><p> This approach of embracing state-of-the-art AI, as well as striking a balance with its impact on society, has helped groom SUTD students to excel in the real world. Since 2009, SUTD graduates have commanded top dollar in the job market. </p><p> In a Straits Times report in April 2023, nine out of 10 SUTD graduates found jobs within six months of completing their final examinations, based on the school's 2023 graduate employment survey of 300 new graduates. </p><p> More than half of SUTD graduates secured full-time permanent employment in the sectors of information and communications, financial and insurance, and scientific research and development.</p><p> In February, the results of the Joint Graduate Employment Survey revealed that graduates of information and digital technologies courses continued to take home the highest monthly pay at $5,600, up from $5,500 in 2023. </p><p> ST scopes out five of SUTD's most ground-breaking AI projects.</p><p> Helping students flesh out bright ideasA new AI-powered design software converts doodles, sketches or simple shapes into layered architectural renders for pitching to design clients or for buildable architecture. </p><p> This is the invention of SUTD's Carlos Banon, associate professor of architecture and sustainable design. </p><p> For the past three years, he has integrated advanced diffusion models and large language models (LLMs) and conducted cutting-edge training in SUTD's first-year design workshops or \"studios\".</p><p> Advanced diffusion models are sophisticated machine learning algorithms that generate high-quality data. The application improves the connection between students' intuition and their visual output, boosting their creativity while helping them maintain control and ownership. </p><p> Prof Banon experienced first-hand the problem that designers grappled with to maintain control of and execute their vision using AI. His user-friendly application, which he christened FORMAS.AI -- \"formas\" is Spanish for \"forms\" -- turns sketches, coloured shapes and 3D images into textured visualisations and 3D-printable geometry with one click. </p><p> More than 2,000 architects, interior designers, educators and students globally are early users in the private beta version of the application, ahead of its end-Maypublic launch.</p><p> By making each step of the AI-driven creative process more transparent and controllable, users transition from being led by the AI's creations to actively guiding its development. This helps preserve their personal style while leveraging data-driven tools.</p><p> \"Since 2022, we have been integrating image-based diffusion models to enhance foundational design skills from the first semester at SUTD,\" says Prof Banon, 46. He is also the co-founder of Spanish architectural firm Subarquitectura Architects and co-founder of research laboratory AirLab@SUTD.</p><p> In his classes, students still draw on tracing paper and use cardboard study models, as they are encouraged to nurture primary thoughts and intuition. </p><p> But the moment a spark of brilliance takes shape, they sketch the idea and feed it into the FORMAS.AI model. It generates a realistic building image with materials and the surrounding environment for context.</p><p> \"In that way, our students develop a new kind of intuition, connecting very basic, abstract shapes and simple operations to complex spatial structures,\" says Prof Banon. \"They then develop new ways to operate in the world, reducing production time and focusing on vital areas revealed during the design process.\"</p><p> Currently, most AI image generators such as Midjourney are able to produce stunning visuals but drift far from the original vision or sketches, says Prof Banon. </p><p> On the other hand, FORMAS.AI's intuitive interface empowers designers to experiment and iterate using basic shapes. The output ranges from a high-resolution architectural rendering to an image that can be fed to 3D printers to produce a prototype.</p><p> \"Innovative architectural design often starts with a personal vision -- something only you notice about a site, the climate, a pattern of living,\" Prof Banon says. </p><p> \"It is that 'trained vision' that architects develop over time, something that can be transformative as we consider many factors -- combining science, art and technological intuition. AI should amplify and sharpen that hunch, not overshadow or replace it.\"</p><p>  Info: To see examples of what users globally are generating, go to FORMAS.AI </p><p> An AI-powered Design Brain for architectsWhen humans draw up architectural plans, they bring a lifetime of lived experiences, sensory input and emotional understanding to the table. They intuitively grasp spatial relationships, human needs and the feeling a space should evoke. </p><p> Currently, AI is unable to do this. An AI program needs to be fed large amounts of data which it identifies as patterns, recombining existing elements and optimising results within clearly defined parameters.</p><p> AI also lacks the physical and emotional experiences that shape human intuition about space and form. </p><p> Assistant professor Immanuel Koh of SUTD's Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar and Design and Artificial Intelligence programme is working on changing that. </p><p> His \"Design Brain\" project was conceived in 2024 with the aim of developing AI models capable of digesting, perceiving, understanding, learning, remembering, generating and evaluating designs -- specifically, architectural designs.</p><p> This is despite architecture being one of the most complex design disciplines in the world, demanding both creativity and logic.</p><p> Prof Koh has found that while there are many aspects to the project, the problem of spatial design reasoning -- and creative \"unreasoning\" -- is the most critical and difficult to solve.</p><p> For AI to truly power the design process and production, both humans and AI need to first communicate why, when and how specific design decisions are made during the iterative process.</p><p> \"It is difficult because it requires a transdisciplinary conceptual understanding and technical skills that lie at the intersection of design and AI,\" says Prof Koh, who also directs Artificial-Architecture at SUTD. </p><p> Artificial-Architecture is an interdisciplinary research laboratory that focuses on the design and development of deep learning models for artificial creativity, neurocognitive design, generative architecture, predictive urbanism and defence intelligence.</p><p> Artificial-Architecture has a slate of funded projects that include tie-ups with industry, academia and government agencies, such as AI Singapore and the Urban Redevelopment Authority.</p><p> Design Brain tries to create visible parallel chains of reasoning design actions throughout the process that can be performed, observed and augmented by human designers and autonomous software agents. An autonomous software agent is capable of making design decisions on its own.</p><p> \"I see AI as having the potential to not only automate or 'compress' existing design workflows that are currently conceived by human architects in a top-down manner, but also, even more radically, to un-automate or 'expand' existing design thinking habits that are yet to be conceived, using AI in a new bottom-up manner,\" says Prof Koh. </p><p> He worked with London-based design practice Zaha Hadid Architects from 2011 to 2014 before joining SUTD in 2019 to teach what he says is the world's first dedicated \"AI x Architecture\" module. </p><p> On Design Brain, Prof Koh says: \"The importance of this research lies in gaining a deeper mutual qualitative and quantitative understanding of the evolving gap between the intelligent architectural capabilities of AI and those of human architects. </p><p> \"At this point in time, it functions as a litmus test to see if an AI model can acquire the design skillsets of a human architect.\"</p><p> Analysing the ear canal through light imaging and machine learningAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), customised hearing aids can help cut the rate of cognitive decline by nearly half in seniors at a higher risk of dementia. </p><p> WHO says that nearly 2.5 billion people globally may have some degree of hearing loss by 2050, and more than 700 million will require hearing rehabilitation. </p><p> To create a more accurate mould of the outer ear for hearing aids, ear specialists in Singapore led by Dr Kenneth Chua, formerly from Changi General Hospital (CGH), collaborated with SUTD associate professor Stylianos Dritsas from 2020 to 2023. </p><p> Prof Dritsas teaches design computation and robotics, combining design, geometry, computing and manufacturing methods. </p><p> He worked with the CGH team to improve the way hearing aids are made, using machine learning. This is a field of study in AI centred on the development and study of algorithms that can learn from data and go on to create scenarios without relying on explicit instructions.</p><p> Fitting hearing aids typically involves injecting silicone into patients' ears. This produces ear canal moulds which are then scanned using 3D imaging to create digital ear canal impressions. </p><p> But before digital impressions can be used by doctors, the printouts require a lot of manual 3D editing. </p><p> Prof Dritsas and his team at SUTD helped Dr Chua -- now a principal audiologist at Mount Elizabeth Medical Centre -- with computational methods to pre-process ear canal impressions. The project ended earlier in 2025, but there are plans for an extension to conduct more studies.  </p><p> The goal is to develop automated tools to help design better hearing aids. This will improve manufacturing and fitting the aids, and help standardise ear canal data for research purposes.</p><p> Prof Dritsas points out that in traditional computer programming, tasks that require visual intelligence and a qualitative assessment are very difficult to express via simple rules fed into a computer.</p><p> However, with AI, it is possible to provide enough examples for the computer program to understand the trends and patterns, and enable it to perform these tasks without explicitly being guided by a human.</p><p> \"The key finding of the ear canal project is that, unlike classical geometric analyses which require 'clean' or comprehensive data, the machine learning models are able to work with 'noisy' (incomplete) data from the real world,\" says Prof Dritsas, 48, a founding member of SUTD.</p><p> \"During the process, something unexpected happened,\" he recalls. </p><p> \"The machine learning model scrutinised the team's main printouts of the outer ear shapes thoroughly and was able to spot errors. This occurred because some of our data samples were off the general trend.</p><p> \"So, it provided highly intelligent guesses to improve the end-product.\"</p><p> Prof Dritsas says the machine learning model is a pioneering technology. One of its \"superpowers\" is the ability to make hyper-intelligent assessments for a final read-out that is more than 90 per cent accurate. </p><p> \"The model learnt something objective by combining subjective opinions of experts and collective knowledge from the team,\" he adds.</p><p>  \"This is something very powerful about machine learning that is not yet well understood, and which has enormous potential.\"</p><p> Sharing knowledge about coastal protectionProtecting coastlines from rising sea levels due to climate change is a top priority, says SUTD professor of practice Eva Castro from the Architecture and Sustainable Design pillar.</p><p> As the director of the Centre for Climate Adaptation (CCA), housed within the Upper Changi campus, she uses AI to generate visualisations of projected scenarios faster than in previous years, when the technology was not so advanced.</p><p> Instead of manually selecting chart types and visual encodings, AI-powered tools can automatically suggest the most effective visualisations to represent data and highlight key insights. </p><p> This allows Prof Castro to ideate and iterate large-scale infrastructure proposals for coastal resilience that can be shared across borders to help stakeholders such as overseas researchers, scientists and government agencies.</p><p> AI has also helped to break down complex design concepts for stakeholders to access and comprehend information that would otherwise be understood only by specialists or experts.</p><p> \"The CCA agenda is centred on archipelagos, so we have been working with coastal areas, developing a new understanding of the meaning of coastal resilience and the role the ocean plays within it, designing hybrid as well as nature-based solutions to inhabit possible futures,\" says Prof Castro, 53.</p><p> One of CCA's ongoing research programmes is the Long Island project, which involves reclaiming land at higher levels off East Coast and placing them in the form of \"islands\" located a distance away from the existing coastline.</p><p> The programme, aimed at helping Singapore's efforts in coastal protection, is expected to reclaim about 800ha of land off East Coast.</p><p> It will be progressively implemented from 2030 and will stretch over a few decades, according to national water agency PUB.</p><p> Prof Castro says the aim of her work is to produce more inclusive processes of design that help in sharing knowledge and engaging society at large.</p><p> \"As designers, we want to promote the importance of our role within the infrastructural projects that define the cities we inhabit,\" she says. \"In doing so, we believe we are strategists who know how to operate across diverse scales and typologies.\"</p><p> Collaborative intelligence, instead of artificial intelligenceArchitecture graduate and PhD candidate Daryl Ho believes AI will not take over the jobs of humans, but will be more of a reliable assistant to designers. Think collaborative intelligence rather than artificial intelligence, he says.</p><p> The 30-year-old is working on a few \"wonder\", or speculative, projects, which look into how the medium of extended reality (XR) can augment the way humans interact with AI beyond the standard user interface. </p><p> The way humans engage with AI should not be limited to buttons and text prompts, he says. Through XR, users can make use of space for new forms of interaction and collaboration with AI.</p><p> \"One of my projects looks into how AI can be a creative partner that helps users design their own virtual environments,\" says Mr Ho, whose research is in understanding XR through the perspective of an architect designing spaces for people to interact in. </p><p> His goal is to find ways for people to curate their own spaces within the metaverse or virtual world, not only through appearance, but also via interactivity with the environment. </p><p> In this project, AI collaborates with the users, responding to their actions through sounds, colour and placing design suggestions of its own. </p><p> This allows designers within a virtual environment to create together with AI in a social, embodied manner.</p><p> Another project looks at how AI can redefine how people interact with information, not as static elements taken from a webpage, but as dynamic agents that respond to the user and one another. </p><p> \"Much of the information we find online is presented to us through search engines, websites and online repositories that for the large part remain static 2D interfaces,\" he says.</p><p> \"Through XR and AI, we can change the way a person receives and makes sense of information.\"</p><p> Imagine information as little AI helpers living inside a virtual world. Instead of just looking at words and pictures on a screen, one can interact with these AI helpers directly. </p><p> This allows the individual to explore information in a dynamic 3D way, beyond the flat screen of the computer.</p><p> \"The metaverse is still a nascent force,\" adds Mr Ho, highlighting that its implications make it an important future for designers to speculate about. If XR and AI become ubiquitous at a scale akin to that of the internet now, how does one engage with such spaces'</p><p> \"My research looks into tapping the principles of the metaverse to find novel ways in which we might be able to work, create and play with an ever-evolving digital landscape.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Associate professor Carlos Banon's FORMAS.AI software can transform basic sketches and shapes into textured visualisations.

And adaptation needs are large -- having been estimated by the IMF to amount to 0.25 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) per year in 2030 at a global level, and at around 1 to 2 per cent for some emerging markets, and in excess of 10 per cent for some small island economies.</p><p> \"Given the financial constraints faced by the sovereigns and regional and local governments (RLGs) most vulnerable to physical climate risk, strong governance -- which increases the likelihood that adaptation investment effectively reduces risks and fosters access to funding -- will be a key differentiating factor of governments' climate resilience,\" Moody's report said.</p><p> Its own engagement with sovereigns and RLGs, it said, suggests that while most have formed an assessment of the risks and defined their vulnerabilities to climate change, many of their plans lack detail when it comes to implementation and prioritisation.</p><p> For example, according to the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), only 26 per cent of sovereigns have monitoring and evaluation systems in place, though a further 36 per cent are in the process of developing a system. Only 8 per cent, however, have evaluated their National Adaptation Plans, or national-level planning instruments, based on, for example, additional qualitative and quantitative information about progress made and feedback from stakeholders; this is even less developed for RLGs and their climate adaptation plans or strategies.</p><p> This has left potential financiers of such plans uncertain about their likely effectiveness -- contributing to the low level of global climate finance directed towards adaptation, which was at around 10 per cent in 2019-2020.</p><p> In addition, difficulties in pricing net financial and economic gains from adaptation, and broader credit risk, are expected to weigh on the private investment that will be crucial to emerging markets. </p><p> \"We expect advanced economies will accelerate their adaptation planning and start to increase investment financed from either the public purse or debt markets over the coming years. By contrast, weak government balance sheets and competing policy priorities will weigh on public spending on adaptation initiatives in lower-income jurisdictions, who are also most at risk from extreme climate events and climate-related long-term trends such as rising sea levels,\" Moody's said.</p><p> Private finance is therefore vital for these economies; but funding is likely to be limited due to the broader credit risk present in these economies -- such as weaker policy frameworks and limited organisational capacity to undertake detailed adaptation planning -- and the difficulties in estimating the potential gains and the avoidable losses from climate adaptation investment.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Adapting to extreme weather events, such as drought, and long-term climate change, needs copious amounts of funding.

It's really a privilege to have the two of you here on stage, and it is a record turnout for us this year. I think we know why. Everyone's here to hear you and also to learn about how you are moving philanthropic capital-because we know that that's the capital that can tolerate the most risk, and the world is at risk.</p><p>It's a world where we are seeing rules-maybe all changed-trade flows affected, aid flows affected. So, if there was a mission you were on to solve one global challenge, what would it be? And if you had a hundred billion dollars, where would you place it?</p><p>Climate adaptation-Ravi would be happy. Nutrition-I know the Rockefeller folks would be very, very happy. Disease elimination-Gates has been with us on that. Global jobs crisis-you talked a lot about that as well, President Tharman.</p><p>What are the big bets and the trade-offs for philanthropy to step up?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, President of the Republic of Singapore and Distinguished Patron of Philanthropy Asia Alliance: Well, I have a little less experience in spending a hundred billion dollars than Bill has, so I will address the question differently.</p><p>We have a problem. There's a step change that's taking place in the global aid landscape. It's not just the US. It's the European countries, and more broadly, you add it all up together - even with China stepping up somewhat - there's a significant reduction in aid monies. And I don't think that's going to change soon.</p><p>So we have to find ways in which this doesn't lead to catastrophe - greater global hunger, more epidemics, or other maladjustments and conflicts in the world.</p><p>It is possible to achieve this, but we've got to get more value out of every aid dollar spent.</p><p>We need a step up in resources - public sector resources within countries, philanthropic money, and private finance - but it's not just about volumes, but effectiveness.</p><p>So if you think of how we can best deploy even a billion dollars, I think we first have to refocus on building up the domestic capacity within countries for them to be more self-sufficient. For sure, many will still require significant international support, through the multilateral development banks, through various bilateral schemes and through initiatives such as what we are trying to grow here.</p><p>But building up domestic tax capacity, building up the ability to execute budgets more effectively, is an extremely important challenge, and is doable. It's not a hopeless case at all. What many don't realise is that in the lowest-income regions of the world, several countries have significantly increased their tax revenues - by at least two to three percentage points of GDP, without loss to economic growth. It's doable.</p><p>But there's a capacity issue. There are, of course, political issues in some countries, but there's a capacity issue. How can we digitise tax systems? How can we build more efficient administration of tax collection, and enforcement systems?</p><p>So that's a very important challenge, and there's an interaction between the efforts that countries themselves make and the amount of support they're going to get internationally: from philanthropies, from the MDBs, from other governments that still are providing bilateral support.</p><p>Developing capacity within countries has to be a renewed priority. Besides tax administration, there are other areas. Gates Foundation, amongst others, has funded the African CDC. Excellent example, well run, with exceptional leaders. A good example of how countries in Africa have gotten together to develop capabilities of their own.</p><p>There are other examples to do with training people to reform health and agricultural systems - training PhDs, Master's graduates digitising systems. There's still huge potential for capacity development in Asia and in the developing world at large. It has to be a priority.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Okay, we hear you then, President Tharman-build the capacity, and then we'll be ready for the challenges, whatever the challenge might be.</p><p>Bill-spending a hundred billion-to do good. You are the one with the most experience here on this stage. Where would you put it?</p><p>Bill Gates, Chair and Trustee, Gates Foundation: Yeah. So the Gates Foundation is celebrating its 25th anniversary. It was in the year 2000 when I first got started, and during those 25 years, we've given a little bit more than a hundred billion.</p><p>When we started out, we didn't know what impact we'd be able to have, and we saw some really awful things. You know, for example, because malaria was a disease only in poor countries, there was no work being done on malaria drugs or bed nets or any technique to reduce those deaths. When vaccines were first designed, they weren't cost-reduced. Vaccines like pneumococcus and rotavirus were so expensive, they were only going to children in rich countries-who were at almost no risk of dying of rotavirus-and over a million kids were dying of this diarrhoeal disease.</p><p>So we thought, okay, there's something that the market doesn't get. Because it's profit-driven, it does a lot of great things, but saving children's lives-it doesn't do well.</p><p>At the turn of the century, over 10 million children were dying every year who were under the age of five. And through not just us, but rich countries giving to things like Gavi, that bought vaccines, and the Global Fund, which worked on malaria, TB, and HIV-we've cut that child death rate from 10 million a year to below 5 million a year.</p><p>And so it's, you know, pretty phenomenal. Part of it is the R&amp;D piece-of inventing new tools-and part of it is the delivery piece, and that's where the partners have been key.</p><p>You know, to eradicate polio, the world needs to spend another about $5 billion to get rid of that. To eradicate malaria-which is still killing 600,000 a year-we'll need about $15 billion to do that.</p><p>Malnutrition is this evil thing that both makes you twice as likely to die-because you're just not as strong-and even if you do survive, your brain and your body never develop. And so 40 percent of kids in Sub-Saharan Africa don't achieve their potential.</p><p>So I go against all of those things. In fact, I'm lucky enough that over the next 10 years, because we've grown, I'll spend another hundred billion. But I would say-and the President made this point-you know, we could save lives for a few thousand dollars per life saved.</p><p>So if you buy bed nets, if you buy medicines for neglected tropical diseases-even a gift of a million dollars, or even less-can make a huge difference. Because the field of global health, even in the toughest countries, is now quite mature. We measure the outcome. We know what's working, what's not working. And we have a track record of success.</p><p>And so it's great-we're having some fellow philanthropists come together on health issues in this region, where people will be able to go and see the impact of their generosity.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know Bill, listening to you, I must say there's something I need to understand. You say it's your 25th anniversary, and anniversaries are full of celebration-a point of reflection and inflection-but this year has also been a year for some hard rethinks and resets for you. But you're full of optimism. Where does this optimism come from?</p><p>Bill Gates: Well, I would think of global health, which is the biggest area we work in. We work in agriculture and education and some other areas as well, but 70 percent of our money is in the research and the delivery of global health-because we saw such a tragedy and a market failure there.</p><p>I would divide global health into three eras. There's the last 25 years, with the great results. Then we have a period here which will last from four to ten years, where we have a lot less money. And some of these poor countries, particularly in Africa, are very indebted-and nobody's giving them the debt relief. So their financial situation is very, very weak.</p><p>And as was mentioned, the aid budgets-in the US, the tentative proposal is an 80 percent cut. We will go to the Congress and try to convince them to not be nearly that dramatic. But as Europe looks at its military spending and ageing society-and they've been the most generous, over twice as generous as other countries: Sweden and Norway in particular, but also France, Germany, the UK-we're going to have a tough period here.</p><p>And the only reason that the deaths won't go back to 10 million is that we do have innovative tools-and we have a pipeline of innovative tools. We have ways of protecting girls from getting HIV. We have new vaccines. We have an understanding of malnutrition. We have ways of stopping women from bleeding to death after delivery that only cost a few dollars in drugs.</p><p>So our teams come to Singapore and say, okay, let's find some of these research projects. Thank goodness for innovation-or else these funding cuts could drive us back almost to that 10 million a year. I'll be an advocate that the idea of helping children survive and preventing HIV deaths is no less important today. And so this sort of wave of not caring for other countries-I feel it'll be reversed. At least, I'll spend a lot of my time trying to make the case for that.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: To add to what Bill has said - and the thinking behind what you've been doing is very similar to our thinking in Singapore. We are faced with the shortage of development finance, and have to prioritise how it's going to be used. And apart from my point about building up capacity within beneficiary countries, we've got to deploy philanthropic and public monies as effectively as possible.</p><p>The approach you're talking about, and many of the examples you've been involved in like Gavi, have involved first investing in innovations, piloting them on a small scale to see what works, before then scaling up the interventions with proven impact. And I think that should be an important mindset in development funding - pilot, then scale up the proven interventions.</p><p>A reason for optimism is that it's actually working very well. If you look at Gavi, just as an example, every dollar given to Gavi and spent by Gavi on proven interventions leads eventually to $54 of returns. By returns, I mean not just financial returns, but broader economic and social returns-healthier and more productive lives for everyone.</p><p>And that's actually the type of thinking - thinking about impact, and on the full returns on what we spend - that should motivate philanthropic giving and investments, as well as motivate the global public sector. We are doing this not just out of the goodness of our hearts. We are doing this not just because there is an important moral cause-but because we are all better off living in a world where every country has populations that lead healthier and productive lives. We are all safer, and we are all better off.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Indeed, President Tharman. You know, each time we listen to you, each time we hear you, we are grateful that you are the patron of Philanthropy Asia Alliance. There's so much that needs to be done, and your wisdom has spurred us on. And we also know that-like Bill-you love innovation, and innovation in Asia is something you have told us repeatedly to be scaling, to be working hard on. Innovation, and what Asia can do for the world-what do you see of that?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Well, there's lots that, again, Bill will have to say, and there's lots that many of you are already doing. The innovations that catch the news typically are about breakthroughs in technology, which are extremely important. We can come back to that-the potential for example for AI to enable a whole set of more effective social interventions, or better agriculture.</p><p>But innovation also involves organisation. For instance, if you look at India, one of the unsung successes is what they call the Aspirational Districts Programme. A well-chosen name for the most underdeveloped districts in India. This was Prime Minister Modi's initiative. I believe Gates Foundation joined Piramal Foundation and Tata Trusts in helping to fund it.</p><p>It gives ownership to the community-developing community health workers, para-nurses, and data systems, supported from the centre - targeted especially at maternal health and health of the child in the earliest years. Monitoring growth, month by month, monitoring nutritional intake, and making sure that circle of actions and remedies is closed at the local level. I've visited some of those districts, and seen how they are working because they give ownership and agency on the ground to the people in the village themselves-who know who the mothers are, who know who the absent fathers are, who know who the kids are who are a little smaller than others, and where something needs to be done to remedy that before they end up stunted. It's a very interesting example of innovation that can be of interest beyond India, elsewhere in the developing world.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Asian solutions for the globe are just as important. Bill, you are in Southeast Asia. We know you are here on a very tight and busy schedule. Tell us what you're doing in Singapore, what you're going to be doing with Southeast Asia.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah, so I'm here for two days, but with a great agenda-seeing a lot of the leaders here. My Gates Foundation work is what I put the most time into, but I also do a lot of work on climate change through a group called Breakthrough Energy. And both of those organisations are very excited about what's going on in Singapore.</p><p>The Gates Foundation is putting an office here-to access the science, to partner with the philanthropic community.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: An office here in Singapore?</p><p>Bill Gates: Yes.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Gates is opening an office here in Singapore? Thank you for that.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah, it's really to partner with philanthropists, to partner with the research being done here. Likewise, Breakthrough Energy has a very deep relationship with Temasek and a growing relationship with GIC. We've done things like fund innovative clean energy work through what we call our fellows programme. So I'll get to meet the first four of those, and that's a growing programme we're doing together with the top universities here.</p><p>I would say that Asian innovation is a part of why I am so excited about the progress we can make in health. Initially, when we thought of Asian innovation, we mostly thought about low cost-which is a great thing. I mean, the lowest cost vaccines in the world are made in India, Indonesia-this region.</p><p>But more and more, the innovation is about cutting-edge work. Genomics data that, when you combine it with AI, will help us understand what is the disease prevalence, what differences are there across all the diverse populations here. One of the scenarios we have for AI is that just talking to your phone in whatever language you use, you should get medical advice that's as good or better than you would get if you had a doctor with you all of the time. That health scenario will be enabled by AI.</p><p>The farmers in this region need advice about weather, which variety, and plant disease. We're piloting using the AI to give them advice where it'll know about their soils and their land and what the pricing looks like. It's the innovation pipeline-a lot of which will be developed in this region-that means even with these aid cuts, although we will try and get them reversed, I do see even the toughest challenges like malaria, HIV-I do see us being able to solve those in the next 25 years.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, Bill, we have to ask you to add dengue to that list. You talk about malaria, which is definitely very important. But within Southeast Asia, and really with the tropical parts of the world getting warmer, we're seeing dengue in other parts of the world as well. Will you add that to the solutioning as well?</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. We've been a big funder. We were the ones who funded this Wolbachia work down in Australia. That was a Gates Grand Challenge back in 2003. We jointly funded the work in Yogyakarta with an Indonesian family foundation who funded that rollout. That has benefited - It doesn't completely get rid of the dengue, but it drops the level pretty dramatically.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: -by about 70 percent.</p><p>Bill Gates: And we have some of our vaccine partners, including Sanofi and Takeda, who've worked on vaccines. We're going to need a next-generation vaccine to completely solve it. The dengue vaccine turns out to be quite challenging, but it is possible. We funded the early development of this mRNA, and so a lot of the new vaccines will be reformulated. And instead of using a needle, which a lot of people don't like, we're just going to have a little patch that you can self-apply. And it doesn't have any pain-or so we hope.</p><p>Whether it's just in general to get higher vaccination rates, or particularly in a pandemic, the fact that you could distribute this thing and just self-apply it rather than going into healthcare would be pretty dramatic. And so there's a lot of lessons coming out of the COVID pandemic that will help us with the current infectious diseases, but also would allow us to deal far, far better when-and sadly, it's not if, it's when-the next big pandemic challenge comes around.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, we work very closely with the Gates team. So, you know, I'm sure dengue will be part of what's going on.</p><p>It sounds like we're asking for it, but it's something that we really go through quite a fair bit in Southeast Asia as well. It'll be great to see the malaria problem maybe broaden into a mosquito challenge for you.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. For some of our diseases-it sounds awful to say this-but we're almost glad there's some cases in rich areas, like dengue in Singapore. I mean, it's a terrible thing to say. But, you know, it means that the priority for doing that-you know, HIV, it's tragic that it's everywhere. But part of the reason a lot of global health things like PEPFAR, Global Fund, they got created because the citizens in the US could see the tragedy of HIV. And when you said, should anyone in the world die just because we don't have the $100 a year to buy these ARV medicines? We managed, at least in that time, to get a strong bipartisan response to that. That's one of the things that's at risk, and we're going to have to re-explain to US politicians why they should stay engaged in that.</p><p>When you have a disease like malaria or malnutrition that's really only in the poor countries, then we really need to get people to come and see it. Of course, here in Singapore, the range of income levels and disease burdens just in the region is quite dramatic. You know- in Papua New Guinea-there's still some significant burdens. And of course, this is a region where we'd love to get rid of both dengue and malaria and have that be an example so the rest of the world can do the same thing.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Indeed. Whatever we ask for through Philanthropy Asia Alliance, we ask not only for Singapore, but we ask for the region-because that's important to us.</p><p>Bill Gates: Fantastic.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: President Tharman, you know we've been following your speeches over the years around philanthropy as well. And really, it was at the inaugural PAS that you talked about the move-the need for that move-from cheque-book philanthropy to catalytic philanthropy. Have you seen philanthropists pick up on that idea?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: I think if you look at our new landscape of philanthropy, including the family offices, there's a generation of philanthropic leaders now who really want to see impact in what they're doing. And that impact is not completely dislodged from looking at financial returns, but they want more than that. They want to see social impact. They want to see a broader impact on the lives of beneficiaries.</p><p>So I think the thinking has shifted. And it's important now to develop the methods that allow us to measure impact so that-to go back to the earlier point-we can put more resources into proven interventions and scale them up.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, when you speak of the shift in generation-and from what we are seeing through some of our efforts throughout the Temasek Trust ecosystem-we find it very interesting that the younger, well, not quite philanthropists, but maybe would-be philanthropists through their own wealth management platforms-they save, they invest.</p><p>Or at least when I was growing up, if I was savvy about my personal finances, I would save well, I would invest well, and that was what my platform was all about. We have found that the wealth platforms of today are including philanthropy in it-the young people whom they are trying to attract onto their apps, their wealth apps-are asking for philanthropy options to be part of it. Because they know to be savvy today in your personal finances is to give as well as to save.</p><p>So that's been an interesting shift that we've seen as well. But how do we get more, Bill, of the young people at least to see their $1 million, their $10,000, or even their $100 as making a difference? Not everyone moves a hundred billion.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. Well, the Gates Foundation is trying to encourage philanthropy, both by people of great wealth-you know, we have a thing called the Giving Pledge that we have about 300 people who've committed to giving away the majority of their wealth during their lifetime or through their will. And so that's kind of a community.</p><p>But we also-you know, there's a day in the United States called Giving Tuesday, where we really talk about help your local teacher, help your local food bank, or help us succeed with polio eradication-where even $10 donations, you know, we say a bed net that protects a child, a vaccine that protects a girl from cervical cancer-that's actually $2 to buy that vaccine.</p><p>In the US, philanthropy is about 2 percent of the economy, so small compared to private sector and government, but globally it's about half a percent. And so the US is a little bit ahead on that. And it's interesting to think, okay, why is that? Is it the tax incentives? That may be part of it. Is it that we know the government can't solve all problems? And so there's this kind of self-reliance, local community groups-that's part of it.</p><p>We'd like to really spread this idea. A very big giving-you know, the most honourable givers are those who are actually making some sacrifice. And of course, when I give, I'm making no sacrifice at all. And so it's very praiseworthy. But helping people know that the money will be well used and they get a sense-I thought in the digital era, philanthropy would take off even more. As yet, we've only seen that in a very modest way.</p><p>And so I still believe we can do it, because we can connect the donor and have them see the outcome. We can't get everybody to go to the site of the actual work. And it's in those poor areas that the impact per dollar is dramatically higher. I'm not saying all philanthropy should be that, but that's-you know, I'm doing that with 90 percent of my resources.</p><p>In the US, about 5 percent of philanthropic giving leaves the country. So a lot of it is domestic, which is just fine.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: I think there's an important opportunity for philanthropy in this part of the world, which is moving beyond traditional charity towards addressing the largest problems that the region faces-and the world faces-through local action. And one of the least noticed large problems has to do with food systems and nutrition.</p><p>It's a looming crisis that isn't focused on very much because it's a slow-burning crisis. We have reached the limits of traditional ways of producing food - both by ordinary smallholder farmers as well as in industrial agriculture. We've reached the limits because it is too large a source of greenhouse gas emissions; we can't keep encroaching into natural forests and other natural ecosystems; and also because soil health has deteriorated very significantly.</p><p>In fact, there's been a step reduction in moisture in the soil over the last 20 years that now makes the land much more susceptible to droughts, much less able to be a sink for carbon, and much less able to grow plants with a reasonable yield. So we have a real challenge in how we grow food in future.</p><p>And on the demand side, we have the reverse. We have an explosion of demand. We have about 1.7 billion people being added to the world's population in the next 25 years. In fact, in the next 10 years, we have about 800 million people. And we have a much larger increase in food and nutrition demand - by some 50-75% over the next 25 years - because a large group of lower-middle-income people aspire to become middle class.</p><p>So food demand is going up. Supply is going to be constrained. We have to revolutionise food systems. We need a new Green Revolution-and a truly green revolution that uses less water, allows more moisture to stay in the soil, involves less methane emissions from rice cultivation especially, and less greenhouse gas emissions in general. And that still gives farmers a better yield.</p><p>And it's possible. One of the initiatives that Philanthropy Asia Alliance has launched is Decarbonising Rice. Using new seed varieties or new strains that are more resistant to droughts and floods. New cultivation techniques that use much less water. There have been large-scale trials now in India and elsewhere that have seen significant improvements in farmers' yields, a 50% reduction in water requirements, and 20-50% percent reductions in methane emissions.</p><p>So this is a large challenge. It involves all of us, because if we don't solve it, many more people in the world are going to go hungry in the years to come, and everyone else is going to see an increase in the cost of living, because food prices are going to go up. So we really need to focus on this - transform how rice is cultivated - in order that farmers can still have good incomes, populations can have good nutrition, including the poor especially, and the cost of living doesn't need to go up over time.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Thank you, President Tharman. Bill, before we go-thank you for opening the office in Singapore. What do you want to see from this region, where innovation and philanthropy are concerned?</p><p>Bill Gates: Well, we're already seeing a lot of great philanthropists here. And I think people are very family-oriented. And so having something even beyond whatever the family business is-having the family philanthropy, getting the family members working together and being proud about what they're able to achieve-I think we're seeing a big increase in that. And so we're excited to be here and learn together.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: We're excited to have you here. Bill Gates, thank you. President Tharman, thank you very much.

It's really a privilege to have the two of you here on stage, and it is a record turnout for us this year. I think we know why. Everyone's here to hear you and also to learn about how you are moving philanthropic capital-because we know that that's the capital that can tolerate the most risk, and the world is at risk.</p><p>It's a world where we are seeing rules-maybe all changed-trade flows affected, aid flows affected. So, if there was a mission you were on to solve one global challenge, what would it be? And if you had a hundred billion dollars, where would you place it?</p><p>Climate adaptation-Ravi would be happy. Nutrition-I know the Rockefeller folks would be very, very happy. Disease elimination-Gates has been with us on that. Global jobs crisis-you talked a lot about that as well, President Tharman.</p><p>What are the big bets and the trade-offs for philanthropy to step up?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam, President of the Republic of Singapore and Distinguished Patron of Philanthropy Asia Alliance: Well, I have a little less experience in spending a hundred billion dollars than Bill has, so I will address the question differently.</p><p>We have a problem. There's a step change that's taking place in the global aid landscape. It's not just the US. It's the European countries, and more broadly, you add it all up together - even with China stepping up somewhat - there's a significant reduction in aid monies. And I don't think that's going to change soon.</p><p>So we have to find ways in which this doesn't lead to catastrophe - greater global hunger, more epidemics, or other maladjustments and conflicts in the world.</p><p>It is possible to achieve this, but we've got to get more value out of every aid dollar spent.</p><p>We need a step up in resources - public sector resources within countries, philanthropic money, and private finance - but it's not just about volumes, but effectiveness.</p><p>So if you think of how we can best deploy even a billion dollars, I think we first have to refocus on building up the domestic capacity within countries for them to be more self-sufficient. For sure, many will still require significant international support, through the multilateral development banks, through various bilateral schemes and through initiatives such as what we are trying to grow here.</p><p>But building up domestic tax capacity, building up the ability to execute budgets more effectively, is an extremely important challenge, and is doable. It's not a hopeless case at all. What many don't realise is that in the lowest-income regions of the world, several countries have significantly increased their tax revenues - by at least two to three percentage points of GDP, without loss to economic growth. It's doable.</p><p>But there's a capacity issue. There are, of course, political issues in some countries, but there's a capacity issue. How can we digitise tax systems? How can we build more efficient administration of tax collection, and enforcement systems?</p><p>So that's a very important challenge, and there's an interaction between the efforts that countries themselves make and the amount of support they're going to get internationally: from philanthropies, from the MDBs, from other governments that still are providing bilateral support.</p><p>Developing capacity within countries has to be a renewed priority. Besides tax administration, there are other areas. Gates Foundation, amongst others, has funded the African CDC. Excellent example, well run, with exceptional leaders. A good example of how countries in Africa have gotten together to develop capabilities of their own.</p><p>There are other examples to do with training people to reform health and agricultural systems - training PhDs, Master's graduates digitising systems. There's still huge potential for capacity development in Asia and in the developing world at large. It has to be a priority.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Okay, we hear you then, President Tharman-build the capacity, and then we'll be ready for the challenges, whatever the challenge might be.</p><p>Bill-spending a hundred billion-to do good. You are the one with the most experience here on this stage. Where would you put it?</p><p>Bill Gates, Chair and Trustee, Gates Foundation: Yeah. So the Gates Foundation is celebrating its 25th anniversary. It was in the year 2000 when I first got started, and during those 25 years, we've given a little bit more than a hundred billion.</p><p>When we started out, we didn't know what impact we'd be able to have, and we saw some really awful things. You know, for example, because malaria was a disease only in poor countries, there was no work being done on malaria drugs or bed nets or any technique to reduce those deaths. When vaccines were first designed, they weren't cost-reduced. Vaccines like pneumococcus and rotavirus were so expensive, they were only going to children in rich countries-who were at almost no risk of dying of rotavirus-and over a million kids were dying of this diarrhoeal disease.</p><p>So we thought, okay, there's something that the market doesn't get. Because it's profit-driven, it does a lot of great things, but saving children's lives-it doesn't do well.</p><p>At the turn of the century, over 10 million children were dying every year who were under the age of five. And through not just us, but rich countries giving to things like Gavi, that bought vaccines, and the Global Fund, which worked on malaria, TB, and HIV-we've cut that child death rate from 10 million a year to below 5 million a year.</p><p>And so it's, you know, pretty phenomenal. Part of it is the R&amp;D piece-of inventing new tools-and part of it is the delivery piece, and that's where the partners have been key.</p><p>You know, to eradicate polio, the world needs to spend another about $5 billion to get rid of that. To eradicate malaria-which is still killing 600,000 a year-we'll need about $15 billion to do that.</p><p>Malnutrition is this evil thing that both makes you twice as likely to die-because you're just not as strong-and even if you do survive, your brain and your body never develop. And so 40 percent of kids in Sub-Saharan Africa don't achieve their potential.</p><p>So I go against all of those things. In fact, I'm lucky enough that over the next 10 years, because we've grown, I'll spend another hundred billion. But I would say-and the President made this point-you know, we could save lives for a few thousand dollars per life saved.</p><p>So if you buy bed nets, if you buy medicines for neglected tropical diseases-even a gift of a million dollars, or even less-can make a huge difference. Because the field of global health, even in the toughest countries, is now quite mature. We measure the outcome. We know what's working, what's not working. And we have a track record of success.</p><p>And so it's great-we're having some fellow philanthropists come together on health issues in this region, where people will be able to go and see the impact of their generosity.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know Bill, listening to you, I must say there's something I need to understand. You say it's your 25th anniversary, and anniversaries are full of celebration-a point of reflection and inflection-but this year has also been a year for some hard rethinks and resets for you. But you're full of optimism. Where does this optimism come from?</p><p>Bill Gates: Well, I would think of global health, which is the biggest area we work in. We work in agriculture and education and some other areas as well, but 70 percent of our money is in the research and the delivery of global health-because we saw such a tragedy and a market failure there.</p><p>I would divide global health into three eras. There's the last 25 years, with the great results. Then we have a period here which will last from four to ten years, where we have a lot less money. And some of these poor countries, particularly in Africa, are very indebted-and nobody's giving them the debt relief. So their financial situation is very, very weak.</p><p>And as was mentioned, the aid budgets-in the US, the tentative proposal is an 80 percent cut. We will go to the Congress and try to convince them to not be nearly that dramatic. But as Europe looks at its military spending and ageing society-and they've been the most generous, over twice as generous as other countries: Sweden and Norway in particular, but also France, Germany, the UK-we're going to have a tough period here.</p><p>And the only reason that the deaths won't go back to 10 million is that we do have innovative tools-and we have a pipeline of innovative tools. We have ways of protecting girls from getting HIV. We have new vaccines. We have an understanding of malnutrition. We have ways of stopping women from bleeding to death after delivery that only cost a few dollars in drugs.</p><p>So our teams come to Singapore and say, okay, let's find some of these research projects. Thank goodness for innovation-or else these funding cuts could drive us back almost to that 10 million a year. I'll be an advocate that the idea of helping children survive and preventing HIV deaths is no less important today. And so this sort of wave of not caring for other countries-I feel it'll be reversed. At least, I'll spend a lot of my time trying to make the case for that.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: To add to what Bill has said - and the thinking behind what you've been doing is very similar to our thinking in Singapore. We are faced with the shortage of development finance, and have to prioritise how it's going to be used. And apart from my point about building up capacity within beneficiary countries, we've got to deploy philanthropic and public monies as effectively as possible.</p><p>The approach you're talking about, and many of the examples you've been involved in like Gavi, have involved first investing in innovations, piloting them on a small scale to see what works, before then scaling up the interventions with proven impact. And I think that should be an important mindset in development funding - pilot, then scale up the proven interventions.</p><p>A reason for optimism is that it's actually working very well. If you look at Gavi, just as an example, every dollar given to Gavi and spent by Gavi on proven interventions leads eventually to $54 of returns. By returns, I mean not just financial returns, but broader economic and social returns-healthier and more productive lives for everyone.</p><p>And that's actually the type of thinking - thinking about impact, and on the full returns on what we spend - that should motivate philanthropic giving and investments, as well as motivate the global public sector. We are doing this not just out of the goodness of our hearts. We are doing this not just because there is an important moral cause-but because we are all better off living in a world where every country has populations that lead healthier and productive lives. We are all safer, and we are all better off.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Indeed, President Tharman. You know, each time we listen to you, each time we hear you, we are grateful that you are the patron of Philanthropy Asia Alliance. There's so much that needs to be done, and your wisdom has spurred us on. And we also know that-like Bill-you love innovation, and innovation in Asia is something you have told us repeatedly to be scaling, to be working hard on. Innovation, and what Asia can do for the world-what do you see of that?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: Well, there's lots that, again, Bill will have to say, and there's lots that many of you are already doing. The innovations that catch the news typically are about breakthroughs in technology, which are extremely important. We can come back to that-the potential for example for AI to enable a whole set of more effective social interventions, or better agriculture.</p><p>But innovation also involves organisation. For instance, if you look at India, one of the unsung successes is what they call the Aspirational Districts Programme. A well-chosen name for the most underdeveloped districts in India. This was Prime Minister Modi's initiative. I believe Gates Foundation joined Piramal Foundation and Tata Trusts in helping to fund it.</p><p>It gives ownership to the community-developing community health workers, para-nurses, and data systems, supported from the centre - targeted especially at maternal health and health of the child in the earliest years. Monitoring growth, month by month, monitoring nutritional intake, and making sure that circle of actions and remedies is closed at the local level. I've visited some of those districts, and seen how they are working because they give ownership and agency on the ground to the people in the village themselves-who know who the mothers are, who know who the absent fathers are, who know who the kids are who are a little smaller than others, and where something needs to be done to remedy that before they end up stunted. It's a very interesting example of innovation that can be of interest beyond India, elsewhere in the developing world.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Asian solutions for the globe are just as important. Bill, you are in Southeast Asia. We know you are here on a very tight and busy schedule. Tell us what you're doing in Singapore, what you're going to be doing with Southeast Asia.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah, so I'm here for two days, but with a great agenda-seeing a lot of the leaders here. My Gates Foundation work is what I put the most time into, but I also do a lot of work on climate change through a group called Breakthrough Energy. And both of those organisations are very excited about what's going on in Singapore.</p><p>The Gates Foundation is putting an office here-to access the science, to partner with the philanthropic community.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: An office here in Singapore?</p><p>Bill Gates: Yes.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Gates is opening an office here in Singapore? Thank you for that.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah, it's really to partner with philanthropists, to partner with the research being done here. Likewise, Breakthrough Energy has a very deep relationship with Temasek and a growing relationship with GIC. We've done things like fund innovative clean energy work through what we call our fellows programme. So I'll get to meet the first four of those, and that's a growing programme we're doing together with the top universities here.</p><p>I would say that Asian innovation is a part of why I am so excited about the progress we can make in health. Initially, when we thought of Asian innovation, we mostly thought about low cost-which is a great thing. I mean, the lowest cost vaccines in the world are made in India, Indonesia-this region.</p><p>But more and more, the innovation is about cutting-edge work. Genomics data that, when you combine it with AI, will help us understand what is the disease prevalence, what differences are there across all the diverse populations here. One of the scenarios we have for AI is that just talking to your phone in whatever language you use, you should get medical advice that's as good or better than you would get if you had a doctor with you all of the time. That health scenario will be enabled by AI.</p><p>The farmers in this region need advice about weather, which variety, and plant disease. We're piloting using the AI to give them advice where it'll know about their soils and their land and what the pricing looks like. It's the innovation pipeline-a lot of which will be developed in this region-that means even with these aid cuts, although we will try and get them reversed, I do see even the toughest challenges like malaria, HIV-I do see us being able to solve those in the next 25 years.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, Bill, we have to ask you to add dengue to that list. You talk about malaria, which is definitely very important. But within Southeast Asia, and really with the tropical parts of the world getting warmer, we're seeing dengue in other parts of the world as well. Will you add that to the solutioning as well?</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. We've been a big funder. We were the ones who funded this Wolbachia work down in Australia. That was a Gates Grand Challenge back in 2003. We jointly funded the work in Yogyakarta with an Indonesian family foundation who funded that rollout. That has benefited - It doesn't completely get rid of the dengue, but it drops the level pretty dramatically.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: -by about 70 percent.</p><p>Bill Gates: And we have some of our vaccine partners, including Sanofi and Takeda, who've worked on vaccines. We're going to need a next-generation vaccine to completely solve it. The dengue vaccine turns out to be quite challenging, but it is possible. We funded the early development of this mRNA, and so a lot of the new vaccines will be reformulated. And instead of using a needle, which a lot of people don't like, we're just going to have a little patch that you can self-apply. And it doesn't have any pain-or so we hope.</p><p>Whether it's just in general to get higher vaccination rates, or particularly in a pandemic, the fact that you could distribute this thing and just self-apply it rather than going into healthcare would be pretty dramatic. And so there's a lot of lessons coming out of the COVID pandemic that will help us with the current infectious diseases, but also would allow us to deal far, far better when-and sadly, it's not if, it's when-the next big pandemic challenge comes around.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, we work very closely with the Gates team. So, you know, I'm sure dengue will be part of what's going on.</p><p>It sounds like we're asking for it, but it's something that we really go through quite a fair bit in Southeast Asia as well. It'll be great to see the malaria problem maybe broaden into a mosquito challenge for you.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. For some of our diseases-it sounds awful to say this-but we're almost glad there's some cases in rich areas, like dengue in Singapore. I mean, it's a terrible thing to say. But, you know, it means that the priority for doing that-you know, HIV, it's tragic that it's everywhere. But part of the reason a lot of global health things like PEPFAR, Global Fund, they got created because the citizens in the US could see the tragedy of HIV. And when you said, should anyone in the world die just because we don't have the $100 a year to buy these ARV medicines? We managed, at least in that time, to get a strong bipartisan response to that. That's one of the things that's at risk, and we're going to have to re-explain to US politicians why they should stay engaged in that.</p><p>When you have a disease like malaria or malnutrition that's really only in the poor countries, then we really need to get people to come and see it. Of course, here in Singapore, the range of income levels and disease burdens just in the region is quite dramatic. You know- in Papua New Guinea-there's still some significant burdens. And of course, this is a region where we'd love to get rid of both dengue and malaria and have that be an example so the rest of the world can do the same thing.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Indeed. Whatever we ask for through Philanthropy Asia Alliance, we ask not only for Singapore, but we ask for the region-because that's important to us.</p><p>Bill Gates: Fantastic.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: President Tharman, you know we've been following your speeches over the years around philanthropy as well. And really, it was at the inaugural PAS that you talked about the move-the need for that move-from cheque-book philanthropy to catalytic philanthropy. Have you seen philanthropists pick up on that idea?</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: I think if you look at our new landscape of philanthropy, including the family offices, there's a generation of philanthropic leaders now who really want to see impact in what they're doing. And that impact is not completely dislodged from looking at financial returns, but they want more than that. They want to see social impact. They want to see a broader impact on the lives of beneficiaries.</p><p>So I think the thinking has shifted. And it's important now to develop the methods that allow us to measure impact so that-to go back to the earlier point-we can put more resources into proven interventions and scale them up.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: You know, when you speak of the shift in generation-and from what we are seeing through some of our efforts throughout the Temasek Trust ecosystem-we find it very interesting that the younger, well, not quite philanthropists, but maybe would-be philanthropists through their own wealth management platforms-they save, they invest.</p><p>Or at least when I was growing up, if I was savvy about my personal finances, I would save well, I would invest well, and that was what my platform was all about. We have found that the wealth platforms of today are including philanthropy in it-the young people whom they are trying to attract onto their apps, their wealth apps-are asking for philanthropy options to be part of it. Because they know to be savvy today in your personal finances is to give as well as to save.</p><p>So that's been an interesting shift that we've seen as well. But how do we get more, Bill, of the young people at least to see their $1 million, their $10,000, or even their $100 as making a difference? Not everyone moves a hundred billion.</p><p>Bill Gates: Yeah. Well, the Gates Foundation is trying to encourage philanthropy, both by people of great wealth-you know, we have a thing called the Giving Pledge that we have about 300 people who've committed to giving away the majority of their wealth during their lifetime or through their will. And so that's kind of a community.</p><p>But we also-you know, there's a day in the United States called Giving Tuesday, where we really talk about help your local teacher, help your local food bank, or help us succeed with polio eradication-where even $10 donations, you know, we say a bed net that protects a child, a vaccine that protects a girl from cervical cancer-that's actually $2 to buy that vaccine.</p><p>In the US, philanthropy is about 2 percent of the economy, so small compared to private sector and government, but globally it's about half a percent. And so the US is a little bit ahead on that. And it's interesting to think, okay, why is that? Is it the tax incentives? That may be part of it. Is it that we know the government can't solve all problems? And so there's this kind of self-reliance, local community groups-that's part of it.</p><p>We'd like to really spread this idea. A very big giving-you know, the most honourable givers are those who are actually making some sacrifice. And of course, when I give, I'm making no sacrifice at all. And so it's very praiseworthy. But helping people know that the money will be well used and they get a sense-I thought in the digital era, philanthropy would take off even more. As yet, we've only seen that in a very modest way.</p><p>And so I still believe we can do it, because we can connect the donor and have them see the outcome. We can't get everybody to go to the site of the actual work. And it's in those poor areas that the impact per dollar is dramatically higher. I'm not saying all philanthropy should be that, but that's-you know, I'm doing that with 90 percent of my resources.</p><p>In the US, about 5 percent of philanthropic giving leaves the country. So a lot of it is domestic, which is just fine.</p><p>President Tharman Shanmugaratnam: I think there's an important opportunity for philanthropy in this part of the world, which is moving beyond traditional charity towards addressing the largest problems that the region faces-and the world faces-through local action. And one of the least noticed large problems has to do with food systems and nutrition.</p><p>It's a looming crisis that isn't focused on very much because it's a slow-burning crisis. We have reached the limits of traditional ways of producing food - both by ordinary smallholder farmers as well as in industrial agriculture. We've reached the limits because it is too large a source of greenhouse gas emissions; we can't keep encroaching into natural forests and other natural ecosystems; and also because soil health has deteriorated very significantly.</p><p>In fact, there's been a step reduction in moisture in the soil over the last 20 years that now makes the land much more susceptible to droughts, much less able to be a sink for carbon, and much less able to grow plants with a reasonable yield. So we have a real challenge in how we grow food in future.</p><p>And on the demand side, we have the reverse. We have an explosion of demand. We have about 1.7 billion people being added to the world's population in the next 25 years. In fact, in the next 10 years, we have about 800 million people. And we have a much larger increase in food and nutrition demand - by some 50-75% over the next 25 years - because a large group of lower-middle-income people aspire to become middle class.</p><p>So food demand is going up. Supply is going to be constrained. We have to revolutionise food systems. We need a new Green Revolution-and a truly green revolution that uses less water, allows more moisture to stay in the soil, involves less methane emissions from rice cultivation especially, and less greenhouse gas emissions in general. And that still gives farmers a better yield.</p><p>And it's possible. One of the initiatives that Philanthropy Asia Alliance has launched is Decarbonising Rice. Using new seed varieties or new strains that are more resistant to droughts and floods. New cultivation techniques that use much less water. There have been large-scale trials now in India and elsewhere that have seen significant improvements in farmers' yields, a 50% reduction in water requirements, and 20-50% percent reductions in methane emissions.</p><p>So this is a large challenge. It involves all of us, because if we don't solve it, many more people in the world are going to go hungry in the years to come, and everyone else is going to see an increase in the cost of living, because food prices are going to go up. So we really need to focus on this - transform how rice is cultivated - in order that farmers can still have good incomes, populations can have good nutrition, including the poor especially, and the cost of living doesn't need to go up over time.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: Thank you, President Tharman. Bill, before we go-thank you for opening the office in Singapore. What do you want to see from this region, where innovation and philanthropy are concerned?</p><p>Bill Gates: Well, we're already seeing a lot of great philanthropists here. And I think people are very family-oriented. And so having something even beyond whatever the family business is-having the family philanthropy, getting the family members working together and being proud about what they're able to achieve-I think we're seeing a big increase in that. And so we're excited to be here and learn together.</p><p>Jennifer Lewis, Moderator: We're excited to have you here. Bill Gates, thank you. President Tharman, thank you very much. Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much.</p><p>Source: The Istana, Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0066239331</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FRH-YHW3-RTNP-60X0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"4685\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 5, 2025 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>N813211MM</classCode><className>FOUNDATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008XKB</classCode><className>PHILANTHROPY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000278</classCode><className>CHARITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D2JI</classCode><className>TRANSCRIPTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000186</classCode><className>BIOTECHNOLOGY &amp; GENETIC SCIENCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX000789</classCode><className>GENOMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>STX001880</classCode><className>PUBLIC HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000CUXE</classCode><className>HUNGER IN SOCIETY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"person\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>PE0009VZ7</classCode><className>BILL GATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>PE000DTPC</classCode><className>THARMAN SHANMUGARATNAM</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>GT113</classCode><className>ASIA</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GT115</classCode><className>EUROPE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>GC343</classCode><className>UNITED STATES</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

The Singapore Government is learning from the experience of the Sumatra squall on 17 September 2024, and reviewing our practices and responses in preparation for more of such extreme weather events in future.</p><p>2. First, in forecasting and providing early warning. While the Meteorological Service Singapore (MSS) can currently track the development of such squalls, MSS will invest more in forecasting their intensities and providing earlier warning to the public. MSS will also increase public education on early warning systems, in preparation for more adverse weather scenarios in future.</p><p>3. Second, to ensure the structural safety and resilience of buildings in Singapore against strong winds, the existing regulatory requirements for the design, installation and inspection of exterior features of buildings have taken into account the impact of wind forces. NParks also has in place a comprehensive tree management regime that enhances the resilience of its tree population against intense rains and winds. The Government will continue to update our regulations and practices where needed, and strengthen our climate adaptation policies to ensure that Singapore remains resilient and prepared for such extreme weather events, as they become more prevalent in the face of climate change.</p><p>[Category: Regulatory and Legal]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065217395</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DC0-24D1-JB5M-W11K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-06</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"346\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 14, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921120CC</classCode><className>LEGISLATIVE BODIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097C9</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS &amp; AUTHORITIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST0009XT1</classCode><className>METEOROLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N924120QC</classCode><className>OCEANOGRAPHIC &amp; ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DIIQ</classCode><className>SEVERE WIND</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST000DS9R</classCode><className>REGULATORY ACTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001434</classCode><className>PUBLIC SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><classCode>STX001434</classCode><className>PUBLIC SCHOOLS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000A0DN</classCode><className>SUMATRA, INDONESIA</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

A very good afternoon to everyone. Singapore aligns ourselves with the statement delivered by The Honourable Fiame Naomi Mataafa, Prime Minister of Samoa, that was delivered on behalf of AOSIS (Alliance of Small Island States).</p><p>2.Singapore is a tiny city-state, a low-lying island. Thirty percent of our island is less than five metres above sea level. Some of our fellow SIDS (Small Island Developing States) are even more at risk than us. Sea-level rise is therefore a global challenge, a clear and present danger. Cooperation and coordination at the global level is needed, as well as adherence to international law, and all this is essential for an effective response. Singapore fully supports the AOSIS Declaration on Sea-Level Rise and Statehood, which is a concrete step in the right direction. Notwithstanding the physical changes arising from climate change-related sea-level rise, the continued application, without reduction, of our maritime zones generated in accordance with UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea), as well as the rights and entitlements that flow from them, is of critical importance to SIDS.</p><p>3. Singapore has also been taking action to address the threats posed to us by sea-level rise. Let me just share two approaches.</p><p>4. First, coastal adaptation measures. Singapore has constructed seawalls and stone embankments covering 70 to 80 percent of our coastline in order to mitigate coastal erosion. We have launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute at the National University of Singapore to encourage further innovative solutions for coastal protection.</p><p>5. Second, we are trying to enlist nature to address sea-level rise. One example of this is the planting of mangroves and seagrasses that we believe act as natural barriers. Mangroves can reduce wave heights by up to 66 percent. This strengthens Singapore's coastal resilience and also restores ecosystems.</p><p>6. We are happy to share our experiences with other states. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme, we have the Sustainability Action Package that covers themes such as climate adaptation and resilience-building. We believe that the effective sharing of these ideas and expertise has a multiplier effect and we look forward to working alongside all of you.</p><p>7.

INTRODUCTION</p><p>A1. Mr Chairman, I thank Members for their questions and suggestions.</p><p>A2. The points made cover three key themes:</p><p>a. First, enhancing our pro-enterprise environment. I will cover how MOF agencies are simplifying rules for businesses. SPS Shawn Huang will address improving the experience of transacting with the Government and making government procurement more accessible.</p><p>b. Second, ensuring responsible, effective and efficient use of our public resources. I will speak on this.</p><p>c. Third, preparing for Singapore to meet intensifying long-term challenges, particularly climate change, and strengthening our social compact for a caring and inclusive society. Minister Indranee will cover these.</p><p>B. SIMPLIFYING RULES AND REDUCING COMPLIANCE COSTS FOR BUSINESSES</p><p>B1. Mr Chairman, Mr Liang Eng Hwa asked what MOF agencies are doing to simplify rules for a more pro-business environment.</p><p>B2. Rules and regulations exist for several reasons - from safeguarding people, property and the environment, to ensuring good governance and accountability. The Government has to strike a balance between these important objectives, and the need to encourage enterprise and innovation. Therefore, Singapore's approach has been to enact practical rules and review them regularly to streamline and remove outdated ones.</p><p>B3. The Inter-Ministerial Committee for Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, led by DPM Gan, was formed in April 2024 to further enhance regulatory efficiency and reduce compliance costs for businesses.</p><p>B4. Let me share some examples of what MOF agencies are doing to support this important area of work.</p><p>B5. First, IRAS will extend the grace period for businesses to begin charging GST, from one month to two months.</p><p>a. Currently, businesses expecting to cross the $1 million taxable turnover threshold within the next 12 months must register for and start charging GST within a month of forecast. This timeline can be tight for some SMEs.</p><p>b. The change will give SMEs more time to prepare. It will take effect from 1 July 2025, and benefit 1,500 businesses every year.</p><p>B6. Second, IRAS will progressively expand the requirement for intermediaries to pre-fill income information on behalf of self-employed persons, or SEPs for short.</p><p>a. About 87% of individual taxpayers today benefit from pre-filled income information by their employers and intermediaries for their income tax filing. However, many SEPs do not enjoy this convenience.</p><p>b. The intermediaries that engage the services of SEPs already have the income information of the SEPs, and are in a good position to provide this. It is more efficient for them to do so, than to have the individual SEPs fill in the information in their respective tax returns.</p><p>c. We started by requiring commission-paying intermediaries, such as real estate agencies and insurance providers, to submit income information for their agents and this has benefitted over 100,000 self-employed commission agents.</p><p>d. IRAS plans to bring more intermediaries on board, and has been encouraging and engaging private hire car and taxi operators, as well as the delivery platforms. I urge these intermediaries to come on board as soon as possible.</p><p>B7. We have also been simplifying rules where we can.</p><p>a. One example is the Fixed Expense Deduction Ratio, or FEDR, which allows qualifying businesses the option of claiming their tax deductions for business expenses based on a prescribed percentage of their gross income earned. This is simpler and more convenient compared to using actual allowable business expenses.</p><p>b. The FEDR was first introduced in Year of Assessment 2019 for private-hire car and taxi drivers, and subsequently extended to commission agents and delivery workers. The utilisation has been high, which shows that this is a good option for many of our workers.</p><p>c. We will be consulting stakeholders on how the FEDR can be expanded to support more small businesses and self-employed persons.</p><p>B8. We are reducing and removing regulations where possible.</p><p>a. IRAS will drop the requirement for second-hand goods dealers to seek approval before using the GST Gross Margin Scheme.</p><p>b. The scheme allows second-hand goods dealers to charge GST on the gross margin of the sale, rather than the full sale price. This is because GST is often priced into the base cost from earlier transactions.</p><p>c. As most dealers are generally compliant with the scheme's requirements, IRAS will remove the need for them to obtain approval, starting from 1 July this year.</p><p>d. This will streamline the compliance process, particularly for new or smaller second-hand goods dealers.</p><p>B9. Sir, ACRA is also actively streamlining processes for companies.</p><p>a. There is a requirement today for companies to disclose their directors' interest in shares or debentures in the director's statement.</p><p>b. Over the years, ACRA has received an increasing number of requests from companies to be exempted from this requirement. In cases where all the company shareholders agree, ACRA will grant these exemption requests.</p><p>c. ACRA has recently streamlined this process such that non-listed companies do not need to seek exemption, as long as consent from all shareholders is sought. This will reduce administrative burden and save companies $200 in application fees and we expect around 1,500 companies to benefit every year.</p><p>d. Information of the company's shareholding will remain publicly accessible and this maintains corporate transparency.</p><p>B10. These are part of the ongoing efforts to improve our rules and processes. In the interest of time, I am not able to share the full range but this is an ongoing work. We will continue to engage businesses, and also our frontline officers and colleagues, and solicit their ideas to jointly improve our regulatory landscape.<br/><br/>B11. This approach is also in line with the spirit of Forward Singapore. It reinforces in our agencies the importance of working with citizens and businesses, while taking on board their feedback to continually improve our policies, rules and processes.</p><p>C. RESPONSIBLE, EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT USE OF PUBLIC RESOURCES</p><p>C1. Our government spending over this term has delivered good outcomes for Singapore as detailed in the biennial Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review Reports.</p><p>SPENDING EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY</p><p>C2. We are continually looking at how we can transform and improve the way we operate.</p><p>C3. Mr Saktiandi Supaat asked about resource reviews and improving budget efficiency. Our budgeting framework is designed with efficiency in mind:</p><p>a. We regularly review the block budgets for Ministries.</p><p>b. MOF also applies controls to spending and manpower growth to drive agency transformation and yield savings, which are returned to MOF for central reallocation towards emerging priorities.</p><p>C4. I agree with Mr Saktiandi that it is important to have strong collaboration and coordination across Ministries. MOF actively encourages coordinated service delivery, where there are synergies.</p><p>a. For example, we saved $2 billion and 44 hectares of land with the 4-in-1 East Coast Integrated Depot, which combines three MRT depots and one bus depot.</p><p>b. The ServiceSG Centres are another example. They offer residents one-stop access to about 600 Government services from over 25 agencies. Citizen satisfaction across ServiceSG Centres was consistently above 90 percent for the last three years.</p><p>C5. Resourcing levers can be used to drive transformation on a whole-of-Government basis. We use joint budgets for issues that straddle multiple agencies, to streamline efforts, check against resource duplication, and enhance accountability for shared outcomes.</p><p>C6. We also created the WOG Public Service Transformation Budget in 2022. This provides agencies seed funding to pilot innovative and transformative ideas, if the proposals involve inter-agency collaboration.</p><p>C7. I thank Mr Edward Chia for his suggestion on tracking the time taken from policy ideation to implementation. Sir, the timelines vary across projects, depending on factors such as their complexity and the resources required. We will continue to deliver our projects in an efficient and cost-effective manner.</p><p>C8. We regularly review our internal processes to improve efficiencies. For instance, we shortened the Gateway evaluation for large development projects to speed up the approval process. Mr Liang highlighted the need to continually enhance effectiveness and governance. This is supported by programme evaluation, which helps us to understand whether a programme is achieving its objectives, and whether improvements are needed.</p><p>C9. I want to be quite clear that these are processes that we have in place, and these are efforts that we will continue to improve. But as PM reminds us, it does not mean that we are perfect today. There is room for improvement and we will work hard to make those continuous improvements. This is something we will continue to do.</p><p>GST-EXCLUSIVE PRICING BY HOTEL AND F&amp;B ESTABLISHMENTS</p><p>C10. Mr Louis Chua asked about the concession for hotel and F&amp;B establishments that impose a service charge to display GST-exclusive prices.</p><p>a. This concession was granted in 1994, based on industry feedback that it would be costly and operationally challenging to maintain and display separate price lists for take-away items and dine-in items as service charge would be imposed only on the latter.</p><p>b. The concession is to help reduce business costs. But clarity for consumers is also important, and businesses that rely on this concession must display a prominent statement informing consumers that prices shown are subject to service charge and GST.</p><p>c. This practice has now been in place for three decades and we last reviewed it in 2022. I do not think most consumers would be confused, as Mr Chua claimed. Conversely, removing the concession may lead to more confusion, and also increase costs for businesses as they would now need to print multiple sets of menus and price lists.</p><p>FISCAL MANAGEMENT OF PROGRESSIVE WAGE CREDIT SCHEME</p><p>C11. Ms He Ting Ru asked about the Progressive Wage Credit Scheme (or PWCS). This is a scheme that we have put in place. It is currently due to cease in 2026. We will review closer to the date, whether to continue or to stop, bearing in mind the economic conditions at that time, because we are in a more uncertain global environment.</p><p>C12. The PWCS is not a broad-based subsidy for all companies. To get PWCS, the employer has to pay their lower-wage workers a wage increase, then they can qualify for co-funding from Government.</p><p>C13. So the purpose is for the government to co-fund and share some of the costs of helping our lower-wage workers to earn a higher income. Because we want employers to pay the lower-wage workers a higher salary, we share with employers part of this cost of paying the lower-wage workers a higher salary. This is an important part of our social compact, which I think Ms He will agree.</p><p>C14. I do not think Ms He is suggesting that we should stop providing support for employers, especially our SMEs. This is not in lieu of other schemes we have in place to improve productivity. In fact, this is something that we put in place specifically to help employers to be able to share some of the costs where they are paying their lower-wage workers a higher salary.</p><p>C15. On productivity, we have many other schemes that we will continue to work, through our Trade Association Chambers, industry associations, companies, as well as the labour movement, through the Company Training Committees (CTCs), to help companies to improve productivity. Because I agree with Ms He that for the wage increases to be sustainable, it must go together with productivity improvements.</p><p>I just made an observation here that what Ms He is saying seems to be a little bit different from what Associate Professor Jamus Lim said during the Budget debate. If I heard him correctly, he suggested that wage increases can happen with or without productivity improvements. But I agree with Ms He's point that the two over time need to move in tandem. It is more sustainable.</p><p>SOUND FISCAL AND RESERVES POLICIES</p><p>C16. Chairman, Mr Liang spoke about responsible management of our fiscal resources and reserves. Mr Saktiandi asked how the Government ensures fiscal prudence and responsibility.</p><p>C17. Sir, as PM mentioned, our current fiscal position is healthy. We have spent within our means and planned ahead for structural spending needs, like rising healthcare expenditure and climate adaptation.</p><p>a. This allows the Government to follow through on our commitments, without borrowing or using more of our reserves for immediate needs and recurrent spending.</p><p>b. This fiscal discipline of maintaining a balanced budget has worked well for Singapore, and we must strive to sustain this.</p><p>C18. Our reserves, which have been carefully managed over generations, are another source of strength and national resilience, especially during a crisis.</p><p>a. During the Global Financial Crisis and COVID-19 pandemic, our reserves protected Singaporeans and placed us in a better position than many other countries. We were able to use our reserves for public health, social and economic support measures that saved lives and livelihoods, and enabled Singapore to bounce back and emerge stronger.</p><p>b. Our Past Reserves also generate a sustainable and steady stream of income that goes into our budget every year. The Net Investment Returns Contribution now accounts for about a fifth of annual government revenue.</p><p>C19. Mr Louis Chua spoke about the importance of transparency, accountability and governance of our investment entities.</p><p>C20. Sir, we have discussed and explained this many times. There are structures and processes in place to ensure that our investment entities, GIC and Temasek, are good stewards of our reserves for the benefit of all Singaporeans.</p><p>C21. On governance, the Government ensures that each entity has a competent Board in place to oversee its Management. The Government holds the Board accountable for instilling good corporate governance and achieving good long-term returns according to its mandate.</p><p>C22. At the same time, the Government does not direct or influence the investment decisions of our investment entities. This segregation of roles allows our investment entities to invest professionally with a long-term orientation. That is why during the MAS COS earlier, Mr Chua also acknowledged that it would not be a good idea for the Government to require GIC to invest part of its portfolio in the local equities market.</p><p>C23. On transparency, we have put out a lot of information on our reserves. Temasek's net portfolio value and MAS' official foreign reserves are public information. All our entities publish information on their portfolio returns. We have also published information on our reserves management framework and governance on the MOF website.</p><p>C24. On performance, the Government does not look at one single parameter. Neither do we focus only on short-term performance. Instead, we assess our entities based on their mandates and performance over the long term, and consider factors such as diversification of portfolio and risk-adjusted returns, which measure investment returns relative to the risk taken.</p><p>C25. Our investment entities have performed creditably over the long term. Given the increase in market volatility in recent years, some variation from market indices is to be expected. What is key is that our entities continue to navigate the uncertainty while maintaining a disciplined, long-term approach to generating sustainable returns.</p><p>C26. Stewardship and accountability are key principles we abide by when managing the reserves. We have benefitted from the careful work of previous generations. This Government believes that we must continue to maintain the same fiscal discipline and provide a strong financial foundation for both current and future generations of Singaporeans.</p><p>[Category: Investment Banking &amp;

Working Group I deals with the physical science basis of climate change, Working Group II with climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and Working Group III with climate change mitigation. </p><p> Working Group II is split into two offices, one in Singapore and one based in Delft, Netherlands. </p><p> We, in the Singapore-based technical support unit of the IPCC, together with Delft, have been tasked to lead the report and are keen to ensure that this special report is as inclusive as possible. </p><p> That aspiration underpins our aim to actively involve experts, urban practitioners and civil society in developing the report. </p><p> There are multiple opportunities to participate, and we are inviting early-career scientists, urban planners and regional policymakers to contribute insights and perspectives, ensuring that the report reflects the unique challenges and opportunities faced by cities in diverse physical, spatial and social contexts.</p><p> We hope that these efforts will foster a stronger sense of ownership among urban stakeholders in the region and beyond, to ensure that they feel represented by the report, and make its findings more relevant for action.</p><p> A call to action A report that offers solutions is key as we need science to be translated into decisions that can help cities achieve their sustainability targets. </p><p> Cities will not reach their climate goals without the support and active engagement of those who live, work and make decisions within them. </p><p> For policymakers, the responsibility of building sustainable cities lies largely with those who shape policies and allocate resources. </p><p> The special report will encourage policymakers to implement progressive policies that both reduce physical climate risk and promote low-emissions living by default. </p><p> Imagine a city where energy-efficient housing is the standard, public transportation is widely accessible and affordable, and green spaces are integrated into every neighbourhood. Such environments reduce the need for individual emissions-related decisions and make climate-friendly living the norm.</p><p> For urban practitioners, such as architects, engineers and urban planners, and scientists, they have the expertise to reimagine cities in ways that are functional, resilient to climate risk and sustainable in lifestyle. </p><p> The IPCC report will provide these professionals with the scientific evidence needed to design and implement urban infrastructure resilient to heat, droughts, floods and other hazards, ensure energy efficiency and renewable energy, and incorporate nature-based solutions into urban landscapes. </p><p> Cities are made by and for the people who live in them, and urban residents can play a crucial role by supporting sustainable local initiatives, advocating for green policies and making low-carbon choices in their daily lives. </p><p> By sharing regional insights, the special report will provide a toolkit of best practices, showing cities how to tackle climate challenges in ways that resonate with local contexts.</p><p> Now is the time for urban residents, businesses, civil society organisations, policymakers and professionals to get involved. </p><p> For residents, this means staying informed, advocating for policies that prioritise sustainability and participating in local climate initiatives. </p><p> For policymakers and urban practitioners, it means contributing to the report's recommendations to create environments where people and nature can thrive together. </p><p> Ultimately, the cities we shape today will determine the lives we lead tomorrow. </p><p> The IPCC special report on cities is a call to action for all of us to harness the full potential of our cities in the climate fight, ensuring that they are resilient, inclusive and sustainable for generations to come.</p><p> Dr Winston Chow is the co-chair  of Working Group II of the UN's leading climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Dr Mukesh Gupta is the science officer of the working group, which focuses on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation. Both authors are based at Singapore Management University, and their research looks into climate resilience and strategies to adapt to climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A resident wading through flood waters at a convenience store in Chiang Mai on Oct 6 after Typhoon Yagi swept through Northern Thailand in September.

Good morning. I am delighted to speak once again at this Forum.</p><p>2. Accelerating sustainable development and climate action is urgent. If recent climate projections are anything to go by, we will experience more extreme weather events. There is a need to both mitigate climate change and adapt to climate change. SingCham is bringing the adaptation imperative to the fore this year by focusing on \"Building Our Resilient Future: Innovations for Sustainable Living\".</p><p>3. The partnership between the government, private and people sectors is indispensable in tackling this challenge head on. Governments are the vanguard of long-term policy planning, companies are the forerunners of innovation, and people are the source of ideas. All three sectors require and complement each other to mount robust responses to challenges and seize opportunities. Let me share some examples.</p><p>4. Without each other, the Suzhou Industrial Park, Sino-Singapore Tianjin Eco-City, the Sino-Singapore Guangzhou Knowledge City and the Sino-Singapore Nanjing Eco Hi-Tech Island would not have materialised. These beacons of sustainable industrial and urban development were outcomes of government vision and facilitation, industry innovation and investment, and government-industry collaboration and integration.</p><p>5. Second, as evidenced by the China-Singapore Free Trade Agreement Further Upgrade Protocol, we are enhancing our bilateral economic ties whilst recognising the importance of sustainable development. I encourage enterprises to leverage the opportunities created by the CSFTA to engage in substantive and mutually beneficial cooperation.</p><p>6. And third, the Singapore-China Youth Interns Exchange Scheme. The cultural similarities between Singapore and China have allowed the platform to serve as a safe space for the cross-fertilisation of ideas among talented youth for innovative and out-of-the-box solutions.</p><p>7. But the partnership between the government and private sector is not naturally harmonious and should not be taken for granted. Governments are inclined to regulate and are subject to political imperatives; while industries desire certainty and to maximise commercial outcomes. The imposition of tariffs on environmental goods and services such as EVs, as well as the supposed use of sustainability standards to determine market access in some parts of the world is an example. The need for governments and industries to collaborate is greater than ever.</p><p>8. Singapore and China differ in size and circumstances, but the adverse impacts of climate change on economic development and social well-being are equally felt. We have announced our respective climate mitigation and adaptation policies and plans such as the China National Climate Adaptation Strategy 2035 and the Singapore Green Plan 2030. Both include existential issues such as food security, water resource management, as well as infrastructure and coastal resilience strategies and plans.</p><p>9. In a few weeks, COP-29 will convene in Azerbaijan, and will among other issues, deal with the priorities of adaptation, including support for national adaptation plans and addressing the adaptation finance gap. Regardless of the outcome of discussions, Singaporean companies should accelerate innovation and partnerships in China. Beyond the commercial returns, Singapore companies will widen and deepen their expertise, and help build a Resilient Singapore with Innovations for a Sustainable Singapore.</p><p>10.

The Agreement was signed virtually between Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations Grace Fu, and Ghana's Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation Ophelia Hayford.<br/><br/>After the signing, both countries will commence with the ratification process and operationalise the Agreement. This sets out a legally binding framework and processes for the generation and international transfer of carbon credits between Singapore and Ghana, aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.<br/><br/>This collaboration will advance both countries' climate ambition and channel financing towards additional mitigation efforts. The carbon credit projects authorised under the Implementation Agreement will seek to promote sustainable development and generate benefits for local communities, such as creation of jobs, access to clean water, improved energy security, and reduction of environmental pollution.<br/><br/>Under the Implementation Agreement, project developers will be required to make a contribution equivalent to 5% share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana, which helps Ghana prepare for and adjust to the impacts of climate change. They will also be required to cancel 2% of authorised carbon credits at first issuance to ensure additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions.<br/><br/>Under Singapore's International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, eligible ICCs generated under this Implementation Agreement may be used by Singapore-based carbon tax-liable companies to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.<br/><br/>Minister Fu said, \"Singapore and Ghana share many mutual interests in the sustainability sphere. The conclusion of the Implementation Agreement is testament to our shared commitment to advance global climate action through high-integrity carbon markets. The carbon credit projects that are implemented under this Agreement will generate climate benefits as well as benefits to our economies. Singapore will continue our efforts to work with like-minded partners like Ghana to co-create opportunities for a sustainable future.\"<br/><br/>This is the second Implementation Agreement for Singapore, after the first with Papua New Guinea which was signed in December 2023.</p><p>[Category: IT Services, IT Consulting &amp;

Good morning. I am very happy to join you today for the inaugural Coastal and Flood Resilience Leaders Summit, held in conjunction with the Singapore International Water Week 2024.<br/><br/>2. Water is an integral part of the planetary ecosystem. It supports lives and nurtures the food chains that feed humanity.</p><p>Mismanagement of our water ecosystem contributes to climate change such as over-drawing of water, lowering of water table, which has resulted in higher risk of forest fires. And in return, climate change unleashes extraordinary power through typhoons that destroy properties and lives. While mitigation will always be a priority in climate action, we have to deal with the impacts of climate change now.</p><p>Adaptation to a warmer planet, with greater unpredictability of the weather system, and changing rainfall patterns is a present-day priority. Policy makers have to consider a wide range of water-related issues in an integrated way - by incorporating decisions such as water security and allocation of water; water safety and protection of water sources; flood mitigation and coastal protection.<br/><br/>3. It is thus timely that we now include climate adaptation as one of the key pillars of the Singapore International Water Week. By pooling together the expertise and experiences of global stakeholders, this long-standing platform provides an ideal opportunity for all of us to jointly develop best practices that will strengthen our cities and communities against climate change threats.<br/><br/>Singapore's Experience in Climate Adaptation<br/><br/>4. Singapore is susceptible to the effects of sea level rise.</p><p>Around 30 per cent of our island is less than 5 metres above mean sea level and potentially affected by the combined impact of rising sea levels, storm surges and high tides. Enhancing coastal and flood resilience is a complex endeavour that requires new capabilities and skillsets and coordinated planning and implementation.<br/><br/>5. In 2020, we appointed PUB as our national coastal protection agency to address both coastal and inland flood risks holistically. PUB is tasked to develop a set of comprehensive strategies to enhance Singapore's flood resilience against both sea level rise and extreme rain events. An example of how flood resilience and coastal protection are considered in an integrated and holistic manner is the Marina Barrage. This flood control infrastructure involves the use of crest gates and pumps to regulate the water levels of the Marina Bay in times of heavy rain to reduce the risk of flooding, while serving its water supply function. It has also become an icon of the city landscape, and a popular destination for recreational activities. Another exciting project ahead of us is the Long Island proposal. This is a proposed solution for coastal and flood protection for a stretch of over 10km of coastline, with twelve outlet drains discharging stormwater from inland for flood resilience, while concurrently incorporating coastal protection function. At the same time, it has the potential of creating more land to meet future development needs with new recreational opportunities for the East Coast.<br/><br/>6. While we are in our early stage of building coastal protection, we have done a few things.</p><p>First, since 2021, we have demarcated our entire coastline into eight parts and begun site-specific studies progressively. These studies seek to develop and explore the feasibility of various coastal protection measures, taking into account site characteristics, opportunities, and constraints. The Long Island project was one such outcome.</p><p>Second, we are going through legislative changes to clarify and delineate the roles and responsibilities for coastal protection. As the site-specific studies progress, we will need this clarity to implement the required coastal protection measures across our coastline as multiple land owners and stakeholders are involved.</p><p>Third, we are building our knowledge in understanding and addressing flood risks. We have launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Management Research Programme in March last year with a funding support of S$125 million, or about USD$90 million. Under this programme, we will house our Centre of Excellence, named the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (CFI) Singapore. For the first tranche of research projects, the Centre has initiated nine projects in areas such as innovative engineering, hybrid solutions, and understanding of local coastal processes. CFI Singapore and its partners are training more than eighty undergraduate and graduate students as well as working professionals to provide a strong pipeline of talent in the field of coastal protection. To learn more about the nine projects, I encourage you to visit CFI Singapore's booth at the Level 1 Expo.</p><p>Here, I am pleased to announce that CFI Singapore will be starting on eight more research projects, ranging from understanding coastal science processes to improved modelling methods. For example, a new project by Nanyang Technological University aims to design barriers made from jute, a composite of plant fibre and calcium waste. These barriers could function as submerged beach berms to reduce wave energy and promote soil accumulation, thus serving as a potential eco-friendly measure to enhance coastal resilience.</p><p>I am also pleased to share that PUB has launched an applied research grant call in May. The grant call considers five topics: sustainable materials, smart structural health monitoring, decision making for adaptive planning, innovative solutions, and sensors for sediment transport.</p><p>Fourth, we are building capacity and capability in our industry, engineering services in particular, to deliver future coastal protection measures. One such effort is a new Code of Practice for Coastal Protection, which will establish common standards for design, operation, and maintenance, to guide the industry in implementing effective measures.</p><p>To enable closer partnership between the public and private sectors, I am pleased to announce that the Singapore Water Association will be launching a new Coastal Protection Chapter. With this new Chapter, we aim to establish a three-way intermediary between the industry, institutes of higher learning, and government agencies. The Singapore Water Association will be signing a tripartite Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the CFI Singapore and the Forum for Climate Change Adaptation, FCCA. The FCCA is a ground-up initiative to bring professionals, practitioners, and researchers together to share, collaborate, and co-create solutions for climate change adaptation. With the MOU, we envision closer collaboration amongst stakeholders through knowledge sharing sessions, post-graduate courses, as well as innovation and translation efforts.</p><p>Call for International Collaboration</p><p>7. As we seek to address our common challenge of coastal and flood risks, there is clearly potential for cross-border partnerships and knowledge exchange. Demand for innovative and cost-effective solutions and expertise will grow, and along with it, the opportunities and prospects for business.<br/><br/>8. Singapore is committed to international climate action, through the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's (IPCC) Seventh Assessment Report, AR7. Singapore will be supporting the IPCC Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability, which is co-chaired by Professor Winston Chow. We will be hosting the Technical Support Unit at the Singapore Management University, which will further global understanding of the importance of adaptation.<br/><br/>9. Singapore is also keen to contribute to the understanding of changing climate in South East Asia. The Centre for Climate Research Singapore has released updated climate projections (V3 for version 3) in January. Singapore is sharing the V3 data with the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre and through platforms such as the Coordinated Regional Downscaling Experiment for the Southeast Asia Region or CORDEX-SEA.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>10. In conclusion, we would like to invite cities and countries across the world, to partner with Singapore in your journeys to address the pressing need for climate adaptation.<br/><br/>11. Leveraging a global forum like SIWW, the Coastal and Flood Resilience Cities Roundtable provided a platform for city officials and regulators to exchange experiences and insights on climate adaptation. Today's summit will further foster meaningful conversations and create impact. We hope that SIWW and its events will continue to serve as catalysts for these collaborative efforts to take shape and bear fruit in the coming years.</p><p>[Category: Utilities, Water Utilities, Events]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0064417982</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9R-WG91-DXMP-K0R2-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1563\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 20, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Real Property Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QUUyRTcxRURBNEY2NEE2MDk3QzBCNzRDOEY0NTZDQzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJDMTRFMzUwNzA0NEU1Q0ExMTg0NzRENTA0QUIyRjk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkI1NUVDMDA0Nzk5NDJFM0EzQjMyRjQ4NUI1RjZFODc</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX000317</classCode><className>COASTAL AREAS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS67</classCode><className>COASTAL CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001074</classCode><className>MARINE RESOURCES MANAGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FY4</classCode><className>SALTWATER ECOSYSTEMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DL6M</classCode><className>SUSTAINABILITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001660</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000733</classCode><className>FLOOD CONTROL</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000735</classCode><className>FLOODS &amp;

But details on how this could be achieved remain unfinished.</p><p> Under the Paris Agreement, developed countries -- which are historically responsible for the bulk of global emissions -- are obligated to provide climate finance to developing countries as they often bear the brunt of the worst impacts of climate change despite contributing the least emissions. </p><p> The huge shortfall, coupled with unfinished details on how the rest of the money is to be mobilised, leaves emerging markets -- many of which are in Asia -- facing the daunting task of having to undertake system-wide energy transition efforts, implement climate adaptation projects and cope with natural disasters, all on a tight budget. </p><p> Getting things movingBefore the finalisation of these details though, Singapore already got things moving with the launch of a blended finance initiative -- known as the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (Fast-P) -- at COP28 last year. </p><p> The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has been making a push to scale up blended finance transactions over the last few years as emerging markets in Asia typically are fiscally constrained, and have limited access to private capital. </p><p> To this end, the country announced at COP29 -- one year after Fast-P was launched -- that it will provide up to US$500 million as concessional capital to the initiative, by matching every dollar of concessional capital committed by other partners also involved.</p><p> It was a very strategic move considering that the tiny but very rich nation-state has been facing pressure by other developed countries to be a donor country to the climate finance fund. Singapore does not have a mandatory obligation to provide climate finance under the Paris Agreement, as it is treated as a developing country in international negotiations. </p><p> The idea is for Fast-P to build up concessional capital of US$1 billion in total -- if other partners can match Singapore's commitment -- and then utilise this pool to crowd in up to US$4 billion of commercial capital. </p><p> This brings the total amount that could be potentially mobilised to US$5 billion, which is the target Fast-P aimed to reach when it was first announced one year ago. </p><p> A step forwardThis move, which has been commended by industry observers, is definitely a step forward in mobilising the capital this region needs for climate action. </p><p> The hope is that this initiative may help de-risk climate projects in Asia, and encourage more private-sector participation. Businesses in the region can develop a pipeline of investable projects, which can then be vetted to ensure it meets environmental and financial standards to increase confidence among private investors. </p><p> Blended finance is not new. It has historically been used in the development finance and impact finance sectors, but such transactions are often bespoke and complex, hindering its scalability. </p><p> The approach adopted by MAS aims to overcome some of these challenges. Instead of structuring such transactions on a project-by-project basis, Fast-P seeks to build three different portfolios -- with different investment focuses -- through this pool of money before it gets deployed to multiple projects. </p><p> By designing blended finance mechanisms in such a manner, various sources of capital can help to achieve a diversity of risk and returns. It also helps to scale such transactions as investors would not have to renegotiate the terms of how their capital is to be blended for every individual project. </p><p> However, blended finance is not a silver bullet to solve the climate financing gap in emerging Asia. </p><p> Even for blended finance initiatives such as Fast-P that try to break away from convention, there is still a lot of time spent trying to meet the different investment mandates, risk appetites and time horizons of various stakeholders. </p><p> Multi-development banks may have a long time horizon, but private investors typically have a shorter timeframe of about 10 years, beyond which they expect to be able to recycle their capital. Governments are committed for the duration that the assets being invested in will remain on their territory. </p><p> The attributes of climate-related projects are also very different from one another, though Fast-P has sought to mitigate this by differentiating them into three pillars. One is focused on green investments, the second is on energy transition including the early closure of coal plants, and the third is on hard-to-abate sectors, recently launched at COP29. </p><p> Bridging these differences and carving out a portfolio that satisfies the different needs of each investor require a lot of negotiation, and all these take time. </p><p> Even after these get sorted, there is also no guarantee that there is a ready pipeline of investable projects. </p><p> Ultimately, the right enabling environment through policy support is the crux that will drive private capital into climate-focused investments in emerging Asia. </p><p> Central to the theme of blended finance is the use of concessional capital to mitigate risks for private capital. Policy can achieve the same outcome, and may even be able to do so more efficiently. </p><p> When projects are commercially viable on their own -- whether through the setting of a carbon price or the development of robust institutional frameworks -- private investors will naturally seek them out. </p><p> Once that has been achieved, there may no longer be a real need for blended finance. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The new climate finance agreement hammered out at COP29 settled on a quantum of US$300 billion per year until 2035, well below the US$1 trillion annual target.

Both are crucial, and I think for South-east Asia, we are at the front lines of climate change, being a maritime (region). We should put more focus on adaptation,\" said Minister for Natural Resources and Environmental Sustainability Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad. </p><p> Two of Malaysia's severe floods in recent times -- in Kelantan in 2014 and around the Klang Valley in 2021 -- led to losses totalling more than US$2.2 billion (S$2.96 billion), and this was largely borne by the government, he said. </p><p> He was speaking to The Straits Times on Nov 20, several hours before a proposal on the main outcome of COP29 -- climate finance for developing countries -- was released.</p><p> Many developing countries are pushing for US$1.3 trillion per year in climate finance. </p><p> An updated draft was released on Nov 22, proposing that developed countries take the lead to channel US$250 billion per year by 2035. </p><p> This amount will come from a wide variety of sources, including public and private, multilateral funds and alternative sources of funding. </p><p> Ultimately, the aim is to raise at least US$1.3 trillion per year by 2035, with this amount achieved by scaling up finance from all public and private sources. The Nov 22 proposal on the goal did not explicitly mention grants. </p><p> Nov 22 is officially the last day of the summit, but the conference is expected to overrun. </p><p>Malaysia, echoing the sentiment of many developing countries and climate activists, called for the thrust of the funding to be grants-based, with private finance comprising a fraction of the coffer. </p><p> \"There should also be more grants as opposed to loans. The unfair financial architecture globally has penalised a lot of the poorer countries, and they are loading these countries with debt which is not sustainable,\" said Mr Nik Nazmi. </p><p> \"So, to expect these countries to then carry more debt to deal with climate change, I think it is a bit unrealistic and unfair. And we know that a lot of the developed countries have achieved their level of development and standard of living on the back of climate injustice by using fossil fuels, some of them even from the developing world.\"</p><p> According to a report by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, 69 per cent of public financing from developed countries in 2022 came in the form of loans. </p><p> Mr Nik Nazmi is expecting climate finance to be easily accessible to developing nations, without hurdles in accessing it. </p><p> \"We are worried the funds would be difficult to access in terms of procedures and very stringent eligibility criteria. Our hope is for transparent modality and that (it) can reduce bureaucratic hurdles,\" he said. </p><p> To develop its national adaptation plan, Malaysia has received funding from the Green Climate Fund -- currently the UN's main funding arm for disbursing climate finance. </p><p> The fund disburses up to US$3 million to help a developing country plan its climate adaptation measures. </p><p> What is more crucial is the funding required to implement the adaptation measures, he noted. </p><p> \"If flood risks are properly calculated, then you could even take out insurance for it. But how do you make it insurable'\" </p><p>Malaysia has experienced a fourfold increase in heatwaves since the 1960s. </p><p> Besides heat-related illnesses and bush fires, another hazard of rising temperatures which emerged recently is drowning.</p><p> The Star reported in August that there were about 20 drowning cases every month in 2024 as more people take a dip in rivers and other water bodies to cool down in the heat. </p><p> The climate finance coffer will help developing countries afford to put in place measures to slash greenhouse gas emissions -- such as carbon capture technologies or building renewable plants -- thus allowing them to set more ambitious climate targets. </p><p>Malaysia wants to retire its coal-fired power plants earlier to meet its target of phasing out the pollutive power source by 2044. South-east Asia has about 2,000 coal plants that are less than 15 years old on average. </p><p> Mr Nik Nazmi said: \"When you have 20 years more for the power plant, then it gets quite expensive to compensate the power producers (when the plants are retired earlier).\" </p><p> Financing the early retirement of coal plants is challenging. </p><p>Singapore is looking into a new type of carbon credit -- called transition credits -- to enable such early phase-out in the region. </p><p> Each credit would represent one tonne of planet-warming emissions that are prevented from being released. </p><p> When asked to assess Asean's presence at COP29, which is being held in Baku, Azerbaijan, Mr Nik Nazmi said member countries have begun discussing common positions to take at climate change talks, and he hopes this cooperation will be more apparent at the 2025 conference in Brazil. </p><p> \"Asean is one of the most threatened areas with regard to climate change. We are also a major, major economic bloc. Our population, 670 million, is more than the European Union. Obviously, we are not as integrated in the way the EU is, but I don't think that is an excuse for us not to... have a stronger voice,\" he said.</p><p> \"(We can) ask the world to not only act faster, but we can even say that if there is more assistance coming in from the developed world, (we) can even be more ambitious as a region,\" the minister added. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Malaysia's environment minister Nik Nazmi Nik Ahmad is expecting climate finance to be easily accessible to developing nations, without hurdles in accessing it.

The authors highlighted three key economic impacts of heatwaves: lower agricultural output, diminished labour productivity, and greater occurrences of power outages, which can cause major disruptions to industries and hit a country's energy security.</p><p> These impacts have been especially pronounced over the past year due to the El Nino climate pattern -- which brings warmer conditions to the Pacific Ocean -- as well as the effects of climate change.The resulting heatwaves have had serious effects on Asian agriculture. In Japan, the 2023 heatwave caused quality issues with rice, leading to a shortage. In Vietnam, the heatwave earlier this year affected Robusta coffee production, causing bean prices to hit new highs.</p><p>  Food price inflation may have a spillover effect on core inflation by influencing expectations of consumers and businesses, the HSBC report noted. </p><p> Diminished labour productivity is another major economic impact of heatwaves. By 2030, more than 2 per cent of total working hours worldwide could be lost every year amid higher temperatures, according to a report by the International Labour Organization. In South Asia alone, under the scenario that global temperatures rise 1.5 deg C by the end of the century, heat stress would lead to a loss of 5.3 per cent of working hours in 2030, said the HSBC report. This corresponds to 43 million full-time jobs.</p><p> Energy security is yet another key issue, with countries facing grid overloads and power outages amid extreme heat. In Vietnam, major industrial parks in the north housing multinationals suffered power cuts in mid-2023. Given Asia's central role in global supply chains, disruptions to local manufacturing, shipping and logistics may drive up global tradable inflation, the HSBC report's authors noted.</p><p> \"In the context of intense competition among Asian economies to attract foreign direct investment from companies that look to diversify production bases, this makes host countries' energy policies and investment in energy infrastructure more important than ever,\" they said.</p><p> That said, there is a risk that governments respond to heatwaves in ways that worsen climate change, such as by ramping up coal usage or handing out more fossil fuel subsidies to boost energy supply. This is where it becomes crucial for policymakers to maintain a long-term perspective on climate resilience to minimise such knee-jerk reactions, while continuing to invest in the transition towards renewable energy. </p><p> For now, Asia is enjoying some respite from heat since the end of El Nino. However, the lessons from the past year's heatwaves should spur countries to enhance their heat resilience, especially as weather patterns become increasingly uncertain. </p><p> For foreign investors, a city's heat resilience could eventually become a non-negotiable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-VFCAH51</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CW5-7G61-JCF2-800N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It has prompted shifts in behaviour, and inspired concerted action. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Governments worldwide are enacting regulatory measures, such as carbon taxes, subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), and plans for green infrastructure development. Businesses are committing to net-zero emissions, setting science-based targets, and encouraging their supply chains to adopt more sustainable practices. Consumers increasingly favour sustainable products, and are altering their spending patterns accordingly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Meanwhile, some investors are advocating for action, heightening their focus on climate-related risks and setting minimum climate standards, which in turn influences portfolio allocations.</p><p> Although these transformations pose risks to asset prices, we recognise that they also herald a unique investment opportunity for our generation. </p><p> We advocate for a climate strategy that yields both environmental and financial returns, moving beyond traditional approaches. Generally, strategies focused solely on low emissions often rely on historical data without adequately accounting for shifts in business models or the tangible impacts on the environment. </p><p> Similarly, while green bond strategies contribute to funding eco-friendly projects, a strategy exclusively centred on green bonds may suffer from limited diversification, lower yield return and extended durations.</p><p> Such traditional methodologies do not sufficiently address the physical consequences of climate change, nor do they focus adequately on adaptation. Current policies place us on a trajectory towards a 2.4 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures, a scenario corroborated by our climate analysis. This warming path is likely to exacerbate weather volatility and temperature extremes, affecting both society at large and asset values.</p><p> Crafting a solutionAt the heart of a favourable solution is the conviction that climate outcomes should prioritise real-world emissions reduction, support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and facilitate adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change. Every investment decision should be made through a climate lens, necessitating a bespoke framework. This approach, coupled with a global opportunity set and a strategy focused on best ideas, is designed to yield compelling returns and income.</p><p> Climate transition in Asia will likely be core to the outcomes that are achieved on a global level considering the size of Asia's population, projected economic growth, exposure to higher emitting industries, and the opportunity to potentially leapfrog high-emitting technologies and adopt low-carbon solutions. Asian companies are often national, regional or even global leaders in their respective industries, which could translate to meaningful impact when they adopt more sustainable trajectories. </p><p> Covering the global universe, the strategy centres on identifying and investing in ambitious companies that are leading the charge in their respective industries. These trailblazers are making significant strides in real-world decarbonisation, disrupting traditional business models, pioneering innovative technologies, and responding proactively to evolving consumer demands. By aligning with such leaders, investors may capitalise on the growth of the climate market and achieve superior performance.</p><p> Three types of companies are worth a look -- those in high-emitting sectors that are setting the standard for emissions reduction; innovators who are developing the technologies and products essential for decarbonisation efforts; and entities that help societies adjust to the impacts of climate change and contribute to global climate resilience. </p><p> By carefully selecting companies that align with these themes, investors may seize a significant growth opportunity and contribute meaningfully to the efforts against climate change.</p><p> Fixed income instruments, including green and municipal bonds, are pivotal in channelling funds towards projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience. A comprehensive fixed income strategy should span various segments -- investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging market debt. </p><p> An additional nuance within the Asian bond universe is the presence of large state-owned enterprises that are focused on delivering policy objectives instead of solely profit, allowing bond investors the opportunity to lend to issuers that are involved in national infrastructure projects that are part of the government's strategy to move towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p> We currently see the opportunities in Asia in the renewable energy space, EVs and its corresponding value chain, as well as large corporates that are adopting more sustainable ways of manufacturing their products. </p><p> We expect the potential pipeline from Asia to continue to grow, and could span a wide variety of opportunities including low carbon materials production and climate adaptation.</p><p> Selecting the right theme is merely the beginning. Active company selection becomes crucial in ensuring that investments genuinely enhance the portfolio's value. </p><p> For credit investors, the application of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards across all issuers requires careful consideration, especially given the disparities between high-yield and investment-grade issuers. High-yield issuers -- often smaller or newer companies -- may not have the luxury of dedicated ESG teams, established green-bond frameworks, or the capacity to generate comprehensive sustainability reports. Consequently, companies genuinely committed to sustainability might be overlooked due to their inability to showcase their ESG credentials prominently.</p><p> A recent example is Ardagh Metal Packaging, a US-listed global producer of infinitely recyclable metal drinks cans. Until recently, this company lagged in ESG disclosures despite its strong alignment with sustainability, particularly within the circular economy and waste reduction sectors. In 2022, its recycling initiatives were estimated to have avoided 3.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions compared to using virgin materials.</p><p> This case highlights that ESG assessment should transcend mere box-ticking; there is no substitute for thorough research. Investors adept at identifying firms with commendable ESG practices, albeit with limited disclosure, stand to gain by investing ahead of the curve, before enhanced transparency garners wider market recognition. </p><p> A promising landscapeThe future of climate change investing looks bright, buoyed by the escalating global emphasis on environmental sustainability. Despite concerns, we maintain that the burgeoning demand for climate-related investments will not alone lead to overvaluation. The arena of climate transition presents a vast and perpetually evolving landscape of opportunities, far from being exhausted by current interest levels.</p><p> Most importantly, we believe a climate change investment strategy should have a dual objective -- achieving meaningful climate impact alongside robust financial returns. This approach transcends mere trend-following. It is about pinpointing and supporting innovative companies that lead the charge in industry transformation and real-world decarbonisation efforts. </p><p> This strategy opens the door to a wide spectrum of opportunities, enabling investors to engage with ventures that are not just promising in terms of returns but are also pivotal in the global transition to a more sustainable future.</p><p> It is imperative to curate a well-balanced portfolio encompassing leaders in emissions reduction, innovators in technology, and contributors to climate adaptation. This diversified strategy ensures resilience against potential overvaluation in any single region, sector or asset class by spreading exposure across the varied facets of climate transition.</p><p> The writer is investment director of fixed income, abrdn</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Opportunities in Asia include companies in renewable energy, electric vehicles and the corresponding value chain, and manufacturers adopting more sustainable practices.

years the impact of the urban environment on mental health, said Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat on June 3.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The study will examine factors such as urban design features, density and human behaviours, Mr Heng said at the opening plenary of the World Cities Summit 2024, held at Suntec Singapore Convention and Exhibition Centre. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Mr Heng, who is chairman of the National Research Foundation Board, said insights from the study will \"serve to better inform the way we rejuvenate, reinvent and reimagine our city-state\". </p><p> The A*Star study, which costs $1 million and was commissioned by the Urban Redevelopment Authority and the Housing Board, will be funded by the Government's $28 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan. </p><p> The five-year plan was launched in December 2020 with an initial sum of $25 billion.</p><p> The mental health study was awarded to A*Star in May 2024, and will be carried out by the agency's Singapore Institute for Clinical Sciences.</p><p> The Ministry of National Development (MND) said the study will devise a data-driven method to assess how different aspects of the built environment affect the mental well-being of the general population.</p><p> Given Singapore's highly built-up environment, said MND, the country \"offers a unique opportunity to conduct mental health research\".</p><p> \"Current research in our local context has primarily focused on the impact of our built environment on physical well-being, and the benefits of greenery on mental well-being,\" MND added.</p><p> \"This project aims to expand this knowledge by investigating other aspects of the built environment more holistically, and their impacts on mental well-being.\"</p><p> As part of the study, a list of indicators that link the built environment to mental well-being will be developed.</p><p> MND said that these indicators could help urban planners understand how factors such as the provision of facilities, land use configuration, and the intensity of development on a piece of land may affect mental well-being.</p><p> Researchers plan to validate the study's findings against four ongoing Singapore cohort studies: Growing Up In Singapore Towards Healthy Outcomes, Singapore Preconception Study Of Long-Term Maternal And Child Outcomes, Singapore Longitudinal Early Developmental Study and Mapping Antenatal Maternal Stress.</p><p> MND said that the four studies have collected extensive data from study participants using validated questionnaires, including mental well-being indicators.</p><p> The ministry added that findings from the new study will inform how the authorities plan, design and prioritise built environment interventions to enable a healthier and more liveable environment.</p><p> The three-day World Cities Summit, held every two years in Singapore, ends on June 4. </p><p> It gathers city leaders, industry experts and others who work on urban environments, and the 2024 edition has delegates from more than 90 cities around the world.</p><p> Among its highlights was the Mayors Forum, chaired by National Development Minister Desmond Lee on June 2.</p><p> Speaking at the summit's opening plenary on June 3, Mr Lee announced an updated Singapore Liveability Framework -- a set of principles and systems that guide city planners and policymakers.</p><p> The upgraded framework has a new emphasis on \"collaborative ecosystems\".</p><p> Such systems involve the public, the private sector and the Government, recognising that citizens have a part to play in policymaking, and in the governance of cities.</p><p> A series of memorandums of understanding (MOUs) will be signed during the summit. </p><p> The Singapore Land Authority (SLA) and the Singapore Management University (SMU) signed an MOU on June 3.</p><p> SLA said that its geospatial information -- referring to data associated with a particular location such as aerial images and street maps -- will be used in the Cooling Singapore 2.0 research project, which SMU co-leads.</p><p> Among the project's products is a Digital Urban Climate Twin of Singapore that will explore the heat effects of buildings, transport and industry.</p><p> SLA said its data, and the digital twin, will aid policymakers in Singapore in assessing effective climate adaptation solutions that can enhance the city's climate resilience.</p><p> During a panel discussion on leveraging geospatial data to improve citizens' quality of life, Mr Vincent Karremans, vice-mayor of Rotterdam in the Netherlands, said such data has helped his city to prioritise investments in climate adaptation.</p><p> \"Due to this geospatial technology, we know exactly which neighbourhoods, which streets -- even portions of streets -- are the most vulnerable to heatwaves or heavy rainfall because we can put that all into a model,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat touring the booths at the World Cities Summit on June 3.

But now, it's time for it to do more to fund itself, through its own bank.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Since the 1960s, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank (ADB), Japan, the European Union and, more recently, the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) and China have poured resources into Asean economies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Hundreds of billions of dollars have gone towards building infrastructure, revitalising agriculture, health and education programmes, climate change adaptation and mitigation, promoting financial inclusion and other goals. This has made a difference. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Combined with their own domestic resources, external inflows have enabled most Asean economies to transition from low-income to middle-income status within a generation.</p><p> But the development challenges remain, their costs have soared and the gap between the resources needed and those available has widened.</p><p> Needs far exceed  available resourcesIn a 2022 study, the Sydney-based Lowy Institute estimated that 11 South-east Asian nations -- which include all of the Asean members and Timor-Leste -- received about US$200 billion (S$265 billion) in official development finance between 2015 and 2021, or an average of around US$28 billion per year, in a mix of grants and concessional and non-concessional loans, of which China was the biggest contributor, providing US$5.5 billion a year.</p><p> But Asean's financing needs are multiple times greater than what it receives. For example, the Asean Secretariat and UN Trade and Development estimate that Asean needs about US$210 billion per year for infrastructure investment alone. </p><p> Given that Asean countries are among the most vulnerable in the world to climate change disruptions, the Global Commission on Adaptation suggests that they need to invest at least US$50 billion a year to build resilience against climate impacts. </p><p> The UN Development Programme figures that Asean needs another US$100 billion to US$150 billion a year in social investments, especially in health and education, to eradicate poverty and reduce inequality.</p><p> To meet its financing needs, Asean will need to mobilise resources from public, private and international sources, and to deploy them effectively across various sectors.</p><p> Public and international sources will need to provide most of the financing, at least for infrastructure, climate adaptation, health and education, most of which involve investments that are not commercially viable.</p><p> Every Asean country runs fiscal deficits, so public finances in the region are already stretched. </p><p> Countries are limited in their abilities to fund their development on their own, but they would benefit from a collective financing pool.</p><p> There are many external sources of finance available, but even all taken together cannot fulfil Asean's needs. </p><p> The multilateral development banks, such as the World Bank, the ADB and the AIIB, have several other clients to serve. </p><p> For example, the ADB has 68 members, the majority of which are outside South-east Asia. </p><p> It has done good work in several areas across the region for decades, but its resources are spread thin. According to its annual report, its total financial commitments in 2023 amounted to US$23.6 billion, of which about two-thirds went outside South-east Asia. </p><p> The AIIB has 109 members, 48 of which are outside Asia and include countries in Europe, Africa and Latin America. Its biggest borrower is India. </p><p> The voting power of Asean members in these institutions is also small -- about 14 per cent in ADB and 8 per cent in AIIB. </p><p> So, as much as Asean benefits from the financing that these institutions provide, it may not get approval for many of the projects that it needs.</p><p> Question marks around future funding from ChinaAlthough China has been the single largest source of development finance, what is notable is that its contribution has fallen in recent years. </p><p> The Lowy Institute study points out that whereas in 2015, China provided around 24 per cent of South-east Asia's overseas development finance, by 2021, its share had fallen to 14 per cent. </p><p> This partly reflects China's economic slowdown after the Covid-19 pandemic, the sluggish progress on some big infrastructure projects such as the East Coast Rail Link in Malaysia and the high-speed rail project in Thailand, as well as greater caution among Chinese state banks in disbursing loans. </p><p> Amid China's continuing economic slowdown and pressing domestic needs, it is doubtful whether China will be able to provide development finance to Asean on the same scale as 10 years ago. </p><p> Moreover, whatever finance it does provide will be guided by China's economic and strategic priorities, which may not always align with those of Asean.</p><p> This further strengthens the case for Asean to create its own development bank, which could be called the Asean Bank for Development. </p><p> Many economic sub-regions and groupings have their own development banks that supplement the work of multilateral lending agencies. </p><p> Europe has the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development as well as the European Investment Bank. Brics members (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa and others) have the New Development Bank -- although its membership extends beyond Brics. </p><p> The Eurasian Development Bank, headquartered in Almaty, Kazakhstan, invests in the development and economic integration of six Eurasian countries. The Caribbean Development Bank finances projects in the Caribbean region, and the Arab Fund for Economic and Social Development, based in Kuwait, provides development finance to Arab countries. </p><p> There is no pan-Asean financing institution.</p><p> Filling financing gapsAlthough Asean can continue to depend on its traditional partners such as the ADB, AIIB, China and Japan for financing large projects, an Asean Bank for Development could help to support projects that may not easily get sufficient funding from other sources. </p><p> These could include projects that promote greater economic integration, such as regional energy grids, cross-border transportation networks, greater digital connectivity across the region and the harmonisation of product and service standards. </p><p> It could play an instrumental role in the reconstruction of Myanmar, which will be needed sooner or later. It could also respond quickly to natural disasters, many of which are cross-border in nature.</p><p> Using its localised knowledge, it could also fund projects that fall between the cracks -- that is, those which are too small for the likes of the ADB and AIIB and which address funding gaps at local levels. </p><p> These could include community-based energy projects, such as small-scale solar farms and micro-hydro projects in remote areas, the upgrading of village roads, building small bridges to connect isolated communities, climate adaptation initiatives such as building flood defences at the community level, helping mobile health clinics to deliver healthcare to underserved areas, establishing or renovating local museums and cultural centres, and supporting programmes to nurture and preserve traditional arts and crafts.</p><p> It would also have governance advantages. Unlike existing development financing institutions in which Asean's stake and voting power is small, an Asean Bank would foster a greater sense of ownership among Asean member states, which would control the bank. </p><p> They, rather than other powers, would be able to set the bank's agenda, priorities and strategic directions. </p><p> An Asean Bank would also be freer to innovate in ways that traditional development banks do not. For example, it could partner with fintechs to serve under-banked communities, tap blended finance -- that is, finance from companies through their corporate social responsibility programmes, as well as philanthropic organisations -- and work with local governments and non-governmental organisations, which are already active in several local-level initiatives. </p><p> Over time, it could also develop mechanisms to extend financing in local currencies.</p><p> Some governance issues will be challenging to address, such as how the bank should be capitalised and re-capitalised, how its shareholding should be divided among Asean member states, how its leadership should be determined and where it should be based. </p><p> These issues would need to be resolved politically.</p><p> That may seem a tall order, but it will be worth the effort. </p><p> An Asean Bank for Development would be a valuable public good for the grouping with a potential impact that will be greater than the sum of its parts. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-UBBQN78</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CPN-VST1-DYX4-01XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1431\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) today launched the inaugural Artificial Intelligence Open Innovation Challenge (AIOIC) to catalyse the development of AIpowered solutions that can address industry needs. This was announced by Deputy Prime Minister Heng Swee Keat in his opening address at the Singapore Week of Innovation and Technology (SWITCH) 2024. Organised by Enterprise Singapore (EnterpriseSG) and MP Singapore, SWITCH is the flagship startup event with a focus on deep tech and frontier technologies. It is taking place from 28 to 30 October at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.</p><p>2. Five leading global corporates across the infrastructure, hospitality, security, marine and transport sectors - AECOM, PARKROYAL COLLECTION, Safran, Seatrium and Toyota Tsusho - are participating in the AIOIC. They have issued six challenge statements to source for AI solutions to raise efficiency, effectiveness, and build safety into their operations. Refer to Annex A (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/media-centre/media-releases/2024/october/mr04524_inaugural-artificial-intelligence-ai-open-innovation-challenge-launched-to-catalyse-new-ai-solutions.pdf\">https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/media-centre/media-releases/2024/october/mr04524_inaugural-artificial-intelligence-ai-open-innovation-challenge-launched-to-catalyse-new-ai-solutions.pdf</url>) for more details on the AIOIC 2024.</p><p>3. According to Bain &amp; Co, the global market for AI is expected to grow between 40% and 55% annually for the next three years and reach a record S$1.27 trillion in 2027. This is fuelled by companies' increasing adoption of AI technologies to boost efficiency and enable growth. Singapore has also launched its second National AI Strategy (NAIS 2.0) to drive innovation through AI, and equip people and businesses with the capabilities and resources to adopt such technologies.</p><p>4. \"AI holds immense potential to transform businesses and catapult their growth. But as companies put this at the forefront of their growth strategies, they must be deliberate to identify specific use-cases in order to develop or deploy effective solutions,\" said Mr Tan Boon Kim, Executive Director, Global Innovation Network &amp; Innovation Ecosystem Development, EnterpriseSG. \"Through our inaugural AI Open Innovation Challenge, we can accelerate the development of targeted solutions that truly meet industry needs, while also fostering win-win partnerships between corporates, and startups and innovative SMEs.\"</p><p>Decarbonisation, renewable energies and green buildings top of mind for corporates seeking sustainability solutions</p><p>5. The Sustainability Open Innovation Challenge (SOIC) by EnterpriseSG returns for its sixth edition to crowdsource innovative solutions that can help companies meet their sustainability ambitions (refer to Annex B (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/media-centre/media-releases/2024/october/mr04524_inaugural-artificial-intelligence-ai-open-innovation-challenge-launched-to-catalyse-new-ai-solutions.pdf\">https://www.enterprisesg.gov.sg/-/media/esg/files/media-centre/media-releases/2024/october/mr04524_inaugural-artificial-intelligence-ai-open-innovation-challenge-launched-to-catalyse-new-ai-solutions.pdf</url>) for more details on the SOIC 2024).</p><p>6. More than S$2.5 million has been committed to the SOIC, including by 14 corporates including ACWA Power, GlobalFoundries, Goodyear Orient Company, Seatrium, Sentosa Development Corporation, and the Singapore Fashion Council in the Demandled category. They have issued 16 challenge statements to catalyse the development of solutions in areas like Sustainable Materials, Green Buildings and Agri-Food and help meet their sustainability goals.</p><p>7. The Open Category sees a closer collaboration with Temasek Foundation and Temasek Trust this year, where greater opportunities will be available for promising sustainability innovators to scale across the region.</p><p>a) Selected solution providers will continue to be granted direct entry to Temasek Foundation's The Liveability Challenge (TLC), a global crowdsourcing platform for innovative sustainable solutions, without the need for a separate application. This year, TLC features two themes: 'Decarbonisation', which focuses on uncovering disruptive deep tech solutions that significantly reduce carbon emissions, and 'Cool Earth', which centres on finding innovations that address the challenges posed by climate-induced extreme weather conditions, especially heat.</p><p>b) Temasek Trust will also consider them for Catalytic Capital for Climate &amp; Health (C3H), an impact-first vehicle that provides early-stage funding for solutions in areas such as Novel Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS), Built Environment, Agri-Tech and Med-Tech for climate exacerbated conditions.</p><p>c) For the first time, EnterpriseSG will bring in corporates to participate directly in the Open Category. Eight corporates, including Kuok Maritime Group, Lenovo and Micron Technology are seeking new and novel solutions in areas like leveraging AI for sustainability, climate adaptation, green energies and CCUS, to future-proof their operations.</p><p>Nordic Open Innovation Challenge unveiled to help Singapore companies partner with global corporations and expand into new markets</p><p>8. EnterpriseSG has also launched the first-ever Nordic Open Innovation Challenge (NOIC) to help Singapore companies partner with renowned multinational corporations to address challenges in areas like sustainability and advanced manufacturing. Through the NOIC, Singapore firms will have the opportunity to co-innovate and launch pilot projects with global companies ABB and Electrolux via their Singapore or Nordic headquarters - and gain access to new markets.

These include carbon capture technologies, forest restoration, swopping pollutive cookstoves for cleaner ones, and renewable energy projects. </p><p> Not all projects can make the cut. In late 2023, Singapore released a set of eligibility criteria to ensure that credits and projects are of high quality. </p><p> For example, in calculating the amount of emissions removed by a mangrove planting project, the calculations must be made in a conservative and transparent way, and measured and verified by an independent third party. </p><p> The National Environment Agency also released a list of specific types of projects or methodologies that Singapore is willing to accept, based on existing carbon crediting programmes. These include international carbon credits that come from offshore wind technology and cleaner cookstoves. </p><p> Internationally, a recent oversupply of carbon credits from renewable energy projects failed to deliver additional climate benefits, noted Ms Melissa Low, a research fellow at the National University of Singapore's Centre for Nature-based Climate Solutions. </p><p> How far along is Singapore in trading carbon credits'Of the 19 countries Singapore is collaborating with on carbon credits, two have finalised bilateral agreements with Singapore so far -- Papua New Guinea and Ghana. These are known as implementation agreements. </p><p> This means companies here can buy carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions, provided the carbon projects in Papua New Guinea and Ghana meet Singapore's eligibility criteria. </p><p> Steps must be taken to prevent the double-counting of emission reductions in both the carbon credit buyer (Singapore) and the host country's national greenhouse gas inventories. </p><p> And in each agreement, climate adaptation for the host country and the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions must be prioritised. </p><p> For example, carbon credit project developers must contribute 5 per cent of their share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana. </p><p> Project developers must also cancel 2 per cent of carbon credits at first issuance, so that those credits will not enter the carbon market. The 2 per cent has the sole purpose of reducing emissions.</p><p> These requirements are based on Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, which governs the bilateral trade of carbon credits between countries. </p><p> Of the remaining 17 countries, Singapore has concluded negotiations on similar carbon credit schemes with Vietnam, Paraguay and Bhutan. The next step will be to sign the agreements. </p><p>Singapore has also signed memorandums of understanding (MOUs) with other countries such as Laos, Indonesia and Fiji, with the intention of collaborating on carbon credits.</p><p> A fair amount of negotiations takes place before an MOU becomes a bilateral agreement, said Ms Low. </p><p> \"This would include an assessment of the respective countries' climate targets and level of ambition and whether the respective countries have arrangements in place to transparently report on their greenhouse gas inventories,\" she added. </p><p> It took 10 months for Singapore and Ghana to conclude negotiations on their deal.</p><p> As at May, only one carbon credit transaction under Article 6.2 has taken place between Thailand and Switzerland. </p><p> According to a carbon market explainer by The Nature Conservancy, such international transactions will take time, and bilateral agreements are only the first step.</p><p> \"Countries still have several additional steps, such as providing letters of authorisation, complying with reporting requirements and, once the project is concluded, starting monitoring and verification processes. Only after the first monitoring cycle is completed can the first issuance and first transfer (of credits) take place,\" stated the report.</p><p> Checks by ST in January revealed that Singapore companies looking to buy carbon credits from Papua New Guinea must wait longer for eligible projects that are of high quality, as none of the available credits for sale currently meets the criteria set by the Singapore Government. </p><p> On June 20, it was announced that more than 100,000 improved cookstoves will be distributed to communities in Papua New Guinea that still rely on open-fire cooking. This project was approved by carbon crediting programme Verra. </p><p> The project's developer, Tasman Environmental Markets, said it is working with Singapore and Papua New Guinea to finalise the approval of its project under both countries' carbon credit agreement. </p><p> In July, Verra suspended 27 cookstove projects over allegations of over-issuance of millions of carbon credits, Ms Low pointed out.</p><p> \"So, it remains to be seen if cookstove projects in Papua New Guinea will eventually be eligible for use under Singapore's framework,\" she said.</p><p> Ms Low added that the authorities are organising a business mission to Ghana in July, and this may help companies in Singapore explore opportunities there. </p><p> How does carbon trading benefit Singapore and the host country'Carbon markets help to channel funds to nature-based and underfunded forest conservation projects that would not otherwise have been implemented due to factors such as insufficient policy and economic incentives. </p><p> Carbon projects can further the sustainable development of host countries, benefit local communities in terms of job creation and access to clean resources, and improve their energy security. Environmental pollution can also be reduced while protecting the rights of indigenous groups. </p><p> Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero has been investing in a forest restoration project in the Kwahu region of Ghana. It involves replanting degraded forest reserves, including growing cocoa trees sustainably in shaded farms to shield the plantations from disasters and pests. </p><p> Jobs in farming and agroforestry training will be created, and there will be new income opportunities for indigenous communities. The verification of carbon credits from the Ghana project will begin in 2028.</p><p> As for Singapore, buying carbon credits can benefit carbon-tax-liable firms as the tax is set to increase. The carbon tax in 2024 has increased to $25 per tonne of CO2 emissions, up from $5 per tonne previously. By 2030, the tax will eventually reach $50 to $80 per tonne. </p><p> Companies can potentially cut their carbon tax liability if they can procure carbon credits that are lower than the prevailing tax rate of $25 per tonne, noted Ms Low. </p><p> Being an alternative-energy-disadvantaged country, Singapore can tap carbon credits to meet its national climate targets, also known as NDCs. </p><p> But this will have trade-offs for the host country. The more credits a host country exports to Singapore, the less mitigation can be claimed against its own climate goals, stated The Nature Conservancy explainer. </p><p> \"Even when domestic frameworks are in place, a more complex issue will arise as host countries define what sectors, how many units at what price they could transfer internationally without undermining the achievement of their NDCs,\" the report stated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero has been investing in a forest restoration project in the Kwahu region of Ghana. photo: genzero</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-4NB1DL9</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CFM-TMF1-JCF2-801V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1340\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

We care, not only how our food tastes, but also how it is distributed, sourced and even cultivated. Food has evolved from something we merely eat into a reflection of our values and identity. With issues such as food security, unsustainable farming practices and climate change, impact on crops becoming increasingly severe, solutions to address these issues become critical and with that, provides a large market opportunity to tap into.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The agri-food sector contributes more than 25 per cent of ASEAN's GDP, denoting its potential to drive economic empowerment. Academic, private, and government-led incubation hubs have established test bed environments to help scale agri-food products toward commercialisation, while large corporations provide strategic and financial support for startups in the space.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Source: Forward Fooding (2024)</p><p>Among ASEAN markets, Singapore has become the agri-food innovation hub, leading in regulatory frameworks, ease of doing business, and programmes and incentives to tackle food security needs. Singapore is the largest ecosystem in the region based on both the number of agri-food tech fundraises and funds raised - accounting for 38 per cent of total ASEAN funding. Indonesia comes in second with 71 fundraises and 30 per cent of total funding, followed by Vietnam with 15 fundraises and 12 per cent of total funding.</p><p>The agri-food supply chain starts upstream with the provision of inputs and production. This is where companies normally recognised as 'agritech startups', provide services and technology to improve farming efficiency, sustainability and introduce novel farming systems. The next stage is transformation, where innovations focus on new food processing techniques or enhancing ingredient functionality. Some companies opt to create entirely new types of food and beverages, with a well-known example of this being plant-based meats.</p><p>Further downstream to distribution and consumption, solutions centre around transporting/delivering the finished food products to consumers. This can take the form of marketplaces or apps where consumers are able to discover, order and receive food, as well as technology to help businesses become more efficient in preparing and delivering food to their customers.</p><p>There is also food safety and traceability technology that covers the entire supply chain that helps sanitise food processing equipment, assess product freshness and increase their shelf-life. After consumption, then comes the question of how to handle surplus food and reduce food waste to further improve efficiency in the supply chain.</p><p>Source: Forward Fooding (2024)</p><p>The momentum in the agri-food space has facilitated the establishment of a vast array of startups in the space across the entire supply chain. With over 270 agri-food tech startups in Southeast Asia, this ecosystem reflects the region's dynamic and technology-driven approach to addressing food security, sustainability, and efficiency challenges (Forward Fooding, 2023). This growth is supported by a favourable mix of academic, corporate, and government initiatives, enabling these startups to access the resources needed for commercialisation and scaling.</p><p>However, challenges remain as recent years have seen VC funding slowing; for example, vertical farming economics are challenging and often less appealing than their traditional peers. Alternative protein startups have to offer more than a great consumer 'green' brand to rival the traditional meat brands. In agritech, there is an increasing number of ventures, leveraging the model and riding on the success of eFishery.</p><p>SectorStartup CountFunding since 2013CAGR 2019-2022Most funded companiesAgritech62 (22%)US$636 million92%eFishery (July 2023), Series D of US$235 millionNext-gen food and drinks70 (25%)US$352 million192%nextGen (Feb 2022), Series A of US$154 millionFood delivery65 (24%)US$1.75 billion81%Line Man Wongnai (Sept 2022), Series B of US$265 millionConsumer app and service18 (7%)US$486 million-71%Trax (April 2021), Series E of US$640 millionRestaurant tech21 (8%)US$144 million9%Rotimatic (April 2018), Series C of US$30 millionFood processing15 (5%)US$42 million11%Seppure (Feb 2023), Series A of US$12 millionFood safety and traceability4 (1%)US$3 millionNADiMuto (Sep 2021), Series A of US$2.4 millionSurplus and waste management21 (8%)US$331 million9%RWDC Industries (Nov 2021), Series B of US$257 million</p><p>Source: Forward Fooding (2023)</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/can-alternative-proteins-help-build-a-more-secure-and-sustainable-food-system-20210702/\">Can alternative proteins help build a more secure and sustainable food system?</url></p><p>By taking a deeper look, we have observed two promising agri-food tech verticals that present significant market potential:</p><p>Agritech</p><p>Agritech startups have gained prominence, given the need for independent sovereign food security in times of global conflict and an impending EU carbon tax. The problems this space aims to tackle can be broken down to those of farmers and consumers:</p><p>Farmers</p><p>Lack the knowledge and support to farm efficiently, resulting in lower yields</p><p>Utilise environmentally unsustainable practices</p><p>Lack access to affordable inputs and profitable markets</p><p>Consumers</p><p>Want fresher high-quality produce</p><p>Want more consistent quality</p><p>Want produce to be cultivated in an environmentally sustainable way</p><p>Our observations of the SEA agritech space in the past 10 months have revealed a wide variety of interesting innovations in this space to tackle the aforementioned issues:</p><p>Crop monitoring technology: Utilise IoT/satellite/drone technology to monitor farming environment &amp; crop health</p><p>Produce and/or inputs marketplace: Online marketplaces to provide easier access for consumers/businesses to buy their produce or for farmers to buy their inputs</p><p>Sustainable farming methodology and inputs: Implementation of sustainable farming practices &amp; provision of more sustainable inputs which may also include financing</p><p>AI/ML powered data-driven smart farming: Predictive analytics of weather patterns, supply/demand and crop yields for better resource planning and management</p><p>Renewable energy resources: Shifts to more environmentally friendly energy sources for farming processes, such as solar or other renewables.</p><p>That being said, some challenges still remain:</p><p>Limited education and technology skills among smallholder farmers: Smallholder farmers frequently have. limited experience with technology, which can pose challenges in adopting new technologies and modern farming practices.</p><p>Financing default risk: Many startups who provide financing for farmers face a significant default risk due to fraud and lack of a reliable credit scoring mechanism.</p><p>Vulnerability to macroeconomic and environmental factors: Macroeconomic factors such as volatile price of commodities and natural disasters such as typhoons can instantly damage an agricultural business after which it is hard to recover.</p><p>Seeing is believing. In our landscaping through Southeast Asia, our team has had the opportunity to see how businesses operate on-site. One aquaculture startup implements proprietary technology to ensure efficiency in fish farming, affording farmers with higher yields hence reducing losses and wastage. Another Indonesian startup focuses on hydroponic indoor farming and implements a proprietary scheduled planting algorithm to maximise crop yields and align supply and demand to reduce wastage.</p><p>Next-gen food and drinks</p><p>The growth of Next-gen food and drinks' is far ahead of any other vertical, mainly driven by Singapore, acting as a catalyst for alternative protein development in recent years.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/the-realities-of-scaling-food-tech-in-todays-resource-strapped-world-20221223/\">The realities of scaling food tech in today's resource-strapped world</url></p><p>The problems that these innovations aim to solve centre around changing customer need and culture, mainly:</p><p>Demanding more healthy and novel food options (that still tastes good!)</p><p>Accommodating dietary restrictions such as veganism or lactose intolerance</p><p>Demanding food that is sourced sustainably with lower carbon footprint</p><p>As such we have seen the following innovations within this space:</p><p>Alternative food ingredients: Developing new proteins using alternative materials or fermentation methods, acting as a more sustainable food ingredient</p><p>Alternative ready-to-eat/drink F&amp;B: Creating new food items using alternative materials such as plant-based meat/milk or even insect-based chips</p><p>However, there are several key challenges in the agritech space that need to be addressed:</p><p>R&amp;D investment: New ingredients require extensive R&amp;D, which can extend the timeline to commercialisation and demand substantial resources.</p><p>Regulatory approvals: New food ingredients must secure approval from local regulatory authorities, such as the Food &amp; Drug Administration, which can be a lengthy process in certain markets.</p><p>Capital expenditures: Manufacturing and distribution often entail significant capital investment, which may impact the scalability and attractiveness of the venture.</p><p>Product-market fit: Products must align with the taste preferences of local markets to ensure acceptance, avoiding overly novel profiles that may deter consumers.</p><p>The Radical team has been deeply engaged with next-gen food and beverage ventures across the region, recently investing in a stealth startup at the forefront of strain engineering and precision fermentation. This innovative company is also advancing downstream processes to produce high-value palm oil derivatives like high-purity oils, fatty alcohols, and fatty acids-all valorised from agricultural waste. Demand for these sustainable, high-quality alternatives is increasing (with interest across Asia, US and Europe), indicating strong potential to disrupt this industry.</p><p>Agritech and next-gen food and drinks present a myriad of great opportunities for founders to tap into, and addressing the above challenges can help establish strong differentiation.</p><p>These sectors remain relatively nascent but present significant opportunities:</p><p>Food processing: Although capital-intensive, the upcoming EU carbon tax is likely to incentivise large corporations to adopt these solutions, positioning them to benefit from economies of scale.</p><p>Food safety and traceability: Advancements in this area rely on increasingly complex regulatory frameworks, with initiatives like the EU's digital food passports setting the groundwork.</p><p>In closing, agriculture, food, and climate are deeply interconnected. Smart farming practices reduce waste and leverage sustainable inputs, benefiting the environment. Certain crops aid in carbon sequestration, and transitioning to renewable energy can further lower emissions, presenting a strong climate mitigation pathway. Simultaneously, the need for soil resilience and disaster management creates critical opportunities for climate adaptation.</p><p>The Radical Fund is seeking business models that are capital-light while delivering a twin strategy of scaled commercial and climate impact.

Singapore and the Netherlands signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) today to collaborate on supporting international climate science research. The MOU was signed by Singapore's Permanent Secretary for Sustainability and the Environment, Mr Stanley Loh and the Netherlands' Water Envoy, Ms Meike van Ginneken.<br/><br/>2. The MOU supports the establishment and work of the Technical Support Unit (TSU) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC)'s Working Group II on Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability. The Singapore and the Netherlands Government have secured premises and are providing funds for staff and research for the two TSU offices in their respective countries. The two TSUs will provide scientific, technical, operational and communications support to IPCC's Working Group II in its Seventh Assessment Report Cycle (AR7).<br/><br/>3. This collaboration follows from the successful election of the Professor Winston Chow of Singapore Management University and Professor Bart van den Hurk of Deltares, as Co-Chairs of the IPCC's Working Group II, at the 59th Session of IPCC Bureau elections in July 2023 in Nairobi, Kenya.<br/><br/>4. The IPCC is the United Nation's body for assessing the scientific basis of climate change, its impacts and future risks, and options for mitigation and adaptation. IPCC's assessments provide a scientific basis for governments to develop climate-related policies and contribute to global climate action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). AR7 formally began in July 2023.<br/><br/>5. Permanent Secretary Mr Stanley Loh said, \"The signing of this MOU highlights Singapore and the Netherlands' joint commitment to contribute to the advancement of climate science and international climate action. Our collaboration will contribute to capacity building and enable countries to advance climate action, particularly in climate adaptation. Singapore's hosting of the TSU will facilitate more effective representation and involvement of fellow developing countries in the IPCC process.\"</p><p>[Category: Life Sciences, Water Utilities, Partnerships and Alliances, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0064413430</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9J-D8B1-DXMP-K0KW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"482\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"06\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>June 18, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0008YXD</classCode><className>EARTH &amp;

Singapore and Ghana signed an Implementation Agreement on carbon credits cooperation under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement on 27 May 2024. The Agreement was signed virtually between Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment and Minister-in-charge of Trade Relations Grace Fu, and Ghana's Minister of Environment, Science, Technology and Innovation Ophelia Hayford.<br/><br/>2. After the signing, both countries will commence with the ratification process and operationalise the Agreement. This sets out a legally binding framework and processes for the generation and international transfer of carbon credits between Singapore and Ghana, aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement.<br/><br/>3. This collaboration will advance both countries' climate ambition and channel financing towards additional mitigation efforts. The carbon credit projects authorised under the Implementation Agreement will seek to promote sustainable development and generate benefits for local communities, such as creation of jobs, access to clean water, improved energy security, and reduction of environmental pollution.<br/><br/>4. Under the Implementation Agreement, project developers will be required to make a contribution equivalent to 5% share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana, which helps Ghana prepare for and adjust to the impacts of climate change. They will also be required to cancel 2% of authorised carbon credits at first issuance to ensure additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions.<br/><br/>5. Under Singapore's International Carbon Credit (ICC) framework, eligible ICCs generated under this Implementation Agreement may be used by Singapore-based carbon tax-liable companies to offset up to 5% of their taxable emissions.<br/><br/>7. Minister Fu said, \"Singapore and Ghana share many mutual interests in the sustainability sphere. The conclusion of the Implementation Agreement is testament to our shared commitment to advance global climate action through high-integrity carbon markets. The carbon credit projects that are implemented under this Agreement will generate climate benefits as well as benefits to our economies. Singapore will continue our efforts to work with like-minded partners like Ghana to co-create opportunities for a sustainable future.\"<br/><br/>8. This is the second Implementation Agreement for Singapore, after the first with Papua New Guinea which was signed in December 2023.<br/><br/>Implementation Agreement Factsheet<br/><br/>* The Implementation Agreement between Singapore and Ghana sets out a legally-binding bilateral framework for the international transfer of correspondingly adjusted[1] high-integrity carbon credits aligned to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. The framework includes processes to seek authorisation for carbon credit projects and corresponding adjustments for implemented mitigation outcomes. These processes will be made available on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg\">http://www.carbonmarkets-cooperation.gov.sg</url>/ in due course.<br/><br/>*Correspondingly adjusted carbon credits authorised under this Implementation Agreement may be used for various purposes, such as:<br/><br/>*To offset up to 5% of a company's taxable emissions under Singapore's ICC framework[2] from 1 Jan 2024, subject to eligibility.<br/><br/>*To comply with binding mandates such as Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and other international mitigation purposes e.g., the requirements under the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA).<br/><br/>*As an additional contribution to mitigation of global emissions, Singapore has committed to having 2% of the correspondingly adjusted carbon credits authorised under this Implementation Agreement cancelled at first issuance. These carbon credits cannot be sold, traded, or counted towards any country's emission targets, and will instead contribute towards a net reduction in global emissions.<br/><br/>*Singapore has committed to channelling the value from 5% of the correspondingly adjusted carbon credits authorised under this Implementation Agreement towards adaptation measures such as heat resilience measures and coastal protection in Ghana.<br/><br/>*Singapore has also concluded substantive negotiations on an Implementation Agreement with Bhutan, Paraguay, and Vietnam, and has signed MOUs/ Letters of Intent on carbon credits collaboration with Cambodia, Chile, Colombia, Dominican Republic, Fiji, Kenya, Mongolia, Morocco, Peru, Rwanda, Senegal, and Sri Lanka, with the aim of inking similar Implementation Agreement.</p><p>Footnotes:<br/><br/>[1] Corresponding adjustment prevents the double-counting of emissions reductions or removals in both buyer and host country's national greenhouse gas inventories. For example, when Country X (buyer) receives five tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (tCO2e) of carbon credits from Country Y (host country), Country Y (host country) has to add five tCO2e to its greenhouse gas inventory while Country X (buyer) will reduce five tCO2e from its greenhouse gas inventory.<br/><br/>[2] The ICC Framework was introduced in Nov 2022 alongside the progressive increase in carbon tax rate under the Carbon Pricing (Amendment) Bill, from S$5 per tonne of emissions to S$25 per tonne in 2024 and 2025, and S$45 per tonne in 2026 and beyond.</p><p>[Category: IT Services, IT Consulting &amp;

Earlier in September, he announced his intention to restructure the Public Works and Housing Ministry by splitting it into two ministries, which he believes will allow Indonesia to streamline efforts to construct 15 million homes by the end of his term. Local media has also reported that Mr Prabowo is keen on splitting the Environment and Forestry Ministry, as well as planning stand-alone government agencies for water security and revenue collection. </p><p> Having more ministries could allow greater specialisation in handling specific issues, said Indonesia-based PermataBank chief economist Josua Pardede.</p><p> There is also the potential benefit of making the government more flexible and adaptable when it comes to addressing crises, said Mr Josua. \"For instance, specific ministries focusing on health, climate adaptation or food security might be better equipped to respond swiftly to emerging threats like pandemics or natural disasters,\" he told The Straits Times.</p><p> But he said such potential benefits can be fully realised only if the government ensures efficient coordination, clear roles and accountability across the newly formed ministries.</p><p> In theory, breaking down ministries into more specialised roles could reduce bureaucratic bottlenecks and sharpen their focus, Mr Dedi Dinarto, lead Indonesia analyst at public policy advisory firm Global Counsel, told ST. But for such a method to succeed, the new ministers will have to possess the technical know-how to implement effective policies. </p><p> \"Just expanding the Cabinet (in this manner) does not guarantee success. Without capable leadership, this expansion could easily lead to inefficiency,\" said Mr Dedi. </p><p> He said that such a move could even make things worse for businesses that are already struggling with Indonesia's complex regulatory environment.</p><p> From a financial perspective, more ministries would also mean increased spending on salaries, operational costs and administrative structures, which critics say would place additional pressure on the state budget.</p><p> Mr Prabowo has said he wants to boost Indonesia's economic growth to 8 per cent per annum in the next three to five years. For the second quarter of 2024, Indonesia's economy grew 5.05 per cent.</p><p> But a larger government also brings with it worries about additional layers of bureaucracy and inefficiency.</p><p>Indonesia's government is already on a spending spree as it seeks to fund massive projects like its upcoming capital city Nusantara, which will cost around US$32 billion (S$41 billion). There is also Mr Prabowo's plan for free school lunches, which looks set to cost 71 trillion rupiah (S$6 billion) in 2025. </p><p> Mr Bhima Yudhistira, director of Indonesian think-tank Centre of Economic and Law Studies, has spoken out against the idea of having more ministries, saying that the country already has enough agencies to run its programmes. </p><p> Speaking to local news outlet Tempo on Sept 12, Mr Bhima warned that such a bloated bureaucracy stands to complicate government coordination and processes in the archipelago. </p><p> \"This (the addition of ministries or agencies) will actually hinder Prabowo's ambitious economic growth target for the next five years,\" he said.</p><p>Indonesia is now facing concerns about a growing budget deficit, said Mr Dedi, pointing to how the additional spending required to support more ministries could put further strain on the fiscal budget. </p><p> \"We should expect Mr Prabowo's administration to come out with revenue-generating policies in order to balance out the financial cost of this expansion,\" he told ST.</p><p> Analysts have also pointed out another reason why lawmakers, largely supportive of Mr Widodo and Mr Prabowo, passed revisions to the law: Having more ministries would open up more Cabinet positions and allow Mr Prabowo to \"reward\" his allies.</p><p> Seven of the eight big political parties in Indonesia are part of Mr Prabowo's Onward Indonesia Coalition, which together control more than 60 per cent of the seats in Parliament. The parliamentary majority is expected to smooth legislative processes for Mr Prabowo's administration.</p><p> Mr Josua said: \"The expansion of Cabinet (positions) could be viewed as a political move to accommodate allies from various coalition parties... to maintain political stability within the ruling coalition.\"</p><p> Mr Prabowo needs to keep his coalition intact and distributing ministerial positions is one way to ensure loyalty, said Mr Dedi.</p><p> The risks of doing so, however, are significant, and he warned that expanding the Cabinet in this manner and primarily for this reason will almost certainly lead to bureaucratic bloat unless these new ministries are carefully designed with clear and distinct functions. </p><p> Mr Josua noted: \"If not managed carefully, this could lead to bureaucratic inefficiencies that undermine governance and economic growth.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Signs point to President-elect Prabowo Subianto expanding the number of ministries to 44 -- the most in Indonesia's recent history, with lawmakers recently passing revisions that eliminated the limit of 34.

This grant call comes under a S$125 million research programme on coastal protection and flood management. The programme was established in 2023 to support the country's climate adaptation efforts. </p><p> In 2019, former prime minister Lee Hsien Loong said that Singapore would need to spend S$100 billion over the next 100 years to protect against rising sea levels. The government has since put S$5 billion towards a coastal and flood protection fund. </p><p> PUB said in a media release on Thursday that one of the focus areas is sustainable construction materials that could be used for coastal protection structures.</p><p>Singapore has more than 300 km of coastlines, which require extensive coastal protection infrastructure. There is a need to source for sustainable materials that are durable and can have a long service life in the dynamic coastal environment. The materials also need to be high-strength but lightweight to facilitate the retrofitting of existing coastal protection structures against rising sea levels. </p><p> This grant call is open to universities and polytechnics, public-sector entities, and private-sector companies based in Singapore. Those interested are required to submit their proposals by 4 pm on Aug 6. </p><p> Separately, PUB also announced on the same day that it has launched a tender for the third phase of its expansion plans for the water reclamation plant in Changi. The tender for this third phase of expansion would be for professional engineering services. </p><p> The construction is expected to cost about S$2 billion and will include new facilities such as an additional influent pumping station, liquids treatment modules and a biosolids treatment facility, said PUB. </p><p> The appointed consultant will be required to conduct a series of engineering studies, including a long-term plan for the plant's future expansion, as well as an environmental assessment to evaluate the potential impact caused by the construction and subsequent operation of the expanded plant. </p><p> The project is scheduled to be completed in the mid-2030s and is aimed at meeting the projected increase in used-water flow from industries in the eastern part of Singapore. \"The expansion is in line with PUB's efforts to maintain our water systems and to invest in water infrastructure, to meet rising demand for used-water treatment and to ensure a sustainable used-water system for Singapore,\" said PUB. </p><p> The used-water treatment capacity at the Changi plant will increase by up to 96 million gallons per day (mgd) once completed. That is equivalent to 175 Olympic-sized swimming pools. The plant has a current treatment capacity of 224 mgd, and is undergoing its second phase of expansion, which is expected to be completed by the end of this year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-E9AFDVB</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C9C-D2M1-JCF2-800C-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"526\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The Monetary Authority of Singapore's (MAS) Sustainable Finance Advisory Panel (SFAP) met on 26 September and discussed possible financing mechanisms to accelerate the phase-out of coal-fired power plants in Asia and support decarbonisation of the hard-to-abate aviation and maritime transport sectors. The SFAP also discussed how private capital could be better mobilised to finance the region's climate adaptation needs.</p><p>2. The decarbonisation of the energy, aviation and maritime transport sectors is critical for the region's transition to net zero. The key takeaways from the SFAP discussion include:</p><p>* A whole-of-ecosystem approach is critical to accelerate coal transition. SFAP members emphasised the urgency of managed phase-out of coal-fired power plants, which must take place alongside the development of clean energy sources, in Asia's energy transition. A comprehensive approach that provides credibility for early phase-out projects and innovative financing structures, regulatory clarity on financed emissions, and appropriate policy reforms, will be needed to scale coal transition.</p><p>* Accelerating the adoption of sustainable aviation and marine fuels is key to the decarbonisation of the aviation and maritime transport sectors. SFAP members underlined the importance of establishing the long-term business case for these low-carbon solutions. Potential levers to lower the costs of these fuels include demand aggregation, securing a reliable and adequate supply of feedstock needed to produce these fuels, and supportive government policies to encourage adoption.</p><p>* Public-private collaboration needed to tackle decarbonisation. Multi-stakeholder collaborative platforms would be useful to identify opportunities in financing sectoral transition, foster synergy between government policies and industry actions, and design innovative financing solutions. SFAP members noted the critical role of governments and regulators in solving market failure situations, such as in undertaking detailed analysis of risks and benefits of emerging decarbonisation technologies, and providing initial financing for critical supply chain infrastructure.</p><p>3. On climate adaptation, the meeting noted that less than 10% of global climate finance is currently being channelled to adaptation efforts [1] , with most of it financed by the public sector. Noting that global warming is already causing more severe droughts, heat waves, and other climate-related disasters, SFAP members discussed possible solutions to scale up private financing for the region's climate adaptation efforts. These include resilience-linked instruments and parametric insurance products which enable early intervention and quick responses to climate catastrophes. SFAP members also discussed ways to address the underpricing of physical climate risks, including strengthening the global climate risk data architecture.</p><p>4. The SFAP was established in 2022 to guide MAS on its strategies and initiatives to build a credible and vibrant sustainable finance ecosystem.

Her home town of Dallas, which is currently being blasted by unrelenting heat, frequently experiences heatwaves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But when the 21-year-old visited the Greek capital Athens in mid-June with her friends, she was shocked by the \"unbearable\" 37 deg C heat she faced. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I actually had no idea about the heat that was going on until we were there, which was pretty surprising,\" she told CNN.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> \"I always joke around that I have such a high heat tolerance; I bring my sweatshirt with me to class in August (in the US),\" she said.</p><p> But the apartment she was staying in had no air-conditioning, and temperatures were too high during the day to explore the city on foot. </p><p> \"Our energy levels were lower than we thought they would be,\" she said. \"It felt pretty unbearable to walk in the direct heat.\"</p><p> Climate crisis-driven sweltering summers in Europe are now a reality that tourists are waking up to. </p><p> Interest in visiting hotter Mediterranean countries dropped in 2023 amid record heatwaves and wildfires, with more temperate destinations becoming increasingly popular, experts say.</p><p> Recent heat-fuelled deaths and disappearances in Greece, including that of the British TV personality Michael Mosley, have the potential to further fuel this northwards shift, as incidents of extreme heat influence holiday decisions.</p><p> The degree to which the travel industry and tourists alike can adapt to the rising tide of climate impacts is becoming a bigger issue for countries in southern Europe, many of which rely on tourism to boost their economies.</p><p> The recent high temperatures have brought the climate crisis into sharp focus for some European vacationers.</p><p> \"The climate crisis that we've been fearing will happen in 10 or 15 years is already here in some parts of the world. That's the scary part,\" Mr Roo Clark, 28, from Suffolk in eastern England, who is currently staying with his girlfriend on the Greek island of Skyros, told CNN.</p><p> \"Five years ago, my friends and I wouldn't have even spoken about it (climate change), whereas now it's more of a conversation.\"</p><p> The authorities in Greece have repeatedly warned tourists not to underestimate the intense heat, especially during the middle of the day. Hiking in high temperatures has been a common thread linking recent deaths in the country.</p><p> Temperatures in Greece are forecast to be between 32 deg C and 35 deg C over the next couple of weeks, a few degrees above summer average, according to CNN meteorologists, except for one to two days when rain is forecast, which will keep temperatures down.</p><p> Mr Stefanos Sidiropoulos, who runs Greece's largest travel agency specialising in outdoor activities, said tourists should not jump straight into activities. </p><p> \"People that are coming from north Europe, or from Canada, places with colder temperatures, it's more difficult for them. They need time to adapt to these conditions,\" he told CNN.</p><p> Mr Sidiropoulos' travel agency, Trekking Hellas, now offers some activities when temperatures are lower, such as during sunrise and sunset hours. \"Or at night, with torches,\" he said.</p><p> Climate change's influence on where tourists are taking their vacations will have serious repercussions for some countries dependent on income from travellers.</p><p> In Greece, tourism contributes nearly EUR38 billion (S$55.3 billion) -- around 20 per cent of the country's entire economy, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council.</p><p> In Italy, where level-three heat alerts -- the highest warning -- have recently been issued for the cities of Rome, Perugia and Palermo, tourism represents 10 per cent of the country's economy, according to the latest figures, with one in every eight jobs linked to the industry.</p><p> Following Europe's 2023 summer heatwave, which saw thousands flee from wildfires on the Greek island of Rhodes, there was a 7 per cent rise in expression of concerns about climate change among European travellers, according to the European Travel Commission (ETC), a non-profit association responsible for the promotion of Europe as a travel destination.</p><p> This followed a decline in interest in southern Mediterranean vacation locations between the summers of 2022 and 2023, with cooler destinations like the Czech Republic, Bulgaria and Denmark becoming more appealing, ETC told CNN.</p><p> Mr Eduardo Santander, chief executive of ETC, told CNN that \"travellers are increasingly aware of extreme weather events and their potential impact on their vacations\", adding that in the future this could cause more travellers to visit southern Europe during the spring and late autumn instead of during the hotter summer months.</p><p> For now, Mr Santander said, tourist concerns about climate change tend to be relatively short-lived. \"Travellers are concerned after the summer, but tend to forget about those events when booking their next holidays in spring,\" he said.</p><p> Extreme heat is one consequence of climate change impacting tourist hot spots across Europe. But there are others.</p><p> Warmer conditions caused by climate change are pushing populations of disease-transmitting mosquitoes into new areas of Europe, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC).</p><p> Mr Clark, the tourist staying on Skyros, said the number of mosquitoes was very high during the heatwave in early June. \"We were absolutely riddled with bites. There was no wind, and even though we sprayed ourselves they still found a way,\" he told CNN. \"It was definitely the low winds and high temperatures causing it.\"</p><p> The ECDC said one key mosquito species that can spread dengue, chikungunya, and Zika viruses, called Aedes albopictus, is now established in many European countries, including Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain,</p><p> Dr Andrea Ammon, ECDC director, said travel can contribute to the expansion of the species' reach. </p><p> \"Increased international travel from dengue-endemic countries will also increase the risk of imported cases,\" she said in a statement.</p><p> In 2023, the ECDC recorded 130 locally acquired cases of dengue in Europe, up from 71 cases in 2022.</p><p> There have been no locally acquired dengue cases reported in Europe so far this summer, the centre said, but based on previous summer trends, it expects the first cases to be reported in the coming weeks.</p><p> One human case of West Nile virus infection, spread by the native Culex pipiens mosquito, was reported in Spain's Seville province in March, according to the ECDC. </p><p> In 2023, the organisation recorded 713 locally acquired human cases of West Nile virus infection in nine European Union countries, resulting in 67 deaths.</p><p> Last summer's record-breaking temperatures across the globe were driven by a mix of human-caused climate change and the return of the natural, El Nino phenomenon, which brings warmer global temperatures. This combination raised temperatures to record levels in parts of Europe, the planet's fastest-warming continent.</p><p> But even as the impact of El Nino  diminishes, experts say the long-term trend of global warming will go on. </p><p> \"Climate change is tilting the odds in favour of more extreme events happening more frequently, and then becoming more severe,\" Dr Rebecca Carter, director of climate adaptation and resilience at the World Resources Institute, told CNN.</p><p> She added that high tourist numbers in some regions of Europe were putting already hard-pressed local authorities under pressure, as they juggle the need to keep residents safe from high heat as well as protecting visitors.</p><p> Dr Carter said the travel industry needs to consider climate adaptation. \"It's something I don't think the travel industry is thinking about as much as it should,\" she said, adding that booking rules could be made more flexible for flights and hotels, for example.</p><p> \"When people plan these trips, it's weeks or months in advance, and you can't predict when a specific place is going to have extreme heat.\" Some tourists, such as parents whose children are at school, have less flexibility when deciding travel plans, Dr Carter said. </p><p> In these circumstances, she said, planning was key: \"What would you do if there was an extreme heatwave, and the power was out? Can you map out in advance where you would go for help'\" </p><p> Mr Sidiropoulos from Trekking Hellas agreed that forward planning was important, but he was keen for visitors to still get out and enjoy the beauty of Greece's culture and natural world.</p><p> \"I always say to people who are travelling, 'Don't stay in your hotel and just do the classic things like go to a restaurant,'\" he said. \"You have the opportunity to see nature... and to see the authentic side of our country.\" CNN</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The authorities in Greece have repeatedly warned tourists not to underestimate the intense heat, especially during the middle of the day.

It sets out a legally binding framework and processes for the generation and international transfer of carbon credits between Singapore and Ghana.</p><p> The agreement is aligned with Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which governs rules on the bilateral and international transfer of carbon credits. Under Article 6, Ghana will have to increase its reported emissions by the amount of carbon credits it has transferred to Singapore, to avoid double counting. One carbon credit represents a reduction, avoidance or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent. </p><p> Just like the agreement with Papua New Guinea, this deal with Ghana requires project developers to contribute 5 per cent of their share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in the West African country. These funds will go towards helping Ghana prepare for and adjust to the impact of climate change. </p><p> Project developers will also be required to cancel 2 per cent of authorised carbon credits at first issuance to ensure additional contribution to overall mitigation of global emissions.</p><p> The collaboration advances the climate ambitions of Singapore and Ghana, and channels financing towards additional mitigation efforts, said a joint statement by the Ministry of Trade and Industry, the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, and the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) on Monday. </p><p> \"The carbon credit projects authorised under the implementation agreement will seek to promote sustainable development and generate benefits for local communities, such as the creation of jobs, access to clean water, improved energy security, and reduction of environmental pollution,\" said the statement. </p><p> The agreement means that Ghana joins Papua New Guinea on the eligibility list under the International Carbon Credit (ICC) Framework.  </p><p> The arrangement does not, however, mean that corporates can buy carbon credits generated from any carbon project in Ghana. Only credits generated under projects assessed and approved under the ICC framework are eligible. </p><p> Fu said that Singapore and Ghana share many mutual interests in the sustainability sphere. </p><p> \"The carbon credit projects implemented under this agreement will generate climate benefits as well as benefits to our economies. Singapore will continue its efforts to work with like-minded partners like Ghana to co-create opportunities for a sustainable future,\" she added. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Grace Fu, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment, says: \"The carbon credit projects implemented under this agreement will generate climate benefits as well as benefits to our economies.

This is a momentum that governments can build on. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute survey of nearly 3,000 people in all 10 Asean nations between July 10 and Aug 17 found that not only were people taking practical steps to reduce their impact on the planet, but they were also prepared to accept a hit to their hip pocket to make a difference. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> A majority of South-east Asians made at least one lifestyle change in the past year for the sake of climate. Steps included cutting down on single-use plastics, reducing electricity consumption and opting to take public transport. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As well as this stronger-than- expected shift to individual responsibility, nearly half want fossil fuel subsidies cut in their own countries. Importantly, support for a national carbon tax also grew to 70 per cent of respondents, up from 68 per cent the previous year. And an overwhelming 93 per cent of those who support such a tax are willing to take on a share of the tax burden as an individual consumer.</p><p> The findings suggest that the window is open for governments to take decisive policy action. </p><p> Two critical areas emerged in the survey that they could act on: a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies and investing in a regional power grid. </p><p> Their action will require a systemic policy approach, aligning economic, social and environmental goals through coordinated actions across multiple sectors.</p><p> Fossil fuel subsidies:  What governments can doForty-seven per cent of survey respondents support a phase-out of fossil fuel subsidies; 13 per cent were against it. But a middle group of \"swing voters\" -- about 35 per cent -- say they cannot decide one way or the other because of a lack of information about how their families will be affected if subsidies are removed.</p><p> This group can be persuaded. Governments can do this by discussing the economic, environmental and health impact of overdependence on fossil fuel subsidies, and by explaining how subsidies can be reallocated to more public funding for climate adaptation and other social programmes.</p><p> This is where Asean governments can go the extra mile, with inclusive dialogue that demonstrates transparency and by giving policy assurances on how the subsidies will be spent, such as on creating social safety nets for people who are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. </p><p>Malaysia has already taken a first step, moving from blanket to targeted diesel subsidies in July.</p><p> The situation in Indonesia is complex, although given the survey findings, it can afford to be more resolute in pushing through this difficult issue. </p><p> The removal of subsidies there is politically sensitive because of potential social instability caused by the rising cost of living. </p><p> President-elect Prabowo Subianto's plans to reallocate subsidies to the nation's school lunch programme are politically acceptable as they can be rationalised as nurturing the next generation -- but with the removal of fossil fuel subsidies, he would need to take a gradual and targeted approach. </p><p> A calibrated approach makes sense as it allows governments to fine-tune policies in response to the impact of subsidy reforms and energy transition measures. </p><p> Factoring in the social and economic impacts is important because, while many respondents say they are prepared individually to do their part in climate action, the survey also found that more people in the region are concerned about bread-and- butter issues such as food security than about climate change. Even in Singapore, in the vanguard of clean energy transition in the region, 63 per cent of respondents are very concerned about rising energy costs and the impact on the cost of living.</p><p> It is vital that people look beyond that short-term pain. Globally, US$7 trillion (S$9 trillion) -- equivalent to 7.1 per cent of global gross domestic product -- was spent on fossil fuel subsidies in 2022. Subsidies also exact less obvious environmental and climate costs. Removing them could prevent 1.6 million premature deaths due to air pollution, increase government coffers by US$4.4 trillion and put the world back on track to meeting the Paris Agreement goals, says the International Monetary Fund.</p><p> Support for an  Asean power gridNearly half the survey's respondents want governments to facilitate the development of regional energy infrastructure to accelerate a clean energy transition. It is an idea not without cause -- the International Energy Agency estimates that Asean has sufficient renewable energy sources to power itself and more. The question is, how to tap and distribute these resources, granting equal access across the region.</p><p> In fact, an Asean power grid (APG) has been in discussion for almost three decades. Currently, only half of the 18 planned interconnections are completed.</p><p> However, new bilateral interconnections and sub-regional power integration projects are leading to a reimagination of the original APG.</p><p> New subsea and overland interconnections are being planned outside the APG framework, such as one between Laos and Vietnam, Singapore-Cambodia, Peninsular Malaysia-Sumatra, Sarawak-Singapore, Vietnam-Singapore, and a new Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines Power Integration Project (PIP), akin to the Laos-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore PIP which will trade low-carbon electricity generated from hydropower or other renewable energy sources. </p><p> These could inspire a new Asean power grid 2.0 that need not require all the remaining interconnections to be completed. In fact, plans should, and must, evolve to meet new needs and demands. A systems policy approach at the regional level has to continuously evaluate what works and what does not. </p><p> Major infrastructure investments, amounting to nearly US$21 billion annually from now to 2030, will be required to bring these plans to fruition. Early inclusion of multilateral development banks and financial institutions is key to getting blended public and private finance.</p><p> An APG-dedicated financing facility would certainly help. But just having ready financing is not useful without open and transparent information of key priority APG projects to help investors decide. The European Union's Projects of Common Interest help investors prioritise the more urgent energy transition projects and speed up licensing and approvals. Asean can do something similar. </p><p> What is holding the  region back'What is lacking is the political will to bite the bullet by suffering short-term pain for long-term gain. </p><p> When the annual regional survey was launched in 2020, in the middle of the Covid-19 outbreak, over 60 per cent of South-east Asians wanted their governments to prioritise climate action over the pandemic response, despite the severe health and economic threats. </p><p> The desire for clear, decisive climate action by governments remains strong. However, removing blanket fossil fuel subsidies and implementing carbon taxes without adequate political buy-in could be a massive vote-loser amid inflationary pressures and economic uncertainties.</p><p> There is no common template that guarantees success for countries in moving from subsidies to deploying new technology and implementing carbon taxes. For example, a carbon tax may work in Singapore -- the Republic introduced it in 2019 -- but a compliance emissions trading scheme (ETS) may not. </p><p> An ETS allows regulators to set a cap on how much greenhouse gas emissions can be emitted in a sector or economy, and then allows tradable allowances. </p><p> Then again, some countries such as Indonesia could accept a combination of taxation and ETS, because their access to resources could spur technology innovation, while a carbon tax in certain sectors could be easily regulated. </p><p> Regardless of the specific transition challenges confronting each Asean country, the survey results show that people are willing to make sacrifices and take more responsibility for climate action. Governments should make the most of this window of opportunity to put in place policies that will benefit the planet in the long term.</p><p> Sharon Seah is senior fellow and coordinator of the Climate Change in South-east Asia Programme at the ISEAS -- Yusof Ishak Institute.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-R8D26BP</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D34-DMF1-JCF2-818K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The event at The Fullerton Hotel gathered policymakers, industry delegates, representatives of non-government groups, academics and the media. </p><p> In her speech, Fu said the Power Integration Project that Singapore has with Laos, Thailand and Malaysia has been a \"pathfinder\" for a wider regional grid. Under this project, Singapore will import up to 100 megawatts of hydropower from Laos, via Thailand and Malaysia.</p><p> \"The next step is to expand regional energy trading and aim for an Asean-wide power grid,\" she said. The reasons for this are the uneven distribution of renewable energy resources and the intermittency of such power sources, she said.</p><p> On her call for Asean to harmonise standards of climate monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV), she said: \"This will not only enhance the accountability of our climate actions, but will also support the development of interoperable carbon markets,\" she said.</p><p> Asean and Japan have worked together since 2019 to build MRV capabilities through an initiative known as the Partnership to Strengthen Transparency for Co-Innovation, or Pasti. </p><p> \"The next step is a pilot implementation of greenhouse gas emission monitoring and reporting guidelines across Asean member states,\" she said.</p><p> Another suggestion that she made was for Asean to boost its green value chain -- by building an integrated feedstock pathway for biofuels in the region.</p><p> The regional bloc can also promote and share solutions for sustainable agroforestry, so that these systems can act as carbon sinks, enhance agriculture and lower the risk of forest fires, Fu added.</p><p> Climate change is a pressing issue for Asean's 10 member countries, which are already experiencing the effects of extreme weather. The minister noted that Myanmar recently recorded its highest April temperature of 48.2 degrees Celsius, and that Thailand's heat index exceeded 52 deg C.</p><p> The region is, however, heavily reliant on coal and other fossil fuels, and in urgent need of green financing to make the transition to sustainable energy.</p><p> Fu acknowledged efforts on this front, such as Singapore's launch of the Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, or Fast-P initiative, that aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion to de-risk energy-transition projects.</p><p> She called on Asean to pool the experience of all member states and facilitate the sharing of best practices on climate action. </p><p> On its part, Singapore will share data from its Third National Climate Change Study with the Asean Specialised Meteorological Centre, so that the data can be used by member states to craft climate adaptation plans.</p><p> \"It is imperative that Asean work together to accelerate its green transition. Asean can leverage the benefits of regional complementarity, create economies of scale and drive opportunities for green growth,\" said Fu.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu also called for Asean to boost its green value chain.

The more sensible alternative, it is suggested, would be to get used to China's power and dominance. Just adapt and avoid the pain of pushing back.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But Australian statecraft is more than a bipolar game of primacy. </p><p> There is merit in a comprehensive and evidence-based appraisal of what Australia is actually doing to make its way in the connected and contested Indo-Pacific region so many nations share.</p><p> Instead, the Australian story gives a sense of what creative diplomacy can do in helping ensure a region of stability, predictability, resilience and respect for the sovereign rights of nations large and small alike.</p><p> In other words, how a middle power can support the conditions for prosperity and peace.</p><p> Diplomacy of stabilitySince its election in May 2022, the Labor government of Prime Minister Anthony Albanese, with Foreign Minister Penny Wong at the helm of its statecraft, has pursued a sophisticated foreign policy underpinned by the concept of \"strategic equilibrium\". This seeks to balance deterrence, diplomacy and development. </p><p> Yes, it involves the need to work with others -- and not only America -- in deterring China from disrupting regional order or initiating conflict.</p><p> But it also places large emphasis on the diplomacy of stability. In the region, this means support for dialogue and risk-reduction measures to prevent maritime incidents escalating to conflict.</p><p> Indeed, Asean and Asean-centric institutions have no firmer friend than Australia, as was clear in the special summit held in Melbourne in March. Australian diplomats strive each year to help Asean-centric institutions such as the East Asia Summit live up to their founding promise.</p><p> And bilaterally with China, the Albanese government has emphasised \"stabilisation\": cooperating where possible, disagreeing where necessary and always acting in the national interest. As a participant in last month's high-level dialogue with a Chinese delegation in Adelaide, I can attest the exchange was robust and constructive. We are well past the earlier phase of diplomatic confrontation and China's counterproductive economic coercion.</p><p> Such stabilisation-based engagement, with leadership-level visits in both directions, hardly suggests that Canberra is imagining away the realities of Beijing's power and potential, even while being cleared-eyed about the limitations and risks.</p><p> Blue Pacific interestsJust as the past few years of Australian diplomacy have stressed closer cooperation with South-east Asia, so too has there been emphasis on friendship with the nations and peoples of the Blue Pacific; more than that, practical and development-focused collaboration has been infused with what Papua New Guinea Foreign Minister Justin Tkatchenko has defined as \"strategic trust\".</p><p> There's no question that concern about growing Chinese influence and presence has been a major spur to Canberra's policy vigour. Plainly, it is in Australia's interests to ensure that an authoritarian military power cannot one day be in a position to project force on our eastern flank, in what has since 1945 been essentially an ocean of peace.</p><p> Foreign Minister Wong has acknowledged that, sadly, the two countries will be in a permanent contest for influence in the Pacific.</p><p> But for Australia, this is also about doubling down on decades of partnership with its Pacific \"family\", where we have never stopped being the development partner of scale and choice.</p><p> Every major collective indication from Pacific governments -- from the 2018 Boe Declaration on regional security, to the 2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent, to recent announcements at the Pacific Islands Forum summit in Tonga -- affirms an openness to precisely the kind of approach Australia is taking.</p><p> That is, engagement that is Pacific-led, based on deep consultation and local needs, whether on economic development, resource management, governance, health, connectivity, or addressing the impacts of climate change. </p><p> Pacific nations are clear about preserving their independence, cultural integrity and democratic character, just as they assert their rights to engage with many partners, including Australia, New Zealand, Japan, the United States, South-east Asia, India, South Korea, Europe or indeed China -- or even, in some cases, Taiwan. </p><p> All this sets the scene for the latest developments, notably the finalisation of the Australia-Indonesia Defence Cooperation Agreement and the many-nation Pacific Policing Initiative.</p><p> Confusingly, my colleague Prof White sees these success stories as proof that Australia is losing \"credibility\" by fruitlessly trying to draw its neighbours into a coalition to support the US against China. </p><p> The reality is more subtle and less exciting, as befits the grinding work of real statecraft. </p><p>Indonesia defence tiesCanberra has no illusions that there is even a possibility of seeking an anti-China mutual defence pact with Jakarta, and no serious policy voice in either country is contemplating a formal alliance. </p><p> Of course, Australia and Indonesia need each other as forces for stability and strength, and it makes good sense to do precisely what the new military agreement does: train together, operate with consent from each other's countries, share education and, where possible, technological know-how. </p><p> The new Australia-Indonesia agreement is a measure of mutual consent and common interest, translated by proactive diplomacy through the art of the possible. To suggest otherwise is to imagine absurdly that a dynamic, proud and rising power of 280 million people lacks agency or the free and active foreign policy for which it is known.</p><p> Meanwhile, the Pacific Policing Initiative is best understood as part of a wider web of cooperation by which Pacific nations are pooling capability for good effect. This involves shared training in Brisbane as well as across multiple centres of excellence in various Pacific nations, and the creation of a common deployment force for major events and crisis response. Pacific experts point out that it is the revitalisation of a model under which Australia and many neighbours supported Solomon Islands from 2003 to 2017, and Pacific leaders have welcomed it as the response to genuine regional need, including in countering the drug trade and supporting public order.</p><p> The specifics have been driven by a consensus of Pacific Islands chiefs of police and have been more than a year in the making. So the private suggestion by a leading US official that Washington was giving Australia the \"lane\" on this issue was both inaccurate and unnecessary, given that this was a Pacific-led deal that had already been done.</p><p> The policing outcome was announced last month when Pacific leaders gathered in Tonga, along with the establishment of a multilateral Pacific Resilience Facility -- for agile funding of climate adaptation projects -- and entry-into-force of the Falepili Union. This is an innovative treaty in which Australia guarantees a future for the people and sovereignty of the small island nation of Tuvalu, even if rising sea levels cover their low-lying territory.</p><p> There are always things to question about any nation's foreign policy settings, and being our best critics is a fine Australian tradition, at home and abroad. Nor are there any guarantees that the current government's goal of equilibrium can be achieved or sustained, given that it requires many nations to work together for regional resilience. </p><p> But whatever the faults of where Australian policy stands today, a lack of respect for the priorities of its neighbours is not one of them. The world may be increasingly a topsy-turvy place where truth is hard to discern. Yet one thing should remain obvious: Securing creative deals with its neighbours is evidence of a nation's credibility and not the opposite. </p><p> Professor Rory Medcalf is head of the National Security College at the Australian National University.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Chinese Premier Li Qiang and Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at Parliament House in Canberra in June.

By 2030, the tax will eventually reach $50 to $80 per tonne of CO2 emissions. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Companies can purchase carbon credits to offset up to 5 per cent of their taxable emissions, provided that the carbon projects they invest in meet Singapore's eligibility criteria, which include having permanent emissions reductions, for instance. </p><p> A similar carbon credit agreement was signed between Singapore and Papua New Guinea on Dec 8, 2023, at the United Nations' COP28 climate conference in Dubai. </p><p> In a joint statement on May 27, Singapore's National Climate Change Secretariat, Ministry of Trade and Industry and Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment said the collaboration between Singapore and Ghana will advance climate ambitions for both countries and channel financing towards climate mitigation efforts. </p><p> The carbon credit projects authorised under the agreement will seek to promote sustainable development and generate benefits for the local communities, such as creation of jobs, access to clean water, improved energy security, and reduction of environmental pollution. </p><p> Under the agreement, carbon credit project developers will be required to make a contribution equivalent to 5 per cent of the share of proceeds from authorised carbon credits towards climate adaptation in Ghana, which helps Ghana to prepare and adjust to the impact of climate change. </p><p> The project developers will also be required to cancel 2 per cent of authorised carbon credits at first issuance, to contribute to the mitigation of global greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p> The agreement was signed virtually between Singapore's Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu and Ghana's Minister of Environment for Science, Technology and Innovation Ophelia Hayford. </p><p> The bilateral agreement comes as Temasek-backed investment platform GenZero has already been investing in a forest restoration project in the Kwahu region of Ghana. </p><p> A Straits Times report published in July 2023 said the first phase of the project was to start in the last quarter of 2023, with the second phase beginning in 2027. </p><p> The project, which is a collaboration with Singapore-based AJA Climate Solutions, will involve replanting degraded forest reserves, including growing cocoa trees sustainably in shaded farms to shield these plantations from potentially damaging climate impact such as floods, heat stress and pests. </p><p> AJA Climate Solutions is focused on generating and managing climate mitigation projects in Africa and South-east Asia. </p><p> The project area within the Kwahu region had been a lush forest about 40 to 50 years ago, but was heavily exploited for timber over the past few decades. </p><p> The deforestation has led to Ghana losing more cocoa hectares year on year, which is damaging for the country economically as it is among the world's largest cocoa producers. </p><p> In the second phase of the forest restoration project, the focus will shift to regenerating native tree species across degraded forests. More than 20 million seedlings of native species are to be planted over seven years. </p><p> Jobs in farming and agroforestry training will be created, and new income opportunities will emerge for the local indigenous communities, empowering some 22,000 families, AJA Climate Solutions' co-chief executive John Mason told reporters at a briefing in July 2023. </p><p> The verification of carbon credits from the Ghana project will then begin in 2028. </p><p> Checks by ST in January revealed that companies looking to purchase carbon credits from Papua New Guinea to offset part of their carbon tax would have to wait longer for eligible projects that are of high quality, as none of the available credits for sale currently meet the criteria set by the Singapore Government. </p><p>Singapore has also concluded negotiations on similar carbon credit schemes with Vietnam, Paraguay and Bhutan, but agreements have not been formally inked with these countries. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-SA9S1RC</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6C48-3H61-JCF2-82KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-05-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"706\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Good morning. I am happy to join all of you at the 8th MENDAKI Symposium.</p><p>Implications of Climate Change</p><p>2. While I am heartened to see many youths among the audience today, something that weighs heavy on my mind is climate change. It is a reality that we simply cannot ignore. It is not something that will happen 30 years down the road. It is already happening today. We are experiencing warmer temperatures globally. It is quite clear that temperatures are going up.</p><p>3. How does this impact us? We are receiving frequent reminders of climate change through unprecedented weather events in cities around the world. From the record-breaking Hurricane Beryl which ripped through the Caribbean and is now slamming into Texas, to severe floods in parts of China and Brazil, to a scorching 51.8 degrees Celsius temperature in Mecca recently, resulting in thousands of deaths and injuries. In Singapore, 2023 was our 4th warmest year on record, and it has been forecasted by the Meteorological ServiceSingapore (MSS) that 2024 could be an even warmer year than 2023. Already scientists are telling us that temperatures for June 2024 is going to be record-breaking around the world. I am sure many of us agree that we are feeling the brunt of the weather these days.</p><p>4. These weather events and weather changes cause devastating results such as deaths, injury, damage and loss of property and even uncertainties in global food supply due to a reduction in crop yield. We are not merely victims of climate change. Decades of burning fossil fuels for energy, industrialisation and unsustainable deforestation and consumption practices have contributed to the climate change which we experience today. We are the cause of climate change.</p><p>Climate Action</p><p>5. These events send a clear message on the pressing need for immediate action. In Singapore, we have pledged to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve net zero by 2050. Achieving net zero is a whole-of-nation effort, involving the public and private sectors, communities, as well as individuals. That is why we launched the SG Green Plan 2030 in 2021, which charts concrete targets in five Pillars over the next 10 years that will position us to achieve our long-term net zero emissions aspiration by 2050. We are increasing our carbon tax rate and introducing new policies to decarbonise our economy, energy and households.</p><p>Aviation sector</p><p>6. As an aviation hub, Singapore is playing our role in decarbonising the aviation sector by scaling up Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), a cleaner alternative to traditional jet fuel used in airplanes. Flights departing from Singapore will be required to use SAF from 2026. We will aim for a 1% SAF target for a start, with the goal of increasing it to 3 to 5% by 2030, subject to global developments and the wider availability and adoption of SAF. It is not just about airlines wanting to do it. The supply of SAF also has to come on stream, and in time. SAF is expected to contribute around 65% of emissions reductions needed by aviation to achieve net zero by 2050.</p><p>Maritime sector</p><p>7. In the maritime industry, Singapore is also playing a leading role in catalysing the development and uptake of zero and near-zero emission solutions. The Maritime and Port Authority of Singapore (MPA), with the support of industry partners and the Port of Singapore Authority (PSA) conducted the world's first ship-to-containership methanol bunkering operation in July 2023, followed by a more complex simultaneous methanol bunkering and cargo operation in May 2024. We have also conducted the world's first use of ammonia as a marine fuel in March 2024 within the Port of Singapore, onboard the Fortescue Green Pioneer. By switching away from conventional marine fuels to these cleaner alternative fuels, we can significantly reduce carbon emissions generated from the maritime industry. We have also established five Green and Digital Shipping Corridors (GDSCs) along key shipping and fuel supply routes with like-minded partners in Asia, Europe, and North America. These GDSCs serve as a test bed environment for pilot projects and facilitate stakeholder collaboration towards a more sustainable maritime industry.</p><p>8. Climate action has been focused on climate mitigation, which are efforts and ways to reduce climate greenhouse gas emissions, and to reduce the effects of climate change, adaptation is a topic that is very much talked about in the climate circuit. Because while we are mitigating, we must also prepare for warmer temperatures. The world also needs to focus on climate adaptation - to adapt to the effects of climate change which we are already feeling and to adapt to greater unpredictability of the weather system which affects our food sources and water supply.</p><p>9. In Singapore, we are reviewing and refining our adaptation plans to incorporate the latest climate projections from our Third National Climate Change Study (V3), which has projected higher temperatures, more wet and dry extremes, and accelerating increase in mean sea levels. For example, to enhance our flood and coastal resilience, we are carrying out studies to explore different solutions, including the 'Long Island'. This is a stretch of new land is going to be reclaimed, creating a new boundary that will protect us from coastal floods, and new land for us. We also have to ensure our food resiliency, and we do so through a multi-pronged approach. Complementing import source diversification and stockpiling, is the 'grow local' basket, which through productive, climate resilient, resource efficient local food production, acts as a buffer against disruptions to food imports. This is about building capability, the know-how to grow in a climate resilient way. For this, we have set the aspiration of the \"30 by 30\" vision, to build up our agri-food industry's capability and capacity to produce 30% of our nutritional needs locally and sustainably by 2030.</p><p>10. Despite accounting for just 0.1% of the world's emissions, Singapore is doing our part to support climate action internationally. We are committed to supporting and accelerating the transition towards a net zero future in Singapore, in the region, and beyond. For example, we are actively contributing to blended finance initiatives in the region, and have signed carbon credit Implementation Agreements with Papua New Guinea and Ghana, which will help spur the development of international carbon markets.</p><p>11. At COP-28 last year, Singapore played a key role in facilitating the conclusion of the first Global Stocktake which reviewed the world's progress towards meeting the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal. No effort is too small. Despite our size and constraints, Singapore continues to punch above our weight and contribute to international efforts. In addition, Singapore is committed to supporting fellow developing countries in their efforts to address climate change through capacity-building assistance. Under the Singapore Cooperation Programme (SCP), more than 150,000 officials from over 180 countries and territories have been trained in topics such as climate adaptation and mitigation, disaster risk management, and green finance. The Sustainability Action Package (SAP) was launched under the SCP in 2022 to focus on sustainability themes, including green project management, low carbon development and carbon markets. To date, we have organised 45 courses for over 1,000 participants under the SAP.</p><p>The Role of Youths</p><p>12. Youths have a significant role to play in Singapore's sustainability journey and fight against climate change. Initiatives led by governments, businesses and community organisations provide youths with resources, mentorship, and a conducive environment to have a stake in their future and champion issues they care deeply about.</p><p>13. One initiative led by the Government is the Climate Youth Development Programme (CYDP). Co-led by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, the National Climate Change Secretariat and the National Youth Council, the programme was established in July 2023 to strengthen partnership with the youth community in advancing climate action for sustainable development. Through the inaugural programme last year, 40 youths had the opportunity to develop the knowledge, skillsets and networks to contribute to Singapore's sustainability efforts through conversations with climate change advocates, policymakers, and related events such as the Singapore International Energy Week 2023, Ecosperity and United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's (UNFCCC) COP28.</p><p>14. The National Environment Agency (NEA) launched the Youth for Environmental Sustainability, or YES, Leaders Programme, to bring together partners from the People, Public and Private to address environmental issues through innovative solutions and collaborations. Launched in 2023, the programme offers our youth leaders a unique opportunity to channel their passion for the environment into tangible projects with meaningful impact. We are also seeing youths and organisations tapping on the SG Eco Fund to drive ground-up sustainability initiatives in their community, in areas ranging from waste reduction and recycling to community growing of food.</p><p>15. One such project is by the Malay Youth Literary Association, which started a \"Youth Eco Action\" project to create awareness on environmental sustainability among youths through interactive activities such as pairing clean-ups with cycling and kayaking, gardening and waste upcycling workshops, and farm tours. I encourage youths who are keen to work on environmental initiatives to come forward and apply for the SG Eco Fund to carry out your projects. We have also partnered with MOE, such as through the SG Perspectives series, to engage the youths so that they can better understand Singapore's context and policy considerations.</p><p>16. To the youths, I know it might sound daunting or you might not know where to start, but there are those who have gone before you.</p><p>17. We have Ms Farah Sanwari, who is an active youth leader who co-founded FiTree, an Islamic environmental group; and Repair Kopitiam, an initiative involving repair enthusiasts who believe in giving used appliances a second life. I had the honour to present Singapore's Voluntary National Review of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) at United Nations in New York with Farah. She presented Singapore's report card on the SDGs. She added richness to the discussions, and for the community, the people sector to be represented.</p><p>18. Meanwhile, Mr Muhammad Ibnur Rashad is the founder of social enterprise Ground Up Innovation Labs for Development (GUILD) and has conducted workshops to educate the public on recycling waste plastics into 3D-printed planters, which were used to create a floating garden system.</p><p>19. I would like to mention a third person - Naeem Nadzri. As you may know, Singapore played a leadership role at the sessions at COP-28 where I co-facilitated negotiations on mitigation. When I was co-facilitating, I noticed this young man taking notes. I found out later that he was there as a youth leader in our Climate Youth Development Programme. Naeem is really an inspiring person to me. I found that his work in sustainability, in understanding treatment and extraction of useful materials from our waste is very relevant.</p><p>20. If are able to extract the useful items from our waste, give them a second or third life, that is how we can reduce the need to mine even more. Every time when we change to a new electronic device, we are part of the reason why pits are being dug up. When you see photos of huge mining operations, where we are digging several tens of metres down into the earth to extract resources and causing environmental degradation, loss of biodiversity, clearing of land. You and I are part of the cause. If we are able to give the resources endless life by recycling, extracting resources, separating the waste, then we can minimise the harm caused to the environment.</p><p>21. Youths are in the middle of action. From the three examples that I gave, you can see they are involved in community awareness, community engagement, and are putting their aspirations into action. They are going into the science and technological part of it to find new solutions. And there is really a whole range of different ways for us to enter the field of sustainability and climate change. This is really an area where your aspirations and your dreams can be put into action in a very seamless way.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>22. In 2050, how old would you be? What future do you want your children to grow up in? Start today to own the future, shape the future, so that the future will be what you want it to be. That is why youth involvement is so important. You have the runway ahead of you. Own the future and put your aspirations into actions.</p><p>23.

As we start the new year, I thought we would share some reflections from the recent COP28 in Dubai last month, to give us a sense of where we have come and where we are heading.<br/><br/>3. COP28 marked the first-ever Global Stocktake of the world's progress towards meeting the goals of the 2015 Paris Agreement. For the first time, a decision has been reached to transition away from fossil fuels in our energy systems. And more than ever, there is a realisation that we may have the means to make the necessary course corrections to get to net zero by scaling up renewable energy deployment, energy efficiency improvement and removing the stock of carbon in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>4. However, the Global Stocktake was also a stark reminder that current efforts are not sufficient to limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C. And this was at the heart of most of the discussion stretching deep into the night during COP28, that we cannot afford to sit idly by, because the effects are already here and affecting our lives. According to the World Meteorological Organisation, 2023 is the warmest year on record. Across the globe, communities experienced extreme weather events, from deadly wildfires in Canada and Greece, to torrential rains and floods in India, Pakistan and China, and a sweltering heatwave in Southeast Asia. In Singapore, we matched our historical high temperature of 37C in May 2023. The heat, coupled with high humidity in our environment, brings serious health risks. Such extreme weather occurrences are projected to increase in frequency and intensity, and undoubtedly many of us are concerned how much worse they may become, and how we are preparing.<br/><br/>Third National Climate Change Study<br/><br/>5. Climate change is an existential challenge for Singapore, and the Government treats it with utmost seriousness. We are investing significantly to better understand it, and starting our planning and preparatory works. Since 2007, we have undertaken three National Climate Change Studies to better understand the impact of climate change on Singapore.<br/><br/>6. The Third National Climate Change Study, or V3, is the latest. Led by the Centre for Climate Research Singapore (CCRS), V3 provides the world's highest resolution climate projections for Singapore and the Southeast Asia region until the end of the century. Working off the 6th Assessment Report (AR6) of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), V3 shows climate projections based on three global emission scenarios - low, medium and high, with the effects of climate change more pronounced under the high emissions scenario.<br/><br/>7. V3 is the result of years of careful investments, in not only climate science but also supercomputing. CCRS partnered the National Supercomputing Centre (NSCC) to work on coarse global climate models to obtain finer climate projections for Singapore and our region. This is akin to zooming in from a big world map to a map of Singapore that displays our streets and landmarks. To achieve this, the teams had to make sense of billions of climate data points spanning multiple decades.<br/><br/>8. I congratulate CCRS and NSCC on the successful completion of V3. This achievement advances scientific understanding of our tropical climate and sets a benchmark for future climate projections. More importantly, V3 provides a common scientific basis for all interested parties - government agencies, businesses, academia and community groups - to prepare for a climate-resilient future.<br/><br/>9. V3 shows that we will have to contend with more extreme climate conditions - higher temperatures, heavier rainfalls and longer and more frequent dry spells. These climate conditions may also lead to other indirect climate challenges, including disruptions to water and food. Armed with these projections, we will strive to safeguard a sustainable, resilient and liveable Singapore for our future generations, just as our forefathers had done for us.<br/><br/>Climate Action in Singapore<br/><br/>Climate Mitigation<br/><br/>10. To achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement in limiting global warming, a global solution is required. We will do our part. We have committed to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 and have been taking active steps to mitigate climate change and transit to a low-carbon future.<br/><br/>11. From 1 Jan, we have raised our carbon tax to $25 per tonne. We will progressively raise the carbon tax level further, to $50 to $80 by 2030.<br/><br/>12. As a small, alternative energy disadvantaged island nation, we have looked towards innovation and collaboration to transform our energy supply. We are making innovative use of our limited land by deploying solar panels on rooftops and reservoirs, and are collaborating on cross-border green energy trade.<br/><br/>13. Decarbonisation of the international maritime and aviation sectors is also high on our agenda. We are preparing our maritime hub for a multi-fuel transition. We are piloting projects for biofuels, methanol and ammonia. We have also been collaborating with other international ports and partners to promote Green and Digital Shipping Corridors. On the aviation front, we are home to the largest production facility for sustainable aviation fuel. We are exploring ways to promote the offtake of SAF to regional and international airlines at Changi Airport, moving the needle on low-carbon air travel.<br/><br/>Climate Adaptation<br/><br/>14. The Government will co-create solutions on adaptation with the community by setting aside resources, and strengthen our climate adaption plans.<br/><br/>15. With the release of V3, we will review our existing plans and ensure their relevance. We will also look out for new climate risks that may require our attention. I will highlight two aspects of climate impacts.<br/><br/>16. First, on tackling rising sea levels. This presents an opportunity to reimagine the design of our coastlines, to create new benefits such as additional recreational spaces for the community, and conserving nature and biodiversity. Last November, we announced plans to start technical studies for the 'Long Island', which could involve reclaiming around 800 hectares of land and protect the low-lying East Coast of Singapore from rising sea levels. This will integrate coastal protection with future land use needs, create a new freshwater reservoir to enhance long-term water resilience and create new possibilities for parks and recreational activities. We will take into consideration stakeholders' views and suggestions from Our Coastal Conversations led by PUB, and we will seek feedback from stakeholders on the plans for the 'Long Island' and other segments of the coast. To enhance our engineering capability, we launched the Coastal Protection and Flood Resilience Institute (or CFI) Singapore, hosted at NUS. This brings together the strengths of local institutes and the industry to take on this decades-long challenge.<br/><br/>17. The second part is about coping with rising temperatures. We have utilised passive design strategies to remain cool in our warm climate. These include intensifying greenery in our urban areas and orienting buildings along the North-South direction to reduce heat gain. More recently, we have used measurements, modelling and simulation to improve our city design and enhance our knowledge of urban heat and its impact on human health. We are also actively strengthening our community's resilience to cope with heat. Last year, we launched the Heat Stress Advisory to empower residents to make more informed decisions when engaging in outdoor activities. Specific sectors such as employers of outdoor workers, schools and operators of residential homes have also put in place enhanced measures to protect vulnerable segments from heat stress.<br/><br/>18. As a broader point, we will need to continue to deepen our understanding of these climate risks, to inform our long-term plans. CCRS launched a first grant call last year under the Climate Impact Science Research Programme. I am pleased to announce that eight projects have been awarded under the first grant call to a diverse group of researchers across our Institutes of Higher Learning. Armed with the V3 results, these projects will investigate the impact of climate change on vector-borne and chronic diseases, changes in our tropical forest landscape, and our food security, to name a few.<br/><br/>19. Today, CCRS will launch the second grant call for proposals to better understand climate change impacts on Singapore's water resources, maritime and port infrastructure, the incursion and spread of vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, and our abilities to adapt to heat. I encourage our scientists and industry partners in the audience today to participate in the grant call.<br/><br/>International Collaborations in Climate Science &amp; Adaptation<br/><br/>20. Just as with decarbonisation efforts, countries have to work with and support one another to accelerate climate adaptation. Singapore will contribute expertise and resources for international capacity building, such as in the IPCC process. Professor Winston Chow, who is here today, is the Co-Chair of the IPCC's Working Group II. He will lead the next cycle of work in the 7th Assessment Report (AR7) to assess climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities across diverse communities and ecosystems. These findings will serve as a globally recognised basis for international negotiations at future UN Climate Change Conferences. We will also share our V3 data with our regional partners through the ASEAN Specialised Meteorological Centre to support scientific understanding of climate change and associated impacts. And we will provide V3 data to inform the climate impacts assessments tools of the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, to enable users in our region to conduct more detailed assessments of their agriculture sectors and equip themselves better to respond to climate change.<br/><br/>Closing<br/><br/>21.Everyone has a part to play in tackling climate change. CCRS will make the findings publicly available via the Data Visualisation Portal, to encourage greater access. With this information, researchers can co-create climate-resilient solutions and communicate important scientific knowledge. Businesses can lead the way by adopting more sustainable practices, tracking your carbon footprint and setting a net zero target year. Community groups can raise awareness about climate change and mobilise action, such as nature conservation.<br/><br/>22. I hope today's Symposium will give you a renewed sense of purpose and energy in climate action. I wish you all a fruitful session ahead.

The UN estimates that the current adaptation finance gap is US$194 billion (S$264 billion) to US$366 billion per year.</p><p> Ms Marisa Drew, chief sustainability officer at Standard Chartered Bank, said that defining the commercial opportunities involved in financing adaptation is key to getting the private sector involved. </p><p> \"Because we are private sector actors, we're here to make a return,\" she said. </p><p> She added that case studies are valuable in helping firms grasp the opportunities involved in the space. </p><p> \"Often, we talk about these things in a very big-picture way. But if we have proof points, your investments that are proving out the return or the project that worked... (we can say) here's a good one. Copy it. And... that's when you start to see that scaling effect start to take hold,\" said Ms Drew. </p><p> Mr Koh said the list of climate hazards that scientists have warned about can serve as \"shopping lists\" for technologies and solutions to deal with these challenges. </p><p> He cited one solution his firm will soon announce that it is funding: an artificial intelligence company that analyses satellite imagery for vegetation management for utilities. </p><p> \"Sparking from power lines, globally, is what causes the giant wildfires we are seeing in the United States, Australia and other countries where vegetation, trees, shrubs, grasses encroach too much on the transmission distribution lines,\" he said. </p><p> Currently, managing this threat is done manually, Mr Koh said, with one group of workers identifying trees growing too close to the power lines, and another group coming in to trim the limbs that are getting too close.</p><p> \"However, this is not a scalable strategy with the acceleration (of climate impacts) that we're seeing now in heat events, weather events, and the kind of wildfire risks that we have,\" he said. </p><p> \"But now we have applications of technology, artificial intelligence, and satellite and drone imagery to enable over 40 utilities today to manage that risk in a much more efficient way,\" Mr Koh said. </p><p> The session was moderated by Mr Dave Sivaprasad, managing director and partner at management consultancy Boston Consulting Group, and featured as panellists Mr Koh, Ms Drew and two other speakers. </p><p> The two other speakers were Mr Tom Moody, regional director for South-east Asia, climate and energy at the British government's Foreign, Commonwealth and Development Office, and Mr Lubomir Varbanov, managing director and head of public sector solutions for the Asia-Pacific at reinsurance giant Swiss Re.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-GO8TLRO</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BTR-8501-JCF2-801X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"721\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

They are going to raise the cost,\" he told a panel discussion, moderated by The Straits Times editor Jaime Ho, on unlocking climate leadership in a competitive world. </p><p> The other panellists were Professor Julie Zimmerman, vice-provost for planetary solutions at Yale University, and Professor Kim Sang-hyup, co-chairman of South Korea's Presidential Commission on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth. </p><p> China, the world's largest greenhouse gas polluter, is also by far the largest producer and investor in renewable energy. The government sees green energy as key to reaching net-zero emissions by the mid-century. </p><p> Globally, in 2023, the world added 473 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity, according to the International Renewable Energy Agency. China accounted for the lion's share, adding another 297.6GW, mostly wind and solar. </p><p> This rapid growth in China, fuelled by state subsidies, has helped slash green energy costs globally, and further investment will drive costs down even more, said Mr Liu. </p><p> \"I think we are also prepared to collaborate with many of the developing countries to help them. So, globally, we have to maintain this process for both the innovation and manufacturing,\" he said. </p><p> The panel discussion comes against a backdrop of rising geopolitical and trade-related tensions and increasingly severe impacts from climate change, with 2023 being the hottest year on record.</p><p> More than ever, nations need to collaborate on financing innovation to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, a key guard rail under the 2015 UN Paris Agreement. </p><p> COP29 will be a major test of cooperation and willingness to step up the fight against climate change. At the summit in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku, nearly 200 countries will be tasked with agreeing on a new global goal for funding, called the New Collective Quantified Goal. </p><p> \"We must have an agreement on financial support at COP29,\" Mr Liu said. </p><p> But there are signs that getting agreement, a key measure of COP29's success, will be a fraught process. Climate finance has been one of the most divisive issues in three decades of UN climate negotiations.</p><p> Poorer nations, which are the most vulnerable to climate impacts but are least responsible for the emissions driving the climate crisis, say rich nations should provide funding to help them adapt to impacts and to green their fossil fuel-dependent economies. </p><p> Yet, the costs of climate impacts keep rising, and many poorer nations are deep in debt. </p><p> They are already missing out on much of the green investment boom globally because they lack the financial resources or policies to support investment. </p><p> Wealthy nations refuse to commit to large and growing climate costs, and want to spread the financial load to other countries.</p><p> Differences were laid bare during preparatory talks for COP29 in Bonn, Germany, that wrapped up on June 13. There were deep disagreements over the size of the goal, who should pay, how much to pay, and where the money would come from -- for example, from taxes on fossil fuels or debt swaps. </p><p> The new goal must be more than the existing US$100 billion (S$135 billion) that rich nations pledged back in 2009 to provide annually by 2020 -- and eventually reached in 2022. </p><p> The UN pointed to an independent report from 2023, which estimated that US$2.4 trillion of investments per year are needed by 2030 in developing countries -- excluding China.</p><p> This would be a fourfold increase from current levels, and includes public finance, as well as private finance and funding from sources including development banks.</p><p>India, African countries and small island nations have said more than US$1 trillion should be raised per year, but have mixed views on how much of this should come from government coffers.</p><p> The EU and US want to add new donors, including China and countries with high gross domestic product per capita, such as Qatar, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates.</p><p> Beijing has firmly opposed this, and Mr Liu reiterated China's position.</p><p> \"China will not be a donor like OECD countries. But we are going to continue to support multilateral development banks in their efforts for the investment in climate action. We are going to continue our support to other developing countries through South-South cooperation,\" he added, referring to the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development club of wealthy nations. China is the world's second-largest economy. </p><p> \"We also need to mobilise all sources of support for this global process,\" Mr Liu said, a view shared by Prof Kim. </p><p> Building up the skills of people, working with developing nations on climate solutions and helping fund climate adaptation projects are ways to drive change, Prof Kim said. For instance, the Global Green Growth Institute based in South Korea supports the green and low-carbon transition of developing and underdeveloped countries. </p><p> Another key area of collaboration is education -- to train the people needed for a climate-changed world, said Prof Zimmerman. </p><p> \"It is working with partners in industry and in government to understand what skills will be necessary, so that we are training a workforce that is prepared for future jobs and the future world that is changed by climate,\" she told the panel. </p><p> \"I think universities really need to think about defining what a future that we want to live in (looks like).\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A panel discussion at the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting of the New Champions in Dalian, China, on June 25, was moderated by The Straits Times editor Jaime Ho (left), and involved Mr Liu Zhenmin, Beijing's special envoy for climate change; Professor Julie Zimmerman, Yale University's vice-provost for planetary solutions; and Professor Kim Sang-hyup, co-chairman of South Korea's Presidential Commission on Carbon Neutrality and Green Growth.

While the GSS bond market is unlikely to rebound to 2021's record US$1.1 trillion in issuance, we expect it to hold up well, even with challenges such as higher-for-longer interest rates and moderating growth. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Moody's projects that GSS bond issuance could reach US$950 billion in 2024, slightly higher than 2023's US$946 billion, and S&amp;P forecasts issuance to surpass the US$1 trillion mark.</p><p> Growing share of new bondsAlthough supranational entities, financial institutions and agencies initially led the way in GSS bond issuance, sovereigns now account for a growing proportion of new bonds. Bonds issued directly by government departments have risen from about 7 per cent of the total market value at end-2017 to over 20 per cent at the end of March 2023, according to MSCI data.</p><p> In 2023, a record 35 sovereigns globally issued sustainable bonds totalling US$169 billion, exceeding the 2022 high-water mark of 26 issuers with US$141 billion in issuance. Of these, 17 were developed countries and 18 were emerging market (EM) sovereign issuers; the EM issuers included seven who entered the market for the first time.</p><p> Over recent years, EM sovereigns have contributed more to global GSS sovereign bond issuance, accounting for 25 per cent in 2023, underscoring the significant climate finance gap for developing economies to build resilience to climate change and fund the shift to a low-carbon economy.</p><p> These national, regional and local governments face not only high exposure to physical climate risk and carbon-transition risk, but often also lack the fiscal and institutional capacity to tackle these problems on top of facing higher costs of capital. Such challenges require continued innovation in their financing approaches.</p><p> We believe sustainable finance will be a growing source of funding as emerging market sovereigns present national-energy transition plans and climate adaptation goals.</p><p> The Sharm El-Sheikh Implementation Plan drawn up at COP27 in 2022 included an estimate that investments needed to transition to a low-carbon economy globally would total US$4 trillion to US$6 trillion a year. Sovereign GSS bond issuance could provide a significant proportion of this financing. At the following COP28 meeting, climate finance was again a hot topic, and we expect it to continue to be a key focus for developing and emerging markets.</p><p> Standards in the GSS bond market are improving. From late 2024, the European Union Green Bonds Standard (EUGBS) is set to transform issuance across the bloc in terms of reporting and transparency.</p><p> Close alignmentThe standard requires a close alignment with the EU taxonomy for sustainable activities and its six environmental objectives for sustainable activities: </p><p> Issuers of bonds under the EUGBS will be required to disclose detailed information about how the proceeds will be used to ensure alignment with the taxonomy. They must explain how the funds contribute to the sustainable transition, ensuring green investments are not negated by unsustainable activities in other areas.</p><p> The EUGBS builds on existing green bond frameworks, including the Green, Social and Sustainability Bond Principles formulated by the International Capital Market Association, alongside frameworks in China and India covering local markets.</p><p> The shift from voluntary to regulatory standards should enforce greater market discipline and encourage increased issuance of green, social and sustainable bonds.</p><p> Building on these improving standards, we have seen issuances covering a steadily widening range of themes in the last six months. Clean transportation -- particularly railway-related financing -- continues to dominate issuance from a thematic standpoint, but the market is seeing increased diversification.</p><p>Iceland, already the world's most gender-equal country, has become the first sovereign to issue a gender-based bond aimed at closing the gender gap further. Previously, only companies and development banks had issued gender-labelled bonds. Iceland's entry into this segment is notable, as it issued its first GSS bond -- a 750 million-euro (S$1.1 billion) green bond -- only in March 2024.</p><p> Entering the GSS bond market in 2022, Canada was the first sovereign issuer to include nuclear-energy expenditures in its March 2024 GSS bond of C$4 billion (S$3.96 billion) after the government updated its Green Bond Framework to include nuclear in its eligible investment areas.</p><p> The EU Taxonomy includes provisions for nuclear, so this could become a recurring GSS bond theme in the months ahead.</p><p> Other debutants to the green bond market include Turkey, which has raised US$2.5 billion, with the transaction more than three times oversubscribed. It was one of the first EM sovereigns to allocate a significant portion of the funds (47 per cent) to environmentally sustainable management of natural resources and land use.</p><p>Brazil debuted in the market with a US$2 billion sustainable bond in November 2023. Its proceeds will be allocated to deforestation control, biodiversity conservation and poverty reduction programmes.</p><p> A vehicle to realise  net-zero goalsSovereign green, social and sustainable bonds can be seen as a robust climate-financing instrument that facilitates collaboration between investors and sovereign governments on environmental aims.</p><p> Investors can showcase the green credentials of their portfolios, while sovereigns can progress towards their net-zero commitments and goals, particularly as two key net-zero milestones in 2030 and 2050 approach.</p><p> Adherence to industry-established guidelines, such as those by the Partnership for Carbon Accounting Financials and International Capital Market Association, can enhance bond efficacy. These frameworks underpin the methodologies for carbon footprint calculations and guide the selection of impact reporting indicators at the project level, ensuring transparency and accountability in the financing of climate action.</p><p> Direct investor engagement with sovereigns can be a powerful tool to catalyse climate action.</p><p> The Collaborative Sovereign Engagement on Climate Change is an initiative led by the Principles for Responsible Investment to assist governments in addressing climate change. </p><p> Its goal is to have investors join forces in encouraging governments to undertake comprehensive measures to combat climate change, adhere to the objectives of the Paris Agreement, and strive to limit the rise in the average global temperature to 1.5 deg C.</p><p> Members of the initiative, including BNPP AM as a founding member, have identified Australia as a sovereign debt issuer that would be a suitable candidate for the initiative's pilot project. The country passed a Climate Change Act in 2022, but has done poorly compared to peers on climate and environmental measures in sovereign risk ratings. If successful, a similar sovereign engagement programme will target other issuers.</p><p> The writer is sustainable fixed-income lead (Emea), BNP Paribas Asset Management</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Moody's projects that green, social and sustainable bond issuance could reach US$950 billion in 2024.

Climate change made its presence felt as temperatures rose 3 deg C or 4 deg C above what they were the last time Paris hosted the Games a century ago. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Table tennis and badminton players had to use ice packs to cool down, soccer teams took mandatory cooling breaks, and cold-water baths and air-conditioned changing rooms brought much-needed relief. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In the sustainably designed athletes' village, organisers decided not to install air-conditioning. But heatwave conditions meant sleep-deprived athletes perspired in their cardboard beds, and teams resorted to buying or renting air-conditioners anyway.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Going forward, it is only going to get worse for the Olympics. </p><p> Rising heat and vanishing snow and ice for the Winter Games will be major challenges, as well as concerns over the price tag for hosting these events. </p><p> Future hosts will also need to ensure the Games will have the lightest of environmental footprints, while leaving huge benefits for local communities long after the party has left town. </p><p> Game planThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) says it is aware of the climate risks and the need for the Games to be as sustainable as possible. </p><p> In October 2023, IOC president Thomas Bach said that by mid-century, only 10 to 12 nations would be able to host the Winter Games. That would mean creating a schedule to rotate the Games among them, reducing cost, particularly by not having to build gigantic new venues. </p><p> And, as part of the effort to do this, in July, the IOC simultaneously awarded the 2030 Winter Games to France (French Alps) and 2034 to the US (Salt Lake City). </p><p> A bigger headache are the Summer Games. The sweltering Tokyo Games of 2021 and, now, Paris show the traditional July to August time slot is only going to become more risky for athletes and fans. </p><p> One option is to shift the Games to later in the year. But this clashes with other big sporting events and broadcasters' programming, which is scheduled years in advance. Still, there are precedents. The 1964 Tokyo Olympics were held in October and the 2000 Games in Sydney were held in September. </p><p> In the coming decades, far fewer cities will be able to host the Summer Games because of heat. A study published in The Lancet journal in 2016 looked at the number of cities in the Northern Hemisphere that were deemed low risk based on predicted wet bulb temperatures of 26 deg C or less.</p><p> Wet bulb temperature measures how heat affects humans, taking into account the effects of humidity, air temperature, wind speed and solar radiation. </p><p> The researchers made the temperature predictions using computer climate models. </p><p> Out of 645 cities -- each with a population of 600,000 or more and deemed able to stage the Olympics -- only 33 were considered low risk and 25 of these were in Western Europe, such as Dublin, London and Oslo. In Asia, only Bishkek and Ulaanbaatar were classed as low risk. </p><p> Busting budgetsNow, who does not like a good party? The Olympics must be dazzling but not bust the budget. At least, that's the hope for Paris, as the mantra from the IOC shifts to financial responsibility and sustainable use of limited resources. </p><p> Under its Olympic Agenda 2020, the goal is to reduce the cost of bidding, allow hosts more flexibility in using already-existing sports facilities, encourage bidders to develop a sustainability strategy, measure and report emissions and figure out ways to cut carbon pollution, as well as increase transparency, such as through third-party auditing. </p><p> The use of existing sites or building temporary ones is a key focus, because in the past some of the eye-watering bills for the Olympics were due in large part to the building of vast stadiums and sports facilities that were rarely, if ever, used again. </p><p> About 95 per cent of the infrastructure being used for the Paris Games is either temporary or already in existence. This cuts emissions linked to new construction sites. And, wherever possible, most of the electricity comes from sustainable sources. </p><p> All up, Paris' emissions footprint, estimated at 1.58 million tonnes, will be about half that of the Games in London in 2012 and Rio in 2016. </p><p> But the final bill for the Paris Games could still be hefty, though less than other recent Games -- US$13.7 billion (S$18.1 billion) for Tokyo and US$23.6 billion for Rio, according to an analysis of the costs of the Summer Games by Oxford University published in May. The authors estimated Paris would cost US$8.7 billion. </p><p> S&amp;P Global Ratings said Paris would come in just under US$10 billion -- about 25 per cent over the initial budget -- still hardly cheap and a reflection of the reality of becoming a host of this massive event. </p><p> It remains a Herculean task. </p><p> But the IOC is keen to point out the larger economic benefits the Games can bring. In a May blog post, the IOC said a study by the University of Limoges in France estimated the Games will generate between EUR6.7 billion (S$9.6 billion) and EUR11.1 billion in net economic benefits in the Paris region from 2018 to 2034. </p><p> But while it can be hard to quantify the full economic benefits, one trend is clear. Since 1960, the average cost of hosting the Games has been triple the bid price, according to the Oxford University study by Dr Alexander Budzier and Professor Bent Flyvbjerg.</p><p> \"The Games remain costly and continue to have large cost overruns, to a degree that threatens their viability,\" they said. \"Cost overruns are the norm for the Games, past, present and future; they are the only project type that never delivered on budget,\" they added. </p><p> Perhaps Los Angeles will do better in 2028 -- the city turned a profit when it hosted the 1984 Games. </p><p> Brisbane will be another test case in 2032. Based on 2023 figures, the Australian federal and Queensland state governments will spend about A$7.1 billion (S$6.1 billion) on the Games, chiefly building or refurbishing sports venues and athlete accommodation. And more than 80 per cent of venues are existing or temporary.</p><p> Brisbane will also be a further test of the IOC's desire to decentralise host venues. </p><p> For instance, the 2032 Games will feature 50 sports hosted in 11 cities, mainly around Brisbane but as far north as Cairns and Melbourne in the south, taking advantage of existing stadiums and other venues. But this strategy also risks more emissions from people travelling long distances (Brisbane to Cairns is 1,700km). </p><p> LegacyOrganisers, though, hope Brisbane will have long-lasting benefits, not just better sports venues, but also better transport infrastructure. The state is spending A$7.9 billion on the Cross River Rail project in Brisbane to improve connections between the central parts of the city and Olympics venues. It is also upgrading roads and rail lines elsewhere in Queensland state. </p><p> The Beijing Olympics in 2008 helped transform the city. The building and running cost of the Games amounted to US$8.3 billion, according to the Oxford researchers. But total spending was about US$40 billion, mainly on better roads, subway lines, a massive greening campaign across Beijing and efforts to clean up the city's air pollution. </p><p> Still, while the long-term benefits can help justify hosting the Games, the costs will be too steep for many. </p><p> Some candidate cities for future Games have withdrawn their bids or scaled down their plans. And the number of bids has been falling from 11 cities wanting to host the 2004 Olympics to four bids for the 2016 Games and two for 2024. Brisbane became the first host city to win the bid unopposed since 1984.</p><p> One solution is to scale back the Games. </p><p> \"These competitions need to be smaller,\" author and sports ecologist Madeleine Orr told Reuters. \"It's not athlete travel that's doing the damage, it's all the fans.\" The IOC said between 2.3 million and 3.1 million unique visitors with Games tickets were expected to descend on Paris during the Games, nearly two-thirds of them French. </p><p> Long-haul flights also have a large carbon footprint. </p><p> Despite the challenges, the Olympics are likely to endure. But, if we do not cut global greenhouse gas emissions fast enough, the Games, especially in the second half of this century, are likely to be smaller and rotated among a smaller pool of host cities. The number of sports events could possibly shrink, too. </p><p> And there will most likely be much greater emphasis on climate adaptation measures, such as acclimatising athletes, better cooling measures and even changing the timing of events such as the marathon. </p><p> The Games in Paris that ended on Aug 11 might be among the last of its type for scale and spectacle. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Spectators cooling down with misters before the men's team archery quarter-finals at the Paris 2024 Olympics on July 29.

I am glad to join you for the 7th Annual Global Research Alliance for Sustainable Finance and Investment conference, or GRASFI, at the Singapore Management University or SMU.</p><p>Fostering Credible Transition, Creating Sustainable Impact<br/><br/>Climate change is a clear and present danger for the world. This is the first time that GRASFI is gathering physically here in Asia. I hope this experience will be valuable to deepen your understanding of Asia. Asia is a big and complex region, with countries at different stages of development, and with a range of economic and social needs and resources.</p><p>On one hand, we emit about half of global emissions. These emissions are expected to grow, driven by economic and development needs, including extending electricity to rural populations.</p><p>On the other hand, Asia is rich in biodiversity, which is affected by climate change, but also offers a promising range of nature-based solutions. Asia is home to around a fifth of the world's rainforests. The waters in South-East Asia, near Singapore, harbour one of the world's most extensive seagrass beds, coral reefs, and mangroves.</p><p>The theme of the conference \"Fostering Credible Transition, Creating Sustainable Impact\" is most apt. With the right policies, strategies, and technologies, we can pursue sustainable growth for the benefit of people and planet.</p><p>While climate change affects all states around the world, for tropical island states like Singapore, it is an existential risk.</p><p>Small island states are the first to experience the impact of climate change.</p><p>Singapore's latest National Climate Change Study projects that mean sea levels in Singapore could rise by up to 2 metres by 2150.</p><p>But climate change will set off other complex changes in the world's ecology, that ultimately impacts all of us, wherever you live.</p><p>These include tipping points in our ice sheets, seawater and forests, which could amplify and accelerate climate change.</p><p>It is critical that we address this existential challenge and avoid the tragedy of the commons. Every one of us has a stake, and everyone must do his or her part. This complex problem with multiple dimensions must be dealt with at multiple levels, with a range of policy instruments, and by mobilising a wide range of stakeholders.</p><p>At the global level, we need to forge a consensus for a sustainable and equitable model of growth.</p><p>International frameworks and agreements are the foundation of this, with the UNFCCC process and the Paris Agreement at the heart of it.</p><p>Singapore is a strong supporter of this multilateral approach, including serving as ministerial facilitators in the negotiations leading up to the Paris Agreement, and more recently on mitigation and carbon credits.</p><p>Global institutions, such as the World Bank and IMF, play important roles in mobilising climate finance. I am glad that the World Bank Group has a presence in Singapore, including an Infrastructure and Urban Hub to serve the region.</p><p>At the country level, we must do our parts to decarbonise our economies, and adapt to the impacts of climate change.</p><p>We can all contribute in our own way, regardless of our size, or our level of development. For instance, even though Singapore emits less than 0.1% of global emissions, we have set ourselves a target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050, and a little earlier for the public sector.</p><p>To achieve this, we launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030 - a roadmap to mobilise our industries and citizens towards sustainable growth.</p><p>When I was the Finance Minister, I introduced a carbon tax as a price signal for carbon emissions. The government has also issued green bonds We have since laid out a schedule of carbon tax levels until 2030.</p><p>The proceeds from our carbon tax will be used to help companies in Singapore decarbonise.</p><p>And under our S$28 billion Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2025 plan, we are supporting R&amp;D into new climate technologies and solutions like sustainable building materials, carbon capture and storage, and alternative fuels like biofuels and hydrogen.</p><p>Do find out more about these projects from GRASFI participants from the National University of Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, and SMU, which have strong science and technology capabilities, and research programmes in several areas of sustainability.</p><p>We trust that these initiatives can enable us to boost resilience here in Singapore, and enable us to serve the region as a pathfinder and testbed for green solutions.</p><p>And at the industry level, companies will need to keep pace with greater consumer preferences for sustainable products, and emerging climate regulations like sustainability reporting and cross-border carbon taxes.</p><p>Companies can either pivot their business models and portfolios to contribute and benefit from new opportunities, or risk being disrupted by others or boycotted by consumers.</p><p>Last week, I presented an award for transformation to Sembcorp Industries, a local energy company which had pivoted from oil and gas to renewable energy. They had also achieved impressive total shareholder returns through this transformation.</p><p>As part of our wider efforts in Singapore to transform our economy - also known as Industry Transformation 2.0 - we have added two new pillars to the existing four pillars, by including sustainability and resilience.</p><p>Sustainable Finance as a Catalyst for a Greener and More Resilient Future<br/><br/>Among the many stakeholders, the financial sector plays a critical role. Significant financing is needed to accomplish these ambitions at the global, country, and industry levels. We must mobilise financial resources and allocate these effectively to meet the diverse needs.</p><p>McKinsey estimates that Asia alone needs more than US$3 trillion annually to achieve net-zero by 2050.</p><p>But public finances in many countries are stressed, especially after the COVID-19 pandemics.</p><p>To meet the needs for investment and capital, we will need to more effectively mobilise some of the estimated US$400 trillion of private capital.</p><p>Sustainable finance - the pursuit of financial returns alongside environmental and social objectives - will be a critical enabler.</p><p>As a global financial centre, Singapore hopes to play our role in advancing sustainable finance, for our region and the world.</p><p>Last year, we launched the Finance for Net Zero Action Plan, which seeks to achieve four strategic outcomes.</p><p>One, to promote consistent, comparable and reliable climate data and disclosures to guide decision making and safeguard against climate risks; Two, to build up a climate resilient financial sector with deep capabilities in risk management practices like climate scenario analysis and stress testing; Three, to support financial institutions in developing credible science-based transition plans; and Four, to promote innovative financing solutions such as blended finance and voluntary carbon markets.</p><p>Many of you here are experts and practitioners in sustainable finance. You have an impressive list of topics and speakers for the coming sessions. Let me take this opportunity to suggest three areas where academics, industry, and government can work together to advance sustainable finance.</p><p>The first area is to develop better definitions and outcome measures of sustainable finance. This reduces the risks of green washing, and helps guide companies and investors in decision-making.</p><p>Taxonomies which define sustainable activities, are the foundation of this.</p><p>I am glad that efforts are underway to align these taxonomies across jurisdictions, including between Singapore, China and the EU. This will facilitate cross-border transactions by financial institutions in these jurisdictions.</p><p>We can also work together to improve how we measure the impact of finance on sustainability.</p><p>For example, the conference paper by Ayako Yasuda and Keer Yang from UC Davis suggests that clearer labelling of sustainable finance products helps investors make better investment decisions.</p><p>Similarly, the Singapore Green Finance Institute (SGFIN) developed a corporate impact pricing model that leverages AI to analyse the impact of environmental performance on stock prices.</p><p>And the Singapore Green Finance Centre is developing an Impact Weighted Account Framework to help companies better assess the sustainability impact of their operations and investments.</p><p>These initiatives help us measure outcomes, and to channel capital into activities that are impactful.</p><p>Second, to shape regulations to facilitate sustainable finance flows, while keeping down regulatory costs to companies.</p><p>For example, we have seen an increase in sustainability disclosure regulations in many jurisdictions, with some countries looking to progressively implement the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) disclosure standards including listed companies in Singapore from FY2025, and large non-listed companies from FY2027.</p><p>By working together, we could better develop reporting frameworks that are simple yet effective.</p><p>I am glad that the conference will examine the impact of regulation, and on ESG ratings and disclosures, over the next few days.</p><p>Good regulations can also catalyse the flow of financing to impactful causes such as energy infrastructure, and deep tech innovations to accelerate decarbonisation.</p><p>For example, in the Handbook on Scaling Up Blended Finance by the Network for Greening the Financial System, regulatory and practical barriers were often cited as obstacles to scaling up blended finance transactions in emerging markets.</p><p>Third, while definitions, outcome measures, and regulations are important, ultimately, any system is operated by people. We must therefore uplift our skills and broaden our talent base.</p><p>As part of Singapore's Sustainable Finance Jobs Transformation Map, we will invest $35 million over the next three years to upskill and reskill our finance professionals.</p><p>This includes expanding the range of sustainable finance training courses for working professionals, undergraduate and polytechnic students.</p><p>I encourage all of us here to develop new teaching modalities to make sustainable finance more accessible. For example, SGFC leveraged SMU's teaching infrastructure to deliver executive courses, and provide a Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) that is open to the public.</p><p>While we do our best with our current state of knowledge, we need to recognise that sustainability, and sustainable finance is a complex and fast-evolving field. So we must continue to push the boundaries of our knowledge, and deepen the capabilities of our industry.</p><p>This will require us to bring together multidisciplinary research and real-life application, and bridge the varied fields of science, technology, economics and finance.</p><p>Academic institutions, including Centres of Excellence like the SGFC and SGFIN, can play an important role by bringing academics and industry together to study important issues such as carbon markets, climate adaptation, transition finance, and nature. Our Centres of Excellence are also crucial in ensuring that the research uncovered can be applied by industry through practice notes and whitepapers, and through training courses across the career spectrum - from undergraduate to executive and C-suite levels.</p><p>Through research networks like GRASFI, we can bring together the best minds around the world, to explore, to learn and to share.</p><p>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me conclude. Climate change is an existential challenge, and one of the most complex challenges facing humankind.</p><p>Every one of us must do his or her part, and make adjustments at the global, country, industry and personal levels.</p><p>Academic researchers and practitioners like yourselves can help guide global efforts for decarbonisation and sustainable growth in an objective and science-based manner.</p><p>We will need to push the frontiers of innovation across different fields -in science and technology to better understand climate science and to develop new solutions; as well as in economics and finance to optimise price signals and fiscal incentives; and in the social sciences to shape norms and nudge behaviours.</p><p>By bringing together experts from all over the world, GRASFI is an important platform to exchange perspectives and learn from each other's experiences.</p><p>I wish you a successful conference, and continued collaborations in this complex and critical work.

At this pace, the year's total could come close to a record US$300 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The surge is no aberration. A rapidly developing policy and regulatory framework now requires countries and companies to do more to protect nature, and plug an estimated biodiversity finance gap of US$700 billion a year.</p><p> For a growing number of investors, meanwhile, biodiversity restoration is seen as a potentially more cost-effective way to tackle global warming and meet net-zero goals.</p><p> Credit ratings agency Fitch said in a recent study that nature-positive portfolios are growing in popularity.</p><p> There is, then, every reason to believe that biodiversity bonds will account for an ever larger share of the US$6.5 trillion ESG bond universe.</p><p> Gaining prominenceSovereigns and supranational institutions have been spearheading the development of biodiversity-related capital. The European Union and the World Bank were among the first to issue such debt.</p><p> They collectively account for around two-thirds of all biodiversity-related ESG debt issuance to date, according to the Institute of International Finance (IIF).</p><p> Corporate borrowers are also entering the fray in response to regulations and reporting standards requiring companies to consider biodiversity protection as part of their net-zero planning.</p><p> Two types of corporate biodiversity bonds have been in the ascendancy.</p><p> The first is the use of proceeds (UOP) bond, which raises money for sustainability projects. </p><p> Issuance of such bonds has grown in the past few years even as other types of ESG debt have flagged amid fears of a lack of transparency. </p><p> Among the most popular UOP nature bonds have been those that fund terrestrial and aquatic biodiversity conservation objectives -- both recognised as an eligible UOP category by the International Capital Market Association.</p><p> These represent some 16 per cent of all new biodiversity bonds issued in 2023, up from 5 per cent in 2020, according to Fitch.</p><p> Among the issuers was Chilean pulp and paper company CMPC -- which issued UOP bonds for sustainable forest and water management, and the restoration of native forests.</p><p>Finnish forestry company Stora Enso issued green bonds with proceeds earmarked for sustainable forest and water management, as well as pollution control, among others.</p><p> The Bank of China recently issued two biodiversity bonds with net proceeds allocated to biodiversity conservation projects as well as environmentally sustainable management of living natural resources and land-use projects.</p><p> The second type of biodiversity bond popular among corporate issuers is the sustainability-linked bond (SLB). The distinguishing feature of SLBs is a change of terms -- such as coupons -- should the issuer fail to meet performance objectives.</p><p>Brazilian pulp and paper company Klabin recently sold an SLB maturing in 2030, with 2025 as the trigger for the pricing of the next interest rate.</p><p> The company's 2030 goals include:</p><p> Hot spotsCorporate biodiversity bonds have been popular among issuers based in emerging markets. They have accounted for nearly two-thirds of all biodiversity-related corporate bond issues. </p><p> Asian-based borrowers are becoming more active in the market, accounting for nearly 20 per cent of all newly issued bonds. That is nearly as much as the combined amount issued by borrowers based in the United States and the eurozone.</p><p> Emerging-market corporate borrowers look likely to make greater use of biodiversity bonds. This is because populations in these countries, which are home to the world's most diverse ecosystems, are more heavily dependent on nature for their well-being and prosperity -- be it through agriculture, fisheries or tourism. </p><p> According to estimates from BloombergNEF, all the top 20 funding priorities for global biodiversity protection are located in emerging markets.</p><p> Emerging countries are also keen to finance nature-based solutions -- considered effective from a cost point of view -- for climate adaptation, as they brace themselves for the effects of global warming.</p><p> Nature risk and premiumGrowing investor demand for biodiversity bonds may also reflect the favourable financial performance of the asset class.</p><p> The IIF noted that the median return of biodiversity fixed income funds stood at just over 10 per cent -- outpacing conventional peers, which it calculated delivered 6.7 per cent last year.</p><p> The analysis chimes with a growing body of academic research that has uncovered the existence of a \"biodiversity risk premium\" in the fixed income market.</p><p> One study, which analysed the credit risk term structures of infrastructure companies, found that companies that manage biodiversity risks had up to 93 basis points better long-term financing conditions.</p><p> The difference was greater over longer lending periods -- the slope showing one to 10 years was steeper than that for one to five years.</p><p> The credit default swap curve, the researchers concluded, indicates that investors perceive those risks as long-term issues in an industry especially vulnerable to a triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution.</p><p> Biodiversity becoming materialBiodiversity has yet to become a mainstream investment in the green bond market, with only some 8 per cent of the total raised in the market directly funding nature protection efforts. </p><p> In comparison, over 50 per cent of funds are for renewable energy infrastructure.</p><p> The use and setting of biodiversity performance targets has significant room to improve as the current framework makes it difficult to quantify and monitor biodiversity gain or loss accurately.</p><p> Bodies such as the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures and the Finance for Biodiversity Foundation are working with scientists to refine data monitoring and collection processes.</p><p> A more standardised biodiversity finance architecture should help investors ramp up their capital commitments for companies with nature restoration projects.</p><p> It could be a matter of time before nature-related bonds follow the same path as climate-related ones to become a standard environmental feature in the global sustainable fixed income market.</p><p> Sabrina Jacobs is senior client portfolio manager, emerging market fixed income, at Pictet Asset Management, where Philipp Buff is senior investment manager, developed market fixed income</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Emerging-market borrowers are more likely to make use of biodiversity bonds because populations in these countries are more dependent on nature for their prosperity.

We will preserve and deepen these strengths as we chart the way forward for Singapore - to look for better solutions; and to take bold steps to pursue new ambitions.</p><p>3. Even as we do so, there are profound shifts in the global landscape.</p><p>4. Let me speak on three of these.</p><p>5. First, climate change.</p><p>a. This is an existential issue for the world - already, we are seeing more extreme storms, floods, wildfires and heat waves, with 2024 set to be the world's hottest year on record. I am afraid, we will set a new record every year henceforth.</p><p>b. To mitigate climate change, we need to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. But global temperatures are already 1.1 degrees Celsius higher and are continuing to rise.</p><p>c. The impact on economies, societies and physical geographies will be profound, unless we can quickly mobilise efforts to turn ideas on adaptation, mitigation and decarbonisation into action and fruition.</p><p>d. Singapore is keenly aware of this.</p><p>i. While we are small and only contribute 0.1% of global emissions, we have committed to do our part, to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve net-zero by 2050.</p><p>ii.We are doubling down on a number of fronts.</p><p>1.We are working with our industries to reduce their primary emissions. This includes the adoption of greener technologies as well as piloting the use of carbon capture and storage solutions.</p><p>2. We are taking steps to transform our energy mix to rely more on greener power. We have recently raised our target for low-carbon energy imports from 4 GW to 6 GW by 2035, and awarded conditional approvals to 9 projects thus far, with 5 of them advancing to conditional licences. We are also investing in nascent low-carbon energy generation pathways, such as ammonia or hydrogen.</p><p>3. We will invest in coastal protection measures to shore up our resilience against the effects of rising sea level.</p><p>iii. But our efforts alone will not be sufficient - climate change affects everyone. We must ensure that Asia, and even the rest of the world, also get to net-zero. We are therefore keen to work with institutions, industries and governments in Asia and around the world to facilitate the carbon transition, in order to avert the worst impacts of climate change.</p><p>6. Second, demographic pressure and public health.</p><p>a. Today, about 10% of the world's population is aged 65 years or older. For some countries such as Japan, South Korea, Germany and the UK, that proportion is already much higher, and set to accelerate even faster.</p><p>b. If not managed well, this could place severe strain not only on workforce growth, but also healthcare systems, pensions and social support systems. But if we do it right, we can enable our seniors to remain active and healthy for longer, contribute to society, and live life to the fullest.</p><p>c. Singapore has therefore developed an Action Plan for Successful Ageing to mobilise nation-wide efforts to turn ideas on active and healthy ageing into fruition, so that we can not only lengthen the lifespan of our seniors, but also their 'health-span'.</p><p>i. Last year, we took a further step and launched our Healthier SG strategy, marking a decisive shift from reactively caring for those who are sick to proactively preventing or delaying individuals from falling ill.</p><p>ii. We aim to anchor each resident with a family doctor, who will work with community partners and healthcare clusters to develop a personalised Health Plan to support their health journey over time, with recommended screenings, vaccinations and social activities.</p><p>iii. This is a multi-year effort that re-defines the relationship between doctors and patients, and that refreshes the partnership between healthcare providers and the government.</p><p>iv. It will require both continuity and commitment, to reap the benefits of Healthier SG to improve population health, reduce disease burden and ensure fiscal sustainability.</p><p>d. It is still early days, but we hope that Healthier SG can serve as a pathfinder and show the way to address population ageing and rising burdens of non-communicable diseases faced by many countries.</p><p>7. Third, disruptive technologies, and in particular AI.</p><p>a. Thanks to faster computing, the proliferation of big data and deep learning, the pace of technological advancements have accelerated.</p><p>b. ChatGPT is a good example of this.</p><p>i. When GPT-2 was released in 2019, it had 1.5 billion parameters.</p><p>ii. Just one year later, GPT-3 was released with 175 billion parameters, and was capable of understanding context, producing more human-like text, generating code, solving problems, and even displaying reasoning abilities.</p><p>iii. Today, GPT-4 has taken the model even further, with not just the ability to engage in language-based tasks but also process both text and images.</p><p>c. These technologies hold both promise and peril.</p><p>i. For economies like Singapore which do not have the benefit of demographic advantage, AI offers the potential to overcome both labour and productivity constraints.</p><p>ii. But at the same time, we recognise that AI has the potential to disrupt jobs and cause anxiety among workers.</p><p>iii.Without proper regulatory guardrails, there will also be fears about model quality and fair use.</p><p>d. This is why Singapore had developed its National AI Strategy and updated it last year, so that we can address risks and concerns from the potential disruptions, abuse and mismanagement of AI, while seizing the potential of AI to unlock the next frontier of economic growth.</p><p>e. We hope that this will also strengthen our value proposition as an active, constructive and reliable contributor to global AI developments, and position Singapore at the forefront of AI.</p><p>8. It is clear that public-private partnerships play a key role in turning impactful ideas into purposeful action. To capitalise on these partnerships, we must ensure that we have the right enablers in place. I will touch on four of these, namely capital; talent; standards; and international collaboration.</p><p>Capital</p><p>9. Capital is not the only pre-requisite for innovation, but it certainly is one of the most critical.</p><p>10. For example, in the area of climate change, it is estimated that Asia will require about US$1.7 trillion dollars in climate and infrastructure investment annually through to 2030. To meet the capital required, we need to catalyse green and transition finance for the region.</p><p>a. Today, there are a number of reasons why there is insufficient capital to fund such projects.</p><p>i. There may not be sufficient capacity and expertise to prepare and develop projects to a stage that is bankable.</p><p>ii. Such projects may also carry a high level of risk, especially in emerging economies with greater uncertainties.</p><p>iii. Some projects may also face long lead times to implement, and in securing the necessary permits.</p><p>b. Recognising this need, Singapore had announced last year that we will set up a new blended finance initiative - the Financing Asia's Transition Partnerships, or FAST-P, with a target size of US$5 billion dollars.</p><p>i. Governments, development finance institutions, and philanthropies could provide concessional capital.</p><p>ii. Multilateral development banks can provide technical assistance.</p><p>iii.These efforts will reduce project risk and improve bankability, and we hope, catalyse multiples of private commercial capital to finance transition and marginally bankable green projects in Asia.</p><p>Talent</p><p>11. Next, we need to develop the right bench strength of talent to drive research and development. Let me illustrate this with biotech, which we believe can help unlock treatment in specific disease areas such as cancer and neurodegenerative disease, as well as in new therapeutic modalities such as nucleic acid therapy, immunotherapy and cell and gene therapy.</p><p>12. One of the key areas we have identified is drug and venture development talent, and we are taking steps to address this.</p><p>a. According to a 2022 report, we expect the talent gap in Singapore for pre-clinical biotech companies to narrow from 110 to 76 in 2032, but the gap for clinical-stage biotech firms will widen from 44 to 123 within the same period.</p><p>b. This is most critical at the management level, who can support business management activities such as fund-raising and business direction. This will require us to nurture people who not only understand the science, but also possess the know how to commercialise, raise funds and expand the business.</p><p>c. The Helix Immersion Programme is a one-year on-the-job training programme that lets biomedical research and academic professionals gain industry-relevant skills. This programme aims to place and train 100 fellows by 2025.</p><p>d. Another programme is the Innovation and Enterprise Fellowship Programme, which aims to grow the pool of talent who can support the commercialisation of deep-tech research and bring nascent technologies to market. To date, we have attracted more than 90 fellows since its launch in 2020.</p><p>e. Through these programmes, we hope to strengthen the talent pipeline in Singapore, so that we not only have a good base of research talent but also the expertise crucial to later stages.</p><p>Standards</p><p>13. Another key enabler is governance and standards. Let me illustrate this with AI.</p><p>a. Even as we push the bounds of innovation, we ought to give citizens, consumers and governments the assurance that these innovations are done in a safe, trustworthy and responsible manner.</p><p>b. This is why we had recently promulgated our Model AI Governance Framework for Generative AI. This Framework aims to ensure a fit-for-purpose regulatory environment, by setting out nine dimensions - including accountability, data, trusted development and deployment, and incident reporting.</p><p>c.With this Framework, we can foster a trusted ecosystem where we can embrace AI with confidence, provide maximal space for innovation, and harness AI for the Public Good.</p><p>International cooperation</p><p>14. And last but not least, we need to reinforce regional and global cooperation.</p><p>a. We need to reinforce the shared responsibility among nations on global issues, such as on climate change, ageing and disruptive technologies that I had spoken about earlier.</p><p>b. We need to establish common goals that each of us can measure against, so that we can not only coordinate our efforts, but also nudge each other to progress.</p><p>c. We also need to evolve frameworks by which countries can work together, and provide certainty to investors and companies to catalyse the flow of capital, talent and other resources across countries.</p><p>d. The Paris Accords, for example:</p><p>i. Has allowed 195 countries to align the goal to limit global warming to well below 2 degrees, with an aspirational target of 1.5 degrees.</p><p>ii. This has formed the basis by which countries commit to Nationally Determined Contributions, their emission reduction plans and climate adaptation strategies.</p><p>iii.It also establishes a system of monitoring, reporting and verifying the actions taken by countries.</p><p>iv.Without the Paris Accords, it will be challenging for countries to pace their decarbonisation efforts, especially given that the cost implications are not trivial.</p><p>15. One specific area of cooperation which Singapore is deeply invested in is trade cooperation.</p><p>a. Geopolitical tensions, particularly between the United States and China, have resulted in a vicious cycle of subsidies, tariffs and export restrictions, to compete for critical minerals and technological advantage in sectors ranging from semiconductors, clean energy and telecoms to electric vehicles, AI and quantum computing.</p><p>b. This has placed tremendous strain on the multilateral trading order. As a small country that is critically reliant on trade and a stable global environment, we are very concerned about how this will impact our ability to continue doing business with the world, and for the world to trade with one another.</p><p>c. I was just in Vientiane for the ASEAN Economic Ministers Meeting. Despite challenges facing the global economy, ASEAN remains a bright spot. We made good progress on a number of key agreements to strengthen regional economic integration within ASEAN and with our key partners.</p><p>i. We are on track to conclude our negotiations on the upgrade of the ASEAN Trade in Goods Agreement (ATIGA), by the first quarter of next year</p><p>1. It will be a high-quality, forward-looking upgrade that will advance ASEAN as an integrated market.</p><p>ii.We have also substantially concluded the negotiations for the upgrade of the ASEAN-China FTA 3.0.</p><p>1. This will further deepen economic cooperation between ASEAN and China, particularly in emerging areas such as digital economy, green economy and supply chain connectivity.</p><p>iii. Through these agreements, we can catalyse the flow of trade and investment within ASEAN and with key economic partners. This will allow us to unlock the potential of ASEAN, which is projected to become the fourth largest economy in the world by 2030.</p><p>d. Over the past couple of years, Singapore has participated in new plurilateral groupings that have emerged, such as the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (or CPTPP) and Indo-Pacific Economic Framework for Prosperity (or IPEF).</p><p>i. These are important platforms for Singapore to enlarge our network of trading partners, evolve new trade cooperation models, and establish connections with new markets.</p><p>e. We have also advocated for a 'variable geometry' approach to cooperation, by setting up open and flexible mechanisms for countries to join whenever they are ready.</p><p>i. The WTO Joint Statement Initiative on Electronic Commerce that we have convened with Australia and Japan is one such initiative.</p><p>ii.Through the JSI, we work with our co-convenors to develop global baseline rules on e-commerce. 91 WTO members are already participating in this initiative, representing more than 90% of global trade, and we continue to welcome other WTO members to join in when they are ready.</p><p>iii. At the same time, we provide capacity building and technical assistance to help more countries to be ready.</p><p>f. In this way, we can continue to strengthen the rules-based order in trade and economic cooperation, and yet open new avenues for more investments and progress in areas such as the green and digital economy.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>16. Let me conclude.</p><p>17. As we confront the transition towards a low-carbon world, address the challenges of an ageing demographic, and leverage the potentials and mitigate risks of disruptive technologies, Singapore stands ready to work with both public and private partners to brainstorm bold ideas for change and experiment with possible solutions.</p><p>18. This includes mobilising the necessary capital, crowding in the right talent, promulgating strong governance and balanced standards, and last but not least, promoting regional and global cooperation.</p><p>19. This way, we can build a more sustainable, inclusive and innovative world for growth, value creation and social uplift.</p><p>20.

Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study, or V3, produced an updated set of climate projections for Singapore and the Southeast Asia region up to the year 2100, and beyond. V3 studied the three different emission pathways of high, medium and low greenhouse gas emissions to explore the range of climate outcomes for Singapore and the Southeast Asian region.<br/><br/>2. These updated climate projections enable the Government to develop and refine our climate adaptation plans to ensure that Singapore remains resilient to the impact of climate change. Agencies involved in the Resilience Working Group include URA, NParks, PUB and NEA, which are tasked to review and update the adaption plans in their respective areas.<br/><br/>3. One example is Singapore's heat resilience efforts. Agencies including URA and NParks adopt a science-based and proactive heat resilience strategy to help Singaporeans cope with rising temperatures. a. First, we are implementing national-level strategies to cool our urban environment, such as by infusing more greenery and scaling up the use of cool materials on buildings. b. Second, we are strengthening the community's resilience to heat. For example, MSE and NEA launched the Heat Stress Advisory last year for the general population. Working with MOH, we advised the more vulnerable segments, such as the elderly and children, to exercise greater caution. MOM and MOE also issue sector-specific guidelines for outdoor workers and students respectively. c. Third, we are deepening our understanding of the science behind how rising temperatures affect Singapore and our residents.<br/><br/>4. We are investigating the impact of heat on specific population segments. We have commissioned studies under the Cooling Singapore 2.0 project to investigate the impact of heat on different segments of the population. NEA has also launched the second grant call under the Climate Impact Science Research Programme for new research proposals in areas such as food security, human health, and sea level rise.<br/><br/>5. MSE will continue to work with other agencies to better understand the effects of climate change on Singapore and our population, and put in place the necessary adaptation and risk mitigation measures. We will ensure that the built environment is resilient and prepared for a range of climate scenarios, and empower the community to take the necessary protective measures.</p><p>[Category: Energy, Regulatory and Legal]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0063614274</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6B8Y-B291-JB5M-W2H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"575\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 6, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"71\"><className>Business &amp;

Congratulations to CDL on the opening of the Singapore Sustainability Academy Annex (SSA Annex) today.<br/><br/>I see many familiar faces here from recent events like Go Green SG and the Youth4Climate challenge.<br/><br/>The growing tempo of events is a good sign that the sustainability movement here, and around the world is picking up momentum. Today's launch is another occasion for us to gather and exchange ideas.<br/><br/>Taking Action to Address Climate Change<br/><br/>Sustainable development, especially tackling climate change, is one of the most pressing challenges facing the world today.<br/><br/>It is encouraging that commendable strides have been made, especially since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015.<br/><br/>Improvements in technology have reduced the production costs of renewable energy significantly.<br/><br/>Various industry sectors, including building owners and real estate developers, are developing plans to decarbonise their sectors.<br/><br/>Many financial institutions and investors have also adopted sustainability targets and Net-Zero transition plans.<br/><br/>There are also many efforts to look at nature-based solutions.<br/><br/>But we need to do more and act faster.<br/><br/>According to the latest IPCC report, the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 43% by 2030, compared to 2019 levels.<br/><br/>This is necessary to keep global temperatures from rising above 1.5 Celsius, and to avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>But global emissions last year continued to rise above 2022 levels.</p><p>So we are moving in the wrong direction, including in Asia, which accounts for about half of global emissions.<br/><br/>Globally and in the region, we are seeing the results of climate change, with extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and storms.<br/><br/>Singapore is very vulnerable to climate change. Temperatures have risen steadily over the past 40 years, and rising sea levels pose existential risks for our island nation.<br/><br/>It is important that we prepare ourselves for climate change early - starting with our goal to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.<br/><br/>We have put in place policies such as a carbon tax and mandatory sustainability reporting. These are not always easy for companies to adopt, and we will need to help our companies adjust.<br/><br/>We have also launched the Singapore Green Plan 2030, as a national roadmap to guide sustainable development.<br/><br/>And just a few days earlier, the National Research Foundation, or NRF, launched the new CREATE Thematic Programme in Decarbonisation to help decarbonise the energy and industry sectors together with international research partners.<br/><br/>These plans and policies aim to help Singapore increase our resilience to climate change, and contribute to global efforts.<br/><br/>We hope to be a pathfinder and testbed for green solutions, and catalyse a sustainability wave in the region and beyond.<br/><br/>Partnerships to Accomplish our Sustainability Agenda<br/><br/>The agenda that I have laid out is ambitious and will require all of us to play our part.<br/><br/>As Sherman spoke earlier, CDL is leading by example to make sustainability an important pillar of your business ethos and strategy.<br/><br/>2030 and 2050 net zero targets guide your operations towards greater sustainability, and you have contributed to shaping industry practices in emerging areas such as sustainability reporting and sustainable finance.<br/><br/>CDL has also played an active role in sustainability education, and I was happy to join your initiatives like the CDL Green Gallery at the Botanic Gardens, and the 7th edition of the Youth4Climate Festival which was held in Bedok earlier this month.<br/><br/>This spirit of active citizenry is reflected in the setting up of the SSA in 2017 as a ground-up initiative and zero-energy facility dedicated to sustainability capacity building and thought leadership.</p><p>I am glad that the SSA has hosted over 1,000 events and 35,000 visitors since its launch. Imagine if every visitor here brought three good ideas, you would have collected over 100,000 ideas. And if only half of those ideas are implemented, you will have at least 50,000 good actions that are taken.<br/><br/>So congratulations to CDL, and I hope that you will inspire more companies to follow suit.<br/><br/>While such individual ground-up efforts are important, we can make even greater progress by forging partnerships with like-minded partners.<br/><br/>The challenges of climate change are multi-faceted - from understanding climate science, to changing the behaviours and preferences of everyone.<br/><br/>To innovate and tackle these challenges, we will need to bring together the multiple perspectives of experts in a wide range of areas including science, technology, business, and social sciences.<br/><br/>The SSA fosters such partnerships by providing a convenient physical space, and curating a calendar of events, to bring these stakeholders together.<br/><br/>Onsite partners like the Sustainable Energy Association of Singapore (SEAS), UN Global Compact Network Singapore (GCNS), World Business Council for Sustainable Development (WBCSD), CDP, GRI and Ocean Geographics add additional expertise to these engagements.<br/><br/>Today, as we inaugurate the new SSA Annex, let me highlight two areas of achievements by the SSA.<br/><br/>First, the SSA has done well to raise public awareness on sustainability and mobilise collective action, by bringing together efforts across the Public, Private and People sectors.<br/><br/>For example, the Second Public Consultation for the Good Samaritan Food Donation Bill was held at the SSA earlier this year, and MP Mr Louis Ng presented his draft bill to reduce food waste for public input.<br/><br/>Similarly, talks and workshops at the SSA have helped demystify topics such as carbon accounting and reporting, the circular economy, biodiversity, decarbonisation and climate adaptation.<br/><br/>So with an expanded SSA Annex, we can expect more of such initiatives from CDL and your partners!<br/><br/>Second, SSA has helped corporates to transform and incorporate sustainability into their business models and practices.<br/><br/>Companies often have a substantial impact on the environment across their industrial processes, supply chains, and product life cycles.<br/><br/>But not all of them have the resources or expertise to understand sustainability issues, especially our SMEs.</p><p>Many companies also struggle to navigate global environmental regulations.<br/><br/>So, while companies should naturally compete in the business field, they will also benefit by working together to pool expertise and share their experiences on challenges that everyone is facing.<br/><br/>This is the spirit behind the Industry Transformation Maps or ITMs - with sustainability being a core pillar across each of the 23 ITMs in ITM 2.0.<br/><br/>We must help our companies and workers build up a strong foundation of sustainability knowledge and skills.<br/><br/>The SSA has contributed to this over the years, by hosting talks and trainings at the SSA to build capacity among our companies on green buildings, nature conservation and the adoption of sustainable energy.<br/><br/>These are conducted with partners like the Singapore Environment Council, SEAS, the Nature Society, the World Green Building Council and the Singapore Green Building Council.<br/><br/>Similarly, under the Enterprise Sustainability Programme, Enterprise Singapore works with partners like GCNS to equip companies with skills like carbon accounting and greenhouse gas management.<br/><br/>Such training courses not only allow companies to tap on expertise from qualified trainers, but also helps them network and learn from each other.<br/><br/>In turn, these new skills position our companies and workers to better seize new opportunities in a carbon-constrained world.<br/><br/>To seize such new opportunities, our focus in Singapore must go beyond training and capacity building, to working with companies to develop, innovate and scale up climate solutions.<br/><br/>These solutions can help us achieve our targets under the Singapore Green Building Masterplan, by bringing down emissions in the buildings and real estate sector, which contribute to some 20% of Singapore's carbon emissions.<br/><br/>The Green Buildings Innovation Cluster Programme, or GBIC, has been an important platform to bring together different stakeholders to innovate and develop such solutions to improve the energy efficiency of our buildings.<br/><br/>These stakeholders include our Autonomous Universities and Research Institutions, building owners such as JTC and CDL, and building solution providers like ST Engineering and Building Systems Diagnostics (BSD).<br/><br/>Under our National Research Foundation RIE 2021-25, we are devoting $28 bil to our R&amp;D efforts. One of the four big domains in our R&amp;D efforts is on Urban Solutions and Sustainability (USS). Under our USS R&amp;D programme, we have a range of interesting research that is ongoing in our universities as well as in the research institutes, including how AI and sustainability could be complementary.<br/><br/>GBIC also supports the Super Low Energy Building Smart Hub, which includes a database of technologies undergoing testing in Singapore.</p><p>I had seen some examples of these low-carbon building materials and energy-efficient designs when I visited NUS's College of Design and Engineering.<br/><br/>So I encourage everyone here to contribute to our innovation ecosystem, and be part of the solution.<br/><br/>Conclusion<br/><br/>Let me conclude.<br/><br/>We need to take urgent action to reduce global emissions, and avoid the worst impacts of climate change.<br/><br/>We must all do our part, and work together to pool our resources and expertise, and support each other to achieve our sustainability objectives.<br/><br/>So as we inaugurate this new Annex, let us use this space to:<br/><br/>i. push the boundaries of sustainability thinking;<br/><br/>ii. work together to mobilise collective action;<br/><br/>iii. help our companies transform and embrace sustainability; and<br/><br/>iv. develop innovative solutions that can be scaled to serve the region and beyond.<br/><br/>Congratulations to Sherman and the CDL team on the launch of the Annex!
