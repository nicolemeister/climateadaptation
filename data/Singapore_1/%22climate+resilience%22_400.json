Stagflationary risks rise: Given the scale of the proposed US import tariffs, a full-scale implementation along with retaliation by foreign countries would represent a growth shock that could spark a global recession. However, our base case is for bilateral negotiations between the US and affected countries on tariff and non-tariff matters to persist for several months through 2025. </p><p> Despite the 90-day reprieve announced last week by Trump, we expect tough negotiations to delay or roll back parts of the US reciprocal tariffs while its 10 per cent tariffs remain. </p><p> Concurrently, inflationary risks have risen as US tariffs push up import costs. </p><p> The net effect of slower growth and higher inflation lead us to expect two quarters of stagflation, rather than the worst-case scenario of a recession. </p><p> We lowered US gross domestic product growth forecasts from 2.2 per cent to 1.5 per cent, reflecting the drag from the tariff shock. Tariff-related policy uncertainties are weighing on business confidence and consumer sentiment, already reflected in recent soft economic data. </p><p> 2. Central banks' dilemma: On Apr 4, US Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell warned of US inflationary risks with tariff uncertainties and the need for greater clarity before considering interest rate shifts. </p><p> We expect the Fed to hold the fed funds rate steady at 4.25 to 4.5 per cent, before deciding between higher rates to curb inflation or rate cuts to avert a potential recession. </p><p> In response to weaker growth, we expect the European Central Bank to keep cutting interest rates from 2.5 per cent to 1.75 per cent over its next three meetings. The Bank of England may also make three quarterly rate cuts from 4.5 per cent to 3.75 per cent this year. Despite weaker growth and lower rates, the euro and the pound will strengthen against the greenback as global investors seek diversifiers from the US dollar on the back of US policy uncertainties.</p><p> Asia beyond the fogBased on Chinese data, exports to the US were worth about US$525 billion in 2024.</p><p> This implies that the 145 per cent tariff applied for a full year on China's exports would result in an effective tax rise to US consumers of more than 2 per cent of US GDP alone. </p><p> We believe this potential contractionary impact on US growth, combined with a sell-off of US assets, will prompt a US-China deal to avert an unsustainable market situation. </p><p> Export-oriented Asia is caught in the crosshairs of the US-China contest for economic hegemony. The US plans to levy reciprocal tariff rates on major Asian markets -- China at 34 per cent; India at 26 per cent; Taiwan at 32 per cent; and South Korea at 25 per cent, subject to further negotiations. </p><p> Asean markets (including Vietnam, Thailand and Malaysia), often seen as prime candidates for the China+1 strategy, will contend with potential tariff rates of 24 to 46 per cent. </p><p> Our overall overweight call on Asian equities, is tilted in favour of Hong Kong, China, Singapore and the Philippines. </p><p> In equities, we focus on opportunities in domestic-oriented Asian sectors and companies (such as Chinese Internet platform companies, Asean utilities and telcos); quality yield stocks; policy beneficiaries; and businesses with well-diversified intra-Asia supply chains and flexible distribution nodes. </p><p> These companies will be relatively buffered from the shifting sands of global tariff and non-tariff trade barriers. However, the second order impact of economic slowdown and inflation will still hurt overall business growth.</p><p> In fixed income, sectors such as financials, utilities and telecoms could be more defensive and see smaller spread widening on a relative basis. </p><p> We prefer quality credits with strong fundamentals such as issuers with a diversified business profile, stable cash flows and strong liquidity buffer, and sectors which are more defensive or systemically important that stand to benefit from government support.</p><p> Long-term investors' playbook amid uncertaintyWhen the only certainty is uncertainty, stick to the process. To avoid crystal-ball gazing and getting whipsawed by short-term swings, we believe in the core principles of prioritising a long-term investment horizon and investment discipline of building diversified risk-aware portfolios.</p><p> The investment playbook for many investors that hinges on US exceptionalism -- across US equities, global technology sector and a strong US dollar -- now faces mounting challenges. Yet, in the midst of volatile markets, one's starting position is critical in determining next steps.</p><p> For investors who have sat on the sidelines with cash, the current dislocation in markets has created opportunities for those with patient capital to access businesses with wide moats at attractive valuations. </p><p> Focus on exposure to longer-term structural themes and super trends such as the changing world order, intelligence economy building on artificial intelligence, climate resilience and changing demographics.</p><p> For active investors, this is an opportunity to revisit asset allocation principles and actively rebalance portfolios to address potential risks and adjust expected return profiles. </p><p> Diversification is key, across asset classes, regions, currencies and investment styles, combined with strategic use of gold, alternatives and derivatives (where appropriate).</p><p> In equities, we prefer value and quality stocks with pricing power and limited exposure to tariffs. In fixed income, we upgraded our positions in US Treasuries and developed markets' investment-grade bonds from underweight to neutral to reflect rising recession risks. We downgraded emerging markets fixed income as credit spreads have not sufficiently priced in growth headwinds.</p><p> For leveraged investors, it is important to actively manage risk and maintain adequate liquidity buffers to weather the market volatility. </p><p> With severe price swings, margin calls may force investors to liquidate positions at drastically unfavourable levels, only to be caught out in violent rebounds. Create liquidity buffers to avoid having to realise mark-to-market losses on unfavourable terms.</p><p> Safe-haven assets will stay in demand until the trade impasse is resolved. </p><p> The long-term outlook for US Treasuries remains challenging as inflation rises and the US fiscal deficit worsens further. Gold will continue to shine as an effective hedge amid tariff uncertainties and concerns over US long-term fiscal sustainability that weigh on the US dollar. </p><p> For investors narrowly focused on selected public markets, the risks of over-valuation and over-concentration may rise on unpredictable growth dynamics. Adding alternative asset classes (such as private equity, private credit, hedge funds, and infrastructure and real estate) can offer differentiated return streams, lower correlation to public markets and provide downside protection in certain instances.</p><p> The writer is global chief investment officer, Bank of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Export-oriented Asia is caught in the crosshairs of the US-China contest for economic hegemony.

The paper, part of a three-year collaboration between the two parties, was launched on Feb 11, ahead of the space organisation's Global Space Technology Convention &amp; Exhibition to be held from Wednesday (Feb 26) to Thursday at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Value-addBy 2030, the value-add of such Earth observation data to the South-east Asian economy is estimated to triple to US$45 billion per year, from US$15 billion today.</p><p> Applications include flood monitoring, deforestation tracking, urban planning and sustainable agriculture -- and the region's tropical forests, coastlines and densely populated urban areas make it an ideal hub for such innovation, said the study. Identified as the biggest winners are the agricultural industry and the mining, oil and gas sector. In turn, countries with large primary industries are set to derive the most benefit.</p><p>Indonesia is expected to reap the largest share -- about half of these economic gains -- among its regional peers on account of its extensive agricultural and natural resource sectors, noted the paper.</p><p> The archipelagic country has a lengthy space legacy: In 1963, it became the first South-east Asian country to establish a space agency; it was also the region's first to operate a satellite exclusively for domestic use, noted the report.</p><p> It highlighted that Indonesia's broader space ecosystem is underpinned by the government's supportive regulatory framework and openness to foreign investment. </p><p> Specifically, Earth observation data could be used in South-east Asia's largest economy to support mining operations, improve crop yield, detect illegal fishing, spot algal blooms, and optimise route efficiency for its logistics and transportation sectors. </p><p>Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand will also see substantial benefits, though the gains are expected to be more uniformly distributed among them.</p><p> In rapidly urbanising Vietnam, space technology can help identify trends in population size and density or congestion hotspots. The data can also be used in the aviation industry to predict weather conditions, detect drones and future-proof airports. Disaster-prone Philippines has used Earth observation extensively for emergency management, climate resilience, food security and to bridge the digital divide, the paper also noted. </p><p> Satellite imagery can help Malaysia in detecting oil spills and methane leaks in the oil and gas industry, which is a major pillar of the country's economic strategy, noted the report. It can also be used in the real-estate sector to monitor construction progress off-site.</p><p> Tourism-reliant Thailand can leverage satellite-derived data to monitor its coral reefs and enhance marine conservation efforts. The kingdom can also track fossil-fuel emissions and identify optimal sites for solar and wind farms to meet its renewable energy goals.</p><p>Singapore can gainEven Singapore stands to gain significant benefits, despite its small landmass and lower level of primary industry, the study said. The city-state is expected to reap indirect value through capital investment, by being a solutions provider to firms around the region and as the tech hub of multinationals headquartered there.</p><p> Notably, Earth observation data has been used in Singapore's sustainable finance scene in the carbon market, for example, to ensure carbon credits are verified with transparent environmental benchmarks, said the report. </p><p> \"By focusing its efforts on launching small satellites, investing in advanced space technology research and development, and fostering private sector innovation, the city-state is carving out a niche on the global stage,\" it added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-7JGFB54</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F6J-B8J3-RRJ8-H3HV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"672\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The site, spanning 23,709 sq ft, has an indicative price of $36 million, according to an April 22 press release by marketing agency Colliers International. The price works out to $1,518 psf on the land area.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A single-storey detached house currently sits on the site, which has a gross plot ratio of 1.4 under the URA Master Plan 2019. Colliers adds that the plot's size, combined with its regular shape, makes it ideal for redevelopment. \"With its substantial land area, efficient configuration, and exceptional connectivity, this site offers unparalleled potential for creating high-quality residential developments,\" says Tan Boon Leong, executive director and co-head of investment services at Colliers Singapore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The site is a five-minute walk from Kovan MRT Station (North-East Line) and is less than 400m from Heartland Mall and Kovan Hougang Market and Food Centre.</p><p>The EOI exercise for the site will close on May 28 at 5pm.</p><p>Knight Frank cuts 2025 factory rental growth forecast on 'stormy weather ahead' for industrial sector</p><p>Knight Frank has reduced its Singapore factory rental growth forecast for 2025 to between 0% and 2%, down from the 1% to 3% range predicted previously. The lower forecast comes amid \"stormy weather ahead\" for the industrial sector, the firm says in an April research report.</p><p>\"The current spate of tariff announcements and changes in the days ahead have created and continue to create heightened uncertainty that compel industrial players to adopt a cautious posture, impacting relocations and expansions,\" observes Calvin Yeo, head of occupier strategy and solutions at Knight Frank Singapore.</p><p>Escalating tensions between the US and China, marked by tariffs and retaliatory tariffs, are slowing global trade flows, which Knight Frank expects to detrimentally impact Singapore's manufacturing, electronics and logistics sectors. Already, Singapore's 2025 GDP forecast has been downgraded, with the Ministry of Trade and Industry lowering its estimate earlier this month to between 0% and 2%, down from 1% to 3%.</p><p>In the industrial real estate market, Knight Frank predicts the immediate impact of the trade war will be a decline in transaction volume as buyers and occupiers move into a state of pause. \"Ongoing transactions could be put on hold as affected parties turn cautious and wait for more of the situation to unfold,\" the report reads.</p><p>This is expected to put a further drag on industrial property sales activity, which has already shown a decline since the last quarter of 2024. Data compiled by Knight Frank indicate that total industrial sales value fell by 33.9% q-o-q to $680.9 million in 1Q2025. Leasing activity also declined, falling 0.4% q-o-q to 3,008 rental transactions. The transactions amounted to $25.6 million in value, 1.1% lower q-o-q.</p><p>Despite the ongoing market turmoil, Knight Frank says bright spots remain for Singapore, given its position as an attractive and trusted investment and business hub. \"As US President Trump's recent announcement of the 10% tariff imposed on Singapore goods imported in the US appears to be the international baseline floor (at the moment), manufacturers might also consider expanding or moving last-stage production activities to Singapore,\" the report adds.</p><p>In addition, Singapore's construction sector is poised to grow due to large projects, including Changi Airport Terminal 5 and the expansion of Marina Bay Sands. This, in turn, would translate to more demand for purpose-built dormitories, with companies also increasingly seeking to convert factory space into dormitories, Knight Frank says.</p><p>The report also highlights JTC's recent enhancements to the industrial land lease framework. Announced in March, the enhancements include offering an additional three years of lease tenure for all new greenfield industrial developments to cover the building and development period, and a new scheme to allow eligible lessees on 20-year JTC leases to extend them by up to two tranches of five years.</p><p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield expands leadership team for project and development services in Singapore and Southeast Asia</p><p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield has announced a senior promotion and three new leadership appointments within its project and development services (PDS) business across Singapore and Southeast Asia.</p><p>According to an April 22 release, the appointments follow the company's focus on strengthening its leadership team and expanding its platform to support continued growth in the region.</p><p>In Singapore, Meriana Liao has been promoted to director of PDS. In her new role, Liao will lead a team of client services managers and develop sales strategy. She will also identify opportunities to support the company's occupier services across the project management, cost management, and design and build sectors. Liao has been with Cushman &amp; Wakefield since 2021, when she joined as an associate director of PDS.</p><p>Cushman &amp; Wakefield also announced the appointment of Gina Peng as a director of PDS in Singapore. Peng joined the company last September. She has over 20 years of experience in project management, design and build, and construction management. Her prior experience includes senior roles at JLL and CBRE, where she managed high-profile projects valued up to $650 million.</p><p>In Malaysia, Adrian Choong has been appointed head of PDS. Before joining Cushman &amp; Wakefield in March, Choong led the principal contracting division at CBRE Malaysia as head of projects.</p><p>In the Philippines, Cedric Baba has been appointed head of PDS, with effect from April. A licensed architect based in Manila, Baba has over 12 years of experience in design and construction across various sectors. Before Cushman &amp; Wakefield, Baba has served as head of projects at CBRE Philippines and as a design and project manager at Portuguese Realty.</p><p>City Square Mall taps into 'retailtainment' and sustainability to draw shoppers</p><p>City Square Mall, City Development's (CDL) 11-storey shopping centre on Kitchener Road, opened in 2009. Some 16 years later, the mall is set to complete its $50 million asset enhancement initiative (AEI). The AEI, which commenced in 2023, adds about 26,000 sq ft of gross floor area to the mall.</p><p>The mall's makeover leans into \"retailtainment\" - fusing retail with entertainment and other immersive features to provide customers an engaging and interactive experience.</p><p>A key highlight is Gastro Square, a new 24,000 sq ft dining destination on level four, featuring new F&amp;B outlets, including Kok Sen Restaurant, Ippudo and Nong Geng Ji Hunan Home-Style Cuisine. Gastro Square also has a dedicated community space where programmes, workshops and community events will be held.</p><p>As part of the revamp, interactive play zones have been installed across levels two, three and four with panels that can be spun and aligned to discover stories and facts behind City Square Mall's history. At the Discovery Square on level five, shoppers have access to an interactive sequin wall where they can swipe and draw to create patterns or write messages.</p><p>Sustainability is also a major factor in the mall's new features. At City Green, the mall's urban park, a decommissioned SMRT train cabin has been repurposed into a solar-powered climate education platform.</p><p>There is also the CDL MicroForest, a 2,800 sq ft regenerative tropical microforest designed to mitigate urban heat and enhance climate resilience. The forest was developed in collaboration with the National University of Singapore, with input from the National Parks Board.</p><p>Singapore's real estate market remains 'resilient' despite 7.3% q-o-q drop in investment deals in 1Q2025: Colliers</p><p>The Singapore real estate capital market has remained \"resilient\" in 1Q2025 despite a dip in investment volume, according to Colliers. Data compiled by the firm in an April research report shows that Singapore real estate investment volume fell 7.3% q-o-q to $6.5 billion last quarter.</p><p>Still, a significant jump in residential investment sales, driven by Government Land Sale (GLS) tenders, helped to support volume, says Colliers. GLS deals totalled $2.8 billion, or approximately 42.9% of total investments, last quarter, boosting residential investments by 68.3% q-o-q to $3.9 billion. Without the GLS transactions, 1Q2025 investment volume would have plummeted 35.7% q-o-q, Colliers observes.</p><p>On a y-o-y basis, investments in 1Q2025 were up 60.1%. Excluding the GLS deals, investment volume grew 36.4% y-o-y.</p><p>The commercial sector saw $1.4 billion investments in 1Q2025, surging 73.9% q-o-q, predominantly driven by the acquisition of the remaining 50% stake in Northpoint City (South Wing) for $1.1 billion by Frasers Centrepoint Trust.</p><p>On the other hand, industrial investments plummeted 90.5% q-o-q to $0.2 billion. Colliers notes that the weaker performance follows a high base registered in 4Q2024 when a 49% stake in two data centres was sold to Keppel DC REIT for around $1.4 billion.</p><p>The hospitality sector also saw lower investments last quarter, falling 41.9% to $153 million. On the flipside, investment volume got a boost from the sale of a worker housing portfolio by Blackstone to Bain Capital for $750 million.</p><p>Looking ahead, Tan Boon Leong, executive director and co-head of investment services at Colliers Singapore, expects Singapore to remain \"well-positioned as a safe haven for capital\", despite growing global economic uncertainty amid trade wars and volatile policy shifts. For the whole of 2025, Colliers is estimating investment sales to total between $29 billion and $32 billion, representing a 10% to 20% growth compared to last year.</p><p>That said, investors will need to adapt to tighter yield spreads, subdued occupier demand and global volatility through creative, active asset management strategies, Colliers says.</p><p>The report notes a shift among investors towards income-driven strategies, with buyers targeting older, under-managed assets with potential for repositioning and rent optimisation.</p><p>\"Selective investment opportunities - particularly in redevelopment, value-add plays, and alternative assets - have risen in appeal due to their structural tailwinds, favourable market fundamentals as well as a means of diversification,\" says Catherine He, head of research at Colliers Singapore. - Compiled by Ashley Lo and Atiqah Mokhtar</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FP1-P6V3-RX66-84G6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1744\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Edge Publishing PTE.

By 2030, increased adoption of Earth observation data from satellites and sensors is projected to contribute a cumulative US$100 billion to the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s gross domestic product, noted a recent report by non-profit Singapore Space &amp; Technology and professional-services firm Deloitte. The paper, part of a three-year collaboration between the two parties, was launched on Feb 11, ahead of the space organisation\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Global Space Technology Convention &amp; Exhibition to be held from Wednesday (Feb 26) to Thursday at the Sands Expo and Convention Centre.By 2030, the value-add of such Earth observation data to the South-east Asian economy is estimated to triple to US$45 billion per year, from US$15 billion today.Applications include flood monitoring, deforestation tracking, urban planning and sustainable agriculture \u00e2\u20ac\u201c and the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s tropical forests, coastlines and densely populated urban areas make it an ideal hub for such innovation, said the study. freecropIdentified as the biggest winners are the agricultural industry and the mining, oil and gas sector. </p><p>In turn, countries with large primary industries are set to derive the most benefit. Space raceIndonesia is expected to reap the largest share \u00e2\u20ac\u201c about half of these economic gains \u00e2\u20ac\u201c among its regional peers on account of its extensive agricultural and natural resource sectors, noted the paper.The archipelagic country has a lengthy space legacy: In 1963, it became the first South-east Asian country to establish a space agency; it was also the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s first to operate a satellite exclusively for domestic use, noted the report.It highlighted that Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s broader space ecosystem is underpinned by the government\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s supportive regulatory framework and openness to foreign investment. Specifically, Earth observation data could be used in South-east Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s largest economy to support mining operations, improve crop yield, detect illegal fishing, spot algal blooms, and optimise route efficiency for its logistics and transportation sectors. Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Thailand will also see substantial benefits, though the gains are expected to be more uniformly distributed among them.In rapidly urbanising Vietnam, space technology can help identify trends in population size and density or congestion hotspots. The data can also be used in the aviation industry to predict weather conditions, detect drones and future-proof airports. Disaster-prone Philippines has used Earth observation extensively for emergency management, climate resilience, food security and to bridge the digital divide, the paper also noted. Satellite imagery can help Malaysia in detecting oil spills and methane leaks in the oil and gas industry, which is a major pillar of the country\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s economic strategy, noted the report. It can also be used in the real-estate sector to monitor construction progress off-site.Tourism-reliant Thailand can leverage satellite-derived data to monitor its coral reefs and enhance marine conservation efforts. The kingdom can also track fossil-fuel emissions and identify optimal sites for solar and wind farms to meet its renewable energy goals.Even Singapore stands to gain significant benefits, despite its small landmass and lower level of primary industry, the study said. The city-state is expected to reap indirect value through capital investment, by being a solutions provider to firms around the region and as the tech hub of multinationals headquartered there.Notably, Earth observation data has been used in Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s sustainable finance scene in the carbon market, for example, to ensure carbon credits are verified with transparent environmental benchmarks, said the report.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153By focusing its efforts on launching small satellites, investing in advanced space technology research and development, and fostering private sector innovation, the city-state is carving out a niche on the global stage,\u00e2\u20ac it added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The TeLEOS-1 system is the first Singapore-made commercial Earth observation satellite.

Stricter regulatory oversight and independent ESG audits are essential to address this issue.</p><p>Capital accessibility: Emerging markets, particularly in South and Southeast Asia, often struggle to attract sufficient green finance due to perceived risks. Blended finance models, combining public and private funding, can help bridge this gap.</p><p>Policy fragmentation: Inconsistent regulations across countries complicate cross-border investments. Aligning standards, particularly within regions like ASEAN, remains a critical challenge.</p><p>How corporations are adopting sustainable practices</p><p>Asian corporations are increasingly embedding sustainability into their strategies. From decarbonising supply chains to adopting circular economy principles, businesses are recognising the financial and reputational benefits of sustainable practices. Leaders like Toyota have embraced hydrogen fuel technologies, while companies like Alibaba are investing in green logistics.</p><p>The future of ESG investing: What to expect</p><p>The future of ESG investing will be defined by increased standardisation, enhanced technology integration, and a broader focus on social equity. Investors can expect:</p><p>Global ESG standards: Improved consistency in reporting metrics, enabling better comparisons across regions.</p><p>AI-powered insights: Real-time ESG analytics driven by artificial intelligence.</p><p>Greater social impact: A shift toward addressing inequality and inclusion alongside environmental goals.</p><p>Building a sustainable financial ecosystem for tomorrow</p><p>Green finance in 2025 offers a transformative opportunity to align capital with global sustainability goals. To build a sustainable financial ecosystem, stakeholders must prioritise collaboration, innovation, and inclusivity.</p><p>Policy support: Governments should provide clear, consistent policies to encourage investment in green projects.</p><p>Private sector leadership: Corporations must lead by example, embedding sustainability into their core strategies.</p><p>Community engagement: Inclusive financing models that address local needs will ensure broad-based benefits.</p><p>The financial ecosystem of tomorrow depends on today's collective commitment to sustainability. By leveraging green finance effectively, we can create a future where economic growth goes hand-in-hand with environmental preservation.</p><p>-</p><p>Editor's note:e27aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.

They include excursions, workshops and games, interactive tours, green dining and musical performances. </p><p> Members of the public take part in a puzzle hunt around Marina Bay, or visit the Marine Aquaculture Centre on St John's Island. More details can be found at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.gogreen.gov.sg\">https://www.gogreen.gov.sg</url>/</p><p> The number of activities is more than double that in 2022, when Go Green SG was known as Climate Action Week. The duration of the event has also been extended by three weeks.</p><p> Partners in the national movement, organised by the Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment (MSE), include DBS, City Developments Limited, Mandai Wildlife Group and the Singapore Tourism Board (STB). </p><p> On the collaboration among the private and public sectors, Minister for Sustainability and the Environment Grace Fu said: \"We hope that this will be a start to many more partnerships to bring this awareness... (and) actions down to all segments of the community.\" </p><p> Minister of State for Education and Manpower Gan Siow Huang, and Senior Parliamentary Secretary for Transport, Sustainability and the Environment Baey Yam Keng, were also present at the event. </p><p> Some partners set up interactive booths at Mee Toh School, which hosted the launch after having won the President's Award for the Environment in 2019. It is also a pilot school for the Ministry of Education's Eco Stewardship Programme. </p><p> The booths featured hands-on activities to teach visitors more about Singapore's rich biodiversity and sustainability efforts.</p><p> Meanwhile, STB is collaborating for the first time with MSE on sustainability-related activities, including interactive tours and attractions, education workshops, dining experiences and green retail. The move comes as sustainability becomes a top priority for eco-conscious tourists, said STB director of special projects Aileen Wong. </p><p> She added that Go Green SG offered an opportunity to test the sustainability activities and evaluate whether to continue with them after July.</p><p> With Singapore already experiencing higher temperatures, DPM Wong said the Republic alone cannot solve the climate challenge. It is working closely across various international platforms and with like-minded countries while cutting down heat-inducing greenhouse gas emissions within Singapore. </p><p> \"Building a greener Singapore is a key priority for me and my team. As many of you know, we are currently undertaking the Forward Singapore exercise to review our policies comprehensively, and to refresh our social compact,\" said Mr Wong, who is also Finance Minister.</p><p> He hoped that Go Green SG will inspire many Singaporeans to take meaningful action to green the economy and society. </p><p> Under the Forward Singapore exercise launched by Mr Wong in June 2022, conversations with Singaporeans have been taking place on the challenges and trade-offs that the country has to balance for environmental sustainability and in the transition to a green economy. </p><p> Topics ranged from circularity, food resilience, coastal and flood resilience and Singapore's net-zero emission goal. More than 2,200 Singaporeans have participated in some 30 public engagement sessions. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Deputy Prime Minister Lawrence Wong (centre) with students at the DBS Sustainability Sparks booth at Mee Toh School.

A very good morning. It is my pleasure to welcome you today to the FAST Conference 2025.First, please let me acknowledge our partners for the FAST conference, Mr Cheng Wai Keung, Deputy Chairman of Temasek and Ms Susan Chan, Head of Asia Pacific of BlackRock.</p><p>2. We are facing a more uncertain path ahead for climate action than at any time in the last five years:</p><p>* There is greater uncertainty in global commitments to timely transition.</p><p>*Global private sector coalitions for climate action are also seeing a pullback. Many financial institutions have withdrawn from net zero alliances, and these alliances themselves have revised their objectives.</p><p>Global corporate investment more generally may also turn more cautious amid heightened trade and economic uncertainty.</p><p>3. On the positive side:</p><p>*COP29 saw broad agreement to enhance cooperation in such areas as carbon markets and climate adaptation, as well as new goals to channel financing to developing countries;</p><p>*Many countries have submitted their 2035 NDCs, reaffirming a steady pathway towards their net zero goals; and</p><p>*Many major financial institutions have affirmed continued commitment to their net zero targets.</p><p>4. We are meeting at a critical time. It is now even more important to bring together leaders across policy, finance and the real economy, to advance concrete approaches and solutions that will maintain the course for climate action and the region's transition to a climate-resilient and nature-positive future.</p><p>Enabling the Energy Transition in Asia</p><p>5. In Asia, enabling energy transition will be key to transitioning our economies.</p><p>Asia's demand for electricity is projected to rise at an annual rate of 4% until 2035[1], driven by end-use sectors such as transport, industry and buildings.</p><p>6. While energy demand is still growing, the good news is that in parts of Asia, renewable energy already makes up a significant share of the energy mix, supported by falling costs.</p><p>* Wind and solar generation capacity in China has already exceeded fossil fuel-based thermal power capacity for the first time in March this year.</p><p>*Countries such as the Philippines, Thailand and Cambodia are also seeing lower renewable energy costs than that of coal-generated energy.[2]</p><p>7. There is an opportunity to drive the deployment of renewable energy and develop the infrastructure and solutions to support growth in Asian economies in a sustainable and resilient manner.</p><p>*The IEA expects renewable energy to supply more than half of Asia's increased electricity demand.[3]</p><p>*The increase in demand for electricity will catalyse a corresponding demand for supporting infrastructure and solutions. Earlier this year, ASEAN foreign ministers reaffirmed the commitment to operationalise the ASEAN Power Grid (APG) by 2045.</p><p>*Almost S$1.1 trillion in financing is estimated to be needed over the next decade to ramp up renewable energy capacity, upgrade existing power grid infrastructure, and invest in battery storage systems.[4]</p><p>8. Singapore hopes to do more to catalyse the scaling up of renewables power generation and their enabling infrastructure in Asia.</p><p>*Over the years, Singapore has supported partners across the entire infrastructure value chain, serving as the regional base to many international infrastructure development companies, project finance teams of global financial institutions, as well as multilateral development banks such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank.</p><p>9. We have also put in place key initiatives to enable the financing of Asia's energy transition.</p><p>10. First, we have provided clear and credible definitions through the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy (SAT) on what are green and transition activities, including activities within the Energy Sector.</p><p>*Specifically, for electricity generation using renewables such as solar PV and wind, the SAT sets out thresholds and criteria for classifying such activities as \"green\" or \"transition\".</p><p>*There has been good adoption amongst financial institutions and corporates of the SAT since its launch. Financial products have been developed based on the SAT's classifications, portfolios have been aligned with the SAT's criteria and corporate sustainability strategies have been formulated with reference to the SAT.</p><p>11. We are also bringing partners together through blended finance platforms to co-create solutions for the region, de-risk investments, and catalyse the flow of private capital, for energy transition projects.</p><p>*We launched the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) in end-2023 to raise up to US$5 billion to support Asia's decarbonisation and climate resilience.</p><p>*Within the FAST-P platform, the Green Investment Partnership (GIP), managed by Pentagreen Capital, will be ready to commence deployment in the coming months. They will mobilise capital for marginally bankable clean energy infrastructure in Asia.</p><p>*I am also glad to share that a FAST-P office, with a dedicated management team, will soon be set up to facilitate the deployment of up to US$500 million of concessional capital from the Singapore Government into the three FAST-P partnerships, alongside capital from other partners. The office will continue to work closely with asset managers, banks, and commercial and concessional investors, to promote innovative blended finance solutions for sustainable infrastructure in the region.</p><p>12. These are important milestones, but we recognise that an ecosystem approach - regulators, businesses, and financial institutions coming together - will continue to be needed to overcome these challenges. MAS will continue to work closely with the industry to develop solutions to support the region's energy transition.</p><p>Developing High Integrity Carbon Markets</p><p>13. A second area of focus for Singapore is the development of high integrity carbon markets.There are situations where the economic case for climate projects may not be well-established, making it difficult to crowd in investors and capital. High-integrity and well-functioning carbon markets can play an important role, to strengthen the economic case for decarbonisation and channel much needed capital towards worthwhile projects.</p><p>14. There have been headwinds in the last few years, but recent developments such as the finalisation of Article 6 rules at COP29, and the growing industry acceptance of meta-standards such as the ICVCM's[5] Core Carbon Principles, are helping to build confidence in carbon markets.</p><p>15. Shaping a well-functioning global carbon market will require progress in the areas of (i) supply of high-integrity credits; (ii) strong demand for credits; and (iii) robust market infrastructure and capabilities. At the GenZero Climate Summit Insights earlier this week, 2nd Minister for Trade and Industry Dr Tan See Leng spoke about the work the Singapore Government is undertaking to address these gaps, including through developing common standards, crowding in financing, and building capabilities.</p><p>16. The Transition Credits Coalition convened by the MAS is also an important initiative that seeks to address some of these gaps in the carbon markets.</p><p>*In its interim report launched at COP29 last year, TRACTION outlined common key high-integrity attributes across various methodologies and frameworks for the early retirement of coal and its replacement with clean energy. It also identified the transaction risks and possible risk mitigation solutions, and motivations of different buyer profiles.</p><p>17. Building on these findings, TRACTION has identified the market and technical conditions where transition credits have the greatest potential to make an impact. This will enable the industry to prioritise a pipeline of suitable transition credits projects.</p><p>18. TRACTION has also identified the key components of a Just Transition associated with the early retirement of coal plants, to guide project owners and financial institutions to address the socio-economic impacts of coal plant closures on workers and communities.</p><p>19. These findings help foster a common understanding of high-integrity and viable transition credit transactions, enhancing the scalability of transition credits as a mechanism to crowd in financing for energy transition.</p><p>20. I would also highlight the work of the Singapore Sustainable Finance Association (SSFA). The SSFA is collaborating with the Singapore Government to develop guidance for companies on the credible usage of carbon credits alongside a decarbonisation plan. They are also developing solutions to deepen carbon project financing and collaborating with ASEAN counterparts on the ASEAN Common Carbon Framework.</p><p>21. MAS, together with the SSFA, are now considering initiatives to further support financial institutions' participation in carbon markets.</p><p>Strengthening Climate and Nature Resilience in the Financial Sector</p><p>22. Let me move on to a growing area of importance, that of adaptation and resilience. As the physical impact of climate change intensifies, there are mounting risks posed by both climate change and nature loss - risks that have cascading effects across sectors, markets, and value chains.</p><p>The Financial Stability Board (FSB) intends to consider more closely how climate-related physical risks can pose threats to financial stability.<br/><br/>MAS took early steps in 2020 to embed resilience in the financial system, by issuing a set of Guidelines on Environmental Risk Management (ENRM). These set out expectations for robust governance, risk management, and disclosures related to environmental risks.</p><p>Our financial institutions have also started to enhance the resilience of their portfolios to climate and nature risks. For example, by integrating physical climate risk into their internal credit risk models, asset valuation, and due diligence processes. Doing so will enable them to better anticipate and manage financial loss, minimise stranded assets, and uncover new financing and investment opportunities.</p><p>23. There is growing interest in how nature loss and ecosystem degradation can amplify the effects of climate change and put nature-dependent value chains at risk. It is timely that the SSFA, in partnership with Oliver Wyman, launched a white paper two weeks ago, titled \"Financing Our Natural Capital.\"</p><p>*The whitepaper contextualises global frameworks to our region, identifies sectors of high priority from a nature materiality lens, and provides practical steps for financial institutions to incorporate nature into their business activity.</p><p>24. Beyond managing their own environmental risk, financial institutions play an essential role in mobilising capital towards solutions that enhance the adaptive capacity of economies and communities.</p><p>*The insurance industry in particular has a key role in developing risk financing solutions for renewable energy and decarbonisation technologies, to reduce the risk of such projects for commercial investors.</p><p>*Several international insurance brokers have built specialised capabilities in Singapore to support and develop such risk financing solutions, through risk analytics and advisory for physical climate risk, energy transition investments, and carbon and nature markets.</p><p>25. Ultimately, financial institutions can respond on two fronts: by managing exposure to growing climate and nature-related risks, and by innovating to finance and de-risk adaptation, resilience, and nature-positive solutions.</p><p>Staying the Course and Building the Future</p><p>26. There are near-term uncertainties about the global momentum for climate action, but Asia can continue to chart a steady course in its transition. Policymakers, financial institutions, and corporates alike should take the long view, stay the course, and invest in the infrastructure, solutions, and capabilities that will enable industries and economies to transition. In doing so, we will unlock new opportunities for growth, create jobs, build resilient economies and make possible a more resilient future for all of us.</p><p>27.

That experience sparked emotions which I've come to understand as \"eco-anxiety\" -- a deep sense of distress at the environmental devastation we are witnessing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> This eventually let me to start WorkWell Leaders, a leadership-focused charity advocating for well-being and sustainable growth in the workplace.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> I was able to channel my anxiety into action, but many might not be so lucky. Studies show that eco-anxiety is rising, particularly among young people. Social media amplifies this distress, making it feel as if the future is already beyond repair. Those with eco-anxiety often experience higher rates of depression, anxiety and stress, and report lower overall mental well-being. The stress of knowing what is happening to our planet can breed powerlessness and even apathy.</p><p> A young woman I know had to quit her job due to eco-anxiety, coupled with the guilt of complicity in \"greenwashing\" -- conveying a false impression that a company's products are environmentally sound -- at one of the top employers in Singapore. \"I was feeling more and more depressed, and dreaded going to work every day,\" she said. </p><p> She is not alone. More than a few young working adults have reached out to me in recent times to share how conflicted and in despair they felt working for companies that simply did not care about the climate crisis. This inevitably leads to presenteeism -- physically present but mentally absent -- and quiet quitting.  </p><p> Yet, the dual crises of mental health and climate change have long been viewed as separate challenges. As we gain a deeper understanding, it becomes clear that they are intricately interconnected. Mental health, once sidelined, is now receiving the attention it deserves. Similarly, climate change is not just an environmental issue but a public health and humanitarian emergency.</p><p> As both of these crises intensify, we must approach them not as isolated issues, but as two sides of the same coin. Initiatives including the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy and the Green Plan 2030 are a step in the right direction as mental well-being is being introduced in climate resilience discussions, and vice versa, but Singapore must do more in this nexus of climate change and mental health.</p><p> Integrating mental health, climate approaches We cannot build resilient societies without addressing the trauma and displacement caused by climate change, nor can we create a healthy environment without a mentally healthy population. </p><p> As such, we must deal with the two biggest crises of our time in concert, not in silos. </p><p> However, the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Climate Change for the National Climate Change Secretariat (NCCS) under the Prime Minister's Office does not include the Ministry of Health, which leads the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy launched in 2024 to tackle mental health, now recognised as a significant health and social issue. </p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health Office (NMHO) -- to be fully established in 2025 -- is co-led by the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Social and Family Development, and comprises officers from the ministries of Education and Manpower -- but notably without any representation from the environment and sustainability agencies. </p><p> What are we missing here? With mental health a national priority and climate change an existential threat, the absence of integration in these national organisations creates a critical gap. </p><p>Singapore may not have to contend with the severe psychological impact of frequent natural disasters and climate-related migration that other countries are dealing with. However, rising temperatures and its mental health impact -- such as heat stress, especially for rental flat households and essential workers -- must be urgently considered. Some studies have found that a rise in temperature is associated with aggressive behaviour and suicidality. </p><p> The rise of eco-anxiety, particularly among Singapore's youth, also highlights the urgency of this cross collaboration and representation in NCCS and NMHO. A group of young people I spoke with at a university questioned whether it would be even responsible of them to bring children into a world grappling with climate change, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity. Such significant attitudinal changes could have far-reaching implications for Singapore's policies, particularly in areas such as public health, social development and economic sustainability. </p><p> It is also important to note that climate change doesn't just affect mental health -- it can also be worsened by poor mental health. When people are struggling with their mental health, they may feel overwhelmed, helpless or disconnected, making it more difficult for them to engage in proactive measures to address climate issues.</p><p> By ensuring that climate policies include mental health considerations, and vice versa, we can better support vulnerable populations and equip individuals with the resilience, motivation, and hope to confront climate challenges. </p><p> As well, the intersection of climate change and mental health presents new opportunities for research, policy and practice. This could include integrating mental health support into climate adaptation plans, extending climate finance to mental health services, and fostering community-led initiatives and creative approaches to address climate-induced stress. </p><p> How to survive and thrive'Mental health has worsened in Singapore since 2020, according to the Ministry of Health's National Population Health survey. Singaporeans have identified mental health as the biggest health problem, surpassing concerns about cancer and diabetes. Worryingly, one in three between the ages of 15 and 35 experiences severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, or stress.</p><p> Experts found that youth mental well-being depends on connections in their social and environmental contexts. It's no wonder these same experts warn that the price of climate inaction will be the mental health of young people. </p><p> We must build environments where individuals can thrive, not just survive. Healing happens in ecosystems of care -- not in isolation. Such an ecosystem ranges from workplaces that prioritise psychological safety to schools that nurture emotional intelligence, to policies that embed mental health into broader social systems.</p><p> In this way, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy was a significant step towards addressing the crisis here, moving beyond crisis intervention to a full spectrum of care: prevention, early intervention, resilience-building, and community-based well-being.</p><p> The link between community well-being and nature is especially crucial in urban settings like Singapore, where green spaces play a vital role in fostering mental health and social cohesion. Shared experiences in nature can strengthen social bonds and foster a sense of community. As climate change threatens the environment, these natural spaces are at risk. When nature is degraded, not only is the physical environment compromised, but the mental and emotional resilience of the community is also weakened. </p><p> While working towards creating thriving individuals and communities, we must also focus on ensuring a thriving planet. The Asia-Pacific region is responsible for over 50 per cent of the world's heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> In Singapore, we are experiencing rising sea levels, extreme heat and climate-related health risks. A deteriorating natural environment undermines efforts to foster mental and emotional resilience. So protecting our ecosystems is not just about preserving biodiversity, but safeguarding the mental health of our future generations. </p><p> Reasons for hopeI was delighted when the Singapore Green Plan 2030 launched in 2021 included the creation of spaces that promote mental well-being, reduce stress and enhance resilience.</p><p> Similarly, the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy includes nature-based solutions, such as creating 30 therapeutic gardens across Singapore by 2030. These spaces will provide restorative environments for people with conditions like ADHD and dementia. </p><p> Furthermore, building codes now prioritise occupant well-being, with the Green Mark certification scheme and the Building Control Act playing key roles in promoting healthy, sustainable buildings.</p><p> And more recently, the Mercury Taskforce, comprising 37 public agencies led by the Ministry of Sustainability and Environment and National Environment Agency, announced the first National Heatwave Response Plan for Singapore. </p><p> The intersection of mental health and sustainability within environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks is increasingly critical for businesses. Investors are placing greater emphasis on companies that prioritise not only environmental sustainability but also the well-being of their employees and communities. </p><p> Healing from eco-anxietyThe way we treat our planet mirrors the way we treat ourselves. A world that exhausts its natural resources is the same world that exhausts its people. The burnout we feel individually is a reflection of the unsustainable systems we have created. If we want to heal the planet, we must also heal ourselves.</p><p> For me, healing has always come from nature. As a child, trees were my refuge from bullying. Thirty years later, amid a series of personal crises including a broken marriage, shattered career and financial ruin, I found myself hugging a tree again. And since then, I have hugged a tree every week after my regular run. </p><p> There's no single way forward, but there is hope in both individual and collective action. By building bridges between mental health professionals, environmentalists, policymakers, researchers and business and community leaders, we can create a future that is both sustainable and resilient for people and planet.</p><p> Anthea Ong is a former Nominated Member of Parliament, social entrepreneur, mental health advocate and author.

Because it has limited land, the nation has to import most of its food and energy and has invested heavily to reduce reliance on water imports. </p><p> Boosting resilience to supply shocks is a key policy focus for the Government, and the threats from climate change only add to the challenges. Here are some examples of what the Government and industry have been doing.</p><p> Over the past five decades, the Government has been diversifying water supplies to bolster imports from Malaysia. They include desalination plants, water recycling (Newater) and water-efficiency steps. The fifth desalination plant opened in Jurong in 2022.</p><p> Going forward, water demand is expected to grow, along with more extreme flood and drought events. According to national water agency PUB, Singapore's total water demand could almost double by 2065. By then, Newater and desalination will meet the bulk of the water demand. </p><p> Food is also a major concern. The Republic sources about 90 per cent of its food from more than 170 nations. But this leaves the country vulnerable to supply shocks, especially from extreme weather events overseas. So, back in 2019, the Government set a \"30 by 30\" target to meet 30 per cent of the nation's nutritional needs locally by 2030.</p><p> This has triggered investment in more egg production, rooftop gardens and giant vertical farms that produce vegetables and fish. And investment is growing quickly to boost production of cell-based meats such as beef and chicken. </p><p> Energy presents challenges as well. Singapore's energy system has been resilient to climate impacts to date. But it is heavily reliant on imported natural gas, and the burning of this fossil fuel contributes to climate change. </p><p> The climate challenge for Singapore comes in a different form -- finding the right path to reduce dependency on fossil fuels to meet climate target obligations, while ensuring energy security. </p><p> Among the strategies are shifting to low-carbon hydrogen imports, quickly scaling up the electrification of transport, mandating more energy-efficient buildings, and importing green power from the region. Singapore hopes to remain a regional energy hub, but the focus is on cleaner energy instead of fossil fuels. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-P61ME07</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67TG-SJ21-DYX4-0518-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"386\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Leapfrogging from the 15th spot in 2023 to the top rank this year is no mean feat and has been the result of Singapore's emphasis on strategic national planning and forward-thinking policies. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As global competition intensifies and urban challenges grow more complex, the city-state must also continuously evolve to maintain its edge as a premier hub for innovation and sustainability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Singapore's journey from a resource-scarce island to a thriving metropolis offers essential lessons in urban innovation. Its Garden City vision, pioneered by founding prime minister Lee Kuan Yew, laid the groundwork for its reputation as a global leader in sustainable urban development. </p><p> Today, Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities, with 7,800 hectares of green space. Its green cover is over 40 per cent, earning it the moniker \"City in a Garden\". The island is also among the world's 20 most carbon-efficient countries, with natural gas generating 95 per cent of its electricity. </p><p> However, achieving the national target of net zero emissions by 2050 will still be a challenging journey. Scarce resources will always be a significant constraint in the planned transition towards increasing the renewables share in its energy mix. Meanwhile, difficulties such as logistics and high capital costs persist in greening Singapore's built environment that accounts for around 20 per cent of national emissions.</p><p> Learning from global leadersIn view of these gaps, Singapore can still draw valuable lessons from cities worldwide in building sustainable urban ecosystems, especially those with a high quality of life, and that prioritise environmental sustainability, are culturally diverse, focus on innovation and technology, and more.</p><p> Copenhagen is a great example. The Danish capital, which has more bikes than inhabitants, has 382 kilometres of cycle tracks and traffic lights coordinated for cyclists during rush hour, which also has reduced emissions and improved public health. Likewise, Oslo's car-free city centre and electric vehicle infrastructure showcase a commitment to green mobility. Amsterdam's long-standing commitment to its circular economy highlights how scaling resource optimisation can engage communities and drive long-term sustainability.</p><p> By learning from the global leaders, Singapore can continue to adapt and scale these best practices through a combination of strong regulatory frameworks, technological expertise, and an innovation-driven mindset. </p><p> Cross-border collaborations as innovation catalystsGiven Singapore's small domestic market, cross-border collaborations are crucial for driving innovation. Global connectivity amplifies the impact by opening doors to new markets, resources, and expertise. </p><p> Academic institutions can play a key role as an enabler of innovation and pave the way for public-private collaborations while fostering entrepreneurship, which is not the path most taken by our graduates. Hence, we must intentionally cultivate entrepreneurship by inspiring student founders and opening their eyes to global perspectives. In particular, institutes of higher learning can play active roles in fostering meaningful connections between Singapore's innovation ecosystem and the global stage.</p><p> For instance, Iterative Health, founded by a Singaporean during his academic journey at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, exemplifies the value of international exposure for startups. </p><p> In another case, Zhiyin, a China-based assistive technology startup, has worked closely with Singapore Management University undergraduates through overseas internships. The competencies and drive displayed by the students has led to their being offered the opportunity to spearhead Zhiyin's expansion into Singapore.</p><p> Power of tri-sector partnershipsUltimately however, collaboration among corporations, government, and universities is key to growing the nation's innovation ecosystem. The government provides regulatory support and funding, while the private sector brings agility, domain expertise, and the ability to scale innovations globally. </p><p> This can lead to the emergence of a tri-sector partnership (TSP) that is a collaboration between the public, private, and civil society sectors. The goal of a TSP is to combine the resources and skills of these sectors to achieve more than any one sector could on its own.</p><p> Universities in turn contribute fresh talent and creative ideas, while youth entrepreneurship drives economic growth by creating jobs and fostering innovation.</p><p> Such tri-sector partnerships can drive breakthroughs in critical areas such as sustainability, deep tech, and urban solutions, and accelerate the deployment of solutions addressing urgent challenges. </p><p> Next frontier: Water solutions and sustainable materialsFor a resource-scarce, high-density urban hub such as Singapore, two areas stand out as game changers for the future of cities: water solutions and sustainable materials. Singapore has transformed water scarcity into a strength, building one of the world's most sophisticated urban water management systems through its Four National Taps strategy. As water stress intensifies worldwide, Singapore's expertise in circular water solutions and smart water infrastructure will become increasingly valuable.</p><p> Similarly, sustainable materials are emerging as a critical component in addressing mounting environmental challenges. Singapore is making significant strides in this space, with institutions such as A*Star's Institute of Materials Research and Engineering pioneering next-generation materials that reduce waste and carbon footprints. The government has also been stepping up support and driving demand for sustainable materials in construction and manufacturing.</p><p> Empowering the next generationInstitutions aside, it is the young innovators, especially students, who are key drivers in shaping Singapore's future as an urban sustainability hub. With fresh perspectives and a readiness to challenge norms, they are uniquely positioned to co-create solutions for climate resilience, resource efficiency, and urban liveability.</p><p> A recent survey of over 6,000 SMU undergraduates found that 40 per cent are open to exploring entrepreneurship, and this interest grows with access to mentorship and startup internships. Universities can empower students to experiment, learn, and create change by providing the right networks, resources, and exposure. </p><p> Platforms such as startup and case study competitions, that connect students with the right mentorship and resources, can also be a springboard for their ideas to move the needle on addressing tomorrow's urban sustainability challenges. Participation and immersion in these initiatives can provide young entrepreneurs the opportunities to broaden their networks and sharpen their value propositions.</p><p> The road aheadSingapore should therefore strive to be more than a hub -- it must be a living laboratory where cutting-edge technologies and human-centric solutions are co-created and scaled globally to address the world's most pressing challenges. This ecosystem must be rooted in deep partnerships that transcend sectors and borders, allowing Singapore to pioneer advancements in urban solutions, green technologies, and digital health while setting new global standards for liveability and resilience.</p><p> By focusing on talent development, cross-sector collaboration, digital transformation, and global market access, Singapore is well-positioned to remain a leading global innovation magnet, attracting talent, investments, and breakthrough technologies to secure its future in the global economy.</p><p> The writer is vice-president (partnerships and engagement), and Lee Kong Chian professor of communication and technology, Singapore Management University</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Singapore is one of the world's greenest cities, with 7,800 hectares of green space.

Fund</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Another $5 billion will be injected into the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, which was set up in 2020 to protect Singapore against rising sea levels and enhance flood resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Prime Minister Lawrence Wong announced this top-up in his Budget speech on Feb 18, saying it would be prudent for Singapore to set aside funds now to ensure that it can proceed with coastal and flood protection investments in the future. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The fund was first announced in 2020 with an initial injection of $5 billion to fund both coastal protection and drainage infrastructure.</p><p> PM Wong said Singapore needs to take steps to protect itself against climate risks even as it moves to reduce its emissions. </p><p> \"If the world continues on a fossil fuel-based development trajectory over the coming years, global temperatures will keep rising, and that means we can expect a mean sea level rise of over 1m by 2100,\" he said. </p><p> A higher mean sea level, coupled with high tides and storm surges, would have a significant impact on Singapore, he said, adding that about one-third of Singapore will be vulnerable to coastal flooding.</p><p>Singapore will employ a range of solutions to protect its coastlines, including static structures like sea walls, to more specialised measures like barrages and tidal gates, as well as reclamation, PM Wong added. </p><p> For example, developing Long Island by reclaiming land in the south-eastern part of Singapore will not only raise the ground level above rising sea levels but also create more space for homes, as well as new waterfront parks for outdoor recreation, he said. </p><p> For Long Island, three tracts of land -- collectively about twice the size of Marina Bay -- could be reclaimed off East Coast Park in the coming decades, creating about 800ha of land for new homes and other amenities, as well as a new reservoir.</p><p> PM Wong said national water agency PUB will complete site-specific studies for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Changi in 2025. </p><p> Studies for Jurong Island and the north-western coast are also under way.</p><p>Singapore is conducting eight islandwide site-specific studies of its coastlines to determine the most suitable coastal protection solutions for each segment.</p><p> \"And step by step, we will complete the plans for coastal protection around the entire island,\" he said. </p><p> In response to queries from The Straits Times, PUB's coastal protection department director Hazel Khoo said that the top-up will be used to fund capital and non-recurrent operational expenditures by PUB for coastal protection and drainage works. </p><p> She said that while coastal protection is a long-term endeavour, the use of the fund is expected to ramp up towards the end of the decade to fund the design and construction of coastal protection measures. </p><p> This includes measures at the Greater Southern Waterfront and Changi, which are covered under the City-East Coast site-specific study. </p><p> Meanwhile, from FY2021 to FY2023, about $200 million of the fund was largely used for drainage projects such as the Syed Alwi Pumping Station, Alkaff Lake and upgrading works at a section of Bukit Timah Canal (Rifle Range Road to Jalan Kampong Chantek).</p><p> PUB has also initiated site-specific studies to develop coastal protection solutions for the City-East Coast and the north-west coast. </p><p> More funds will be deployed for coastal protection measures as the plans are progressively firmed up, said Ms Khoo. </p><p> According to Singapore's Third National Climate Change Study, the mean sea level around Singapore is projected to rise by 23cm in the best possible scenario, or by 1.15m in the worst-case scenario, by 2100.</p><p> If fossil fuel use accelerates, sea levels could rise by around 2m by 2150.</p><p> Storm surges could also contribute to extreme sea-level events and cause coastal flooding in low-lying areas.</p><p> The local coastline is vulnerable to storm surges at varying degrees, depending on the orientation of the coast, depth of water, wind speed and tide levels.</p><p> \"Our next decade will be pivotal as we accelerate efforts to de-carbonise our economy and enhance the climate resilience of our built environment,\" said PM Wong.</p><p> \"... And as long as this Government is in charge, we are committed to delivering them. We will ensure that our island nation survives even as the oceans rise, and we will build a better and greener future for all.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A partially submerged picnic site during high tide at East Coast Park on Jan 17.

It is also an important driver of financial and environmental dividends. </p><p> While the economic benefits of employing women are well documented, the environmental angle is often overlooked, despite evidence of the value women bring to climate agendas and conservation projects. Climate change is rarely considered when we consider the need for greater gender equality. </p><p> We should draw a tighter connection between empowering women and addressing climate change.  </p><p> Consider the evidenceGreater female representation correlates with superior environmental performance -- at the country, corporate and household levels.</p><p> Scientists have documented a statistically significant association between female parliamentary representation and the stringency of a country's climate policies. Countries with a higher proportion of women in Parliament are more likely to ratify environmental treaties and implement policies aimed at addressing climate change, thereby reducing carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p> At a corporate level, companies whose boards included at least three women directors for at least three years achieved greater reductions in carbon-emissions intensity versus their peers in the same sector. </p><p> Such companies were also more likely (16 per cent versus 6.3 per cent) to have environmental targets linked to executive compensation, according to research by investment research firm Morgan Stanley Capital International.</p><p> A 2018 study by Yale University in the US also showed that women are more likely to be concerned about the climate crisis than men. In developed economies, women drive 70 per cent to 80 per cent of all consumer purchasing decisions, and are leading the transition to more sustainable lifestyles. </p><p> Women are more likely to recycle, minimise waste, and save water and energy in the household.  </p><p> This care for our planet has deep roots. </p><p> In rural and indigenous communities, women have played a traditional role as managers and stewards of natural resources and agricultural systems for generations. One study demonstrated that women hold greater plant knowledge than men and, more importantly, share this knowledge more widely, with horizontal knowledge transmission measured at 73 per cent for women and 61 per cent for men.  </p><p> That expertise and sharing of knowledge improves conservation on the ground, as demonstrated by the success of women-only forest protection groups, shown in multiple studies done in India. </p><p> For example, a study in India in 2006 showed that female participation in forest management is associated with a 24 per cent increase in the probability of controlling illicit grazing, a 28 per cent increase in the probability of controlling illicit felling, and a 28 per cent increase in the probability of forest regeneration. </p><p> The evidence is compelling: When women are empowered in environmental projects, their deep knowledge of local ecosystems and resource management practices, as well as their centrality to community dynamics, leads to a substantial increase in the efficacy of such projects. </p><p> This is an important factor to note for investors into nature-based solutions that protect, restore and manage natural ecosystems with the aim of mitigating carbon emissions and enhancing biodiversity. </p><p> Combining gender goals with nature-based solutions serves a dual purpose: It improves environmental outcomes while ensuring that women are allowed to fairly access and benefit from natural resources.</p><p> The emergence of  new solutionsWe are beginning to see nature-focused investors take this connection seriously. </p><p> The Kiwa Initiative in the Pacific Islands, for example, integrates gender equality into land restoration projects. It not only revitalises degraded landscapes, but also elevates women into leadership roles traditionally dominated by men.</p><p> In Nepal, a ground-breaking initiative has put women at the helm of managing the country's vast forests. This shift has led to more sustainable forestry practices, reduced deforestation and improved community livelihoods. </p><p> In Tajikistan, a women-led snow leopard conservation project has integrated species preservation with female empowerment, creating jobs and ecotourism revenues while protecting biodiversity. </p><p> Integrating gender considerations into nature investments requires deliberate strategies and innovative financial instruments. Investors now have a wider suite of investment structures to consider, from green bonds with gender criteria to investment funds prioritising female-led sustainability projects. </p><p> The Climate Bonds Initiative, a non-profit organisation working to mobilise global capital for climate action, and UN Women are partnering on new guidance to integrate gender considerations within green finance tools promoting climate resilience. </p><p> Remember the bottom lineDespite the environmental dividends, mainstreaming gender equality within sustainable finance will require continued education on the financial benefits of empowering women. </p><p> We must remember that companies with more women in senior management score higher in all dimensions of organisational performance. At a global level, a White House report published during US President Donald Trump's first term in February 2020 estimated that the value of removing legal restrictions on women globally could boost global gross domestic product by US$7.7 trillion (S$10.4 trillion), or 8.3 per cent.  </p><p> Limited data, entrenched biases and policy gaps impede progress. However, these challenges also highlight the vast potential for growth. The UN estimates that US$360 billion a year is needed to bridge the gender gap. With the promise of a US$7.7 trillion payoff, that looks like a bargain.  </p><p> It is a collective responsibility to drive gender equality, given the shared benefits that accrue to all. </p><p> Business leaders and decision-makers in all industries can take action by developing programmes and earmarking funds to promote inclusive policies and prioritise gender diversity at all levels of their organisations. </p><p> Adopting a gender-lens approach is not about being woke -- it is an economically and environmentally astute move. Doing more to connect gender equality and sustainable development will help unlock additional benefits for all. </p><p> Let us shift the narrative from \"why\" we should invest in women to how quickly we can scale these investments. The dividends are too significant to ignore -- for our economies, our environment and our shared future.</p><p> Ms Kimberly Tan is the head of investments at GenZero, an investment platform company that aims to accelerate decarbonisation. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-7QGF8AN</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F7V-5BY3-RRT9-P0BK-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1148\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

With a population of over 1.4 billion people, Africa is home to the world's youngest population, with a median age of just 19 years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">More than 60 per cent of the continent's population is under the age of 25, representing not only a massive labour force but also a dynamic base of consumers. By 2030, Africa is projected to have a combined consumer and business spending of over US$6.7 trillion, and by 2050, one in four people on the planet will be African.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Across the continent, youth-led movements are rejecting the legacy of colonialism and challenging foreign political, economic, and cultural dominance-from anti-French protests in Mali and Burkina Faso to digital campaigns calling out exploitative trade and development practices.</p><p>Simultaneously, the European Union's waning strategic interest in the African Union-evident in reduced engagement levels, shifting diplomatic priorities, and diluted financial commitments-has created a vacuum that new players such as China, the UAE, and Turkey are beginning to fill.</p><p>With the world racing to decarbonise, Africa is no longer on the sidelines. Its vast deposits of critical minerals-such as cobalt, lithium, and rare earths-have drawn the attention of states eager to secure supply chains for their energy transitions.</p><p>The United States, for example, has entered into talks with the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) to access strategic mineral rights, including proposals linking military assistance to extraction privileges. China has taken an even more assertive role, with Chinese companies now dominating cobalt and lithium extraction in the DRC and other mineral-rich African states-representing nearly a quarter of all Chinese FDI in Africa by 2022.</p><p>Meanwhile, the European Union has launched its Global Gateway Investment Package, aiming to secure access to key raw materials such as manganese, tantalum, and bauxite while promoting its climate and industrial goals. These moves by global powers have sparked criticism of a new form of resource exploitation, where value is exported and local communities are left with environmental and social costs.</p><p>It is clear, that demographics, resources, and geopolitics are converging to make the continent central to global economic and climate strategy. The question is no longer whether Africa will shape the green transition-but how, and on whose terms.</p><p>Africa's climate ambitions and the green promise</p><p>Africa holds immense promise in the transition to a net-zero world. Home to 30 per cent of the world's mineral reserves essential for clean technologies, vast tracts of arable land, and one of the largest solar irradiation zones on Earth, the continent is poised to become a powerhouse of green growth. Countries like Kenya, Morocco, and South Africa are pioneering clean energy solutions, while others like Nigeria and Egypt are exploring green hydrogen and electric vehicle manufacturing.</p><p>Beyond energy, Africa's green growth potential lies in net-zero manufacturing. According to a recent report by Boston Consulting Group (BCG), Africa has the opportunity to decarbonise its industrial base and become a global hub for low-carbon manufacturing. If supported by the right financing and policy architecture, Africa could reduce manufacturing emissions by up to 90 per cent while creating 3.8 million new green jobs and generating over US$2 billion in annual green revenues by 2030.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/climate-tech-startups-can-play-a-role-in-helping-smes-bridge-sustainability-digital-transformation-paessler-20230712/\">Climate tech startups can play a role in helping SMEs bridge sustainability, digital transformation: Paessler</url></p><p>Sectors such as green steel, sustainable cement, bio-based packaging, and solar panel assembly could anchor a pan-African net-zero industrial ecosystem. Such developments would not only enhance local value creation and export potential but also build resilience against global supply shocks.</p><p>With the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) opening pathways for intra-continental green value chains, and a youthful population hungry for climate-compatible employment, Africa has the assets to shape a new industrial era. But ambition needs capital. And that's where the dilemma begins.</p><p>The financial trap: Debt-for-nature swaps and ESG capital</p><p>Aside from developmental aid, debt-for-nature swaps (DFNS) are gaining traction as a solution to Africa's rising debt and climate finance gap. These financial arrangements allow portions of external debt to be forgiven or restructured in exchange for conservation commitments. Gabon made headlines with a US$500 million marine DFNS in 2023, Seychelles earlier protected 30 per cent of its waters through a similar mechanism, and a coalition of Indian Ocean states is now considering a US$2 billion joint proposal.</p><p>On the surface, DFNS seem like a win-win: nations reduce debt burdens and fund environmental protection. But many of these deals come with strict conditions-funds are often ring-fenced for conservation, leaving little room to finance green industrial infrastructure such as clean energy manufacturing, regenerative agriculture, or low-carbon transport systems.</p><p>Africa risks becoming a 'carbon sink' or biodiversity custodian for the Global North-rewarded for what it protects, not what it builds.</p><p>The fork in the road: Two futures</p><p>Africa stands at a critical juncture, with two divergent paths ahead:</p><p>The dystopian green enclosure: Natural capital becomes collateral. External actors define conservation metrics, audit compliance, and enforce penalties. Environmental policy becomes beholden to ESG bond covenants, biodiversity offset schemes, and investor expectations. Sovereignty is slowly eroded, as African nations trade access to land, forests, and water in exchange for financial relief.</p><p>A regenerative green sovereignty: Africa asserts control over climate finance architecture. DFNS and ESG capital are redirected toward building industrial green zones, powered by solar, producing sustainable goods for global markets. Regional carbon markets and African-developed disclosure frameworks anchor investment. Sovereignty is maintained, development is endogenous, and climate outcomes are just.</p><p>TCFD and the disclosure dilemma</p><p>The Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) is a global framework helping firms report climate-related financial risks. Egypt, Tunisia, and Kenya are among the few African countries piloting TCFD-aligned programs. By aligning with TCFD, African firms can attract climate capital and demonstrate resilience to global investors.</p><p>But there's a catch: the TCFD's structure and methodology are rooted in Western risk assumptions. If adopted uncritically, Africa could once again become a follower of externally defined ESG norms, rather than shaping standards that reflect its realities and strengths.</p><p>The new geopolitics of climate finance</p><p>Climate finance is fast becoming a new instrument of geopolitical influence. China is investing in Africa's renewable grids. The UAE is backing clean tech parks. The EU and US push biodiversity-linked bonds and climate reporting standards. Financial giants like Goldman Sachs and BlackRock are issuing nature-based financial products.</p><p>Foreign investments in Africa increasingly focus on conservation and carbon offset initiatives that benefit both host countries and investors. China, through its Belt and Road Initiative, has developed models of reforestation for carbon credit generation that could be replicated in African landscapes.</p><p>The UAE, via companies like Blue Carbon, has secured rights over millions of hectares of African forests for carbon credit projects, using the credits to offset domestic emissions and trade globally. European investors are engaging in biodiversity credits, such as through African Parks' Verifiable Nature Units, to meet their ESG targets while funding ecological protection.</p><p>While these projects offer crucial capital and visibility for Africa's conservation agenda, they raise critical concerns:</p><p>Sovereignty and land use: Large-scale land agreements may marginalise local communities, especially if traditional rights are ignored or overridden. In Tanzania, the eviction of Maasai herders from the Ngorongoro Conservation Area to make way for carbon offset and tourism investments has sparked international outrage. These evictions, influenced by foreign conservation and finance interests, raise questions about whose interests are being prioritised in the green transition.</p><p>Environmental integrity: The quality and credibility of carbon credits depend on rigorous standards, transparency, and independent verification. Without proper oversight, such projects risk undermining real climate action.</p><p>Financial risk and ownership loss: When climate infrastructure projects go awry, the burden often falls on African governments and citizens. In Kenya's Lake Turkana Wind Power Project, delays in grid connection forced the government to pay US$52.5 million in penalties to foreign developers-costs ultimately passed on to the public. Such contracts reflect the imbalance of power and the risk of legal or financial transfer of assets in the event of defaults.</p><p>Equitable benefit sharing: African nations must negotiate agreements that ensure a fair share of revenue, support local job creation, and reinvest in communities and ecosystems.</p><p>Africa is both the stage and the prize in this contest. If fragmented, it risks being out-negotiated. If unified, it could command better terms.</p><p>Also Read: <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/transition-climate-risk-navigating-the-future-of-sustainable-real-estate-20240911/\">Transition climate risk: Navigating the future of sustainable real estate</url></p><p>Strategic pathways and business opportunities for Africa</p><p>To navigate this moment, Africa must adopt strategic measures that both protect sovereignty and catalyse green growth. Learning from successful models in other regions can provide a roadmap for Africa's climate transition:</p><p>Embed sovereignty protections in all climate finance deals. African governments must include clauses that prevent loss of ownership or operational control in the event of financial distress, ensuring that local communities and national authorities retain decision-making power.</p><p>Develop regional standards forESG frameworks, carbon and biodiversity accounting. Drawing inspiration from Singapore's Centre for Climate Research and its investments in foundational climate science, Africa can establish regional research institutions and universities to lead in regional climate modelling and carbon measurement. With a strong scientific base, it empowers Africa to set its own benchmarks for ESG performance, emissions reduction, biodiversity valuation, and climate resilience. ensuring they reflect the continent's unique ecological, economic, and social realities.</p><p>Harmonise climate finance taxonomies with global standards. Singapore has demonstrated regional leadership by aligning its green finance taxonomy with those of the EU and China to ensure interoperability for cross-border financing. Similarly, Africa can develop a harmonised climate taxonomy that is compatible with major international systems, thereby enhancing its ability to attract sustainable finance while ensuring projects align with local needs.</p><p>Leverage AfCFTA to scale green policies, and setting regional benchmarks for investing of DFNS proceeds. Funds from debt-for-nature swaps should support sectors like renewable energy, green hydrogen, sustainable agriculture, and electric mobility-areas with strong job creation and export potential, not just conservation. Fostering intra-African trade in climate goods and services would promote self-sustaining green value chains and reduce dependency on imported technologies.</p><p>Capitalise on emerging business opportunities in green and digital infrastructure. These include investments in low-carbon 'dark factories' using automation and renewable energy, climate-resilient data centres powered by solar or geothermal, and localised processing of critical minerals such as lithium, cobalt, and graphite. These sectors can transform Africa into a competitive hub for climate-era industries while creating durable economic value.</p><p>Conclusion: Owning the transition</p><p>Africa has a choice. It can remain a passive supplier of offsets and green goodwill. Or it can build the factories, systems, and institutions of the net-zero age. The tools are emerging. The capital is circling. The question is whether the continent will shape its green destiny-or lease it out to the highest bidder.</p><p>The stakes are high, but so is Africa's leverage. If the continent acts collectively and on its own terms, the green future will not only be sustainable. It will be sovereign.</p><p>-</p><p>Editor's note:e27aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.

A very good morning to everyone.</p><p>2. 2025 is a pivotal year in the fight against climate change.</p><p>3. Last year, we witnessed the warmest year on record-1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. Yet, despite this stark warning, global momentum is wavering.</p><p>4. Geopolitical tensions are rising. Some governments are shifting focus to more immediate political concerns. Even some companies and financial institutions are re-evaluating their sustainability commitments, influenced by these shifting priorities.</p><p>5. At the same time, the world is grappling with the challenges of the energy transition. While the momentum toward renewable energy is strong, the reality is that fossil fuels still play a significant role-especially in industries and regions that lack the infrastructure for greener alternatives.</p><p>6. These are complex challenges. But they are not insurmountable.</p><p>Four Key Enablers</p><p>7. Today, I want to share four key enablers that can help sustain our transition to a greener economy: Capital. Standards. Policies. Knowledge. Let me elaborate.</p><p>Capital - Unlocking Finance for Decarbonisation</p><p>8. First, capital.</p><p>9. Transitioning to net zero is not just about ambition-it requires investment. A McKinsey study estimates we need US$9.2 trillion per year to get there by 2050. Today, we are over 35 per cent short of that target.</p><p>10. This means we must be creative in mobilising diverse financing mechanisms to unlock new sources of capital and maximise impact.</p><p>11. One such tool is blended finance, which combines public and private capital to fund projects that would otherwise struggle to secure investment.</p><p>12. At COP-29, countries agreed to triple public financing to developing nations-from US$100 billion to US$300 billion annually by 2035. Yet, even this is not enough. Public and philanthropic funding alone cannot close the gap. But if used strategically, it can de-risk green projects, attract private investment, and accelerate transition efforts.</p><p>13. Singapore is leading by example. Our Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (FAST-P) has pledged up to US$500 million to catalyse additional capital from public, private, and philanthropic sources. With the right partners, we could build a US$1 billion fund-targeting high-impact sectors like energy transition, coal phase-out, and hard-to-abate industries such as steel, cement, and aviation.</p><p>14. Another innovative approach is carbon credits. High-quality carbon credits direct financing toward emission-reduction projects that would otherwise not have been viable. They also offer an alternative pathway for companies to address hard-to-abate emissions.</p><p>15. In Singapore, we are piloting transition credits to accelerate the retirement of coal-fired power plants. Through the Transition Credits Coalition (TRACTION), we are working with financial institutions, insurers, and industry experts to unlock new financing solutions. Already, two pilot projects in the Philippines are exploring how to make this model work.</p><p>Standards - Building a Trusted and Transparent System</p><p>16. Second, standards.</p><p>17. For the green transition to be effective, we need clear, credible, and harmonised standards.</p><p>18. Today, businesses and investors navigate a patchwork of sustainability reporting requirements, leading to confusion and inefficiencies. We must aim for greater interoperability across regions and sectors, reducing compliance burdens and ensuring that capital is directed to truly sustainable projects.</p><p>19. Singapore has taken a step forward with the Singapore-Asia Taxonomy for Sustainable Finance. This framework provides a common language for evaluating green and transition activities, ensuring science-based criteria guide investment decisions.</p><p>20. To enhance global alignment, MAS has also mapped this taxonomy to the EU Taxonomy and China's Green Bond Endorsed Project Catalogue, under the International Platform for Sustainable Finance's Multi-Jurisdiction Common Ground Taxonomy (M-CGT). This integration enhances cross-border financing opportunities and strengthens the credibility of sustainable investments.</p><p>Policies - Providing Clear Signals for Transition</p><p>21. Third, policies.</p><p>22. Regulatory clarity is critical. Governments must signal their commitment to decarbonisation through robust Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and supporting policies.</p><p>23. Just last month, Singapore announced our 2035 NDC-a commitment to reduce national emissions to between 45 to 50 million tonnes of CO equivalent by 2035. This aligns with our net zero target by 2050 and demonstrates our unwavering commitment to sustainability, even as global momentum slows.</p><p>24. But ambition must be balanced with pragmatism. The pace of decarbonisation depends on international collaboration and technological advancements. That is why Singapore is leveraging Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which allows countries to cooperate on carbon markets.</p><p>25. We have signed three Implementation Agreements under Article 6-with Papua New Guinea, Ghana, and Bhutan-facilitating international financing through high-quality carbon credits. To catalyse demand, Singapore's International Carbon Credit (ICC) Framework allows companies to offset up to 5 per cent of their carbon tax liability with these credits.</p><p>26. The reason why we have implementation with these three countries, they were selected because they have very clear policies and frameworks that are enshrined in their laws. That's a very important prerequisite for companies, investors, project developers, to invest their time and resources to develop projects in their jurisdiction. Without those clear laws, it is difficult to generate high quality carbon credit projects that will sustain time and have the longevity that investors require. </p><p>Knowledge - Driving Innovation and Expertise</p><p>27. Finally, knowledge.</p><p>28. Knowledge ties together capital, standards, and policies, forming the foundation for effective climate action.</p><p>29. Singapore is well-positioned to be a knowledge hub for sustainable finance. Our financial sector, academic institutions, and professional services form a growing ecosystem of expertise in climate finance.</p><p>30. Institutions like SGFIN play a crucial role in this landscape. I encourage you to collaborate, share insights, and drive innovation to advance climate resilience in the region.</p><p>31. Beyond financing, we must also explore how capital markets can help address climate risks.</p><p>32. For example, insurance solutions could play a bigger role in optimising capital allocation and managing risk. Parametric insurance could address revenue volatility in solar and wind power projects, while similar financial instruments could be developed for carbon credits and emerging technologies like carbon capture and storage.</p><p>Conclusion - Working Together for a Sustainable Future</p><p>33. Let me conclude.</p><p>34. The challenges before us-geopolitical uncertainty, economic pressures, and environmental risks-may seem daunting. But they should not discourage us.</p><p>35. Instead, they should drive us to act with greater urgency and purpose.</p><p>36. I have outlined four key enablers:</p><p>a. Capital - To finance the transition.</p><p>b. Standards - To build credibility and trust.</p><p>c. Policies - To provide clear, long-term signals.</p><p>d. Knowledge - To innovate and scale solutions.</p><p>37. By working together, we can create the right conditions for capital to flow, unlock new opportunities for businesses, and accelerate climate action. Climate action is not against businesses. They are aligned. We are all aligned here to make the planet better so that we can have sustainable prosperity, progress, economic progress and urban development. All this is not sustainable if we don't look after our planet. </p><p>38. Let us commit to this journey-towards a more resilient, sustainable, and prosperous future for generations to come.</p><p>39.

Many analysts expected the total tab for this work to exceed US$1 trillion (S$1.37 trillion) over the next decade.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> But in a matter of days, President Donald Trump has thrown much of that spending into question, though how much money is affected is unclear. Some funds are frozen. Some projects are paused. And while a portion of that money is already out the door, there is an acute sense of uncertainty among people doing climate-related work that relies on government funding and approvals.</p><p> To take just one example of the chaos, consider the aid that the US sends to foreign countries to deal with climate change. The US Agency for International Development alone manages appropriations of roughly US$40 billion annually, a fraction of which goes to climate-related projects.</p><p> Mr Raj Kumar, chief executive of Devex, a media company that tracks foreign aid closely, said he had spent a lot of time on the phone with the leaders of organisations working on development projects around the world, and even he cannot make sense of this moment.</p><p> \"There's no precedent to this,\" he told me. \"As the recipient of US aid right now, you really don't know what the state of your programme is.\"</p><p> Even among people who track federal spending closely, there is widespread uncertainty about what the US government is going to fund. The White House and State Department did not respond to requests for comment.</p><p> And while the specifics are not all known, it is already clear that US efforts to address climate change could be affected on a number of fronts.</p><p> Federal grantsOn Jan 27, the Office of Management and Budget ordered a pause on almost all federal grants and loans, saying it was necessary to root out \"DEI (diversity, equity and inclusion), woke gender ideology and the Green New Deal\". </p><p> There is no such policy as the Green New Deal, but that language was clearly meant as a broadside attack on federal support for renewable energy projects. By Jan 29, the White House had rescinded that order, creating more confusion.</p><p> But the scope of climate- and energy-related programmes that could still be affected by such a freeze is vast, and includes several clean-energy programmes and efforts working to limit pollution.</p><p> Foreign aidAfter a Trump executive order, Secretary of State Marco Rubio announced a 90-day freeze on almost all foreign aid. </p><p> The stop-work order affected scores of programmes around the world. Some projects have received waivers that will allow them to continue operating. </p><p> But officials have already warned that programmes focused on managing the impact of climate change will be permanently cut.</p><p> \"It's astonishing,\" said the leader of a climate resilience non-profit that receives US funding, and declined to speak publicly to avoid possible retribution. \"The gut reaction is just bewilderment.\"</p><p> Already, the non-profit, which operates in Latin America, Europe and the South Pacific, was making plans to lay off staff and wind down programmes aimed at helping the developing world adapt to rising seas and extreme heat.</p><p> \"We've never seen anything like it in 30 years of foreign aid,\" the non-profit leader said. \"What are they trying to do? Is it just to provoke chaos'\"</p><p> Fuel economy rulesOn Jan 28, newly confirmed Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy signed an order seeking to roll back fuel economy standards for automakers that had been set by the Biden administration. The move could result in more tailpipe emissions from cars and trucks, and slow the adoption of electric vehicles (EVs).</p><p> Wind powerOne of Mr Trump's first executive orders targeted wind energy. The move brought an immediate halt to all leasing of federal lands and waters for new wind farms, and directed federal agencies to stop issuing permits for all wind farms anywhere in the country for the time being.</p><p> Wind projects already under construction are unlikely to be affected for now. But some projects that were far along in the development process and awaiting final approvals may be scuttled.</p><p> Electric vehiclesAnother executive order signed on Mr Trump's first day in office targeted EVs. A tax credit for people buying EVs was scrapped, and federal funds intended to help install charging stations were put on hold.</p><p> While some funds that have been allocated for charging stations are still expected to be used, the moves are likely to slow the development of the EV industry in the US, and help Mr Trump's ally, Tesla CEO Elon Musk. While Tesla is the largest EV maker in the country, it has its own network of fast chargers and stands to benefit if rival networks are slow to be built.</p><p> Some climate funding  could surviveA Trump executive order targeting clean energy investments could affect the Department of Energy's Loan Programme Office, which under the Biden administration awarded US$107.6 billion in loans and loan guarantees to help bring new energy technologies to market. But more than US$60 billion of that has been finalised and would be hard for the Trump administration to claw back.</p><p> Companies that had received loan commitments from the agency say they are unsure when they might start receiving payments, though some pointed out that the agreements are legally binding and cannot simply be abandoned at will.</p><p> \"We do have a contract with the government,\" said Mr Andy Marsh, CEO of Plug Power, a company that aims to convert renewable electricity into hydrogen fuels. In January, the Biden administration finalised a US$1.66 billion loan guarantee with Plug Power to build a hydrogen facility in Texas and several more after that.

you intended and also turn on the fan -- doing this conserves energy, too.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The \"hybrid cooling\" solution was piloted at an office space in the Zero Energy Plus Building at the BCA Academy in Singapore.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Over 11 weeks, the office occupants were exposed to two indoor conditions -- the office cooled to 26.5 deg C with ceiling fans running, and the space cooled to 24 deg C. </p><p> In the study published in 2023, they said that they found their comfort levels were similar in both scenarios.</p><p> As a bonus, the air-con plus fan method used 30 per cent less energy.</p><p> The pilot was led by the Berkeley Education Alliance for Research in Singapore.</p><p> One of its faculty members is Professor Stefano Schiavon, who highlighted the findings of the pilot in his lecture at the First Global Heat Health Information Network (GHHIN) South-east Asia Heat Health Forum on Jan 7. </p><p> He is professor of architecture and civil and environmental engineering at the University of California, Berkeley.</p><p> Using fans with air-con was one of numerous solutions that were discussed at the four-day conference, as heat health scientists, weather experts and policymakers convened to find ways to protect people living in a sweltering South-east Asia amid rising temperatures.</p><p> Other solutions discussed include setting up national heat action plans and promoting ground-up efforts that can help vulnerable communities and remote villages stay safe. </p><p> In 2023 and 2024, many South-east Asian regions were hit by severe heatwaves during the hotter months, with heat-related deaths reported in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines.</p><p> While less visible than other problems, the dangers of heat are far more wide-ranging, including reduced productivity and economic loss, accidents at work and poorer mental health.</p><p> And yet, many countries' responses to extreme heat are often not as advanced as for other disasters like typhoons, landslides and floods. </p><p> The recently launched South-east Asia Hub under the GHHIN -- housed at the National University of Singapore Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine -- aims to coordinate a regional response to rising heat. </p><p> The sweltering conditions in the region are also exacerbated by the development of cities and buildings, leading to the urban heat island effect as roads and buildings retain the sun's heat. </p><p> This makes urban places much hotter than their surrounding rural areas. </p><p> Professor of urban climate Winston Chow of Singapore Management University noted that the urban heat island effect is stronger in Asian cities than in those in the Americas or Europe. </p><p> \"The likely reason speaks to the rapid urbanisation in terms of population growth and development that has occurred within the East, South and South-east Asian cities. </p><p> \"In Singapore, about 50 per cent of the increased temperature arises from urban development,\" he said. </p><p> Prof Chow added that even the best designed and well-thought-out heat action plans or climate resilience plans require not just political will, but also financial resources and backing. </p><p> He noted that much of climate finance is still directed towards mitigation, that is, carbon emission reduction efforts. \"More investments towards heat adaptation measures are sorely needed,\" he said.</p><p> One point that was repeated throughout the Forum was the need to keep potential solutions to heat stress applicable across different countries and circumstances. </p><p> Professor Ollie Jay, a heat and health expert from the University of Sydney, emphasised that solutions have to be affordable and scalable, especially for those in the construction and agricultural sectors.</p><p> He said: \"It's important to keep in mind that the interventions that we test are widely applicable to the most vulnerable. Often, people really want to (look at) cool tech and fancy cooling vests. That's completely useless to a large proportion of the population.\"</p><p> Prof Jay cited the use of fans, shade and misting as examples of simple, scalable interventions.</p><p> On the other hand, some solutions cannot be applied in all situations.</p><p> Prof Jay said fans can be a good cooling measure in a highly humid place up to 38 deg C. But in a hot, dry region at 45 deg C and above, fans triple the rate of overheating.</p><p> Fans help sweat evaporate, providing relief. In dry conditions, a person does not sweat, and blowing hot air on the skin would make him feel hotter, increasing strain on the heart as well.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-9DFEB1Q</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DVR-NR13-S4NW-P3FP-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-01-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"746\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The undisclosed agreement has raised the Cook Islands\u2019 tensions with New Zealand, with which it has constitutional ties. Western nations, including Australia and the US, share Wellington\u2019s concerns about Beijing\u2019s growing influence in the Pacific region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        The Cook Islands were a dependent colony of New Zealand from 1901 to 1965. Afterward, they decided to become a self-governing nation in \u201cfree association\u201d with New Zealand. In 2001, they signed a Joint Centenary Declaration, which committed the parties to \u201cconsult regularly on defence and security issues\u201d. Based on this agreement, Wellington expected the Brown government to disclose the details of the proposed agreement.\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Cook Islands Prime Minister Mark Brown addresses the media during a press conference of the Green Climate Fund (GCF) in Bonn, Germany, on 5 October 2023.</p><p>                        The Cook Islands comprise 15 islands with a total population of 15,000 and an approximate land area of 236.7 square kilometres. The nation is situated halfway between New Zealand and Hawaii. These 15 islands are dispersed over about 2,000,000 square kilometres (770,000 square miles) of the South Pacific Ocean. Cook Islanders hold New Zealand passports. Regarding currency, the nation has its own banknotes and coins but officially uses the New Zealand dollar.</p><p>                        Brown, in power since 2020, has sparked a second controversy with New Zealand in a short period. Just weeks ago, he dropped the idea of issuing separate passports for Cook Islanders after Wellington insisted that the Pacific nation first revoke New Zealand passports.</p><p>                        A month before Brown\u2019s visit to China, New Zealand began requesting the details of the proposed agreement. Wellington\u2019s deputy prime minister and foreign minister, Winston Peters, made a phone call followed by a letter highlighting the need for transparency and proper consultation, citing the constitutional ties between the two sides, which include obligations to consult on defence and security matters. Brown set aside these concerns and proceeded with the agreement.\u00a0</p><p>                        Brown regarded the Cook Islands-New Zealand relationship as reciprocal, rather than one that requires the Cook Islands to seek permission from New Zealand.</p><p>Cook Islands expectations of a \u2018reciprocal\u2019 relationship from New Zealand</p><p>                        He stated, \u201cThere is no need for New Zealand to sit in the room with us while we are discussing our comprehensive agreement with China.\u201d He added that because there were no clauses related to security or loans, consultation with Wellington did not fall under the Centenary Declaration of 2001. Brown regarded the Cook Islands-New Zealand relationship as reciprocal, rather than one that requires the Cook Islands to seek permission from New Zealand.\u00a0</p><p>                        In Avarua (the capital of the Cook Islands, located in Rarotonga, the largest and most populous island), some locals termed New Zealand\u2019s attitude as \u201cbullying\u201d, whereas opposition MP Teariki Heather opposed any agreement that could affect relations with New Zealand. He also organised a protest and submitted a motion of no confidence, which was unlikely to succeed due to a lack of support.\u00a0</p><p>Cook Islands\u2019 Prime Minister Mark Brown visits National Deep Sea Centre in Qingdao, China, in this picture released on 12 February 2025.</p><p>                        In China, Brown engaged in extensive discussions covering various topics, including investment, tourism, ocean science, aquaculture, agriculture, infrastructure (such as transport), climate resilience, disaster preparedness, creative industries, technology and innovation, education and scholarships, and people-to-people exchanges. He also sought China\u2019s assistance in acquiring new vessels to replace ageing ships for inter-island connectivity and in supporting seabed mineral development.</p><p>                        He reiterated his support for the \u201cone China\u201d policy, which should have appeased Beijing amid tense cross-strait relations. China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs downplayed the hype regarding Brown\u2019s visit, terming the country\u2019s relationships with both the Cook Islands and New Zealand as friendly.\u00a0</p><p>                        New Zealand contributed the most, US$219 million, while China, the second-largest donor, gave US$112 million \u2014 more than double Australia\u2019s share.</p><p>                        Economic opportunities and aid from China</p><p>                        China established diplomatic relations with the Cook Islands in 1997 and elevated them to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2018. Between 2008 and 2022, the Cook Islands received US$517 million in foreign aid. New Zealand contributed the most, US$219 million, while China, the second-largest donor, gave US$112 million \u2014 more than double Australia\u2019s share. China\u2019s grants and loans have been utilised for public infrastructure development, such as the courthouse, police station, and agricultural equipment, for public events like the Pacific Mini Games, and in constructing the arena that hosted them. In partnership with New Zealand, China also helped build Te Mato Vai, a large-scale water infrastructure project to replace the Cook Islands\u2019 old water network.\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>US President Joe Biden chats with President of Kiribati Taneti Maamau as Prime Minister of the Cook Islands Mark Brown stands next to them while Pacific Island nation leaders pose for a group photograph during a summit at the White House in Washington, US, on 25 September 2023.</p><p>                        Among Western nations, New Zealand initially took a moderate approach to China\u2019s rise but became increasingly concerned after Beijing\u2019s 2022 policing deals with the Solomon Islands and Kiribati. New Zealand\u2019s then Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern termed those agreements \u201cgravely concerning\u201d.\u00a0</p><p>                        ... China\u2019s growing influence in the Pacific region has brought the US back to the region.</p><p>US\u2019s attention turns to the Pacific region</p><p>                        Most importantly, China\u2019s growing influence in the Pacific region has brought the US back to the region. In February 2023, the US reopened its embassy in Honiara, the capital of the Solomon Islands, after nearly three decades, and in May of the same year, in Nuku\u2019alofa, the capital of Tonga. Washington also plans to open an embassy in Kiribati.\u00a0</p><p>                        Over 70% of the Cook Islands\u2019 economy relies on tourism, which was severely impacted during the Covid-19 outbreak. During this time, the Pacific nation chose to diversify its economy. China, the largest source of tourism globally and the second-largest economy, emerged as a natural option.\u00a0</p><p>                        On the other hand, for a resource-hungry China, the Cook Islands are a natural attraction as well. Although the Pacific nation\u2019s total land area is small, due to the sparse distribution of 15 islands in the vast Pacific Ocean, it possesses a huge area under its exclusive economic zone. This vast ocean area is rich in polymetallic nodules containing essential metals such as manganese, cobalt, nickel and copper, all of which are necessary for technologies ranging from electric vehicles to advanced weapon systems.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0</p><p>                        Prime Minister Brown has said that \u201cthere is nothing to worry about\u201d and has made the agreement public as promised. Even so, the Pacific region may still become another theatre of rivalry between China on one side and the US-led New Zealand, Australia, and the West on the other.</p><p>                        Related: Geopolitical tug of war an opportunity for Pacific Island nations | China gearing up for intense competition in the Pacific | Uniquely New Zealand: How NZ maintains integrity amid great power rivalry</p><p>                        The Cook Islands flag being waved by the nation\u2019s Olympic team from a boat during the opening ceremony of the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THNKCH-5893694</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THNKCH2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F5T-XK33-RS16-K3T4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470736</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1395\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

One promising avenue is energy trade -- a transformative mechanism to bridge energy inequities and drive sustainable growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Across Asia and the Pacific, more than 350 million people grapple with unreliable electricity, while 150 million live entirely without it, according to the Asian Development Bank. This disparity in energy access highlights systemic inequalities that hinder progress in agriculture, manufacturing and broader development. </p><p> Tackling these issues requires new ways of collaborating with governments, corporates and society, aligning with the WEF's 2025 sub-theme of reimagining growth.</p><p> The green energy paradoxSouth-east Asia, one of the most vulnerable regions to climate change, finds itself at a critical juncture. Energy demands in the region are projected to triple by 2050, straining existing systems and exacerbating development divides. Can regional energy trade offer a pathway to sustainable development while addressing economic growth and climate resilience'</p><p> South-east Asia is blessed with renewable energy potential estimated to be 40 to 50 times its current total electricity generation. The abundance of solar, wind, hydropower and geothermal resources presents a clear path to clean, sustainable energy. Yet, it trails behind other regions in transitioning to renewables. </p><p> Fossil fuels dominate energy production as South-east Asia balances economic development demands with the need for decarbonisation. The sluggish renewable transition stems from infrastructure gaps, inconsistent policy support and limited access to financing. </p><p> Ensuring a \"just transition\" -- one that protects vulnerable communities during the shift from fossil fuels -- adds another layer of complexity.</p><p> This paradox highlights a crucial question: How can the region move beyond these barriers and embrace cross-border energy trade and investment to fast-track an equitable energy transition'</p><p> Strong government action, robust policy frameworks and regional cooperation are vital to overcoming the current inertia. It is not just about scaling up clean energy projects, but also ensuring that the transition benefits everyone.</p><p> By enabling the efficient sharing of renewable energy resources across borders, energy trade can break down systemic barriers and unlock South-east Asia's potential for sustainable development.</p><p> The Lao PDR-Thailand-Malaysia-Singapore Power Integration Project offers a compelling blueprint for how regional green energy trade can drive sustainable development. Launched in 2022, it marks South-east Asia's first multilateral electricity trading framework, setting a precedent for cross-border collaboration in renewable energy.</p><p> Under phase one, Singapore imported up to 100 megawatts of hydropower from Laos through Thailand and Malaysia. This project showcases the benefits of regional connectivity: Laos leverages its rich hydropower resources for economic growth, Singapore diversifies its energy supply and lowers its carbon emissions, while Thailand and Malaysia earn revenue by facilitating grid connections. </p><p> If the negotiations to extend this four-nation power project succeed, energy trade could potentially double, with additional supply coming from Malaysia.</p><p> The Laos-Vietnam Renewable Energy Cooperation, established in 2016 with the commissioning of the Xekaman 1 hydropower plant, highlights the potential of regional collaboration in green energy trade. </p><p> By October 2023, Vietnam Electricity had signed 19 power purchase agreements to import over 2.6 gigawatts (GW) from 26 of Laos' hydropower plants. This collaboration boosts Vietnam's energy security and advances its renewable energy goals while promoting sustainable development in the region. </p><p>Singapore is setting the momentum for more regional energy trade, with a goal to import around 6 GW of low-carbon electricity by 2035, up from the initial target of 4 GW. The Energy Market Authority has issued conditional approvals to 10 projects to import low-carbon electricity from Australia, Cambodia, Indonesia and Vietnam. Five projects were awarded conditional licences, marking a significant step toward enhanced regional energy connectivity. </p><p> Private sector steps upThe private sector is increasingly recognising the economic and business opportunities in renewable energy and cross-border electricity projects. </p><p> According to a report by McKinsey and the Economic Development Board, to achieve net zero by 2050, the region must increase renewable capacity by seven to 12 times from its 2018 to 2021 levels. Currently, only 3 per cent of this target capacity is under construction.</p><p> Corporates must strive to be bold and innovative for renewables to leap forwards, driving bankable, commercially viable clean energy initiatives. By contributing to the broader green transition through impactful and scalable initiatives, businesses can thrive while advancing sustainable growth for all.</p><p> Finally, there is an urgent need to establish robust market mechanisms to attract capital for renewable energy projects. While capital is widely available across the region, the challenge is building investor confidence and creating conditions that make cross-border energy trade and green electricity projects compelling investment opportunities. </p><p> Currently, investors hesitate to commit capital, citing risks such as infrastructure gaps and regulatory uncertainty. Governments must provide regulatory certainty through clear, consistent policies resilient to political and macroeconomic changes. Effective mandates and subsidies can further stimulate demand and encourage renewable energy adoption at scale.</p><p> The private sector can also manage risks within its control, such as securing land and bridging infrastructure gaps. These measures, combined with public-private sector collaboration, can unlock the large-scale renewable energy projects that South-east Asia urgently needs. </p><p> Ultimately, the success of South-east Asia's energy transition hinges on its ability to create and optimise new avenues of growth. By enabling regional energy trade, the region can turn ambition into action -- creating a sustainable development model that addresses today's energy demands, drives job creation and secures a resilient future for generations to come.</p><p> The writer is managing director at RGE, a global enterprise operating in the bio-based resources and energy sectors.

About 60 per cent of the global population resides in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p> So, a larger number of people will potentially be affected by heatwaves, said Dr Rodriguez. </p><p> Heat can affect people of all ages but workers, such as farmers and those toiling away in construction sites, ports and non-air-conditioned factories, are especially at risk because of long exposure to rising temperatures. </p><p> In a 2024 report, the International Labour Organisation (ILO) said workers in already hot climates will face ever more dangerous conditions. The ILO said workplace exposure to excessive heat in the Asia-Pacific was above the global average, affecting 74.7 per cent of the workforce. </p><p> But heat can also affect communities indirectly by worsening existing health conditions and causing food and water insecurity. </p><p> \"There is nothing better than early warning and early action because it saves lives and saves livelihoods,\" Dr Rodriguez said in the latest episode of The Straits Times' Green Pulse podcast. </p><p> \"That's the reason why action to prepare for and respond to heat is one of our top, most important priorities for IFRC in this region.\" </p><p> There are varied early responses to a heatwave. </p><p> These could include providing mobile cooling stations with air-conditioning or ice baths, supplying safe drinking water and distributing cash grants to vulnerable communities to help them meet basic needs. </p><p> \"The rationale for providing grants is to compensate for the salary loss for not working during heatwaves,\" said Dr Rodriguez. </p><p> \"We are targeting vulnerable populations, such as the elderly, people with existing medical conditions that might be exacerbated by heat, and exposed groups like outdoor workers.\"</p><p> The IFRC has a network of 191 Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in different countries and jurisdictions. There are 38 national Red Cross and Red Crescent societies in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p> Dr Rodriguez said that while IFRC societies have had a \"long tradition\" of responding to emergencies such as floods and droughts, heat is an emerging area for them. </p><p> Early action plans for heat were activated in a number of IFRC national societies in 2024, including the Bangladesh Red Crescent Society in April.  </p><p> \"So we are trying to build capacity within our national societies to respond to heat, and also working with other agencies in a more coordinated manner,\" Dr Rodriguez added.</p><p> He said that during a heatwave, many different sectors and people are affected, which is why coordination is needed. </p><p> Schools may be closed, so there is a need to coordinate with the affected country's education ministry, he said. </p><p> At the same time, wages might be affected, so there is a need to coordinate with social development agencies, he added.</p><p> \"Moreover, heatwaves can be included in early warning systems, so coordination with meteorological agencies is needed,\" Dr Rodriguez explained. </p><p> \"The magnitude of the impact can be beyond the capacity of a single agency, so coordination with other humanitarian and development organisations is needed for coherent, consistent and technically sound preparedness and response.\" </p><p> Other areas that need to be worked out include defining what a heatwave is, as the threshold for declaring one would depend on each country and context, and developing a threshold for when early action plans kick in. </p><p> \"Something important for us to try to understand is what the best options are when temperatures start to near the thresholds, and when these thresholds are exceeded,\" he said. </p><p> \"For example, if we are going beyond the wet bulb physiological thresholds, it is not going to be sufficient to get affected people to drink water or stay under shade. We need external cooling systems in place.\" </p><p> The wet bulb globe temperature is a measure of heat stress that accounts for not just air temperature, but also humidity, wind speed and solar radiation.</p><p> He noted that air-conditioning systems can worsen the heat problem, especially if they are powered by fossil fuels. Energy grids in certain areas can also collapse during a heatwave when many people turn on their air-cons at the same time. </p><p> \"This is a challenge for us now -- we know that for our response, we need to have our own off-grid, clean energy options,\" he said, adding that the IFRC has committed to \"green response\" efforts to reduce the network's emissions. </p><p> At the UN climate change conference COP29 held in November 2024, the IFRC joined a number of UN agencies, including the UN Office on Disaster Risk Reduction and the World Meteorological Organisation, in highlighting the importance of early warning and early action as a way of reducing the toll that climate disasters are having on communities. </p><p> During COP29, IFRC secretary-general Jagan Chapagain also outlined plans to mobilise EUR530 million (S$746 million) through the Global Climate Resilience Platform for urban preparedness work on extreme heat, aiming to reach 100 million people in 100 cities by 2027. </p><p> South-east Asia's heat problem was also highlighted in early January at the First Global Heat Health Information Network South-east Asia Heat Health Forum in Singapore. </p><p> The forum marked the first time that experts across the heat response chain -- from humanitarian organisations to weather scientists and medical professionals -- convened under the global network to discuss South-east Asia's heat challenges and potential solutions. </p><p> One of the hub's main aims is to coordinate the regional response to rising temperatures.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Workers, such as those in construction, are especially at risk because of long exposure to rising temperatures.

With a focus on fintech, AI, sustainability, and emerging technologies, the firm is playing a crucial role in shaping the region's startup ecosystem.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This year, Kickstart is doubling down on AI-powered software, consumer/retail, construction tech, and cleantech-areas that align with the evolving needs of Southeast Asia's rapidly transforming markets. But beyond capital, Kickstart offers deep strategic value, leveraging its corporate connections to help startups scale.</p><p>In this Q&amp;A, e27 speaks with Kickstart's women leaders-Managing Partner and co-founder Minette Navarrete, General Partner Joan Yao, Head of Communications Celina Durante, and Strategic Partnership Manager Piazza Bernal-on the firm's investment philosophy, the unique opportunities and challenges in Southeast Asia, and how they balance financial returns with long-term impact. These female leaders explore their perspectives on gender diversity in venture capital, the evolving role of women in leadership, and the barriers female founders face when raising capital.</p><p>Edited excerpts below:</p><p>AI and fintech are rapidly transforming industries-how does Kickstart assess the long-term viability of startups in these fast-evolving sectors?</p><p>Joan Yao: In an ideal world, every company would have a moat-a sustainable and compounding competitive advantage that would keep it ahead of the competition. Sometimes, companies have this through technology, e.g., proprietary data or algorithms, which enable better or more accurate recommendations. Sometimes, it's through exclusive, long-term contracts.</p><p>However, a moat alone isn't what leads to success. Having a good team that can execute with speed and quality is equally important. Having a product that customers love and that is responsive to customers' needs and feedback is also crucial.</p><p>Lastly, ensuring cost-competitive pricing (usually through tight operational efficiency) is key to acquiring and retaining customers.</p><p>Over time, excellent execution, product love, and pricing competitiveness could lead to scale, which also becomes a moat in itself.</p><p>Minette Navarrete: It's important to understand the transformative power of fintech and AI and thus appreciate the necessity of responsible investing, backing startups and founders with robust ethical and moral foundations. We have seen technological innovation yield unintended consequences-it matters that our due diligence considers the potential for both positive uses and potential abuses.</p><p>In addition to Joan's points, we look at the timing of startups we consider for investment. Too early an entry will mean struggling to gain adoption and traction; too late, and the market might be too crowded to allow profitable ventures.</p><p>How does Kickstart balance financial returns with long-term impact, particularly in sustainability and deeptech?</p><p>Joan Yao: Venture Capital is, by nature, an asset class where returns are measured over 10, 15, or even 20 years. It's important-particularly during troughs in the cycle-not to lose sight of a business's vision and long-term potential.</p><p>Kickstart has had the privilege of investing in some amazing companies in the sustainability and deeptech space:</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/growing-sea-startups-with-kickstart-ventures-20240813/\">Growing SEA startups with Kickstart Ventures</url></p><p>Clarity is a US-based company that enables accurate air quality monitoring affordably and at scale in over 85 countries worldwide; Roslin Technologies is a UK-based company that applies innovative biotechnologies to develop superior cells for the production of cultivated meat; Transcelestial is a Singapore-based company that develops laser communications technology for telecommunications, defence, and space applications.</p><p>For founders, it's crucial to assemble a diverse group of like-minded investors with the conviction and capacity to support the company through the market and business ups and downs.</p><p>However, vision alone is not enough. Founders also need to work on fundamentals, e.g. unit economics, product velocity, sales pipeline, etc., because the potential has to be matched by the performance over time.</p><p>Minette Navarrete: Equally important to long-term impact are supporting people, nurturing talent, and creating space for innovation that requires time for adoption at scale. Science-based sectors like deeptech, sustainability, climate resilience, and social inclusion can solve deeply rooted issues. Still, teams working on these wicked problems need patient capital to fund development, deployment, and wider distribution.</p><p>In this respect, corporate venture capital offers both funding and connections to industry and commercial contracts with enterprises.</p><p>What unique challenges and opportunities do startups in the Philippines and Southeast Asia face compared to other global ecosystems, and how is Kickstart addressing them?</p><p>Minette Navarrete: SEA's tech ecosystem is young. While different countries have technical industries like manufacturing, food processing, mining, assembly, etc., there hasn't been a long history of startups and venture capital. The talent pool is still developing.</p><p>However, we can see the community evolving: ten years ago, we'd refer to the early waves of startup founders as 'expats and repats'-individuals who acquired their education and experience from overseas (mainly the West). We are now seeing homegrown founders solving big problems and building high-performing teams in the region.</p><p>Joan Yao: To add to Minette's response, in the Philippines and generally Southeast Asia, there is a lower GDP per capita compared to other countries and a lack of infrastructure to support digitisation outside of metro areas, such as logistics and connectivity. The exit landscape also still needs time to develop.</p><p>But the region presents many opportunities. We see an emerging middle class and a young population, a demand for new and better-value offerings for goods and services such as healthcare, financial services, and consumer goods, and shifts in energy and agriculture.</p><p>We also have to recognise the Philippine diaspora as an opportunity. About 10 million Filipinos overseas are also consumers and send money back home to their families. Companies in our portfolio can serve and earn money from this by giving them what they need, whether it's content that connects them to their communities, financial services that make it easier for them to save, invest, and send money, or goods and services that take into account their higher purchasing power.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/echelon-philippines-2024-beyond-traditional-frameworks-with-minette-navarrete-of-kickstart-ventures-20241023/\">Echelon Philippines 2024: Beyond traditional frameworks with Minette Navarrete of Kickstart Ventures</url></p><p>Minette Navarrete: Building on Joan's point regarding lower GDP per capita, that context is helpful for creating a mentality of efficiency and frugality. Even this applies beyond SEA-low-cost operations apply and appeal to the entire emerging markets group and, in fact, in many sectors of even developed world populations, especially helpful in economically challenging times!</p><p>Venture capital remains male-dominated globally. How do you see the role of women evolving in VC, and what needs to change to create more inclusive leadership?</p><p>Joan Yao: I'm definitely seeing more and more women at the analyst, associate, and VP levels in VC. While there are still way more male Partners in VC than female Partners, I'm gradually seeing more females in leadership roles.</p><p>Some LPs require more diversity in management and decision-making, which is a crucial step in creating more inclusive leadership. I'd like to think that there are also more progressive GPs who seek out female partners and don't limit themselves to just working with their bros. I also know a few women who have started their own funds, which is something I'd like to see more of in the coming years.</p><p>Minette Navarrete: There's a compelling business case for diverse teams - a 2023 McKinsey study indicates that companies in the top quartile for gender and ethnic diversity are likely to outperform the bottom quartile; and companies in the bottom quartile are 66 per cent more likely to underperform companies in the top quartile.</p><p>While the study focused on gender and ethnicity, we posit that team diversity in age/generation, education, work experience, and individual strengths will also create better cultures for problem-solving, conscious communication, and maybe even conflict resolution-all critical in high-risk innovation ventures.</p><p>Have you encountered gender-specific challenges in your career, and how have those experiences shaped your leadership and investment philosophy?</p><p>Joan Yao: I always tell younger female VCs not to 'out-bro' their male colleagues. Since VC is a male-dominated industry, there tends to be a lot of deal sharing (or dealmaking) that happens over long drinking sessions or on the golf course (or pickleball court).</p><p>As a female, you have to find your own style and strategy for deal sourcing and dealmaking - you can't 'out-bro' a bro! Personally, I focus on building authentic relationships with my founders and providing support by sharing experiences, insights, or connections.</p><p>Pia Bernal: Personally, none. Kickstart Ventures is my fourth stop, and I've had both male and female bosses. I was exposed to leadership and management styles that recognised me for my skills and the results I delivered first.</p><p>As I grew my career and acquired more decision-making authority, I took a leaf out of their leadership books, became blind to gender, and looked at a colleague's ability to work in teams. However, I also realised that once you gain more control over decisions or situations, it is important to be a steward for your female colleagues by looking out for them and encouraging them to raise their hands more.</p><p>Celina Durante: All the gender-specific challenges I've experienced only made me value diversity more. Especially in a role where creativity is crucial, the coming together of individuals with different perspectives and backgrounds should be welcomed. This insight was instrumental to my work dynamics with the team. I look at the strengths of my colleagues and try to nurture and work with them.</p><p>This serves as a learning opportunity for me to try different approaches that work, which also helps me become agile as a leader. The goal is to help people become better versions of themselves, individuals who have unique things to offer and who are happy and proud of what they can contribute.</p><p>What challenges do women entrepreneurs face in securing VC funding?</p><p>Joan Yao: I find that women, in general, don't like to overstate or overclaim. They'd usually rather err on the conservative side than sell a bold vision without the evidence to back it up.</p><p>In reality, this is probably healthier and more achievable; however, in VC land, where investors are always looking for hockey-stick growth / the next rocket ship story, the 'realistic' storyteller may be at a disadvantage.</p><p>At Kickstart, over 60 per cent of the companies we've invested in have women as co-founders or in leadership roles. The women founders and leaders we've invested in have inspired us with their passion - they typically have a deep personal connection to the problem they're trying to solve; they've also convinced us with their experience and competence - typically, these women leaders have had years, if not decades, of experience in their relevant field.</p><p>In conclusion: don't shy away from the big vision - believe in yourself and what you're trying to achieve, and don't sell yourself short. But also, let your passion, competence, and experience shine. Be confident!</p><p>Minette Navarrete: There's an oft-repeated truism that women won't apply for a role unless they can check 10/10 of the requirements: we do see this self-selection at work, where the pitches we receive are very disproportionately not women founders. And even as the companies we eventually invest in have women in the founder and/or leadership positions, it'll require risk-taking and support from other founders and leaders to create circles of trust and mutual support, and hopefully, we'll see many more diverse teams pitching to us!</p><p>Pia Bernal: A female founder once messaged me on LinkedIn asking if there were female founders/leaders groups that she could join. I felt bad that I couldn't immediately think of one that was active and a good fit for her. In my over a decade of ecosystem building and engagement, the Philippine startup ecosystem has never lacked women's participation in the tech space.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/2022-wrap-up-insights-learnings-and-strategies-for-the-future-20230122/\">Kickstart Ventures' insights, learnings and strategies for the future</url></p><p>However, there has to be a significant shift in roles - more women as Startup Founders and C-Suite Leaders in tech startups and less preoccupied with startup ecosystem enabler roles, i.e. community managers, hackathon organisers, etc.</p><p>What is your vision for the future of women in entrepreneurship and leadership?</p><p>Minette Navarrete: I imagine the ideal future is one where we don't need articles and interviews like this to advocate for diversity, equity, and inclusion because it would simply be the norm that women and men would have access and opportunities in equal measure! But we aren't there yet, so here we are.</p><p>McKinsey has been running studies to understand gender diversity since 2015, I think, and they show that not only is there an advantage for companies and teams in the top quartile for havingwomen in leadership, but there is an increasing penalty to not building diversity into the leadership team.</p><p>In 2020, the bottom quartile was 27 per cent more likely to underperform; in 2023, the probability of underperforming due to a lack of diversity was 66 per cent. The studies were aptly titled: 'Diversity Wins ' in 2020 and 'Diversity Matters Even More' by 2023.</p><p>Our own experience sees progress being made in entrepreneurship, at least in Kickstart's venture capital practice. In 2015, our pipeline showed that while only 11% of companies pitching to us had women as founders or leaders, we were funding disproportionately, i.e. 24 per cent of companies we funded had women as founders and leaders. Today, fully 66 per cent of the companies we fund have women as founders and/or leaders. Progress, if not perfection.</p><p>Pia Bernal: Tech startups and VCs are known for creating a future they believe in and I would love to see both a force to reckon with in mainstreaming boardroom diversity because they understand deeply that having a holistic POV on workplace management and issues is an invaluable business asset.</p><p>Celina Durante: Women in entrepreneurship and leadership to be more mainstream. It's positive progress to put a spotlight on women leaders, but there is a need to elevate the narrative to focus on milestones, contributions, and best practices that people can emulate. Of course, along the way, we need initiatives/programs that could help us reach that point, but imagine a world where women are celebrated all year round, where being a woman is not a handicap. After all, an individual is more than just their gender, and we have so much to learn from everyone if we look past their gender.</p><p>How can we encourage more women to enter venture capital and leadership roles?</p><p>Joan Yao: The tennis world is abuzz, as 19-year-old Filipina Alex Eala has blazed her way through the Miami Open, defeating World #2 Iga Swiatek in the quarterfinals. Before Alex, Maricris Gentz was the highest-ranked Filipina tennis player (284th in the world). In 2021, the female weightlifter Hidilyn Diaz won the Philippines' very first Olympic Gold Model at the Tokyo Olympics. It always seems impossible until it's done.</p><p>Representation and visibility matter. Seeing more women in senior leadership roles at VC funds, thriving in these roles, and getting recognised for making successful deals happen - these stories add up, and pave the way for future leaders to walk the same path, covering even greater distances in record time.</p><p>At the same time, we also need to make sure that there are policies in place to support talented female leaders and employees, e.g. parental leave, anti-discrimination/harassment, etc.</p><p>Pia Bernal: I offer two views to our readers - first, we have to keep in mind that mirroring is a powerful tool for behavioural change and so I would love to see more women leaders in the VC and tech startup spaces today accept more invitations to the stage to be seen and heard, so that the rest can see you and follow suit. I hope that they see it as their 'people' investment for the VC industry. My second view- if you find yourself working in the VC space and you've decided to stay longer - don't wait to be encouraged or wait for permission. Just do it.</p><p>Celina Durante: The community also plays an important role in encouraging more women to enter the space. We need to welcome them and give them the chance to contribute. Perhaps this is a small gesture to some, but nurturing their confidence by trusting in their capabilities makes a huge difference in influencing their self-motivation. I hear a lot of women second-guess themselves, mimicking how other people treat them. If they are able to go past that, they can be bolder in venturing out into spaces where they can make a difference.</p><p>What advice do you have for aspiring women investors and founders looking to break into the VC and startup space?</p><p>Joan Yao: In my almost 20 years of work experience, I've held five jobs. In four out of five, I had strong female leaders that I either reported to directly or worked with closely. Because of this experience, I never felt like a leadership role was out of reach, or only something reserved for men.</p><p>Also Read:  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/women-led-firms-are-15-more-likely-to-outperform-their-male-led-counterparts-helen-wong-of-ac-ventures-20250310/\">'Women-led firms are 15% more likely to outperform their male-led counterparts': Helen Wong of AC Ventures</url></p><p>What the women leaders all had in common were: (1) a strong work ethic (either first to arrive at the office, last to leave, or both); (2) the ability to forge lasting relationships with valuable partners and stakeholders; and (3) a drive to achieve and get things done - not letting doubts, naysayers, or circumstances get in the way of their goals.</p><p>Looking ahead, what are the biggest shifts you anticipate in Southeast Asia's startup and investment landscape over the next five years?</p><p>Joan Yao:</p><p>Artificial Intelligence: The past 15 years in Southeast Asia have been marked by the shift to mobile and digital; while this trend continues to play out, I also see the AI wave rolling in. Companies will need to learn how to integrate AI into their workflows and processes in order to remain competitive. I expect to see more and more companies riding on this trend over the next five years.</p><p>Middle class: As Southeast Asian economies continue to develop and mint new members of the middle class, consumer preferences will evolve. There will be greater demand for affordable luxuries (goods and services), healthcare, travel, energy, and mobility, among other things. Valuable companies will be built that cater to the needs and wants of this emerging middle class.</p><p>Exit landscape: Lastly, I think more and more Southeast Asian VC/PE investors are seeing the need to create robust public equity markets for startups to list. This would thereby create liquidity opportunities for private investors while allowing the general public and international investment managers to gain access to companies serving the needs of one of the world's fastest-growing regions.</p><p>The post  <url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/dont-out-bro-your-male-colleagues-kickstarts-women-leaders-on-gender-diversity-in-vc-20250403/\">'Don't 'out-bro' your male colleagues': Kickstart's women leaders on gender diversity in VC appeared first on</url>\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/\">e27.</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://e27.co/dont-out-bro-your-male-colleagues-kickstarts-women-leaders-on-gender-diversity-in-vc-20250403/\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXE2-ETSG119314544518626461252012108010</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ETSG-119314</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FGG-F8B3-RRSP-F116-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484239</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3309\"/><timeReceived>7:08 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

The PIF is the key regional forum in the Pacific that seeks to foster cooperation among its members and collaboration with external partners. This is the second time that Singapore is attending the PIF Leaders Meeting as a Dialogue Partner, following our admission in January 2022.</p><p>The theme of the 53rdPIF Leaders Meeting is \"Transformative ResilientPasifiki: Build Better Now\". Minister Maliki will attend the PIF Leaders' session with Dialogue Partners on 28 August 2024. He will also meet leaders from the Pacific to discuss bilateral and regional cooperation.</p><p>Minister Maliki's visit builds on the longstanding relations between Singapore and the Pacific. As fellow small island states, Singapore and the Pacific share a commitment to tackling global challenges such as climate change. At the last PIF Leaders Meeting in November 2023, Singapore launched a three-year customised \"Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing\" (SPARKS) package, which comprises courses in climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law. In May 2024, Singapore hosted the 3rdSingapore-Pacific High-Level Visit which fosters closer ties and facilitates exchange of views in areas of common interest such as climate change, sustainable development and urban planning.</p><p>. . . . .</p><p>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS</p><p>SINGAPORE</p><p>26 AUGUST 2024</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SMFAPS-444961230</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SMFAPS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CTM-9KG1-F11P-X1H3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">476773</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"259\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Government of Singapore Provided by Syndigate Media Inc.

This year, the itinerary included Namibia, the Republic of the Congo, Chad and Nigeria where Wang reaffirmed the strategic partnerships and community of a shared future in the new era with the African leaders.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        Beyond emphasising the visits\u2019 symbolism, they underscored China\u2019s long-term commitment to positioning itself as Africa\u2019s most reliable partner in an increasingly multipolar world amid heightening global power rivalries. From energy cooperation and security engagement to advancing sustainable development, Chinese foreign ministers\u2019 start-of-the-year trips reinforced the prioritised status of Africa in China\u2019s foreign policy agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">                        Since 1991 to the present, Chinese foreign ministers achieved an impressive coverage rate of 96% by visiting 51 of the 53 African nations that China maintains diplomatic ties with...</p><p>                        Breadth and depth of engagement</p><p>                        The author\u2019s research has shown that China\u2019s engagement with Africa is unrivalled in its scope and consistency. Since 1991 to the present, Chinese foreign ministers achieved an impressive coverage rate of 96% by visiting 51 of the 53 African nations that China maintains diplomatic ties with (Eswatini remains the only African country maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan). This commitment underscores China\u2019s emphasis on inclusivity and comprehensive engagement, ensuring that nearly all African nations, regardless of size or influence, are part of its foreign policy outreach.</p><p>                        Certain countries have stood out as focal points. Ethiopia and Nigeria, for instance, have each hosted Chinese foreign ministers seven times, reflecting the African countries\u2019 strategic importance. Ethiopia\u2019s role as the headquarters of the African Union and its strategic location in East Africa make it indispensable to China\u2019s regional diplomacy. Nigeria, as Africa\u2019s largest economy and a leader in infrastructure and digital innovation, serves as a cornerstone of Sino-African development relations.\u00a0</p><p>                        The graph shows the visit frequency of African countries, based on the author\u2019s own compilation.</p><p>                        Other highly visited nations include Kenya, with six visits, and Eritrea, South Africa, Namibia, Democratic Republic of the Congo (previously named Zaire) and Gabon, each receiving five visits. Additionally, countries like Egypt, Seychelles, Uganda, Chad, Republic of the Congo, Mauritius, Djibouti, Tanzania and Senegal have been visited four times each, signifying their regional or economic significance. On the other end of the spectrum, some countries, including Sierra Leone, Burkina Faso, Morocco, Algeria, Lesotho, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, and Gambia, were visited only once during this 35-year period, presenting more limited engagement.\u00a0</p><p>                        Subregional engagement further highlights Beijing\u2019s tailored approach. East Africa has seen the most visits (58), underscoring its strategic importance, particularly Ethiopia\u2019s symbolic and logistical roles. West Africa follows with 37 visits, focused on economic powerhouses like Nigeria and Senegal. Central Africa, with 28 visits, has been prioritised for its resource wealth, including oil and minerals. Southern Africa\u2019s 17 visits reflect partnerships with influential nations like South Africa and Namibia. While North Africa\u2019s 13 visits indicate limited engagement in the context of start-of-the-year African visits, the region is often framed under China\u2019s broader Arab world or Middle East diplomacy.</p><p>                        Evolution of Sino-African engagement</p><p>                        Contextualised into China\u2019s broader diplomacy and the global dynamics since 1991, the 35-year-long tradition can be divided into four phases. In the first phase (1991-2000), China turned to Africa along with Asia, Latin America and the Middle East, to rebuild global partnerships amidst Western isolation following the 1989 Tiananmen incident, as Africa at the time refrained from condemning China and became a critical region for a diplomatic breakthrough. </p><p>                        At the same time, the collapse of the Soviet Union left a strategic vacuum in Africa, creating opportunities for China to strengthen its ties with the continent. Symbolic diplomacy characterised this phase, as China focused on East and West Africa, securing vital resources like oil and minerals, and supporting independence movements. Key visits included Ethiopia, Kenya and Madagascar, highlighting China\u2019s dual focus on major players and smaller nations.</p><p>                        This phase emphasised economic diversification, with a focus on technology transfer and industrialisation alongside resource extraction. Visits to Ethiopia, Djibouti and Senegal showcased this comprehensive approach.</p><p>                        Amid the launch of the Forum on China-Africa Cooperation (FOCAC) at the end of 2000, and China\u2019s WTO accession in 2001, the next phase (2001-2010) was marked by a shift to economic engagement and multilateral cooperation. Large-scale infrastructure projects, such as railways, highways, industrial parks and ports, facilitated connectivity and ensured trade and resource flows. Partnerships with major powers like Nigeria and Angola, as well as smaller nations like Cape Verde, demonstrated a balanced strategy. This period also marked the institutionalisation of Sino-African relations under the FOCAC, demonstrating systematic and broad-based collaboration across various sectors.</p><p>                        Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi (left) shakes hands with Nigeria\u2019s Foreign Affairs Minister Yusuf Tuggar (right) during Minister Wang\u2019s diplomatic visit to Abuja on 9 January 2025.</p><p>                        The third phase (2011-2020) started in 2011, the kick-off year of China\u2019s 12th Five-Year Plan. This period witnessed China\u2019s enhanced campaign for businesses to \u201cgo overseas\u201d with the emergence of the increasing production capacity surplus at home following the 2008-2009 RMB four trillion economic stimulus. This further culminated into the unveiling of today\u2019s grand Belt and Road Initiative (BRI) in 2013, integrating Africa as a key component of its global connectivity strategy. </p><p>                        Transformative infrastructure projects, like the Addis Ababa-Djibouti Railway, deepened economic ties, while public health initiatives, including responses to the Ebola outbreak, expanded cooperation. This phase emphasised economic diversification, with a focus on technology transfer and industrialisation alongside resource extraction. Visits to Ethiopia, Djibouti and Senegal showcased this comprehensive approach.</p><p>                        ... Beijing faces increasing competition from South Korea, Japan and Western powers, which have intensified their outreach to Africa in recent years.</p><p>                        In the fourth phase from 2021 to now, the Covid-19 pandemic created new challenges and opportunities for Sino-African relations. Public health emerged as a key pillar, with China supplying vaccines, medical aid and healthcare infrastructure to support recovery. Concurrently, with increasing competition from the US, EU, Japan and South Korea in Africa, and the rise of the global south amid global power rivalries, Beijing pivoted toward renewable energy, digital infrastructure, and climate resilience, aligning with Africa\u2019s modernisation goals. </p><p>                        As China emphasised \u201cbuilding a community of shared future in the new era\u201d, China elevated its bilateral relations with all 53 diplomatically recognised African nations to the strategic partnership level in which partnerships with influential nations like Nigeria and Egypt were deepened, while localised strategies addressed the needs of smaller nations.\u00a0</p><p>                        Outlook: deepening ties amid global rivalries</p><p>                        Looking ahead, China\u2019s engagement with Africa is poised to deepen further. The September 2024 China-Africa summit aligned with the African Union\u2019s Agenda 2063 and laid the groundwork for expanded economic and investment ties, with Chinese President Xi Jinping\u2019s\u00a0pledge\u00a0of US$51 billion in funding and various new\u00a0initiatives targeting infrastructure, digitalisation and green development. </p><p>                        Africa\u2019s growing middle class, projected to exceed half a billion\u00a0by 2030, is expected to spend US$2.1 trillion by 2025 and US$2.5 trillion by 2030, presents a natural market for China\u2019s moderately priced manufactured goods, while the continent\u2019s resource wealth continues to underpin its strategic importance.</p><p>Chad\u2019s Foreign Minister Abderaman Koulamallah (centre right) meets with Minister of Foreign Affairs of China Wang Yi (centre left) at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in N\u2019Djamena on 8 January 2025.</p><p>                        However, Beijing faces increasing competition from South Korea, Japan and Western powers, which have intensified their outreach to Africa in recent years. To stay ahead, China must continue innovating its approach, emphasising mutual benefit and addressing Africa\u2019s evolving priorities.

By blending symbolism with substance, Beijing has positioned itself as a steadfast ally in Africa\u2019s development journey. As global dynamics shift, this enduring tradition serves as a reminder of China\u2019s strategic foresight and its unwavering dedication to fostering a more inclusive and multipolar world order.</p><p>                        Related: China expands footprint in Africa amid declining US security presence | China-Africa Summit: Can China and Africa achieve modernisation together?</p><p>                        A group of youth perform a dance sequence at the intersection of Parliament road during a social media video shoot in Nairobi\u2019s central business district on 17 November 2024.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">THNKCH-5809741</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">THNKCH2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F26-D663-RS9G-P1B6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">470736</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-02-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1743\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

The Ministers noted the efforts by both countries to enhance policies to reduce vehicular emissions and improve fuel standards to minimise air pollution. They agreed to continue to exchange information on such policies regularly and work closely to improve air quality in both countries.</p><p>Joint Monitoring of Water Quality in the Straits of Johor</p><p>6. The Ministers recognised that it was important to maintain good water quality in the Straits of Johor, and committed to continue the joint efforts in water quality monitoring.</p><p>Emergency Response Plan for Chemical Spill at Malaysia - Singapore Second Crossing and in East Johor Strait</p><p>7. The Ministers welcomed the 13th Chemical Spill Exercise conducted on 26 July 2023 at the Second Crossing, and highlighted that such joint exercises were important for both sides to have swift and efficient responses to chemical spill incidents. Singapore will be hosting the next chemical spill exercise in 2025.</p><p>Collaboration between Malaysia and Singapore in the Area of Oil Spill Prevention and Control in the Straits of Johor</p><p>8. The Ministers welcomed the good collaboration between Malaysia and Singapore in oil spill response, which served to minimise the impact of oil spill on the environment and biodiversity. They encouraged relevant agencies on both sides to continue the close collaboration to protect our shared environment.</p><p>Collaboration between Singapore Environment Institute (SEI) and Environment Institute of Malaysia (EiMAS)</p><p>9. The Ministers commended both institutes for their collaboration in exchanging training opportunities and resources. They encouraged both institutes to forge closer partnership to strengthen environmental capacity and awareness for officers from both countries, and to look into expanding cooperation in areas of common interest such as circular economy and climate resilience.</p><p>Progress Report on the Monitoring of the Ecology and Morphology in and around the Straits of Johor</p><p>10. The Ministers agreed for both countries to continue exchanging information on the monitoring of ecology and morphology in and around the Straits of Johor, for the purpose of conserving the marine biodiversity of both countries.</p><p>Other Matters</p><p>11. The Ministers acknowledged the MSJCE's update, noting that both countries had exchanged some information on and discussed land reclamation works affecting the environment in the Straits of Johor and their potential adverse transboundary impact. The Ministers agreed that it is important for Singapore and Malaysia to continue to fulfil their respective obligations under international law, including the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea and the 2005 Settlement Agreement. They also reaffirmed both countries' commitment to monitor, exchange information on, and discuss matters affecting the environment in the Straits of Johor.</p><p>12. As part of the MSAEV programme, the Malaysia delegation visited the Marina Barrage, the Sustainable Singapore Gallery, and Gardens by the Bay.</p><p>[Category: Investment Banking &amp; Brokerage, Financial/ Capital Market, Events, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065355368</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DHW-CBF1-JB5M-W2XG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"818\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 27, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"98\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;

He retired from the company in 2018 to focus on philanthropy. Besides the IEP, Killelea also set up The Charitable Foundation, one of Australia's largest private overseas aid donors.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Speaking at the AVPN Southeast Asia Summit 2025 on Feb 25, Killelea says peace is necessary for the human race to conquer existential challenges. \"Peace is a prerequisite for the survival of society as we know it in the 21st century. The past may have been the domain of the altruistic, but in the 21st century, it's literally in everyone's self-interest.\"</p><p>Adding to this, fellow panellist Ng Boon Heong, CEO of Temasek Foundation, underscores that peace is the bedrock of people, planet and prosperity. He cites a 2022 speech by Ho Ching, chairman of Temasek Trust: \"Without peace, children cannot go to school, and the sick cannot access medical treatment. Without peace, we cannot plan and build long-term infrastructure - not just hard infrastructure like fibre and satellite networks, but also important soft infrastructure like open and objective judicial systems, accessible and inclusive education, or a just and pragmatic transition with a future-ready workforce.\"</p><p>Ho's speech, which she delivered at the start of the Philanthropy Asia Summit 2022, goes on to include: \"Peace is rather elusive too. There is no clear blueprint for success.\"</p><p>Investing for peace</p><p>\"It's easier to start a war than to end it,\" said the late Colombian writer Gabriel Garc\u00eda M\u00e1rquez. The same can be said about investing. This week's cover story is the second in a two-part series. Last week's feature on \"investing in war\" explored the ethics of holding defence stocks amid current tensions, along with a global roundup of stock picks.</p><p>Investing in peace is complex - covering areas like international relations, health, well-being, equality and sustainability - drawing</p><p>various investors and financial institutions. This is also a follow-up to The Edge Singapore's impact investing cover story from April 2024 (Issue 1132: Impact Investing: Hero or Zero?), which explored the continuum of capital, a spectrum ranging from responsible investing to venture philanthropy.</p><p>The continuum illustrates various parties' expectations of returns, impact and risk on a sliding scale, assigning labels to multiple groups in the market today. As more institutions enter the space, however, they bring with them various mandates and preferences. Venture capital (VC) firms identifying impactful start-ups and asset managers refining their engagement strategies, for example, are blurring the distinct buckets within the continuum of capital.</p><p>This cover features some of these newer entrants and their motivations, along with innovative financing structures being adopted by the world's largest financial institutions.</p><p>Local VC to fund scholarships</p><p>Initial forays into philanthropy may serve a broader, long-term purpose for profit-driven firms. Singapore-based VC firm Trirec recently announced plans to launch its non-profit arm, promising to channel a portion of its profits into funding scholarships, bursaries, research grants, thought leadership programmes and other climate-focused non-profit organisations.</p><p>Melvyn Yeo, Trirec's founder and managing partner, says the firm is in talks with two local universities to set up scholarships and bursaries in fields like chemical engineering, material science and theoretical physics. \"The intention,\" says Yeo, \"is really to energise and excite people to go into certain fields that we feel are lacking [graduates].\"</p><p>Trirec has a mandate to invest in companies around the world that focus on decarbonisation. Since 2015, it has invested in more than 20 companies across three funds. Its first fund, which closed at US$75 million in 2022, saw three exits in Southeast Asia. Its second fund, which closed at US$80 million in 2023, saw its first unicorn, Xpansiv, a market infrastructure platform for carbon and environmental commodities.</p><p>Trirec also invested in Sunseap Group, now owned by Spanish renewable energy firm EDP Renewables; and US-based nuclear fusion designer Type One Energy. Trirec has promised to release more details on its non-profit arm soon.</p><p>In a way, the VC is also looking out for itself by identifying future founders and staffing its portfolio companies.</p><p>\"We hope to not just give out scholarships and see you later, but we hope to connect them with our start-ups and our ecosystem, where perhaps they will be doing internships,\" says Yeo. \"Hopefully, they get similarly inspired that it's not just academics, but they say, 'Oh, well, these are the possibilities.' Then hopefully, either they get a job with the start-ups, or they get inspired and go back and do research, right and maybe [form] their own start-up.\"</p><p>Catalytic investments</p><p>Another investor lays claims to the \"impact investing\" title by acting as a \"scale-up capital partner\" to growth-stage companies that are solving \"some of the world's biggest social and environmental challenges\".</p><p>Catalyst is M&amp;G's impact investing arm, launched in January 2021 with a GBP5 billion investment. M&amp;G was demerged in 2019 after two years with parent company Prudential's UK and Europe businesses.</p><p>Catalyst closed four deals in Apac last year. The firm invested approximately US$25 million ($33.56 million) into Indian water purifier manufacturer Livpure in August 2024 and US$50 million into Singapore-headquartered digital banking firm Tyme Group in December 2024. The latter is currently present in South Africa and the Philippines with over 15 million customers.</p><p>Catalyst's other investments in the region are the hyperspectral imaging start-up Pixxel and Indian commercial electric vehicle manufacturer Montra Electric.</p><p>Praveg Patil, head of Asia Pacific (Apac), impact and private equity at M&amp;G, says Pixxel is a climate play as it monitors \"critical resources\" like water, air and soil from space, and flags the impact of human expansion. \"[Pixxel] allows large customers to monitor the health of water bodies. If it's [an] offshore oil rig, you can monitor oil leaks, for example. If you're a large agri[culture] grower, you can monitor the health of soil. Same with mining, you can monitor the health of resources and biodiversity.\"</p><p>Within Apac, Patil says Catalyst's investments \"resonate very strongly\" around two themes: climate solutions and financial inclusion and access. The value proposition of the company doubles as the impact measurement metric, he adds. \"It's tightly aligned. It can't be like something like a sideshow, right? It has to be very core to what the business does.\"</p><p>Patil, who joined M&amp;G in 2011 and is now based in Singapore, divides the Apac region into four key blocs, each focusing on specific countries: Singapore and Southeast Asia; India; Australia and New Zealand; and Japan, South Korea and Taiwan. Within these regions, Patil's team is currently targeting opportunities in healthcare and supply chain resilience.</p><p>\"We think healthcare remains under-penetrated; there are still pockets of society that need that access to healthcare,\" he tells The Edge Singapore. \"There are large supply chains, which continue to get disrupted because of all the things which are happening around the world. We think there might be interesting pockets of opportunity for us to invest given the population demographic [changes] Apac is going through.\"</p><p>In many ways, Catalyst operates like a typical VC, and the impact of its investments fits a broader definition of the investing style. But Patil thinks his firm's brand name offers it a competitive edge.</p><p>Compared to how much dry powder was available among growth funds in 2021, when Catalyst was launched, Patil thinks there has been a \"flight to quality from the founder community\" towards his firm.</p><p>\"Fast-forward four years, where we've been obviously very selective, we can now stand out as probably one of the largest global impact-focused investors,\" he adds. \"What we can bring to the table is completely different from a traditional buy-side VC or a growth investor.\"</p><p>The ABCs of impact</p><p>ABC Impact, a division of Temasek Trust Asset Management, prides itself on its impact measurement capabilities. Chief impact officer Sugandhi Matta says the past year has \"reinforced\" the belief that impact must be \"tangible, measurable and deeply aligned with enterprise value\". \"It is not an abstract ideal, but a key driver of resilience, innovation and long-term growth.\"</p><p>The impact investor showcases stunning figures in its annual \"impact review\". According to the 2024 edition, released on March 27, its portfolio companies supplied some 37.9 million people with \"essential services\" under its \"better health and education\" investment theme, up 40.1% y-o-y.</p><p>Compared to ABC Impact's 2023 report, the investor provided close to 3.5 million patients with healthcare services, up 20% y-o-y; and 17.5 million students with access to digital education content, up 46% y-o-y.</p><p>Apart from health and education, ABC Impact also invests in financial and digital inclusion, climate and water solutions, and sustainable food and agriculture; each of these is backed up with its own specific metrics.</p><p>Some highlights include the 5.7 million individuals and micro-enterprises that have gained access to financial services, up 40% y-o-y; and close to 2 million metric tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions avoided, up 19% y-o-y.</p><p>\"ABC Impact commits to assessing impact with the same rigour as financial performance, ensuring that our investments deliver both measurable outcomes and sustainable value,\" says Matta.</p><p>ABC Impact launched its second impact fund in August 2023. The ABC Impact Fund II closed last year at US$600 million, double the size of its inaugural fund. In 2024, ABC Impact added two companies to its portfolio by leading an approximately US$30 million round into Aye Finance and investing US$50 million into Tekoma Energy.</p><p>Based in India, Aye Finance has assets under management (AUM) of US$600 million and 499 branches serving over half a million underbanked micro-, small- and medium-sized business owners.</p><p>Approximately 38% of its borrowers are new to credit, entering the formal financial system for the first time. Aye Finance also offers \"shakti loans\" - collateral-freefinancial products designed specifically for small, women-owned businesses. \"These loans empower women and marginalised communities by fostering entrepreneurship and driving economic growth,\" says ABC Impact.</p><p>Meanwhile, Tekoma Energy is a renewable power developer based in Tokyo, specialising in photovoltaic solar across Northern Asia. The firm is aiming for a 400-megawatt (MW) solar portfolio within four years.</p><p>\"Aye Finance is breaking barriers to financial inclusion in India, providing small and underserved businesses with access to credit, which is critical for driving local economic growth and employment,\" says chief investment officer Tan Shao Ming. \"Tekoma Energy exemplifies ABC Impact's dedication to accelerating the global energy transition. By investing in Tekoma, we are contributing to the fight against climate change while enabling cleaner, more reliable energy access across the region.\"</p><p>ABC Impact has engaged New York-based BlueMark, an independent third-party verifier, to assess and validate its impact management practices with the Operating Principles for Impact Management, a global framework. The investor says BlueMark has successfully assured both Fund I and Fund II, confirming alignment with industry best practices.</p><p>\"As global conversations around climate action, diversity and sustainability evolve, so too must the way we define and measure impact,\" says Matta. \"There is a clear shift toward pragmatic, solutions-driven approaches, particularly in Asia, where the effectiveness of impact is judged by its ability to generate economic participation and resilience.\"</p><p>Institutional clients eager to learn</p><p>Larger investors also seek more proof that their money is driving meaningful change. According to the sustainability head at UK investment firm Aberdeen Group, institutional clients are demanding greater engagement with the companies they invest in.</p><p>\"We're all becoming a bit more sophisticated, particularly around climate change, and understand it's one thing to decarbonise your portfolio, but that's just a paper reduction in emissions. What is actually important is achieving real-world emissions reductions,\" says Danielle Welsh-Rose, deputy chief sustainability officer, investments at Aberdeen.</p><p>Greater demand for engagement means more work for Aberdeen. In addition, a pushback against ESG in the US further complicates things. \"It would put more burden on engagement, particularly if we truly see - which is what we're expecting to see - US companies disclosing less around some ESG metrics,\" says Welsh-Rose, who is based in Australia. \"We know [climate change] is a material financial risk; if we don't have the disclosures that we need in a public realm from these companies, we still need to understand what they're doing, and so then the alternative is that we have to do more engagement.\"</p><p>In the midst of creating bespoke sustainability investment approaches for institutional clients, Aberdeen also advised an Australian super fund, a retirement savings scheme where employers contribute a portion of an employee's income.</p><p>In addition to putting this particular fund's equities portfolio through a climate scenario analysis framework, Aberdeen spent \"hours every week\" advising the fund managers on climate modelling, says Welsh-Rose. \"Essentially, what they're looking for is to understand whether a company would have an evaluation impairment or uplift under different climate scenarios.\"</p><p>This client has been extremely earnest in its climate journey, says Welsh-Rose. \"One of the reasons that they engaged us and not another provider was that they were really keen to get that knowledge transfer [for] their team. They have their strategy team, risk team [and] quant people in the room to really understand at the granular level, not just looking at the results [or] the end product, but understanding the process of the [climate] modelling.\"</p><p>By involving a range of staff from outside the sustainability functions, this client raised \"really gnarly questions\" that challenged Aberdeen's process and helped refine their methods, adds Welsh-Rose. \"It's definitely a two-way partnership; we both benefitted from that, and they ended up with that knowledge transfer  and they had full confidence to present that to their investment committee. They really were able to stand behind it and say: 'We understand it and we have confidence in the process, and this is investment decision-useful information.'\"</p><p>BlackRock's blended finance tie-ups</p><p>Existing stakeholders in sustainable and impact investing have also pioneered new financing structures to achieve a double bottom line. BlackRock, a pre-eminent name not only for its size as the world's largest asset manager but also for its role as a first-mover, has been at the forefront of innovative sustainable financing structures such as blended finance.</p><p>Blended finance is a strategic way to combine different types of funding from sources like governments, philanthropists and the private sector. Proponents believe bringing together money with varying risk levels helps increase private sector investment in sustainable development.</p><p>In 2022, BlackRock closed the Climate Finance Partnership (CFP), a partnership with the governments of France, Germany and Japan, alongside US impact organisations, dedicated to accelerating the flow of capital into renewable energy infrastructure across emerging markets. BlackRock announced at COP26 in November 2021 that fundraising had reached US$673 million.</p><p>Under the CFP's blended finance structure, governments contributed concessional or catalytic capital, while BlackRock brought in institutional or commercial capital. CFP's current investments include utility-scale solar in various Southeast Asian countries, Kenya's largest wind farm and an integrated renewable utility in Brazil.</p><p>While there is still some hesitation among industry players about the viability of blended finance projects, BlackRock's Heidi Yip calls the CFP a \"success story\" that serves as a precedent for future emerging market projects.</p><p>Yip joined BlackRock from GIC in February 2024, becoming head of sustainable and transition solutions for Southeast Asia. After a year in the role, Yip's job scope expanded in February to encompass the entire Asia ex-Japan region.</p><p>BlackRock has \"proven the equity case\", and it is now working on the debt capital markets, says Yip. In April 2024, BlackRock announced a partnership with the Insurance Development Forum (IDF) to mobilise insurance sector investment into climate resilience-related infrastructure. A blueprint developed by IDF seeks to create a pipeline of infrastructure projects that match insurance sector investment requirements and mobilise insurers to invest in developing \"smaller to mid-size\" infrastructure projects in developing and emerging markets.</p><p>Yip says there is a \"market gap\" in this area. \"We haven't seen capital flow into infrastructure in Southeast Asia at a level proportionate to what we have seen into developed markets.\" Speaking to The Edge Singapore, she says the hesitation by institutional clients to allocate to this market could be partly attributed to the \"real or perceived risk\" of investing in emerging markets not being commensurate with the returns.</p><p>\"Blended finance is one way where we can bring in other capital providers that are able to take more or different forms of risk, or are not looking at returns alone, but for additionality or the mobilisation of capital, or other impact. [This will] allow institutional investors to participate at the level of risk-returns that they can take on,\" says Yip.</p><p>The move also introduces Southeast Asia to institutional cli\u00adents that prefer developed market products. \"The thinking here is that once they have invested through us and understand a bit more about the market and the nature of opportunities here, then their perception of whether there is that extent of risk would be improved,\" Yip adds.</p><p>As precedent grows, so will institutional or commercial interest in such projects, reducing the reliance on the blended finance model. \"In future rounds when we are looking at similar sectors [or] geography, the amount of concessional capital needed in a blended structure would not be as high,\" says Yip.</p><p>BlackRock is also working on another blended finance debt initiative, this time with the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). At COP29 in November 2024, the two parties signed a statement of intent (SOI) with the International Finance Corporation, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Nippon Export and Investment Insurance and AIA Group to explore ways to work together on a blended finance debt initiative to attract global investors \"seeking opportunities to finance corporates' decarbonisation projects at scale in Asia with a focus on Southeast Asia\".</p><p>This \"Industrial Transformation infrastructure debt programme\" is one of the programmes under Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (Fast-P), a blended finance initiative announced by the Singapore government in December 2023. Fast-P aims to mobilise up to US$5 billion from public, private and philanthropic partners to finance transition opportunities in Southeast Asia.</p><p>Under the SOI, the parties will explore \"mutually beneficial opportunities\" to provide debt financing to private sector borrowers seeking to decarbonise their businesses, including projects in hard-to-abate sectors, technology solutions for the low-carbon transformation, and industrial opportunities.</p><p>Blended finance has been around for a long time, says Yip, but mostly implemented at the \"project level\". \"It is difficult to scale when the fund manager needs to source different pools of capital and expertise [and] also negotiate all the different terms and investment or participation objectives project by project  You can spend many years just negotiating funding, alignment of interests and objectives for one project, and then when you're done funding that, you're looking at the next project [and] it starts all over again, because you have to look for a new, different set of stakeholders.\"</p><p>The \"realisation\" that has taken place across the industry is the need for scale, adds Yip. \"What BlackRock is trying to do is create blended finance structures at the portfolio level  It provides scalability because the management of that risk and a blending of risk capital is done within the fund rather than at a project level.\"</p><p>Yip, who has worked in various public and private sector firms like Singapore's Ministry of Finance, JP Morgan, McKinsey &amp; Company and Standard Chartered Bank, says: \"The industry has taken some time to get to this stage because there haven't been many examples of this model being successfully implemented until recently.\"</p><p>Social bonds measure up</p><p>Another instrument gaining ground is the social bond, which aims to address any of five broad themes, according to Sustainable Fitch: housing, health, transport, population and finance.</p><p>\"While environmental issues like climate change and biodiversity loss have made recent gains within sustainable finance, areas of social impact - including socioeconomic development, access to essential services and the elimination of poverty and inequality - have remained a challenge for many investors,\" says analyst Jonathon Smith. \"Social impact is complex, multifaceted and subject to regional considerations, likely contributing towards a broad lack of standardisation across reporting and measurement activities.\"</p><p>Issuance has stabilised since ballooning in 2020 and 2021, when investment in social infrastructure, especially healthcare, was propelled by the Covid-19 pandemic. According to Sustainable Fitch, annual issuance has since averaged about US$175 billion for social bonds and US$158 billion for sustainability bonds, which have a combination of environmental and social use of proceeds (UOP).</p><p>Sustainable Fitch assessed some 3,500 labelled bonds with an aggregate total value of nearly US$2 trillion. Among geographies, French social bonds represent about a third of all social bonds reviewed by Sustainable Fitch. Perhaps by sheer magnitude, European issuers most consistently disclose social impact metrics, with notable alignment among issuers from France, Italy, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.</p><p>Hoping to standardise such disclosures are regulators in Canada, the European Union, South Korea and the UK, which have either begun consulting, drafting or have mandated social-related rules.</p><p>One specific development with respect to socially related debt instruments has been the emergence of the orange bond framework. Orange bonds are a subset of social bonds focusing on gender equality, in addition to existing market bond standards set by the International Capital Market Association (ICMA).</p><p>Orange bonds get their name from the colour assigned to the United Nations' fifth Sustainable Development Goal (SDG): gender equality. It aims to mobilise the global bond market to build a gender-empowered financial system that embraces inclusion by valuing the full and meaningful participation of women, girls and the LGBTQI+ community.</p><p>The Orange Bond Initiative's Steering Committee met for the first time in May 2022. Its members - the Singapore-based Impact Investment Exchange (IIX), ANZ, Nuveen, Shearman &amp; Sterling, Water.org, US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC), Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) and United Nations Capital Development Fund (UNCDF) - published the Orange Bond Principles in October 2022.</p><p>Bonds are qualified as orange by committing UOP to financing projects or products that substantially and disproportionally benefit women, girls and minorities, or by supporting enterprises that are founded or majority-owned by these groups. Among other conditions, issuers and investors using the label are required to integrate a gender lens into their investment decision-making process.</p><p>Since 2021, there has been a meaningful uptake in orange bonds, both in terms of the number of issuances and cumulative value, says Smith. The label saw its largest issuance to date in January, with Dutch public sector lender NWB Bank issuing a US$1.5 billion social bond focusing on affordable housing, categorised as orange due to its disproportionate focus on providing housing to vulnerable women.</p><p>Orange bonds 'easier sell' than climate: DBS</p><p>Social sustainability bonds that aim to improve the livelihoods of women, or \"orange bonds\", are an \"easier sell\" than their climate-related counterparts, says Taimur Baig, managing director and chief economist at DBS Bank.</p><p>Speaking at the Orange Forum 2024, held in Singapore on Dec 10, 2024, Baig says: \"[Bonds with a] climate-related lens suffer from the tragedy of the commons. If I, as a country, reduce my emissions by 20% and my neighbouring country doesn't do anything, system-wide, you could argue emissions are going down and that country is benefitting from my hard work.\"</p><p>But Baig says there is \"no such problem\" with instruments like the Women's Livelihood Bond (WLB), which IIX first launched with DBS in July 2017. \"It is about improving your absolute standards, and there is no question of the tragedy of the commons as far as gender-lens investment is concerned.\"</p><p>In December 2023, IIX issued the sixth bond in the WLB Series, the US$100 million WLB6. With a 7.25% coupon rate, the WLB6 is expected to uplift over 880,000 women and girls in the Global South, making it the largest issuance in the series so far. IIX is scheduled to issue WLB7 sometime this year, and the firm is targeting an issuance of some US$134 million.</p><p>To Baig and his team at DBS, the \"macroeconomic case\" for orange bonds is \"easy\" to understand. \"[If] you have more women in the workforce, by definition, tautologically, your potential GDP growth rate goes up.\"</p><p>This holds in specific microeconomic cases, too. Baig references a Bloomberg Intelligence (BI) report from October 2024, which suggests that companies with gender-diverse boards deliver annual returns 2% to 5% higher than those with fewer women.</p><p>According to the BI Women Capital study, the return differential between the highest and the lowest quintile of women on the board was 11% in the US, 13% in Europe and a sizeable 35% in the Asia Pacific.</p><p>\"So, why should a bank like DBS be involved in not just making money, but making money with a gender lens in mind? It's because making money becomes easier if you have a gender lens in mind,\" says Baig.</p><p>Apart from orange bonds, Sustainable Fitch expects \"additional attention on social issues\" following the September 2024 launch of the Taskforce on Inequality and Social-related Financial Disclosures (TISFD), with the United Nations Development Programme as founder partner.</p><p>The TISFD, much like its climate (TCFD) and nature (TNFD) counterparts, aims to produce recommendations and guidance for businesses and financial institutions to understand and report on impacts, dependencies, risks and opportunities related to people and human capital.</p><p>The TISFD's overview report provides examples of potential impact areas that could fall within its scope, including distribution of wages, compensation and benefits for employees; practices that affect the pay and conditions of value chain workers; and the impact of products and services on both communities and consumers.</p><p>Although the first version of the TISFD framework is only expected in late 2026, its potential to influence disclosure practices and investor focus is significant, says Smith. \"Both the TCFD and TNFD encouraged widespread enhancement in data measurement, collection and reporting. The TCFD eventually formed the foundation of the International Sustainability Standards Board S1 and S2 standards, which are being progressively rolled out by financial regulators globally.\"</p><p>Citi partners giving networks</p><p>Financial institutions even see opportunities in philanthropic donations, where there are no expectations of returns. In March, Citi Private Bank launched new philanthropy advisory solutions in Asia, starting in Singapore.</p><p>The move enables Citi Private Bank's clients here to establish donor-advised funds (DAF) or donate through its two registered charity partners: the Community Foundation of Singapore (CFS) and AVPN.</p><p>CFS is Singapore's oldest community foundation, boasting partnerships with over 400 charities and non-profit organisations. AVPN is the largest network of social investors in Asia, with over 600 members across 33 markets.</p><p>A DAF is a fund account for charitable donations, managed by a sponsor such as CFS or AVPN. Citi Private Bank's global family office group will connect clients with relevant charities for philanthropic contributions.</p><p>The private bank's 2024 annual survey showed that 24% of Asia-Pacific family offices provided services on philanthropy using internal and external expertise, up from 21% in 2023; and 15% of them relied on external expertise to deliver these services, compared to 9% in 2023.</p><p>\"A lot of times the founder says to the family office, 'Here's what I'm interested in, now you go and implement' and the family office is kind of looking at each other saying, 'Well, we might not have the knowledge',\" says Citi Private Bank's head of philanthropy advisory Karen Kardos at an April 2 media briefing.</p><p>Based in New York, Kardos hopes the bank can support family office staff in this regard. \"That's where advisers can be helpful and that's where the DAF can play a very important role, to almost act as that outsourced team that has the programmatic experience to be able to implement the founder's vision.\"</p><p>The minimum sum required to set up a DAF is US$250,000. The \"beauty\" of this structure, says Kardos, is that clients can set aside donations in a DAF during a \"high-income year\", and those donations grow tax-free while donors choose a beneficiary. They also receive upfront tax deductions on eligible donations \"at that point of donation\", she adds. \"You get to kind of build the plane while you're flying.\"</p><p>A generational wealth transfer could mean greater demand for DAFs in the future. \"What we see typically from the older generation is they want to build a hospital or they want to build a school,\" says Kardos. \"I think the younger generation is thinking more holistically about areas where they can make [an] impact  The younger generation [will] probably embrace using that sort of outsourced solution as they start to dip their toes in the water.\"</p><p>Wealth at peace</p><p>East and Southeast Asia account for about 7% of impact investment assets globally, up from 1.5% just three years ago, according to the non-profit Global Impact Investing Network.</p><p>At just 7%, there is still \"huge potential\" to grow impact investing in Asia, says Valerie Lau, managing director and co-head of Apac sustainable finance at UBS. Wealthy families in Hong Kong and Singapore, too, are keen to seize this opportunity, she adds.</p><p>Notably, Lau says these families are willing to follow today's \"pathways\" to investing for impact, suggesting a collaborative approach. \"Some of the pioneers in the market are becoming more receptive to pooling capital [or] investing in fund structures to try to achieve economies of scale in impact management and measurement, and more efficient portfolio management.\"</p><p>Speaking on a panel in February, Lau notes a link between these families' sources of wealth and the causes they find meaningful. \"These businesses are not making their decisions in isolation  A shipping business family may be inclined to find solutions that target environmental and social impact. A textile business will be more open to looking at perhaps textile waste or sustainable synthetic materials. So, it's an integrated approach that they're taking here.\"</p><p>Asia's needs are wide-ranging, and smaller donors are also welcome. Dawn Chan, CEO of the Centre for Impact Investing and Practices (CIIP), says the \"impact opportunity set\" in Asia is large and it does not require new technology. \"You do not need rocket science here. There is market demand and need for healthcare across the entire spectrum, and for smallholder farmers, it is not new tech that's needed; it's just scaling and execution.\"</p><p>Catalytic capital is coming from various investors, and \"sometimes it's family offices and philanthropists stepping up\", she adds. \"Sometimes, there are also companies and CSR (corporate social responsibility) stepping up, because they realise which pockets and which wallets they can actually put to use.\"</p><p>Back at the summit where Australian philanthropist Killelea declared peace a prerequisite for survival, AVPN CEO Naina Batra called for the philanthropy sector to \"step up to the challenge that the globe has presented us today\".</p><p>\"Too often, what happens when something like this happens [is that] we freeze in the headlights. We sit down and we think, 'Okay, I should stop everything till I figure out what's going on in the world.' That is really not the answer. The answer is to act faster, quicker and take more people along with you. Stopping is not an option.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FHJ-4KG3-RVT7-F228-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-04-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"5633\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 The Edge Publishing PTE.

American companies' existing and committed capital investments in AI over the next few years, in partnership with Singapore players in the local ecosystem, are expected to exceed US$37 billion, the US embassy here said. </p><p> Companies on both sides have committed to partnering to raise the AI capabilities of over 130,000 workers here, building on the strong support that US firms have already provided for the TechSkills Accelerator, Singapore's national tech upskilling initiative, it added. </p><p> In its feedback to the Ministry of Finance for Budget 2025 on behalf of the American business community here, AmChamSG said Singapore has the potential to establish itself as a regional AI hub. There are around 5,700 American companies in Singapore, of which 660 are members of AmCham. </p><p> \"A strategic, collaborative approach that encompasses targeted investment, regulatory harmonisation, the cultivation of an AI-ready workforce, and support for research and innovation will be essential for AI to become a significant contributor to Singapore's economic landscape,\" it said. </p><p> Special economic zones such as the one in Johor Bahru, Malaysia, could play a crucial role in speeding up AI adoption and knowledge exchange across borders, it said. </p><p> It called for the Singapore Government to ease funding for AI adoption as not all businesses are able to access this funding even though it is available. </p><p> Standardised cyber-policy frameworks across borders would enable Singapore to cooperate seamlessly with foreign partners on cyber-threat intelligence sharing and response, it suggested. </p><p> As many firms face challenges in finding AI talent, AmChamSG suggested greater collaboration between the Singapore Government, institutes of higher learning, and businesses to implement AI training programmes to ensure workers here are future ready. </p><p>Singapore should consider developing sector-specific AI governance and regulatory frameworks, it said. Sectors such as manpower require tailored guidance to implement AI solutions, which could benefit from collaborative input from both industry and government stakeholders. </p><p> With the five-year Research, Innovation and Enterprise (RIE) 2025 plan set to expire in 2025, American businesses eagerly await details of RIE 2030. </p><p> In RIE 2025, the Singapore Government supports investments in research, innovation and enterprise to the tune of $25 billion, or about 1 per cent of the city state's gross domestic product over 2021 to 2025. The four key areas were health, sustainability, the digital economy, and manufacturing. </p><p> RIE 2030 should include funding for greater public-private partnerships in advanced manufacturing, semiconductors, emissions reducing or removal technologies, new energy, and research and development talent attraction and development, AmChamSG said. </p><p> Increased collaboration between the public and private sectors to harness AI in healthcare can help mitigate rising medical and hospitalisation costs as Singapore's population ages. AmChamSG advocates greater government support for lifestyle management tools, such as wearables and continuous glucose monitors, as part of the Healthier SG initiative. </p><p> To ensure comprehensive patient care, it is important to include allied health professionals and expand insurance coverage for preventive care, the chamber said. </p><p> On climate and sustainability policies, there is a need for a consultative approach that balances business needs while pushing towards Singapore's net-zero emissions target by 2050, it said, adding that American firms are well positioned to supply customised innovative and clean technology. </p><p> AmChamSG recommends bulk purchasing of clean energy and pooled power purchase agreements to secure competitive rates, alongside government-supported green tariffs to ease financial burdens on small and medium-sized enterprises as they transition to clean energy. </p><p> In its 2024 manpower survey, AmChamSG found that the top two challenges to hiring more Singaporeans and permanent residents in senior-level roles are the lack of necessary specialised skills and the lack of exposure in overseas markets, global and regional operations. To address these issues, the Government needs to invest more in programmes that bridge skills gaps and facilitate skills transfer, AmChamSG said. </p><p> Tackling workplace discrimination is a key priority as Singapore strives to build an inclusive workforce. AmChamSG supports the new Workplace Fairness Bill and stresses the need for collaboration between the public and private sectors to implement effective anti-discrimination policies for all to thrive in their careers. </p><p> More support is also needed to support mature workers and help them stay competitive in a rapidly changing economy, it said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Policies that promote trade, innovation, and cross-border investments enable Singapore to leverage the expertise and resources of US businesses here to drive sustainable economic growth, says American Chamber of Commerce in Singapore CEO Hsien-Hsien Lei. \"Furthermore, through continued investment in upskilling and reskilling programmes, knowledge and skills transfer, and international work experience, Singapore can build a future-ready workforce,\" she said.

We thank Members for their various questions and suggestions on how the Public Service can do better.</p><p>2.Let me first address the cut by Ms He Ting Ru. She asked how we support exploratory scientific research and about our approach to quantum research.</p><p>3.Research and Development (R&amp;D) is a long-cycle endeavour, and any payoffs will be more appropriately assessed over the long term, rather than the short term as Ms He has suggested.</p><p>4. In any research, particularly initial research, there will be many competing ideas.</p><p>a. For instance, the mRNA vaccines that were crucial in fighting COVID-19 are a good example. The vaccines were enabled by decades of work in mRNA therapeutics, which many initially regarded as unpromising.</p><p>b. No one knew then the role that it would eventually play in the global pandemic.</p><p>c. This is the nature of R&amp;D.</p><p>5. In R&amp;D, success requires carefully balancing continuity in commitment and investment, with the ability to pivot decisively when the need arises.</p><p>6. Our National Research Foundation (NRF) takes a portfolio approach, supporting R&amp;D across fields and at different levels of maturity, and applying relevant programme management approaches. Let me explain that. There is no one method in managing the complexity of different fields of research, different levels of research, different maturities, or readiness-to-market levels of research. It is not a one size fits all. Different research areas, with different time horizons, different challenges will all require different management methods.</p><p>7. We review our programmes regularly, pivot them when necessary, and double down on efforts that show strong promise or when circumstances evolve. We can only have such optionalities if we have built up our capabilities and talent intentionally. I must also explain that in making such decisions, we do not just rely on our own expertise. Because in many of these emerging fields, we may not have all the expertise. This is the reason why NRF and our research institutes make sure that they have extensive global networks with different panels of advisors that can give us their different perspectives for us to make a considered decision. We have different councils comprising both local and foreign experts in different fields to give us the advice that we need.</p><p>8. Quantum research is an example where we are doubling down after seeing initial promise.</p><p>9.Ms He asked about possible technical approaches, including our current areas of focus, as well as industry development efforts to build our quantum capabilities.</p><p>10. Indeed, this domain is nascent and dynamic. We will continue to adjust where needed and make judgements taking into account the evolving landscape, our capabilities, what we have achieved and what others have achieved. Also, we keep a keen eye on where others are investing in so that we can focus on the areas where we will have a competitive advantage.</p><p>11. I would also like to assure members that the key Government agencies and research offices are keeping a close watch on all of these internal and external developments in consultation with both our local and international scientific panels, and we are not wedded to any focal areas or approaches. But what we must do carefully is to build up capabilities to allow us to have the suite of optionalities to pivot or double down as the circumstances evolve.</p><p>12. As for Ms He's suggestions, we will be happy to take into account her suggestions, and if she has scientific papers that she feels will benefit our considerations, we welcome her to let us know and we will convey this to NRF and our panel of scientific advisors to take a look at this.</p><p>13. More important than just building our own talent pool and expertise, we must also grow our ecosystem of research institutes, industries and workforce. When we say this, I don't just mean growing the capabilities in-house or only in this country. Very often in today's research and development environment, we will need to leverage on the networks that we are able to have access to in the global environment. No one country, not even the biggest countries such as India, China or US, will work alone necessarily, in many of these cutting-edge areas. And working together is what we are committed to do. In a more fragmented world, we must also ride on the opportunity for us to play the role of bringing people from different backgrounds together. That is one area of our competitive advantage. This will then position Singapore strategically to contribute where we can and take advantage of the opportunities, be it in quantum technologies or other areas.</p><p>14. Now let me now address Ms Hazel Poa's cut on behalf of the Prime Minister, on the terms of reference of the Electoral Boundaries Review Committee (EBRC).</p><p>15. Ms Poa would agree with us that there will be an asymptotical limit to asking EBRC to keep reducing the average size of Group Representation Constituencies (GRCs) - that limit being one where all electoral divisions are Single Member Constituencies (SMCs). The current terms of reference provide some stability in our electoral landscape by having a balance in the proportion of GRCs and SMCs. Having Members of Parliament (MPs) serving a broadly similar number of electors on average as the last election will enable MPs in the coming Parliament to continue to serve and represent their residents effectively. This last point is what matters most.</p><p>16. As for greater transparency for its recommendations, we discussed this extensively during the debate on the Motion that Ms Poa and Mr Leong Mun Wai tabled in Parliament last August. We do not intend to repeat the debate today. Suffice to say that we should avoid imposing requirements or instructions on the EBRC that are too prescriptive, but to give EBRC, which comprises senior civil servants with the relevant professional knowledge and expertise, the space to do their work independently and objectively, without fear or favour.</p><p>17. Next, Mr Melvin Yong asked how we would prepare the Public Service workforce to tackle the multi-faceted challenges of the future.</p><p>18. Our Public Service has achieved much for Singapore and Singaporeans since 1965.</p><p>a. Today, we are known for our efficiency, innovation and ethos - from meritocracy to incorruptibility. For example, Singapore has been ranked within the top five in the World Bank's Worldwide Governance Indicators on Government Effectiveness since 2014, and topped Oxford University's inaugural Blavatnik Index of Public Administration in 2024.</p><p>b. Having said that, we are not complacent and must not be complacent. Our world is changing rapidly.</p><p>(1) The once familiar rules-based international security and economic orders are fracturing.</p><p>(2) Achieving survival and success for Singapore and Singaporeans will require fresh approaches in the way we do things, not just internally, but also in how we connect with the world.</p><p>c. Our people's aspirations, as Mr Yip Won Heng has shared, have also changed. They have gone up, while our manpower resource base remains tight.</p><p>(1)We will need to constantly review the way we build capabilities, execute and deliver.</p><p>19. The Public Service will focus on strengthening three areas this year:</p><p>a.  First, we must deepen our perspectives of the world and strengthen linkages with partners beyond our Public Service.</p><p>(1) Public service delivery does not happen in a vacuum, nor does it only depend on us looking inward at our own issues.</p><p>(2) As Mr Saktiandi Supaat mentioned, for Singapore to remain successful, our Public Service must deeply appreciate the fast-evolving external context which we have to operate in. We must remain engaged with our international counterparts through active participation in international forums, exchange and training programmes. We must keep in close touch with what is happening in many international agencies. Because the decisions made there can have significant impact on what we can or cannot do, even in our domestic context.</p><p>(3) This is why we will continue to send our officers to many of these international organisations for us to touch base with the latest thinking, and build those networks that are necessary for our continued survival and success. We aspire to send more officers beyond the Public Service and beyond Singapore to understand and build those linkages to further the cause for Singapore and Singaporeans. As an example, National Environment Agency (NEA) officer Khairunnisa Binte Yahya has first-hand experience of this. She is attached to the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) as an Air Pollution Expert. She shares expertise and develops solutions for air pollution with UNDP partners, enhancing Singapore's global partnerships in environmental sustainability and climate resilience. Khairunnisa has gained insights into UNDP's strategies which informs our efforts to improve Singapore's air quality. More importantly, she has built up a network which she can call upon in time to come.</p><p>(4) As we prepare our officers for an increasingly complex environment, Mr Patrick Tay asked about our efforts to prepare officers for lengthened career spans. We have introduced a Public Service Career Coach Network and will be ramping up our CareerFitness programme to empower officers to build career resilience and agility across different life stages. One such officer is Latha Nadarajan. A Personal Assistant at the Ministry of Social and Family Development (MSF), she pursued her passion for social work by obtaining a Singapore University of Social Sciences degree. After attending a CareerFitness workshop in 2023, she is now set for an attachment with Child Protection Services to apply her new skills. To further reap the career longevity dividend, we will continue to tap on the Public Service Retirees Network, which provides job and volunteer opportunities, to harness their wealth of experiences and add resilience to our system.</p><p>b. Second, and in response to Mr Yip Hon Weng's question on coordinated citizen services, we will continue to integrate our service delivery from a citizen-centric perspective, rather than a silo-Ministry perspective.</p><p>(1) For example, our ServiceSG omni-channel strategy is not just about bringing different services together. It is about how we rewire our processes to deliver services more efficiently, and yet be more aligned with the way our people expect their service journey to be.</p><p>(2) As we continue to streamline and digitalise our services, we will certainly not leave those less digitally savvy behind.</p><p>(3) This requires a mindset shift from a Ministry or agency-centricity to a people-centricity and whole of government perspective. It is a digital-first but not digital-only service that we are aiming for.</p><p>c. Third, we must strengthen team development for a more complex and challenging operating environment. In the Public Service, we have always focused on the development of an individual and this remains valid. Moving forward, we will need to go beyond developing individuals and strengthen the way we develop teams and compose them with diverse abilities, backgrounds and perspectives.</p><p>(1) Our ability to compose teams with diverse abilities to resolve and pre-empt problems is critical as challenges become more complex and interlinked.</p><p>(2)To this end, our Civil Service College will lean forward to help different agencies to build stronger and more agile leadership teams to bring out the best in our agencies to enable Singapore and Singaporeans' success.</p><p>20. To recap, there are three things we will need to focus on urgently this year.</p><p>a. First, for our Public Service to maintain that sense of perspective, to not just be able to understand our own challenges deeply but to have a view of how the world is evolving; because the rules are changing fast. Unless we are plugged in, we might be overtaken or bypassed by rules that are made beyond our shores.</p><p>b. Second, we will continue to focus our efforts to wrap services around citizens. We aim for a more seamless service experience for all Singaporeans.</p><p>c. Third, beyond building the individual, we must build our teams, to have different perspectives, to be able to see things from different angles, so that we can have more robust solutions. We need teams with the courage and the know-how to pivot and change course when the need arises, to pre-empt problems.</p><p>21. Chairman, we do not take for granted that our strong track record will naturally enable our success tomorrow.</p><p>a. Indeed, we believe as a Public Service that we should be continuously vigilant to our fast-changing world order and domestic expectations and constantly challenge ourselves to evolve faster. It is not just about solving today's problems better, but about anticipating tomorrow's challenges earlier, to find those solutions before the problem arises. Only then can we be more assured that we are able to overcome tomorrow's challenges, seize new opportunities to benefit all Singaporeans - and be a Public Service that can continue to be the pride of Singaporeans.</p><p>b. To be successful, we must maintain a strong, continuous and consistent partnership between the political leadership and the Public Service, that allows our Public Service to execute with consistency and conviction, without fear or favour.</p><p>c. This is perhaps something that we have taken for granted. In many countries, they too have people in the Public Service with strong convictions and good ideas, but they do not necessarily have the ability to do this well. This is something that we have, something we cherish, and a competitive advantage for Singapore.</p><p>22. Chair, I have shared how we will deepen our external linkages, deliver integrated services and strengthen our teams. If we do this well, I am confident that this will be a Public Service that we can all be proud of and that will partner us to SG100 and beyond.</p><p>[Category: Events]</p><p>Source: Public Service Division,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065856989</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F7X-0XD3-S1GX-X03R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2477\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"02\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>February 28, 2025 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DLOJ</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT ADVISORS &amp; MINISTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp; OFFICES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001475</classCode><className>RESEARCH &amp; DEVELOPMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST0009RLP</classCode><className>RESEARCH INSTITUTES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CG</classCode><className>EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp; TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>ST0009FY9</classCode><className>EXPERIMENTATION &amp; RESEARCH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><classCode>STX002064</classCode><className>EPIDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DQGE</classCode><className>COVID CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DOTH</classCode><className>COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>STX000912</classCode><className>INFECTIOUS DISEASE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>ST000DOXW</classCode><className>PANDEMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>STX001372</classCode><className>PRESS RELEASES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"86\"><classCode>ST000DRK3</classCode><className>MRNA DRUGS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX001785</classCode><className>VACCINES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>GC311</classCode><className>SINGAPORE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

I will speak on our approach to strengthen our food resilience, and safeguard our hawker culture.</p><p>Strengthening Our Food Resilience</p><p>2. As a country that imports over 90% of our food, Singapore will not be spared from global food supply disruptions. These can arise from disease outbreaks, climate change, and geopolitical tensions.</p><p>Diversifying Our Import Sources</p><p>3. In safeguarding our food resilience, diversifying our import sources remains our core strategy.</p><p>4. Today, we import from 187 countries, up from just 140 around two decades back.</p><p>5. When accrediting food imports, SFA takes a risk-based approach. While products with low food safety risks do not require accreditation, SFA accredits higher-risk food products like meat and egg products, in line with international practice.</p><p>6. Since December 2024, SFA has streamlined this process in line with the work of the Inter-Ministerial Committee on Pro-Enterprise Rules Review, by accrediting at a broader food category level instead of by food product.</p><p>7. This expands our import product range, and improves business efficiency.</p><p>Stockpiling Essential Items</p><p>8. But our food resilience cannot and does not hinge on one single strategy; it requires a multi-pronged approach.</p><p>9. One complementary strategy is to maintain adequate food stocks to tide over supply disruptions, as seen during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, stockpiling alone is insufficient. For perishable essentials like fibre, long-term storage is challenging, involving inventory and logistics costs.</p><p>Growing Local</p><p>10. This is why we develop some capacity and capability for local production. It complements our diversification and stockpiling strategies with a regenerative characteristic, allowing us to continue producing food during supply disruptions.</p><p>11. Ms Nadia Samdinasked about the progress of our \"30 by 30\" vision. Today, less than 10% of the food we consume is produced locally.</p><p>12. When we conceived this vision in 2019, it was aspirational. The agri-food business climate was then more benign, with stronger investor interest, lower interest rates, and lower energy prices. Now, the global food industry outlook has become less favourable, with:</p><p>13. Dwindling investments in urban agri-food technology and alternative proteins, and</p><p>14. Geopolitical tensions exacerbating uncertainties around energy costs.</p><p>15. Local farms will continue facing inherent structural challenges, in this early stage when their production facilities have yet to achieve sufficient scale.</p><p>16. A key challenge is high production costs in Singapore, given limited land and a tight labour force.</p><p>17. This is exacerbated by strong price competition from imported produce, which enjoy lower production costs.</p><p>18. For our farms to scale, we need to help them improve productivity and lower costs, while increasing consumer demand for local produce. Navigating these complex issues will require time, effort and close partnership across the Government, our industry and consumers.</p><p>19. Despite these challenges, our capacity and capability to produce food locally has grown, and some food types have shown early successes.</p><p>20. Locally-produced hen eggs and beansprouts now contribute 30% and 50% of our local consumption respectively.</p><p>21. SFA is continuously assessing our progress and our initiatives' relevance in growing our agri-food sector, gaining experience along the way.</p><p>22. Ms Samdinasked whether we are reviewing Singapore's 30-by-30 goal. Indeed, we are reviewing our local production strategy to be more focused and targeted in addressing key challenges of productivity, costs and demand, and in fostering the sector's continued growth. We will share more details after our review.</p><p>Singapore Aquaculture Plan</p><p>23. Ms Samdinasked about the initiatives announced in theSingaporeAquaculture Plan, which we refreshed last year, bringing stakeholders together to chart a shared roadmap to uplift our aquaculture sector.</p><p>24. Under the plan, we are spearheading efforts to strengthen the supply resilience of agri-inputs, which are vital for farms.</p><p>25. In aquaculture, agri-inputs constitute up to 60% of farms' production costs.</p><p>26. Quality eggs and fingerlings form a key priority. However, with the inconsistent quality our farmers use today, fish mortalities can go up to 80%, impacting downstream yield.</p><p>27. The newly-establishedNational Broodstock Centre(or NBC)andHatchery Development and Recognition Programmewill supply to our farms genetically superior eggs and fingerlings, with higher survival and grow-out rates.</p><p>28. SFA will work with local hatcheries to uplift their capabilities and gain accreditation under the programme, which allows them to access superior fish eggs from the NBC.</p><p>29. The programme will first focus on Asian seabass - commonly produced and consumed by Singaporeans. SFA is in the process of training and accrediting a few seabass hatcheries.</p><p>30. SFA's work is also underway to study potential sites for the hybrid sea farming model, in close consultation with Government agencies, the industry, researchers and nature groups.</p><p>31. Identifying and allocating appropriate sites is not easy. It demands significant time and resources, given our limited sea space, competing uses, and needing to mitigate environmental impact.</p><p>32. Broadly, we will continue to avail space for farming by launching land and sea tenders progressively. SFA will announce tender details along the way.</p><p>33. ToMs Samdin's question on keeping our marine environment clean, let me explain that all farms are required by licence to maintain clean and sanitary conditions.</p><p>34. With the Farm Management Plan, introduced under the Food Safety and Security Act passed in Parliament this January, we also require licensees undertaking primary production activities to adopt means to mitigate food safety risks, disease spread and ensure sustainable production.</p><p>Agri-Food Cluster Transformation (ACT) Fund</p><p>35. To support our farms to be more productive and climate-resilient, SFA provides funding through theAgri-Food Cluster Transformation Fund, or ACT Fund.</p><p>36. To addressMr Shawn HuangandMr Dennis Tan's questions, the ACT Fund supports farms to adopt farming solutions for diverse needs, from small-scale trials to larger commercial systems, with over $28 million awarded to 43 companies by end-2024.</p><p>37. Each application proposal is assessed holistically, considering its merits and ability to contribute to our food resilience.</p><p>38. One example is Blue Ocean Aquaculture Technology. Supported by an earlier iteration of the ACT Fund, they developed an indoor recirculating aquaculture system to farm various fish species in higher densities, with a lower footprint, and regardless of climate or external environmental changes.</p><p>39. Another example, Yili Farm, has also benefitted from funding to construct an intensive soil and hydroponics farming system, achieving resource efficiencies.</p><p>40. Mr Tanraised some suggestions on adopting permaculture principles and deploying natural solutions like aquatic plants, to improve climate resilience.</p><p>41. Permaculture, in particular, tends to require extensive land space, which might not be as well-suited for local production in Singapore.</p><p>42. Nonetheless, farms should assess the farming methods and solutions most appropriate for their operating model and constraints, accounting for the need to be commercially viable, climate-resilient and resource-efficient.</p><p>43. Generally, SFA provides technical resources on agriculture technologies, and have account managers who can further assist and advise farmers on growth areas and development plans.</p><p>44. To better address our farmers' diverse and emerging needs, SFA has enhanced the ACT Fund, incorporating their feedback.</p><p>45. The enhancements will provide farms with:</p><p>46. More comprehensive coverage, to include expenses such as marketing and branding; and</p><p>47. Expanded funding scope to cover standalone pre- and post-harvest production facilities.</p><p>48. To provide farms more time to harness technology and innovation, SFA will also extend the maximum project funding duration from 27 to 36 months.</p><p>49. AsMs Rachel Onghighlighted, local businesses seeking to innovate may need grants and other support, beyond research grants. Agri-food businesses can also access Enterprise SG's initiatives like the Enterprise Development Grant and Startup SG, which finance innovation projects and capabilities.</p><p>Growing Demand Offtake for Local Produce</p><p>50. For our farms to achieve scale, they also need sustained demand. This is where strong support from the industry and consumers can help strengthen our Singapore Food Story.</p><p>51. Under our Alliance for Action to encourage increased offtake for local produce, the Singapore Agro-Food Enterprise Federation (or SAFEF) is expanding its work as a supply and demand aggregator.</p><p>52. In May 2024, SAFEF launched the \"SG Farmers' Market\"and\"The Straits Fish\"product lines in selected FairPrice outlets, aggregating locally-farmed vegetables and marine tilapia respectively to make them more accessible to consumers, especially those in the heartlands.</p><p>53. By last month, sales have increased about fivefold for local xiao bai cai, and twofold for processed local fish products. I am very heartened by the public response.</p><p>54. SAFEF is working with our farmers and industry partners to launch even more products. Beyond FairPrice outlets, consumers can also find \"SG Farmers' Market\" vegetables at Sheng Siong supermarkets starting this month.</p><p>55. More food businesses are recognised under theFarm-to-Table Recognition Programme, for their commitment to procure locally produced, locally-farmed ingredients.</p><p>56. Since launching in 2023, membership has grown steadily to 101 establishments by January this year.</p><p>57. SFA will continue to encourage morebusinesses to come onboard.</p><p>Safeguarding Our Hawker Culture</p><p>58. Let me now shift gears to another food-related topic. With SG60, we also mark the fifth year of the inscription of Singapore's hawker culture onto the UNESCO Representative List of the Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity. Our hawker centres form the heart of our hawker culture.</p><p>Upgrading and Building Our Hawker Centre</p><p>59. Minister Grace Fu explained why we must look ahead to update our hawker centre landscape. This builds on our progress thus far.</p><p>60. In the 2010s, we restarted building 20 new hawker centres after a hiatus to address Singaporeans' needs in estates under-served by food &amp; beverage options. Today, 14 are in operation.</p><p>61. I am also pleased to announce that 2 new hawker centres are opening in the first half of this year.</p><p>62. Bukit Batok West Hawker Centre will feature 22 cooked food stalls and over 400 seats, while Punggol Coast Hawker Centre will introduce 40 stalls and over 680 seats.</p><p>63. Both are designed for a pleasant dining environment, featuring high ceilings with improved ventilation, spacious seating areas and connectivity to surrounding facilities.</p><p>64. As we progressively complete the remaining centres in upcoming years, we are also looking beyond that.We plan to build another 5 new hawker centres to ensure more residents in under-served estates can access affordable and delicious hawker food.NEA will announce more details when ready.</p><p>65. Besides building new hawker centres, we have invested in upgrading our existing infrastructure, in addition to cyclical renovation works.</p><p>66. We last embarked on a nationwideHawker Centres Upgrading Programme, or HUP, over 20 years ago to upgrade or rebuild almost 100 centres.</p><p>67. More recently, we piloted theHawker Centres Transformation Programmeat two centres in Cheng San and Geylang Serai to improve hygiene conditions and address persistent infrastructural concerns. I am glad thatMs Samdinfound it helpful, through works like improving seating layout to minimise crowding and enhancing ventilation with new fittings.</p><p>68. The experiences we gained will inform our next bound, under HUP 2.0. As outlined by Minister Grace Fu,HUP 2.0seeks to meet Singaporeans' evolving needs by upgrading older hawker centres, or rebuilding for some, into more vibrant, accessible and climate-resilient spaces.</p><p>69. Upgrading and building hawker centres are extensive endeavours that we are planning ahead and implementing progressively for the next 20 to 30 years.</p><p>70. ToMs Hany Soh'squestion, NEA is working closely with other agencies to dovetail with estate development plans and ensure local communities' needs are well-served.</p><p>71. We will carefully examine our options and share more details when ready.</p><p>72. Mr Pritam Singhasked about the future of markets.</p><p>73. Of the over 7,000 such stalls in 83 markets managed under NEA, occupancy rates remained relatively stable at around 96% in recent years.</p><p>74. Nonetheless, consumer patterns have shifted with changing demographics and availability of alternatives like supermarkets and online retailers. NEA will assess local community needs and the availability of market produce, to determine the development plans of wet markets under HUP 2.0.</p><p>Supporting our Hawker Trade and Culture</p><p>75. Beyond the physical space, our hawker centres are also about our hawkers who, as masters of their craft, are the heart and soul of our hawker centres.</p><p>76. In commemoration of SG60 and to appreciate our hawkers, the Minister for Finance has announced a one-time rental support of $600 this year, for each stall in hawker centres and markets managed by the Government and Government-appointed operators.</p><p>77. As a nation, we share a joint responsibility to ensure that our hawker culture continues to thrive. The Government will lead by setting policies to support and sustain the hawker trade. This includes providing a conducive business environment, ensuring the trade remains attractive, and nurturing a new generation of hawkers.</p><p>78. ToMr Eric ChuaandMs Samdin'squestions,indeed,as circumstances change, we need to review and adjust our policies.</p><p>79. For instance, we saw the need to discourage excessively high tender bids for NEA-managed hawker centre stalls. Hence, we recently extended the duration for decreasing monthly stall rent from the bid price to assessed market rate after the initial tenancy period, by one more tenancy term.</p><p>80. As we monitor outcomes, we are concurrently taking steps to encourage more informed and realistic bidding.</p><p>81. To guide tenderers, NEA now shares the median assessed market rent for centres with vacant stalls, in NEA's tender exercises since last month.</p><p>82. NEA will also launch an online self-help tool, which can help tenderers understand the costs involved in running a hawker stall.</p><p>83. We also recognise hawkers' challenges in hiring stall assistants. Since January this year, we relaxed our manpower policy for hawker centres managed by NEA and NEA-appointed operators, and are monitoring the impact.</p><p>84. Enhancing productivity is another sustainable approach to manage manpower constraints, and where we can leverage on technology asMr Chuasuggests.</p><p>85. For example, centralised dishwashing and cleaning process automation like tray conveyance systems can improve centre-wide productivity, and are supported under NEA's Productive Hawker Centres programme.</p><p>86. Also, under NEA's Hawkers' Productivity Grant, we have disbursed over $3.4 million by end-2024 to co-fund hawkers in adopting stall-level automation equipment and digital solutions, like e-ordering and kitchen management systems.</p><p>87. We will continue identifying and supporting practical technologies that can alleviate hawkers' challenges.</p><p>88. Mr Chuaalso suggested a two-shift system to optimise stall utility. Hawkers can already do this today through NEA's Joint Operator Scheme, which allows eligible stallholders and their appointed joint operators to share stall operating hours without overlapping.</p><p>89. While I am glad that some hawkers have benefitted from this scheme, we acknowledge that such a scheme may be operationally difficult to accommodate for other hawkers depending on their business models.</p><p>90. We will continue to assess our policies to assist our hawkers and ensure alignment with operating realities.</p><p>91. We also support aspiring hawkers to boost their chances of success.</p><p>92. NEA does this through the Incubation Stall Programme, Hawkers' Development Programme, and Hawkers Succession Scheme.</p><p>93. Ms Samdinwould be glad that by end-2024,</p><p>94. Over 100 aspiring hawkers have moved on to complete apprenticeships under hawker mentors.</p><p>95. NEA has also allocated near 100 pre-fitted incubation stalls with reduced rent, to help aspiring hawkers kickstart their business.</p><p>96. Our hawker landscape will continue evolving with the times. We will continue to review our policies and support programmes, to ensure they can meet the interests of Singaporeans, our hawkers and other stakeholders, amid changing needs and expectations.</p><p>[Category: Food, Packaged Foods &amp;

As we mark SG60, looking back at the last sixty years, it is not difficult to note the progress we have made since independence.</p><p>2. We laid the foundations for a modern metropolis, cleaning up our waterways and environment, putting in place a modern sanitation system, reducing flood risks, and improving food safety.</p><p>3. Our hawker centres remain an important source of affordable food, a cherished social space for many Singaporeans, and a proud showcase of our food heritage for friends visiting from abroad.</p><p>4. We have also harnessed science and technology through NEWater and desalination to strengthen our water resilience, and developed Project Wolbachia to fight dengue and improve public health.</p><p>5. The green and livable city we enjoy today is the collective result of our boldness and our resilience over the past six decades.</p><p>6. Since our independence, we have pursued economic growth in tandem with environmental protection and social inclusion. It is a careful balancing act - one that requires boldness in decision-making and the resilience to rise above our constraints.</p><p>7. MSE's work is vital in safeguarding the food we eat, the water we drink, and the environment we live, work and play in. At the core, MSE's work is about \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday.\"</p><p>8. Our Sustainability - is to steward our limited resources responsibly for future generations; and</p><p>9. Our Resilience - is to prepare for and adapt to new challenges; and</p><p>10. Our Everyday - is to improve the daily living of Singaporeans, and our daily interaction with our environment, present and future.</p><p>11. In this COS debate, we will touch on these areas.</p><p>Our Sustainability</p><p>12. First, our sustainability.</p><p>13. Improving energy efficiency is critical in our drive towards net zero. Everyone can play a part in improving our energy efficiency. Being more energy efficient will help us conserve energy, allowing us to grow our economy and population with less energy and carbon emission.</p><p>14. We will support households and industries in pursuing energy efficiency improvements.</p><p>15. For businesses, we have expanded energy efficiency grants to cover more sectors such as construction and manufacturing sectors. We have also enhanced regulatory frameworks for various sectors, such as the buildings and industry sectors.</p><p>16. For households, the enhanced Climate Friendly Households Programme will be expanded to benefit more households and encourage wider adoption of resource efficient household products.</p><p>17. The public sector is also pressing ahead with its plan to improve the energy efficiency of its buildings. SMS Khor will share more.</p><p>18. Ms Poh Li San asked how we intend to manage air conditioning use. Against the backdrop of a warmer planet, it is crucial that we manage our thermal comfort sustainably. Very often, our indoor spaces are so cold that we need to wear sweaters in tropical Singapore.</p><p>19. A major step is to keep indoor air-conditioned spaces at 25C or higher. This will reduce energy cost and allow occupants to dress more appropriately for our tropical climate.</p><p>20. The public sector has adopted this where possible, and we hope to partner businesses and the public to make a broader shift towards sustainable cooling. More details will be announced later this year.</p><p>Our Resilience</p><p>21. Next, our resilience efforts.</p><p>22. Climate change poses a serious and considerable threat to Singapore.</p><p>23. We will launch a $25 million Weather Science Research Programme to enhance Singapore's ability to understand and predict our tropical urban weather, including extreme weather arising from climate change.</p><p>24. Under this programme, the Centre for Climate Research Singapore will collaborate with local Institutes of Higher Learning and Research Institutes to incorporate the latest scientific and technological developments.</p><p>25. For example, researchers will use artificial intelligence to improve our ability to forecast.</p><p>26. Just as we have risen to past challenges, we need to work together with purpose, urgency and determination to strengthen our climate resilience. I will speak about flood, coastal and heat resilience, while SMS Khor and SMS Koh will cover water and food resilience respectively.</p><p>Flood &amp; Coastal resilience</p><p>27. First, flood and coastal resilience. In our early days of independence, Singapore faced frequent and widespread flooding during the monsoon seasons. Over the years, we have reduced flood prone areas from around 3,200 hectares in the 1970s to less than 25 hectares today - which is a 99% reduction. You may recall that in January this year, Singapore experienced two monsoon surges which brought prolonged rain. Over both monsoon surges, there was just one reported flood incident. Our progress in flood resilience is significant.</p><p>28. However, climate change will pose new challenges. As such, we will upgrade our infrastructure to enhance Singapore's flood resilience.</p><p>29. We can expect six more drainage upgrading projects this year. Later this year, upgrading works for the Sungei Serangoon Western and Eastern subsidiary drains are slated to commence, to cater for upcoming developments in the Lorong Halus area.</p><p>30. That said, in land-scarce Singapore, we cannot keep expanding our drainage infrastructure. We must strengthen flood resilience at the systems level, and partner building owners, developers, and the wider community.</p><p>31. For individual developments, PUB works closely with building owners and developers to implement, operate and maintain flood-protection measures. For underground MRT stations and buildings with basements, PUB works with them to meet requirements on minimum platform and crest levels.</p><p>32. PUB also engages residents and businesses in flood-prone areas and hotspots on flood risks and distributes flood protection devices to enhance flood protection for these premises.</p><p>33. To improve rainfall monitoring and prediction, PUB leverages and has invested in technology like X-band radars to give more localised forecasts. To update Singaporeans on potential flooding, PUB leverages the myENV mobile app, social media, radio broadcast and traditional media outlets to disseminate timely updates. There are also plans to enable the ERP 2.0 on-board units to display flood alerts by mid-2025.</p><p>34. As we enhance our inland flood resilience, we need to build coastal protection in tandem.</p><p>35. Members asked about the status of our coastal protection plans, legislation and standards. To guide our plans, we are conducting site-specific studies. The studies for Jurong Island, City-East Coast, including Long Island, as well as the northwest coast from Tuas to Woodlands are on track. More details for the Greater Southern Waterfront and Changi will be shared later this year. We will commence the studies for Sentosa and the south-west coast by 2026.</p><p>36. Ms Nadia also asked how we will fund our coastal protection efforts. The Government plans to use funds from our annual Budget, the Coastal and Flood Protection Fund, to which the Minister for Finance has announced a $5 billion top-up, and through borrowing. Where eligible, such as for land reclamation costs, we will also use the Past Reserves. We will continue to study how best to finance these measures in a way that is fiscally sustainable and equitable across generations.</p><p>37. It is more effective to build up flood resilience at a system's level, where coastal stakeholders play their part alongside the Government.We are preparing a coastal protection legislation to set out the responsibilities of relevant stakeholders, safeguard land for coastal protection measures and ensure that coastal protection standards are met. We will consult stakeholders and table a Coastal Protection bill in the second half of 2025.</p><p>38. PUB is developing a Code of Practice that will provide a set of design standards, as well as operation and maintenance requirements for coastal protection measures. We will consult the industry this year, and aim to release it by the first half of 2026.</p><p>39. PUB will also launch a Flood-Resilient Developments guidebook to help building owners enhance the resilience of their premises. The guidebook will contain case studies and a toolkit of flood-resilient measures that owners can consider adopting for their buildings.</p><p>Heat resilience</p><p>40. Next, on heat resilience.</p><p>41. As we experience rising temperatures, building heat resilience is a critical part of our adaptation efforts. Ms Poh Li San asked about our heat resilience efforts.</p><p>42. We are progressively rolling out infrastructural interventions to enhance heat resilience.</p><p>43. HDB will work closely with the Town Councils to apply cool coatings to all existing HDB estates islandwide by 2030.</p><p>44. We are studying the effectiveness of cool coatings to other infrastructure archetypes, such as schools and hawker centres.</p><p>45. We will find ways to improve thermal comfort for the public, such as enhancing greenery and ventilation, and reducing heat emission.</p><p>46. Infrastructural interventions, however, need to be complemented with individual actions. Thermal comfort is subjective, and our bodies respond differently.</p><p>47. A key tenet of our heat resilience efforts is about empowering people.</p><p>48. The Heat Stress Advisory was launched in 2023 to guide the public on steps to protect themselves, based on the prevailing heat stress levels. Recognising that heat affects various groups of people differently, depending on the nature of their activities, the Heat Stress Advisory is supported by sector-specific guidelines, such as the Ministry of Manpower's revised framework to protect outdoor workers.</p><p>49. Underpinning these guidelines is our Wet-Bulb Globe Temperature heat stress sensor network. I am happy to share that we are expanding our sensor network beyond sports stadiums to cover residential areas. This will provide more accurate information so that our advisory can be more effective.</p><p>50. The expanded heat stress sensor network will also provide more timely information on extreme weather events, such as heatwaves. We have developed heatwave response plans for both public and sector-specific populations.</p><p>51. Associate Professor Razwana asked about our collaboration with partners. We do so through platforms such as the C40 network of about 100 cities that are looking for solutions on climate change. We also partner researchers to deepen our understanding of how heat impacts our health, and to co-create innovative solutions such as developing wearables for better heat stress monitoring.</p><p>52. I have touched on our efforts for flood, coastal and heat resilience. These are important parts of Singapore's national adaptation plan, which countries are encouraged to develop in line with international best practices. In the face of increasing yet uncertain climate risks, the national adaptation plan will serve as a long-term, living strategy for Singapore to continue thriving in the future. Through our ongoing and upcoming engagements, we hope to hear views from the community and stakeholders too.</p><p>Our Everyday</p><p>53. Lastly, our efforts to safeguard our everyday.</p><p>54. The journey towards a sustainable and resilient Singapore is not just about preparing for the longer-term challenges. We must not lose sight of the importance of our everyday behaviour.</p><p>Public hygiene</p><p>55. This was why we designated 2024 as the Year of Public Hygiene. To highlight the importance of public hygiene and more importantly, to harness the spirit of collective responsibility in adopting good public hygiene practices for the betterment of our society.</p><p>56. We have achieved commendable outcomes.</p><p>57. We saw a 36% reduction of litter between May 2024 and Dec 2024 at littering hotspots, thanks to increased public education as well as enforcement efforts.</p><p>58. My Ministry also recently received the Public Toilets Taskforce's report. We have studied the taskforce's recommendations and decided to endorse them.</p><p>59. SPS Baey will share more on this.</p><p>Hawker centres</p><p>60. Hawker centres are also an important part of our everyday.</p><p>61. In the early days, street hawkers were resettled into hawker centres to improve food hygiene standards and public health.</p><p>62. Hawker centres have remained an important source of affordable food and an integral part of our culture, serving as vibrant community dining rooms for Singaporeans and visitors from all walks of life.</p><p>63. Over time, as our people's needs evolve, our hawker centres have to be revitalised and be future ready.</p><p>64. With climate change, an ageing population, rapid urban redevelopments, and shifting hawker profiles, patrons and hawkers have new expectations. Hawkers also require more productive and innovative solutions to meet their business aspirations and tackle operational challenges.</p><p>65. As demographics shift, some hawker centres in the mature estates have experienced falling demand. At the same time, new estates have emerged, and may need more affordable eating options.</p><p>66. The Minister for Finance has announced that we will allocate up to $1 billion to upgrade older hawker centres and build new centres. We will do these progressively over the next 20 to 30 years, to serve the changing needs of Singaporeans for generations to come.</p><p>67. New hawker centres will be built as needed, with modern services and sustainable spaces.</p><p>68. Under a new Hawker Centres Upgrading Programme 2.0, or HUP 2.0 for short, existing hawker centres will be transformed. Madam, in Mandarin.</p><p>69. Through the Hawker Centre Renovation Plus, we will create a more comfortable dining and working environment for diners and hawkers. We hope to provide more inclusive spaces to ensure that everyone, including the elderly and the disabled, can access the convenience of hawker centres. The infrastructure of hawker centres will also be prepared for climate change.</p><p>70. Some hawker centres located in mature HDB estates may undergo larger-scale reconstruction. We will try to synchronize the development plans with the HDB estates as much as possible, keep pace with the times, and build hawker centres that are more comfortable and better suited to the needs of the public.</p><p>71. SMS Koh will share more later about our plans.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>72. Let me conclude.</p><p>73. The road ahead will not be easy. We will face challenges that will test our adaptability - climate change, geopolitical tensions, disease outbreaks and other global uncertainties. But our Singapore story has always been one of resilience - of a people who refuse to be daunted by our limitations, who turn challenges into opportunities, and who forge ahead with boldness.</p><p>74. MSE's theme for today's debate is \"Our Sustainability, Our Resilience, Our Everyday\". It is not just about the policies and infrastructure, but also aboutourpeople and the everyday choices we make. It is about the businesses that embrace green investments and innovation, the households that recycle waste, the individuals who champion sustainability, and the communities that look out for one another.</p><p>75. Every effort, no matter how small, strengthens our resilience and secures our future. Let us build on our strong foundation and press on with boldness and confidence. Just as past generations laid the groundwork for the green and livable Singapore we enjoy today, let us do our part to ensure that future generations will look back with pride at the choices we made.</p><p>76. Together, we can shape a Singapore that remains not only a thriving nation, but also a home that is sustainable, resilient, and full of potential.</p><p>[Category: Water Utilities, Utilities, ESG]</p><p>Source: Ministry of Sustainability and the Environment,Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065892603</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6F8Y-VCW3-RW1C-X18G-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-03-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2746\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"04\" month=\"03\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>March 4, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"96\"><className>Business &amp;

The PIF is the key regional forum in the Pacific that seeks to foster cooperation among its members and collaboration with external partners. This is the second time that Singapore is attending the PIF Leaders Meeting as a Dialogue Partner, following our admission in January 2022.</p><p>The theme of the 53rd PIF Leaders Meeting is \"Transformative Resilient Pasifiki: Build Better Now\". Minister Maliki will attend the PIF Leaders' session with Dialogue Partners on 28 August 2024. He will also meet leaders from the Pacific to discuss bilateral and regional cooperation.</p><p>Minister Maliki's visit builds on the longstanding relations between Singapore and the Pacific. As fellow small island states, Singapore and the Pacific share a commitment to tackling global challenges such as climate change. At the last PIF Leaders Meeting in November 2023, Singapore launched a three-year customised \"Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing\" (SPARKS) package, which comprises courses in climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law. In May 2024, Singapore hosted the 3rd Singapore-Pacific High-Level Visit which fosters closer ties and facilitates exchange of views in areas of common interest such as climate change, sustainable development and urban planning.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Foreign Affairs,Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Events]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0064793236</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CTT-BW51-DXMP-K23W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"331\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 26, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>PACIFIC ISLANDS FORUM</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST0009QUF</classCode><className>ISLANDS &amp;

Working Group I deals with the physical science basis of climate change, Working Group II with climate change impacts, adaptation and vulnerability, and Working Group III with climate change mitigation. </p><p> Working Group II is split into two offices, one in Singapore and one based in Delft, Netherlands. </p><p> We, in the Singapore-based technical support unit of the IPCC, together with Delft, have been tasked to lead the report and are keen to ensure that this special report is as inclusive as possible. </p><p> That aspiration underpins our aim to actively involve experts, urban practitioners and civil society in developing the report. </p><p> There are multiple opportunities to participate, and we are inviting early-career scientists, urban planners and regional policymakers to contribute insights and perspectives, ensuring that the report reflects the unique challenges and opportunities faced by cities in diverse physical, spatial and social contexts.</p><p> We hope that these efforts will foster a stronger sense of ownership among urban stakeholders in the region and beyond, to ensure that they feel represented by the report, and make its findings more relevant for action.</p><p> A call to action A report that offers solutions is key as we need science to be translated into decisions that can help cities achieve their sustainability targets. </p><p> Cities will not reach their climate goals without the support and active engagement of those who live, work and make decisions within them. </p><p> For policymakers, the responsibility of building sustainable cities lies largely with those who shape policies and allocate resources. </p><p> The special report will encourage policymakers to implement progressive policies that both reduce physical climate risk and promote low-emissions living by default. </p><p> Imagine a city where energy-efficient housing is the standard, public transportation is widely accessible and affordable, and green spaces are integrated into every neighbourhood. Such environments reduce the need for individual emissions-related decisions and make climate-friendly living the norm.</p><p> For urban practitioners, such as architects, engineers and urban planners, and scientists, they have the expertise to reimagine cities in ways that are functional, resilient to climate risk and sustainable in lifestyle. </p><p> The IPCC report will provide these professionals with the scientific evidence needed to design and implement urban infrastructure resilient to heat, droughts, floods and other hazards, ensure energy efficiency and renewable energy, and incorporate nature-based solutions into urban landscapes. </p><p> Cities are made by and for the people who live in them, and urban residents can play a crucial role by supporting sustainable local initiatives, advocating for green policies and making low-carbon choices in their daily lives. </p><p> By sharing regional insights, the special report will provide a toolkit of best practices, showing cities how to tackle climate challenges in ways that resonate with local contexts.</p><p> Now is the time for urban residents, businesses, civil society organisations, policymakers and professionals to get involved. </p><p> For residents, this means staying informed, advocating for policies that prioritise sustainability and participating in local climate initiatives. </p><p> For policymakers and urban practitioners, it means contributing to the report's recommendations to create environments where people and nature can thrive together. </p><p> Ultimately, the cities we shape today will determine the lives we lead tomorrow. </p><p> The IPCC special report on cities is a call to action for all of us to harness the full potential of our cities in the climate fight, ensuring that they are resilient, inclusive and sustainable for generations to come.</p><p> Dr Winston Chow is the co-chair  of Working Group II of the UN's leading climate science body, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Dr Mukesh Gupta is the science officer of the working group, which focuses on climate change impacts, vulnerabilities and adaptation. Both authors are based at Singapore Management University, and their research looks into climate resilience and strategies to adapt to climate change.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A resident wading through flood waters at a convenience store in Chiang Mai on Oct 6 after Typhoon Yagi swept through Northern Thailand in September.

But we are entering a new era where disruptions will likely happen more frequently,\" Mr Wong said.</p><p> \"So we will have to consider additional redundancies and safety buffers that we can fall back on during a crisis.</p><p> \"Having such buffers does not mean that we will not suffer damage when hit by a shock. But it will enhance our ability to absorb the shock, rebound from the crisis and emerge stronger from it.\"</p><p> While the Government will spend more on resilience, it must also be judicious in using public funds for effective and enduring improvements, he stressed. </p><p> One key strategy is to build organisational capabilities to respond quickly and effectively during crises. </p><p> During the pandemic, for instance, the outbreak in migrant worker dormitories was a major challenge, and the Government had to draw on resources from various agencies to address it, he pointed out.</p><p> Learning from this, the Assurance, Care and Engagement (ACE) Group was set up to monitor the situation in the dormitories and provide better care and support for migrant workers.</p><p> Existing spaces such as vacant schools were also converted at short notice to house recovering migrant workers, and hotels were used as quarantine facilities.</p><p> \"All this reinforces the importance of having adaptable, multi-use facilities,\" he said.</p><p> \"We will therefore study how we can further enhance the resilience of our infrastructure, especially for new major projects like the Tuas Mega Port and Changi Airport Terminal 5.\"</p><p> The Tuas Port is being built 5m above mean sea level and with greener construction materials.   </p><p> The upcoming Changi Airport Terminal 5 will also be more pandemic-proof as well as greener and more energy-efficient. </p><p> The Government has already announced measures to accelerate the country's green energy transition and achieve net zero emissions by 2050.</p><p> But climate-related spending is expected to \"go up significantly\" in the medium term, and Singapore will commit more resources as it progressively implements these extensive infrastructure plans, said Mr Wong. </p><p> For one thing, the current carbon tax rate of $5 per tonne of emissions will go up to $25 in 2024 and 2025. </p><p> It will go up to $45 in 2026 and 2027, before reaching $50 to $80 per tonne by 2030.  </p><p> To facilitate the green energy push, Singapore is harvesting solar energy, transiting to cleaner sources such as hydrogen, and working with its neighbours to develop regional power grids, as well as greening its buildings and opting for cleaner vehicles, among other efforts.</p><p> \"In short, Singapore is doing everything we can to fight climate change.  But we know that our efforts alone will not be enough,\" said Mr Wong.</p><p> \"The rest of the world must also do their part. Unfortunately, in the short term, many countries are increasing their reliance on fossil fuels to prevent the lights from going out, to provide for energy security,\" he added.</p><p> This means that the world will have to redouble its efforts to get back on track with the plans to keep global temperatures from rising beyond a threshold that will result in irreversible damage, he said. </p><p> The world has already warmed by at least 1.1 deg C, and scientists have warned that global warming must be kept to 1.5 deg C in  order to avert the more catastrophic consequences of climate change. </p><p> \"While we will do our best to shape and drive this international agenda, we must also prepare for the worst,\" he added. </p><p> For instance, the polder which is being built on Pulau Tekong is more than halfway complete and set to be finished by end-2024, said Mr Wong. </p><p> A polder is a low-lying tract of land protected from the sea by structures known as dikes. </p><p> The experience gained from this project will give the country more options to protect its coastline against rising sea levels, he noted.</p><p> In 2020, the Government announced a Coastal and Flood Protection Fund with an initial injection of $5 billion to support the construction of coastal and drainage infrastructure.</p><p> Since then, national water agency PUB has announced it will be conducting eight site-specific studies to enhance drainage infrastructure and come up with coastal protection measures for Singapore's 300km of coastlines. </p><p> Three of the eight studies are currently under way, and a fourth will begin in the latter half of the year.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Automated quay cranes and automated guided vehicles at Tuas Port in September 2022.

The six severe storms have taken more than 160 lives and impacted over 10 million people, and caused damage worth an estimated 470 million pesos (S$10 million). </p><p> Speaking at a high-level event on climate adaptation, Mr Stiell noted that nearly half of the human population live in climate vulnerability hot spots, where people are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts. </p><p> \"Personally, I find this deeply disturbing, highly offensive,\" he said. </p><p> Even as he made a renewed plea for countries -- especially the most vulnerable ones -- to start planning for climate change, Mr Stiell called for more innovative financing to channel money to countries that need to build resilience against climate impacts. </p><p> \"We can no longer rely on small streams of finance. We need torrents of funding. They need to be easier to access, especially for the most vulnerable countries that often face the biggest barriers,\" he said. </p><p> Countries previously agreed to have their national adaptation plans ready by 2025, to be implemented by 2030. </p><p> Such plans lay out a country's medium- and long-term solutions to limit the impact of climate change on communities. </p><p> To date, 60 countries -- mostly developing or least developed nations -- have submitted their national plans. South-east Asian countries on the list include Cambodia, Thailand, Timor-Leste and the Philippines. </p><p>Singapore's adaptation efforts are included in its climate targets document, which was last updated in 2022 and submitted to the UN. </p><p> Countries' adaptation costs could rise to US$340 billion (S$456 billion) per year by 2030, reaching as much as US$565 billion per year by 2050, Mr Stiell noted. </p><p> \"The funding exists. We need to unlock and unblock it.\"</p><p> He urged multilateral development banks to think beyond traditional grants and loans, and philanthropies, the private sector and bilateral donors to step up without increasing the debt faced by vulnerable countries. </p><p> \"The people who receive this investment will not disappoint. They want to adapt. Often, they know better than we do just how to adapt,\" he added. </p><p> Adaptation outcomes at COP29 are expected to be closely linked to a new climate finance goal, which will be the summit's primary outcome and define the success of the talks. </p><p> Developing countries are calling for developed nations to commit to US$1.3 trillion per year to help the more vulnerable countries meet their climate targets and adapt to disasters that disproportionately fall on them. </p><p> In its adaptation gap report published in early November, the United Nations Environment Programme found that public finance to help vulnerable countries adapt to climate impacts increased from US$22 billion in 2021 to US$28 billion in 2022. </p><p> But this amount still leaves a huge adaptation finance gap, estimated at between US$187 billion and US$359 billion per year. </p><p> Furthermore, a lack of transparency and accessibility of some countries' climate risks would make the financial system more vulnerable and also hinder access to capital for climate adaptation, said Singapore-based Anjali Viswamohanan, who spoke at the meeting. </p><p> This was a problem highlighted in an analysis of adaptation policies of several Asian markets including China, India and Malaysia published by the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change (AIGCC) in November. </p><p> Ms Viswamohanan, director of policy at AIGCC, cited a survey that found that 49 of 52 of the world's largest institutional investors -- managing roughly US$50.2 trillion in Asia -- have policies on climate risks and opportunities. </p><p> \"This means that a large number of financial institutions understand that climate risk is a financial risk and would be keen to see clear plans from policymakers to address these risks that private capital can contribute to,\" she told ST. </p><p> \"(But) if there is a misalignment (between the private sector and country) of what the risks are, you're not going to align on the type of financing, the type of projects that's required... you will not actually get projects that are investable.\"</p><p> Neighbouring countries also need to consider transboundary climate impacts such as air pollution or haze, and water shortage from a drought, she noted. </p><p> \"But several countries are not adequately thinking about or coordinating on these risks. We found very little concrete information on that in their adaptation plans,\" she added. </p><p> Beyond having a national plan in place, the local communities need to be the ones leading the projects, since every island or province faces differing climate impacts, noted Ms Maheen Khan, an international climate resilience adviser at WWF-Netherlands. She was speaking at a press conference by the World Wide Fund for Nature on the morning of Nov 18 at the summit. </p><p> \"Adaptation is local. So adaptation in Siargao in the Philippines will differ from that in Palawan,\" she said. \"We have to cater to the adaptation needs and risks of the local community, the village that we want to have a solution.\" </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>UN climate chief Simon Stiell says half the human population live in climate vulnerability hot spots, where people are 15 times more likely to die from climate impacts.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-TOE970V</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DFW-5DX1-JCF2-83MH-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-19</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"916\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

In comparison, groupings like Asean are defined geographically, while the United Nations covers all the countries in the world.</p><p> The Commonwealth is somewhere in between on this spectrum. Amid its diversity, it possesses certain advantages derived from a common heritage, such as the use of the English language and similar legal systems, said PM Wong.</p><p> Despite the other Commonwealth countries being at different levels of development, Singapore can learn from all of them, added PM Wong, who arrived in Samoa on Oct 23 for his first Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM). </p><p> One key area is climate change. Given that extreme weather and rising sea levels are a \"wipe-out risk\" for a number of Pacific and Caribbean member states, PM Wong noted that many of them are pressing forward on things like carbon mitigation, carbon capture, new renewable energies and green hydrogen.</p><p> \"These are areas where we can exchange notes, even learn from some of their best practices and also find new areas for cooperation. So that's just one example,\" he said.</p><p> Within the Commonwealth, apart from exchanging best practices and supporting the states at risk, there has been some attempt to mobilise funds towards climate action, added PM Wong. </p><p> He also pointed to the Commonwealth Ocean Declaration launched at the end of CHOGM, where member countries committed to preserving and protecting the oceans, and to cooperating around the blue economy.</p><p> During the CHOGM discussions, various leaders spoke about ways to use the grouping's commonality to strengthen their countries' links, such as in trade and investment and ease of doing business, to emerge as a stronger bloc of countries.</p><p> PM Wong said there is a lot of benefit in doing so, and Singapore will certainly support the grouping's efforts to find new ways of working together and enhancing links.</p><p> The summit was also an opportunity for him to spend \"a lot of time\" engaging Pacific island, Caribbean and African countries, he added. He had earlier held bilateral meetings with his counterparts from Guyana, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, as well as Trinidad and Tobago.</p><p> \"We may not have regular interactions, but meeting them here at the Commonwealth, we are able to engage them and find opportunities to do more together,\" said PM Wong. </p><p> He noted that Singapore's ties with Samoa are warm and friendly, as they are with many Pacific island states, although both sides want to do more together. </p><p> From his discussions, many of them admire Singapore and see it as a model, he added.</p><p> One concrete way that Singapore is working with these countries is through the Pacific Islands Forum, with which it is a dialogue partner.</p><p> The Republic provides capacity-building measures to these states through the Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing package, which includes courses on climate resilience, cyber security and international law.</p><p> PM Wong said: \"I told all of them that... we are more than happy to share our experiences, to customise programmes for them which will be useful for their own developmental needs, and to help them develop and grow as we have succeeded.\"</p><p> Earlier on Oct 26, he met British Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who was also attending his first CHOGM since taking office on July 5.</p><p> In a Facebook post, PM Wong said the two countries share longstanding close ties, as well as a strategic partnership covering many key areas -- defence, sustainability, research and technology, among others. </p><p> \"Look forward to working together to advance our bilateral ties, and strengthen cooperation through the Commonwealth,\" he added.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-AEDONQI</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D8N-ND11-JCF2-814R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"773\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

This year, Ravi Menon, former managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), opened the conference with a keynote address on the Global Finance and Technology Network (GFTN), a new initiative aimed at expanding the SFF beyond its role as a global forum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GFTN will replace Elevandi, which was established in 2021 to \"expand and organise\" the SFF. Menon was announced as the GFTN's chairman on Oct 30, and the MAS's current fintech officer, Sopnendu Mohanty, will join as the group's CEO.</p><p>Menon says there are three key reasons for the formation of GFTN. First is the emergence of new technologies such as asset tokenisation, climate tech, AI and quantum computing, which are progressing rapidly in the financial services industry. This leads to the need for more coherent policies and practices to harness their benefits better and manage their risks, he adds.</p><p>Amid current geopolitical challenges, global platforms and safe spaces are also needed to promote collaboration and achieve common goals. GFTN, a non-state, not-for-profit organisation, aims to be such a platform, says Menon. Despite the growing innovation in the global south, critical gaps in talent, infrastructure, capital and policy must also be addressed in a coordinated manner.</p><p>The GFTN will have four key strategic businesses: forums, advisory, platforms and capital. For its first line of business, GFTN seeks to develop a globally distributed, partnership-driven network of fintech forms. This will be done by sharpening the focus of Elevandi's five existing forums: the Japan Fintech Festival in Tokyo, the Point Zero Forum in Zurich, the Inclusive Fintech Forum in Kigali, the 3i Africa Summit and SFF.</p><p>Additionally, GFTN will expand into new geographies to double its global footprint over the next five years, says Menon. The firm will integrate these various forums into a single network, building momentum through the year to culminate in the SFF.</p><p>In 2025, GFTN will launch its first thematic forum dedicated to fostering innovation and investment in climate technology and innovative sustainability solutions for the financial sector. Menon says that this is due to growing interest in financing climate technology solutions for carbon mitigation and climate resilience.</p><p>In addition, he points out that the GFTN forums will also place a growing emphasis on AI and quantum computing. The coupling of both could unlock huge opportunities and present unprecedented security challenges.</p><p>For its advisory business, GFTN will provide practitioner-led consultancy and capacity-building services in innovation and fintech-related issues. In addition to providing advisory services to developing country authorities to build digital infrastructures, formulate policies, and create innovation ecosystems, GFTN will also offer private entities market insights to support innovation programmes.</p><p>GFTN has already signed a memorandum of understanding with two central banks on fintech advisory services. The first is to support the efforts of the Bank of Namibia to build up its fintech ecosystem and digital public infrastructure, while the second is to support plans by the National Bank of Georgia to grow the country's fintech industry.</p><p>For its third business line platforms, GFTN offers platform services to enhance market access, provide analytics and information services, and support sustainability reporting. This will involve integrating three platforms that the MAS incubated into its network: Apix, Proxtera and Gprnt.</p><p>Apix, a cross-border open architecture platform, was co-founded by the MAS, the Asean Bankers Association and the International Finance Corporation in 2018. According to Menon, the Apix network now includes over 110 financial institutions and 2000 fintech firms from 90 countries.</p><p>Proxtera is a digital platform for small and medium enterprises to generate trusted digital credentials and access cross-border trade and financing. Launched by the MAS and the Infocomm Media Development Authority in 2018, it helps to bridge global trade for enterprises in Rwanda, Ghana, Chongqing and Cambodia.</p><p>The third platform, Gprnt, is a digital platform for verifiable environmental, social and governance (ESG) data and reporting launched by MAS in 2023. Gprnt is now focusing on piloting its tools with financial institutions, corporations, trade associations and government agencies. About 20 public and private sector organisations in Singapore have expressed and registered their interest, Menon adds.</p><p>GFTN's last strategic business is capital, where it aims to catalyse equity investments into early and growth-stage enterprises with the potential to succeed commercially and make a positive social impact.</p><p>\"We will provide these enterprises with patient capital to give them the time and space to build up the capabilities to succeed. We are already seeing promising investment ideas emanate from our existing GFTN ecosystem, which we aim to translate into high-quality deals with our fund investors. We will partner with world-class venture funds and asset managers to check on their investment expertise and investment infrastructure,\" says Menon. The fund has yet to apply for a licence with the MAS, and the central bank will not contribute to it.</p><p>Moving forward, Menon says GFTN will continue to work closely with its partners and the MAS to enhance the connectivity of the Singapore fintech ecosystem with regional and global markets. He adds: \"GFTN is here to serve a greater purpose - to harness the power of technology for a more efficient and resilient financial system, more inclusive financial services, expanded economic opportunities for broader segments of societies and a sustainable planet.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">EDGESI-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DD6-HKF1-DYX1-V2HF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 The Edge Publishing PTE.

There is also a need to minimise the \"black box syndrome\", where the massive amount of data, complexity of algorithms and dynamic nature of AI systems make results difficult to interpret and explain, he added. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Accountability is another factor, noted Mr Menon in his keynote address at the Singapore FinTech Festival. \"How can we hold humans ultimately responsible for decisions made by self-learning algorithms and machines? You cannot charge a machine for negligence in a court of law. You need to charge a person.\" </p><p> There is also a need to minimise unconscious bias, social exclusion and ethically unacceptable outcomes. </p><p> \"AI models trained on incomplete or biased data can generate seemingly plausible but unsound predictions. These can in turn lead to flawed financial decisions regarding credit or investments,\" said Mr Menon, chairman of the Global Finance and Technology Network (GFTN), a not-for-profit entity newly formed by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS). </p><p> GFTN's forums will have a growing emphasis on AI and quantum computing. Conferences are one of the network's four business lines, along with advisory and research services, digital platform services for firms, and an investment fund for technology start-ups.</p><p> If quantum technologies take off, the coupling of AI and quantum computing could unlock huge opportunities, as well as unprecedented security challenges, said Mr Menon. </p><p> GFTN forums will aim to address the pros and cons of various AI models and strengthen governance frameworks around AI, among other areas. </p><p> AI has been deployed in financial services through the likes of deep-learning models that analyse multiple layers of complex data to train sophisticated artificial neural networks. </p><p> For example, Ant International uses such models to assess a loan applicant's credit-worthiness by analysing thousands of data points from its online behaviour and digital footprint.</p><p> Large language models -- a specific tool within generative AI (gen AI) -- can process massive amounts of text data to predict human language patterns and create content. JP Morgan's large language model can, for instance, review 12,000 commercial credit agreements in seconds, a task which previously consumed 360,000 hours of work each year. </p><p> Gen AI can track transactions based on location, device and operating system, flagging any anomaly or behaviour that does not fit expected patterns, noted Mr Menon. Gen AI can also be used to provide personalised financial advice based on customers' goals, risk profiles, income levels and spending habits.  </p><p> Climate technology is another area the financial industry is focusing on. Gprnt, MAS' digital platform for environmental, social and governance reporting and data, released tools on Nov 6 to help businesses with their sustainability reporting and enable them to navigate related solutions.</p><p> Mr Menon said Gprnt will focus on piloting the use of these tools with financial institutions, corporates, trade associations and government agencies. Twenty public and private sector organisations in Singapore have already registered their interest. </p><p> Meanwhile, GFTN will launch in 2025 its first forum dedicated to fostering innovation and investment in climate tech, and sustainability solutions for the financial sector. </p><p> \"Addressing climate change has become a priority in the financial sector, with growing interest in financing climate tech solutions for both carbon mitigation and climate resilience,\" said Mr Menon, who is also Singapore's ambassador for climate action. </p><p> GFTN will also sharpen the focus of Elevandi's five existing forums, which include the Singapore FinTech Festival, and expand into new geographies to double its global footprint over the next five years. </p><p> The network will replace Elevandi -- the company limited by guarantee set up by MAS four years ago to organise the Singapore FinTech Festival. Mr Menon previously described the new entity as \"Elevandi on steroids\", with an expanded reach beyond the forums business. </p><p> When it comes to funding, the network will catalyse equity investments in early- and growth-stage enterprises with potential to succeed commercially and make a positive social impact, in areas such as financial inclusion and environmental sustainability. </p><p> \"We will provide these enterprises with patient capital, to give them the time and space to build up the capabilities to succeed,\" said Mr Menon on Nov 6. </p><p> The network will partner world-class venture funds and asset management firms to tap their investment expertise and infrastructure, he added. </p><p> It has also signed memorandums of understanding with two central banks on fintech advisory services. The first is to support the Bank of Namibia's efforts to build its fintech ecosystem and digital public infrastructure. The network will also help the National Bank of Georgia grow the country's fintech industry.  </p><p> Mr Menon also announced the names of GFTN's board of directors, which includes ProsperCap Corporation chief executive Iqbal Jumabhoy, Sun Life Canada president Jessica Tan and GFTN group CEO-designate Sopnendu Mohanty. They will be guided by an international advisory board, which includes Ant Group chairman and CEO Eric Jing and former UBS chairman and ex-Deutsche Bundesbank president Axel Weber.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Global Finance and Technology Network chairman Ravi Menon speaking at the Singapore FinTech Festival on Nov 6.

The PIF is the key regional forum in the Pacific that seeks to foster cooperation among its members and collaboration with external partners. This is the second time that Singapore is attending the PIF Leaders Meeting as a Dialogue Partner, following our admission in January 2022.  Minister Maliki delivered remarks during the PIF Leaders' session with Dialogue Partners on 28 August 2024. Minister Maliki highlighted that Singapore, as a fellow Small Island Developing State, understood the challenges faced by the Pacific, in particular climate change. He reaffirmed Singapore's support for the capacity-building efforts of the Pacific, through the customised \"Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing\" (SPARKS) technical assistance package launched at the last PIF Leaders Meeting in November 2023. The transcript of Minister Maliki's remarks is atAnnex.  During his visit, Minister Maliki met several leaders from the Pacific, including PIF Chair and Tonga Prime Minister Siaosi Sovaleni, PIF Secretary General Baron Waqa, Papua New Guinea Prime Minister James Marape, New Zealand Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs Winston Peters, Federated States of Micronesia Secretary for Foreign Affairs Lorin S. Robert, Marshall Islands Minister of Foreign Affairs and Trade Kalani Kaneko, Nauru Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade Lionel Aingimea and Tuvalu Minister for Foreign Affairs, Labour and Trade Paulson Panapa. </p><p>Minister Maliki had good discussions with these leaders on the Pacific's priorities and how Singapore could collaborate with them on both bilateral and multilateral fronts.<br/><br/>. . . . .<br/><br/>MINISTRY OF FOREIGN AFFAIRS SINGAPORE 28 AUGUST 2024<br/><br/>Annex  MINISTER IN THE PRIME MINISTER'S OFFICE AND SECOND MINISTER FOR EDUCATION AND SECOND MINISTER FOR FOREIGN AFFAIRS DR MOHAMAD MALIKI OSMAN'SINTERVENTION AT THE PACIFIC LEADERS FORUM LEADERS SESSION WITH DIALOGUE PARTNERSIN NUKU'ALOFA, TONGA, 28 AUGUST 2024<br/><br/>Honourable Hu'akavameiliku Siaosi Sovaleni, Prime Minister of the Kingdom of Tonga and Chair of the 53rdPacific Islands Forum (PIF),  His Excellency Baron Waqa, Secretary General of the PIF,  Excellencies,  Distinguished Guests,  Ladies and Gentlemen,  Malo e lelei. First, let me warmly congratulate Tonga for assuming chairmanship of the PIF. I would also like to congratulate the Cook Islands on its successful chairmanship and for steering the PIF over the past year.  Your Excellencies, I address you today not just as a Dialogue Partner of the PIF, but also as a fellow member of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) who appreciates the unique challenges that we face.It is precisely this understanding that drives Singapore's commitment to support the Pacific's implementation of the2050 Strategy for the Blue Pacific Continent. Allow me to share three points that underscore how Singapore is committed to supporting our Pacific partners.  First, addressing climate change and rising sea levels. As low-lying island states, we are at the frontline of facing rising sea levels, extreme weather events, and environment degradation. Climate change adaptation is a top priority for many of us. Singapore stands ready to share our experiences with our Pacific friends. For example, we are now planning to build a \"Long Island\" for coastal protection by reclaiming land at a higher level some distance away from our current coastline. Singapore wants to work together with the Pacific to address climate change by upholding and implementing the Paris Agreement, which we believe is our best hope to galvanise a collective solution to the complex, multi-dimensional problem of climate change. For the upcoming COP-29, we must continue to work together to keep the 1.5-degree Celsius goal within reach, including by reaching an ambitious outcome on a New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, which recognises the special circumstances of SIDS.  Second, building resilient economies and societies. The theme for this year's PIF Leaders' Meeting - \"Transformative Resilient Pasifiki: Build Better Now\"- is very timely. We fully support Tonga's priorities on building resilient health and education systems. Over the years, Singapore has conducted many capacity-building courses in health and education through the Singapore Cooperation Programme. The Programme has welcomed more than 6,100 Pacific officials over the past three decades. This year alone, we are organising seven courses on education and five courses on health. PIF members, as Small Island Developing States, will have priority access to these courses.  Your Excellencies, last year, we launched the Singapore-Pacific Resilience and Knowledge Sharing, or SPARKS, package - a specially customised three-year programme to support the Pacific's \"Regional Collective Actions\" as outlined in the2050 Strategyin three areas: climate resilience, cybersecurity and international law. I am pleased to update that we welcomed the first group of officials from the Pacific for the inaugural course on climate resilience in Singapore in May this year. The next course on international law, with a particular focus on climate and sea-level rise issues, will be held in November. We also launched the \"SIDS of Change\" technical assistance package at the Fourth International Conference on SIDS in May this year,which includes new customised programmes on emerging issues including blue carbon and digitalisation. We welcome our Pacific partners to participate actively in the SPARKS and SIDS of Change programmes.  Third, amplifying our collective voice. Many of the threats that we face, such as climate change and marine biodiversity loss, cannot be overcome by any single country alone. Singapore will continue working steadfastly with our Pacific partners at multilateral fora,including through the Alliance of Small Island States and the Forum of Small States,to advance our shared interests on the international stage. Singapore is honoured to work with our Pacific partners to achieve concrete progress. Last year, we successfully concluded the landmark agreement under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction, or better known as the BBNJ Agreement. The Agreement is crucial for SIDS like us, which depend on oceans and their biodiversity for our livelihoods. It is encouraging that most of the PIF members have signed on to the Agreement.Singapore is committed to the BBNJ Agreement and will be ratifying the Agreement very soon.  Your Excellencies, to conclude, Singapore has been a longstanding and steadfast supporter of the Pacific's development. During the third Singapore-Pacific High-Level Visit hosted by Singapore in May this year, I was encouraged by the Pacific leaders' strong commitment to turn vision into action. Singapore will continue to do our part to ensure that no one is left behind in our journey towards creating a better tomorrow for our people.  Malo 'aupito.

The authors highlighted three key economic impacts of heatwaves: lower agricultural output, diminished labour productivity, and greater occurrences of power outages, which can cause major disruptions to industries and hit a country's energy security.</p><p> These impacts have been especially pronounced over the past year due to the El Nino climate pattern -- which brings warmer conditions to the Pacific Ocean -- as well as the effects of climate change.The resulting heatwaves have had serious effects on Asian agriculture. In Japan, the 2023 heatwave caused quality issues with rice, leading to a shortage. In Vietnam, the heatwave earlier this year affected Robusta coffee production, causing bean prices to hit new highs.</p><p>  Food price inflation may have a spillover effect on core inflation by influencing expectations of consumers and businesses, the HSBC report noted. </p><p> Diminished labour productivity is another major economic impact of heatwaves. By 2030, more than 2 per cent of total working hours worldwide could be lost every year amid higher temperatures, according to a report by the International Labour Organization. In South Asia alone, under the scenario that global temperatures rise 1.5 deg C by the end of the century, heat stress would lead to a loss of 5.3 per cent of working hours in 2030, said the HSBC report. This corresponds to 43 million full-time jobs.</p><p> Energy security is yet another key issue, with countries facing grid overloads and power outages amid extreme heat. In Vietnam, major industrial parks in the north housing multinationals suffered power cuts in mid-2023. Given Asia's central role in global supply chains, disruptions to local manufacturing, shipping and logistics may drive up global tradable inflation, the HSBC report's authors noted.</p><p> \"In the context of intense competition among Asian economies to attract foreign direct investment from companies that look to diversify production bases, this makes host countries' energy policies and investment in energy infrastructure more important than ever,\" they said.</p><p> That said, there is a risk that governments respond to heatwaves in ways that worsen climate change, such as by ramping up coal usage or handing out more fossil fuel subsidies to boost energy supply. This is where it becomes crucial for policymakers to maintain a long-term perspective on climate resilience to minimise such knee-jerk reactions, while continuing to invest in the transition towards renewable energy. </p><p> For now, Asia is enjoying some respite from heat since the end of El Nino. However, the lessons from the past year's heatwaves should spur countries to enhance their heat resilience, especially as weather patterns become increasingly uncertain. </p><p> For foreign investors, a city's heat resilience could eventually become a non-negotiable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-VFCAH51</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CW5-7G61-JCF2-800N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"544\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

It has prompted shifts in behaviour, and inspired concerted action. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Governments worldwide are enacting regulatory measures, such as carbon taxes, subsidies for electric vehicles (EVs), and plans for green infrastructure development. Businesses are committing to net-zero emissions, setting science-based targets, and encouraging their supply chains to adopt more sustainable practices. Consumers increasingly favour sustainable products, and are altering their spending patterns accordingly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Meanwhile, some investors are advocating for action, heightening their focus on climate-related risks and setting minimum climate standards, which in turn influences portfolio allocations.</p><p> Although these transformations pose risks to asset prices, we recognise that they also herald a unique investment opportunity for our generation. </p><p> We advocate for a climate strategy that yields both environmental and financial returns, moving beyond traditional approaches. Generally, strategies focused solely on low emissions often rely on historical data without adequately accounting for shifts in business models or the tangible impacts on the environment. </p><p> Similarly, while green bond strategies contribute to funding eco-friendly projects, a strategy exclusively centred on green bonds may suffer from limited diversification, lower yield return and extended durations.</p><p> Such traditional methodologies do not sufficiently address the physical consequences of climate change, nor do they focus adequately on adaptation. Current policies place us on a trajectory towards a 2.4 degree Celsius increase in global temperatures, a scenario corroborated by our climate analysis. This warming path is likely to exacerbate weather volatility and temperature extremes, affecting both society at large and asset values.</p><p> Crafting a solutionAt the heart of a favourable solution is the conviction that climate outcomes should prioritise real-world emissions reduction, support the transition to a low-carbon economy, and facilitate adaptation to the inevitable impacts of climate change. Every investment decision should be made through a climate lens, necessitating a bespoke framework. This approach, coupled with a global opportunity set and a strategy focused on best ideas, is designed to yield compelling returns and income.</p><p> Climate transition in Asia will likely be core to the outcomes that are achieved on a global level considering the size of Asia's population, projected economic growth, exposure to higher emitting industries, and the opportunity to potentially leapfrog high-emitting technologies and adopt low-carbon solutions. Asian companies are often national, regional or even global leaders in their respective industries, which could translate to meaningful impact when they adopt more sustainable trajectories. </p><p> Covering the global universe, the strategy centres on identifying and investing in ambitious companies that are leading the charge in their respective industries. These trailblazers are making significant strides in real-world decarbonisation, disrupting traditional business models, pioneering innovative technologies, and responding proactively to evolving consumer demands. By aligning with such leaders, investors may capitalise on the growth of the climate market and achieve superior performance.</p><p> Three types of companies are worth a look -- those in high-emitting sectors that are setting the standard for emissions reduction; innovators who are developing the technologies and products essential for decarbonisation efforts; and entities that help societies adjust to the impacts of climate change and contribute to global climate resilience. </p><p> By carefully selecting companies that align with these themes, investors may seize a significant growth opportunity and contribute meaningfully to the efforts against climate change.</p><p> Fixed income instruments, including green and municipal bonds, are pivotal in channelling funds towards projects aimed at enhancing climate resilience. A comprehensive fixed income strategy should span various segments -- investment-grade, high-yield, and emerging market debt. </p><p> An additional nuance within the Asian bond universe is the presence of large state-owned enterprises that are focused on delivering policy objectives instead of solely profit, allowing bond investors the opportunity to lend to issuers that are involved in national infrastructure projects that are part of the government's strategy to move towards a low-carbon economy.</p><p> We currently see the opportunities in Asia in the renewable energy space, EVs and its corresponding value chain, as well as large corporates that are adopting more sustainable ways of manufacturing their products. </p><p> We expect the potential pipeline from Asia to continue to grow, and could span a wide variety of opportunities including low carbon materials production and climate adaptation.</p><p> Selecting the right theme is merely the beginning. Active company selection becomes crucial in ensuring that investments genuinely enhance the portfolio's value. </p><p> For credit investors, the application of environmental, social and governance (ESG) standards across all issuers requires careful consideration, especially given the disparities between high-yield and investment-grade issuers. High-yield issuers -- often smaller or newer companies -- may not have the luxury of dedicated ESG teams, established green-bond frameworks, or the capacity to generate comprehensive sustainability reports. Consequently, companies genuinely committed to sustainability might be overlooked due to their inability to showcase their ESG credentials prominently.</p><p> A recent example is Ardagh Metal Packaging, a US-listed global producer of infinitely recyclable metal drinks cans. Until recently, this company lagged in ESG disclosures despite its strong alignment with sustainability, particularly within the circular economy and waste reduction sectors. In 2022, its recycling initiatives were estimated to have avoided 3.7 million tonnes of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions compared to using virgin materials.</p><p> This case highlights that ESG assessment should transcend mere box-ticking; there is no substitute for thorough research. Investors adept at identifying firms with commendable ESG practices, albeit with limited disclosure, stand to gain by investing ahead of the curve, before enhanced transparency garners wider market recognition. </p><p> A promising landscapeThe future of climate change investing looks bright, buoyed by the escalating global emphasis on environmental sustainability. Despite concerns, we maintain that the burgeoning demand for climate-related investments will not alone lead to overvaluation. The arena of climate transition presents a vast and perpetually evolving landscape of opportunities, far from being exhausted by current interest levels.</p><p> Most importantly, we believe a climate change investment strategy should have a dual objective -- achieving meaningful climate impact alongside robust financial returns. This approach transcends mere trend-following. It is about pinpointing and supporting innovative companies that lead the charge in industry transformation and real-world decarbonisation efforts. </p><p> This strategy opens the door to a wide spectrum of opportunities, enabling investors to engage with ventures that are not just promising in terms of returns but are also pivotal in the global transition to a more sustainable future.</p><p> It is imperative to curate a well-balanced portfolio encompassing leaders in emissions reduction, innovators in technology, and contributors to climate adaptation. This diversified strategy ensures resilience against potential overvaluation in any single region, sector or asset class by spreading exposure across the varied facets of climate transition.</p><p> The writer is investment director of fixed income, abrdn</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Opportunities in Asia include companies in renewable energy, electric vehicles and the corresponding value chain, and manufacturers adopting more sustainable practices.

This further burdens public finances and diverts funds from other priorities such as healthcare and education, said Melvyn Yeo, managing partner of venture capital firm Trirec. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As it is, they are already struggling to adequately fund climate resilience and adaptation projects needed to mitigate the effects of extreme weather events, the region being one of the most vulnerable to the adverse impacts of climate change. </p><p> This includes rebuilding critical infrastructure such as coastal defences, early warning systems and resilient housing, as well as other sustainable development projects, observers told The Business Times. </p><p> Unfortunately, emerging markets in this region are stuck between a rock and hard place. </p><p> On the private capital front, the higher risks involved in investing in South-east Asia -- whether actual or perceived -- have often either kept investors away, or resulted in expectations of a higher premium on returns. </p><p> Given the limitations in public funds, these markets may explore alternative financing strategies -- such as issuing sovereign labelled bonds, leveraging public-private partnerships or seeking technical assistance from international organisations, said Melissa Cheok, associate director of environmental, social and governance investment research at ratings agency Sustainable Fitch.</p><p> However, these measures may not fully compensate for the shortfall in the climate finance quantum eked out at the recent COP29 summit, and therefore could potentially lead to slower progress in achieving their climate and sustainable development goals. </p><p> Close to 200 countries were hammering out a climate finance agreement over two weeks in windowless tents in Baku, Azerbaijan, with battle lines drawn between developing countries often suffering the brunt of climate change impacts despite contributing the least to climate change, and developed countries obligated to provide public funds to these countries due to their historical contribution to global warming. </p><p> After threats of a walk-out by some negotiating parties, they eventually settled on a quantum of US$300 billion per year till 2035 -- far below the US$1 trillion annually that economists have said is needed -- more than 32 hours after the summit overran. </p><p> Known as the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, this new sum of US$300 billion will supersede the previous target of at least US$100 billion a year, which expires in 2025.</p><p> It is part of a wider effort to scale up climate financing to US$1.3 trillion every year until 2035, with the remaining US$1 trillion to be mobilised \"from all public and private sources\", though details on how this could be achieved remained unfinished. </p><p> Policy supportRaising that remaining US$1 trillion is going to be a challenge, said Antony Warren, founder and chief executive officer of family office Eden Impact. </p><p> While the rules governing the international trading of carbon credits -- known as Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement -- could help rebuild confidence in carbon markets and channel more private capital into climate-focused investments, policy support from Asean governments remains key to attracting private investors, he added. </p><p> Even though private capital has a role to play in the energy transition, it cannot be expected to do it alone, said Melissa Moi, head of sustainable business at the corporate sustainability office at UOB.</p><p> \"Private participation depends on commerciality. Investment and financing decisions must be financially viable, which can happen only if regulatory policy creates a conducive environment,\" she added. </p><p> Some basic building blocks include greater transparency through better governance and reporting, policy consistency and stability. This will give investors more confidence, especially in infrastructure projects that have a long-term horizon, as well as some degree of certainty around the future, financiers and observers told BT. </p><p> Cutting down bureaucratic hurdles of green projects could also scale them faster, and make them more attractive to private investment. </p><p> \"In Asia, one impediment to scaling up projects has been the propensity to haggle over contracts, which takes time. In Asean, for example, energy regulations vary across markets, often leading to power purchase agreement delays,\" said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer of OCBC. </p><p> Standardising contractual arrangements across the region could help green projects take off more quickly, he added. </p><p> Ensuring the commercial viability of new green climate technologies and solutions by creating market demand through policies and regulations is also another piece to the puzzle. That is because nascent green technologies are typically too costly to implement and lack demand, said Ng. </p><p> One example is Singapore's mandate for flights leaving Changi Airport to include sustainable aviation fuel in their fuel mix from 2026. </p><p> Aligning the Asean taxonomy on sustainable finance with other regional ones to develop commonalities on the definition of green economic activities could reduce concerns about greenwashing, said Tiza Mafira, director at Climate Policy Initiative. </p><p> Other forms of policy reforms could be potentially more challenging to implement, such as imposing a carbon tax regime for the region, as suggested by Ng. </p><p> \"The carbon tax will put a price on carbon and steer regional investments towards low-carbon alternatives in existing as well as new technologies,\" he added. </p><p> Of course, the biggest sacred cow in South-east Asia is fossil fuel subsidies. </p><p> With public funds already scarce, there is a need to optimise every dollar by shifting it away from fossil fuel subsidies, said Mafira. </p><p> The money should be redirected towards derisking and incentivising decarbonisation projects (such as the early closure of coal plants), as well as developing key enabling infrastructure (such as electricity grid optimisation). </p><p> However, that has yet to take place in many South-east Asian governments as it is a political hot potato. </p><p>Indonesia did not touch on its fossil fuel subsidy reform when it announced its grand plans to accelerate its climate ambitions during COP29 and a week later at the G20 summit at Brazil. </p><p> Nonetheless, observers said that Indonesia's move to bring forward its net-zero target by a decade to 2050 and close all of its fossil fuel plants by 2040 is a positive step. </p><p> While such initiatives can instill confidence in investors about the region's dedication to climate action, much will hinge on whether supportive policies are implemented and actionable strategies are put in place to facilitate their execution, said Cheok.</p><p> Yeo said that investors will still watch out for whether there is transparent and efficient implementations of such policies, given previous examples of bureaucratic delays and policy reversals in the past in the region.  </p><p> One week after Indonesia unveiled its new climate targets, it said that it will review plans to export clean electricity as the government prioritises national interests and sustainability in allocating natural energy resources. </p><p> Blended financeBesides policy support, greater innovation in financial instruments combined with blended finance mechanisms will move the needle most when attracting climate investments, said Clare Shakya, global managing director of climate of environmental non-profit The Nature Conservancy. </p><p> Blended finance is a capital-raising approach that leans on investors with higher risk appetites, such as development funds and philanthropists or governments, to provide concessional or catalytic capital to pull in more commercial investors. </p><p> A lower cost of capital, achieved through such structures, can improve the bankability of projects that would otherwise not be able to secure private capital. This is especially the case for emerging markets in South-east Asia, where a higher cost of capital has been a hurdle to the deployment of private capital, said Helge Muenkel, chief sustainability officer of DBS Bank.</p><p> To this end, Singapore said that it will commit US$500 million as concessional capital to support a blended-finance initiative, known as the Financing Asia's Transition Partnership (Fast-P), at COP29. It also launched a third investment fund under Fast-P, which will focus on decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, with BlackRock as its fund manager.</p><p> Observers said that Singapore's initiative is commendable. But to fully mobilise private capital, it is also essential to have strong institutional frameworks and a pipeline of bankable projects, said Cheok. </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Close to 200 countries were hammering out a climate finance agreement at the COP29 summit, with battle lines drawn between developing countries often suffering the brunt of climate change, and developed countries obligated to provide funds due to their historical contribution to global warming.

This includes rebuilding critical infrastructure such as coastal defences, early warning systems and resilient housing, as well as other sustainable development projects, observers told The Business Times.

Known as the New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance, this new sum of US$300 billion will supersede the previous target of at least US$100 billion a year, which expires in 2025.It is part of a wider effort to scale up climate financing to US$1.3 trillion every year until 2035, with the remaining US$1 trillion to be mobilised \u00e2\u20ac\u0153from all public and private sources\u00e2\u20ac, though details on how this could be achieved remained unfinished. Policy supportRaising that remaining US$1 trillion is going to be a challenge, said Antony Warren, founder and chief executive officer of family office Eden Impact. While the rules governing the international trading of carbon credits \u00e2\u20ac\u201c known as Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement \u00e2\u20ac\u201c could help rebuild confidence in carbon markets and channel more private capital into climate-focused investments, policy support from Asean governments remains key to attracting private investors, he added. Even though private capital has a role to play in the energy transition, it cannot be expected to do it alone, said Melissa Moi, head of sustainable business at the corporate sustainability office at UOB.\u00e2\u20ac\u0153Private participation depends on commerciality. Investment and financing decisions must be financially viable, which can happen only if regulatory policy creates a conducive environment,\u00e2\u20ac she added. Some basic building blocks include greater transparency through better governance and reporting, policy consistency and stability. This will give investors more confidence, especially in infrastructure projects that have a long-term horizon, as well as some degree of certainty around the future, financiers and observers told BT. Cutting down bureaucratic hurdles of green projects could also scale them faster, and make them more attractive to private investment. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153In Asia, one impediment to scaling up projects has been the propensity to haggle over contracts, which takes time. In Asean, for example, energy regulations vary across markets, often leading to power purchase agreement delays,\u00e2\u20ac said Mike Ng, chief sustainability officer of OCBC. Standardising contractual arrangements across the region could help green projects take off more quickly, he added. Ensuring the commercial viability of new green climate technologies and solutions by creating market demand through policies and regulations is also another piece to the puzzle. That is because nascent green technologies are typically too costly to implement and lack demand, said Ng. One example is Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s mandate for flights leaving Changi Airport to include sustainable aviation fuel in their fuel mix from 2026. Aligning the Asean taxonomy on sustainable finance with other regional ones to develop commonalities on the definition of green economic activities could reduce concerns about greenwashing, said Tiza Mafira, director at Climate Policy Initiative. Other forms of policy reforms could be potentially more challenging to implement, such as imposing a carbon tax regime for the region, as suggested by Ng. \u00e2\u20ac\u0153The carbon tax will put a price on carbon and steer regional investments towards low-carbon alternatives in existing as well as new technologies,\u00e2\u20ac he added. Of course, the biggest sacred cow in South-east Asia is fossil fuel subsidies. With public funds already scarce, there is a need to optimise every dollar by shifting it away from fossil fuel subsidies, said Mafira. The money should be redirected towards derisking and incentivising decarbonisation projects (such as the early closure of coal plants), as well as developing key enabling infrastructure (such as electricity grid optimisation). However, that has yet to take place in many South-east Asian governments as it is a political hot potato. Indonesia did not touch on its fossil fuel subsidy reform when it announced its grand plans to accelerate its climate ambitions during COP29 and a week later at the G20 summit at Brazil. Nonetheless, observers said that Indonesia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s move to bring forward its net zero target by a decade to 2050 and close all of its fossil fuel plants by 2040 is a positive step. While such initiatives can instill confidence in investors about the region\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s dedication to climate action, much will hinge on whether supportive policies are implemented and actionable strategies are put in place to facilitate their execution, said Cheok.Yeo said that investors will still watch out for whether there is transparent and efficient implementations of such policies, given previous examples of bureaucratic delays and policy reversals in the past in the region.\u00c2\u00a0\u00c2\u00a0One week after Indonesia unveiled its new climate targets, it said that it will review plans to export clean electricity as the government prioritises national interests and sustainability in allocating natural energy resources. Blended financeBesides policy support, greater innovation in financial instruments combined with blended finance mechanisms will move the needle most when attracting climate investments, said Clare Shakya, global managing director of climate of environmental non-profit The Nature Conservancy. Blended finance is a capital-raising approach that leans on investors with higher risk appetites, such as development funds and philanthropists or governments, to provide concessional or catalytic capital to pull in more commercial investors.\u00c2\u00a0A lower cost of capital, achieved through such structures, can improve the bankability of projects that would otherwise not be able to secure private capital. This is especially the case for emerging markets in South-east Asia, where a higher cost of capital has been a hurdle to the deployment of private capital, said Helge Muenkel, chief sustainability officer of DBS Bank.To this end, Singapore said that it will commit US$500 million as concessional capital to support a blended-finance initiative, known as the Financing Asia\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s Transition Partnership (Fast-P), at COP29. It also launched a third investment fund under Fast-P, which will focus on decarbonising hard-to-abate sectors, with BlackRock as its fund manager.Observers said that Singapore\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s initiative is commendable. But to fully mobilise private capital, it is also essential to have strong institutional frameworks and a pipeline of bankable projects, said Cheok. In Asia, one impediment to scaling up projects has been the propensity to haggle over contracts, which takes time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Close to 200 countries were hammering out a climate finance agreement with battle lines drawn between developing countries often suffering the brunt of climate change, and developed countries obligated to provide funds due to their historical contribution to global warming.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DJD-TK11-DYX4-0006-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-01</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1532\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

These followed \"substantive progress\" since the five companies received the conditional approvals a year ago.</p><p> These developments were announced during the Indonesia International Sustainability Forum in Jakarta on Thursday (Sep 5). Singapore's Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, along with Minister for Manpower and Second Minister for Trade and Industry Tan See Leng, also delivered remarks at the forum.</p><p> Low-carbon electricity imports are part of Singapore's overall efforts to decarbonise the power sector, which currently accounts for about 40 per cent of the nation's carbon emissions. </p><p> In a statement, EMA announced that due to \"strong interest from credible parties in electricity import projects\" and the need to ensure sufficient supply for Singapore's future energy needs, it is raising its low-carbon power import target to 6 GW, up from the 4 GW set three years ago.</p><p> The approvals and licences granted on Thursday to the seven projects build on multiple memoranda of understanding between Indonesia and Singapore in the area of energy cooperation that were signed between 2022 and 2023. </p><p>Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Investment and Maritime Affairs, Luhut Pandjaitan, highlighted that the total investment value of the seven projects amounts to as much as US$20 billion.</p><p> The authority said the agreements strengthen both countries' commitment to cross-border energy trading, interconnections and investments in renewable industries such as solar photovoltaics and battery storage in Indonesia.</p><p> The two new projects include a 1 GW project led by Singa Renewable -- a joint venture between TotalEnergies and RGE, while the second one with an import capacity of 0.4 GW will be developed by Shell Eastern Trading in collaboration with Vena Energy.</p><p> Rachmat Kaimuddin, Indonesia's deputy coordinating minister for maritime affairs and investments in infrastructure and transportation, stated that the two new projects are expected to begin exporting power to Singapore by 2030. The power will come from solar panel installations in the Riau Islands and will be transmitted via new sub-sea cables which are currently under study.</p><p> Speaking at the forum, SM Teo said: \"We need stronger transmission systems to underpin our regional energy transition and to build climate resilience. If we want a truly interconnected regional grid in Asean, we must work together to develop sub-sea cables and this will allow electricity to be traded along multiple routes and in multiple directions.\"</p><p> In a separate statement, William Goh, global head of renewable energy at RGE, said that both RGE and TotalEnergies are committed to providing a win-win solution for Indonesia and Singapore. </p><p> The five companies that were awarded conditional licences received the conditional go-ahead last September, and had since undertaken marine surveys, feasibility studies, and met requirements from both Indonesia and Singapore. They will aim for commercial operations by 2028.</p><p> EMA states that conditional licences are granted to electricity import projects deemed technically and commercially viable, and at an advanced development stage. Once obligations are met, an electricity importer licence may be issued to begin construction and operations.</p><p>Singapore has received more than 20 proposals including from Asian and European energy giants, as well as Australia's Sun Cable, vying for its coveted import licence for clean energy. </p><p> Following the latest development, the Republic has granted the green light in various forms, and subject to conditions, for the import of up to some 5.6 GW of low-carbon electricity from its neighbours. </p><p> These involve plans for 3.4 GW of electricity -- mostly solar -- from Indonesia; 1 GW of solar, hydropower and potentially wind from Cambodia; and 1.2 GW of clean electricity from Vietnam, to be largely powered by offshore wind energy.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Indonesia's Coordinating Minister for Investment and Maritime Affairs Luhut Pandjaitan (sixth from left) flanked by Tan See Leng, Singapore's minister for manpower and second minister for trade and industry, and Senior Minister Teo Chee Hean, at the signing of the MOU.

The Ministry of Finance today published the eighth edition of the Singapore Public Sector Outcomes Review (SPOR). SPOR, a biennial report, provides insights into how Singapore has fared in key areas of national interest, ranging from lifelong learning, health, housing and sustainability, economy, to security and diplomacy.</p><p>SPOR 2024 Key Themes</p><p>2. SPOR 2024 showcases the opportunities that Singaporeans have at every stage of life, how the Government is working towards quality and sustainable living, its efforts to safeguard Singapore's shared future and place in the world, as well as sustaining a strong and resilient economy. The report also highlights areas where Singaporeans have partnered one another and the Government, to own, shape and act on our shared future together.</p><p>3. Head of Civil Service, Mr Leo Yip, said, \"SPOR 2024 underscores the strides Singapore has made in key areas of national interest - with more opportunities for citizens, a quality living environment, a safe and secure Singapore, as well as a strong and resilient economy. It has also been heartening to see the Government, Singaporeans and businesses coming together as part of the Forward Singapore exercise to develop and implement initiatives that support and uplift the community. The Public Service remains committed to working with Singaporeans to address gaps and to build our shared future together.\"</p><p>Theme 1: Opportunities for All, at Every Stage of Life</p><p>4. Progress has been made to create opportunities for Singaporeans at every stage of their lives, from early education to retirement.</p><p>*Affordable and quality education: The number of full-day preschool places has increased to over 200,000 to meet demand. Preschool education has become more affordable. Our primary, secondary and post-secondary students have more pathways and opportunities to pursue their strengths and interests, and be better prepared for the future.</p><p>*Good jobs, lifelong learning, with strong social safety nets: In 2023, employment rate of residents aged 25 to 64 remained high at 82.6% and residents generally saw an increase in wages over the past few years. To help Singaporeans take charge of their career health and seize new job opportunities, jobseekers are supported through a nationwide network of Jobs and Skills Centres, and programmes for reskilling and upskilling. 98% of SkillsFuture trainees surveyed in 2023 reported better work performance, after training. Income inequality, measured by the Gini coefficient, declined to 0.371 in 2023 after accounting for taxes and transfers, reflecting the redistributive effect of government support measures and taxes and efforts to uplift wages of lower-wage workers. The Government also provided more support to lower-income households through short-term cost-of-living support, and schemes such as Workfare which are permanent components of our social safety nets. We have recognised Singaporeans' concerns on cost-of-living in a time of global inflation, and continue to help Singaporeans with daily expenses through the Assurance Package.</p><p>*A Singapore Made For Families: Similar to many other societies, Singapore saw a decline in the resident total fertility rate, which reached 0.97 in 2023 due to fewer and later marriages as well as births. We implemented more measures to support Singaporeans across their marriage and parenthood journey. These included enhancements to the Baby Bonus Scheme and leave measures, and raising full-day infant care places by around 50% in the last five years.</p><p>*Healthy and active living: Singaporeans enjoy one of the longest life expectancies globally. We reduced the prevalence of high cholesterol and diabetes in Singapore and implemented measures to support healthier and active lifestyles. However, the prevalence of high blood pressure and obesity rose. Self-reported poor mental health decreased from 2022 to 2023, and the Government stepped up efforts to support mental health by launching the National Mental Health and Well-being Strategy in 2023. Healthcare remains affordable through subsidies, MediShield Life, and MediSave. Median wait times for adults in public hospitals rose due to factors such as COVID-19-related delays in healthcare infrastructure projects and increasing healthcare needs of our ageing population. We continued to invest in our healthcare infrastructure to ensure sufficient capacity and build a future-ready healthcare system.</p><p>*Retirement and ageing well: Measures such as the raised retirement and re-employment ages have given more opportunities for seniors who wish to continue working, in turn raising the employment rate of seniors. Schemes such as the Matched Retirement Savings Scheme and Majulah Package have helped provide greater assurance of meeting basic retirement needs. We are also supporting seniors to age well and independently through Age Well SG.</p><p>Theme 2: Quality and Sustainable Living</p><p>5. Singapore maintained a quality living environment that is well connected, and we are committed to building an endearing home for current and future generations.</p><p>*We provided affordable and accessible public housing with shortened wait times. Housing estates were rejuvenated through initiatives like the Home Improvement Programme and Neighbourhood Renewal Programme. Public transport connectivity was expanded, shortening travel time, and 92% of residents could walk, cycle or ride to their neighbourhood centres within 20 minutes. More opportunities were created for Singaporeans to enjoy and appreciate our arts and heritage, green spaces, and nature.</p><p>*For a clean, green, and resilient Singapore, we have ensured water resilience and strengthened resilience in energy and food. We have also taken steps to address climate resilience and protect our natural environment.</p><p>Theme 3: Our Shared Future and Place in the World</p><p>6. Singapore has safeguarded our peace and stability, and contributed to regional and international security and humanitarian efforts. We worked with Singaporeans to foster a strong national identity and cohesive community.</p><p>*Singapore contributed to various international security and humanitarian assistance efforts with swift responses to contingencies and maintained high operational readiness to meet our security needs. Singaporeans maintained high confidence in the Home Team's and Singapore Armed Forces' ability to keep Singapore safe and secure.</p><p>*We deepened relations with partners and contributed to the global commons like international maritime law and cybersecurity.</p><p>*Singapore remained one of the safest countries in the world, with low physical crime and recidivism rates. While scams remained a key concern, the Government continued to work closely with the private sector such as banks and our community to fight against scams.</p><p>*We also continued to invest in fostering a strong national identity and a cohesive community by co-creating meaningful initiatives with citizens, community groups and businesses. Over 35 Alliances for Action with citizens, community groups, and businesses were formed to co-create and prototype ideas in areas of opportunity or to address common challenges. The Singapore Government Partnerships Office was also launched to strengthen partnerships and engagements with citizens.</p><p>Theme 4: Strong and Resilient Economy</p><p>7. Our economic fundamentals remained robust and continued to be strengthened, despite structural shifts and a challenging external environment.</p><p>*Between 2019 and 2023, Singapore's real Gross Domestic Product grew at an annualised rate of 2.6%. Singapore remained attractive to businesses and pressed on with our industry transformation efforts. Progress was made towards Manufacturing, Services and Trade 2030 goals. We continued to support enterprise growth and transformation and develop a supportive innovation ecosystem. To maintain Singapore's appeal to businesses, we invested further in SkillsFuture to raise our local workforce competitiveness and empower Singaporeans to take charge of their career health.</p><p>* We further strengthened physical and digital connectivity by investing in our maritime and aviation hubs, and building our digital infrastructure. For future growth, we are building capabilities in areas such as artificial intelligence (AI) and sustainability. Emerging technologies, such as generative AI, present opportunities to improve productivity and strengthen our industries' competitiveness, but they also bring challenges. We intensified our efforts to defend against cyberthreats and build a safer digital domain.</p><p>Special Chapter: Spirit of Forward Singapore</p><p>8. The Forward Singapore exercise brought Singaporeans together to chart a roadmap for Singapore's next stage of development. Forward Singapore is about renewing our social compact to keep our society strong, and sharing the benefits of progress with all Singaporeans. In an increasingly interconnected and rapidly changing world filled with both opportunities and risk, every sector of our society - individuals, communities and businesses - plays a role towards shaping Singapore's future. Through fostering collaboration and partnerships, we can harness our diverse strengths and resources to navigate uncertainty, and more effectively bring Singapore forward.</p><p>SPOR 2024 can be accessed via go.gov.sg/SPOR or the QR code below.</p><p>Source: Ministry of Finance,Government of Singapore</p><p>[Category: Health Care, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0065197774</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DB4-0YY1-DXMP-K0P7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1710\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4253\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 1, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DRP2</classCode><className>ECONOMIC INEQUALITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N921000CC</classCode><className>GOVERNMENT BODIES &amp;
