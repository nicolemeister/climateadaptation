Polluted air, dammed and fouled rivers, plastic waste choking waterways and the oceans, forests cleared for cattle and crops.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Unless this destructive paradigm is halted and shifted to one more in tune with nature, economic and health costs will spiral and undermine the development gains of past years, the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) says.</p><p> Especially since the pressure on the planet's finite resources is expected to keep growing along with its population, which is expected to reach about nine billion by 2050 from 7.8 billion now. The world is forecast to produce 50 per cent more energy and 70 per cent more food by mid-century.</p><p> On World Environment Day today, the UN wants the world to \"re-imagine, recreate and restore\" nature. \"We cannot turn back time. But we can grow trees, green our cities, rewild our gardens, change our diets and clean up rivers and coasts. We are the generation that can make peace with nature,\" the world body says.</p><p> Globally, there are growing efforts to start restoring damaged environments, from replanting mangroves and forests, creating more parks and gardens in cities, and growing food in ways that do not damage the land but rather help restore local wildlife and the carbon content of soils - regenerative agriculture.</p><p> Urban farms are popping up on rooftops or on vacant land amid housing estates, bringing nature back into the urban landscape. Many people who live in cities lose a connection with nature because all of life's essentials can be found at the turn of a tap or in a local food market as well as the safety and shelter of a warm house.</p><p> But Covid-19 has helped people reconnect with nature as many seek the peace of the green outdoors to exercise and take time out from busy, confined lives.</p><p> This connection is an essential reminder that nature provides the key services that we all rely on: clean water, air and food.</p><p> We need clean rivers and healthy forest watersheds for water, and forests and healthy oceans for oxygen and the removal of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas. We need healthy soils to grow food. Yet, about a quarter of the world's land is degraded and climate change is triggering more extreme droughts, heatwaves and floods that disrupt crop production.</p><p> We also need healthy coral reefs and mangroves for productive fisheries. Yet coral reefs are in trouble around the world from water pollution, over-fishing, acidification of sea water and, most critically, warmer ocean temperatures that cause the corals to bleach white. More than 450 million people in more than 100 countries rely on coral reefs for their livelihoods.</p><p> Mangroves protect coastlines from erosion and rising sea levels. They are also vital fish nurseries and soak up large amounts of CO2, making them a great natural climate solution. Yet mangroves are being cleared for development such as shrimp farms. Asean has lost a third of its mangroves between 1980 and 2020, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation's Global Forest Resources Assessment.</p><p> Efforts are under way, though, to restore mangroves in Asean, especially Indonesia, as well as steps to reverse some of the years of damage to tropical peat swamp forests. There are also measures to address the plastic waste crisis in the region.</p><p> But much more is needed, says the UNEP, to avoid irreversible damage. The world is facing three simultaneous crises - on climate, biodiversity and pollution - all of which are interconnected and caused by human action.</p><p> Nature needs to take a seat in the boardrooms of all companies - businesses need to find ways to grow without trashing the environment. Pressure is growing on banks and multilateral lenders to look at how their money will be used and not give it to firms whose activities damage the environment and risk local livelihoods.</p><p> Increasingly, investors are looking at nature-based solutions to earn money while saving the environment. UNEP has said global annual spending to protect and restore nature needs to triple this decade to about US$350 billion (S$464.3 billion) by 2030 and rise to US$536 billion by 2050. Getting there requires a shift in mindset among financiers, businesses and governments.</p><p> UNEP's inaugural State of Finance for Nature report estimated that US$8 trillion in investment would be needed by mid-century to safeguard natural systems. \"It's peanuts when we are frankly talking about securing the planet and our very own future,\" said Ms Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director.</p><p> Report co-author Ivo Mulder, who heads UNEP's climate finance unit, said financial flows should work with nature, not against it.</p><p> \"It is more an opportunity to see how can you continue to do business, how can governments continue to grow economically - but do so in a way that is more equitable and sustainable. It is not impossible,\" he told the Thomson Reuters Foundation.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Indonesians planting mangrove saplings in West Java province.

For 2 years, Covid-19 has shocked the very systems on which we rely, overlaying and influencing a set of wide-ranging changes and transitions - both positive and negative - that were already shaping the 2020s.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As we look forward to 2030, the target year for the realisation of the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals and a key milestone for rapid reductions in carbon emissions, will we find ourselves in a just, resilient and sustainable world - or one in which we witness ever more destabilising shocks on a pathway to a hot-house earth'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> In order to answer this question, it's timely to take another look at the four different pathways or trajectories towards 2030 that Forum for the Future identified 15 months ago in our From System Shock to System Change - Time to Transform report.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These trajectories were based on the mindsets we were seeing proliferate in response to the pandemic, and provided us with a framework for looking at how the world might proactively shift on to a more transformative footing - not just building back better, but actively looking to build forward into a new future.</p><p> They were:</p><p>Compete and Retreat: Characterised by a retreat into national borders driven by the perception that there is not enough to go around, resulting in the strengthening of existing nationalist dynamics, the gradual collapse of what's left of globalisation and international collaboration, and the emergence of fragmented regionalism.Discipline: Characterised by greater state control to manage public health and safety, resulting in the ramped-up use of technology for automation, remote connection, surveillance and control, as well as a concurrent sacrifice of personal privacy, in order to keep growth and global interconnection going as 'normal'.Transform: Characterised by a growing understanding of the deep connections between human and planetary health, using the pandemic recovery as a 'reset' to catalyse a fair and equitable zero-carbon transition and a shift towards new business and economic models based on resilience and regenerative thinking.Unsettled: Characterised by a continued inability to settle on a 'new normal' due to ongoing discontinuity and disruption from crises of all kinds: climate and ecological, political, social, economic and technological. Recognising that many previous ways of thinking are no longer helpful, Unsettled presents an urgent need to adjust and adapt to a difficult and strange reality - one in which resilience, adaptability and opportunism constantly jostle with fatalism and anxiety.</p><p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, all four trajectories are still in play. Taking each in turn:</p><p> Within Compete and Retreat we're seeing intensifying energy geopolitics and resource hoarding; vaccine hoarding in pursuit of national interests; nationalist populism continuing to gain traction; the resurgence of local forces such as the Taliban; the closure of borders to migrants and polarising debate on immigration policy.</p><p> Where Compete and Retreat overlaps with Discipline, we're seeing growing autocracy and new impunity for dictators.</p><p> Within Discipline alone, we've seen the accelerated use of artificial intelligence (AI) and automation; vaccine passports; the normalisation of authoritarian lockdown politics; increasing surveillance capacities by governments; use of spyware and more.</p><p> Turning to Transform, signs of purely transformational change include: Berlin's rethinking of the car; ecocide laws being drafted in respect of the rights of nature; governments being sued by young people whose voices are only growing louder in the climate activism movement; four-day weeks being trialled in a shake-up of how we work; growing energy behind grassroots democracy, as seen with the rise of citizen assemblies and protest movements in support of democratic values; changing diets, particularly in the West; and advances in regeneration, not least the resurgence of regenerative agriculture.</p><p> Where Discipline also overlaps with Transform, we're seeing the growth of nature-based solutions often spearheaded by corporates; growing interest in corporate sustainability and climate reporting for financial institutions; satellite imaging and AI technology used in fighting deforestation.</p><p> Finally, looking at Unsettled, this has been a very dominant story of the last 15 months. We've seen crisis after crisis unfold in some nation-states. We've seen disruption to supply chains, to energy supplies, not to mention multiple waves of Covid-19 and the disruption that causes.</p><p> In many ways, a strong flavour of Unsettled in our daily lives is to be expected. Triggered both by the pandemic and by systems that were already transforming pre-Covid-19 - from food to energy - we are living in a moment of accelerated system change.</p><p> It also opens up new opportunities. For example, where Transform intersects with Unsettled, we're seeing growing people power and community influence, the maturation of new ways of organising, just transition rhetoric gaining pace and the channelling of funds to vulnerable communities.</p><p>Time to face reality, recognise we're off track and prep for further disruption</p><p> At Forum, we believe Transform must prevail - it is the trajectory that will bring about the just and regenerative future the world needs.</p><p> With Unsettled dominating right now, four things are front of mind if we're to get on track.</p><p> First, we must get real about the scale of the system transformation needed.</p><p> They are brittle and vulnerable, with one event having the potential to cause cascading impacts; think back to the disruption caused by a single ship blocking one part of the Suez Canal. In Part 2 of our Looking Back to Go Forward series, John Elkington elegantly referred to the 'decomposition of our systems'. It's a clear sign of the huge task ahead of us if we are to create new, resilient systems capable of sustaining both planetary and human health.</p><p> Second: be honest about the effort this will take and just how far off we are from where we need to be. Johan Rockstrom spoke of us being at the 'end of the road' following three decades of putting unsustainable pressure on the planet. It's easy to see Transform as a distant dream right now and we must all do more, faster if we're to create the future we all want.</p><p> Third, be ready for more uncertainty, more discontinuity. Accelerated system change is messy and often non-linear. Take for example the transition from fossil fuels to renewable energy where we are currently witnessing rapid exponential change.</p><p> Adding in the features of the Unsettled trajectory means planning for disruption and for prolonged uncertainty would seem sensible. As is remembering that non-linear change can be a good thing; the speed and scale of some of our responses to the pandemic illustrate this, from the availability of a brand new vaccine to the success of public/private partnerships in converting manufacturing lines to the production of personal protective equipment (PPE).</p><p> Which is one of the reasons, why, lastly, Transform is still possible. As we head towards 2030, it is very likely that we will continue to experience Compete and Retreat, Unsettled and Discipline, as well as Transform. We can expect multiple versions of our future to be in play at any one point in time. However, if we are experiencing these different trajectories, how might we harness the energy behind them and influence what happens next'</p><p>Shifting systems means working with activating and resisting forces</p><p> In order to shift systems it is usually necessary to work with both activating forces for change (abundant in Transform), and resisting ones (think vested interests that might dominate Compete and Retreat).</p><p> Ignoring resisting forces means they will remain and keep trying to lock in the current configuration of any system. But engaging with them and understanding prevailing mindsets makes it possible to divert this energy into a different direction.</p><p> So our challenge is this: how can we leverage the shake-up created in the Unsettled trajectory to embrace new ways of living and working'</p><p> The way forward will not be easy. The wholesale systemic change we need will require coordinated efforts at multiple levels and across multiple stakeholders, each embracing innovation and shifting their fundamental mindsets.</p><p> At the same time, the resisting forces in the form of vested interests will continue to present a high risk of leaving us stuck in shallow transitions.</p><p> As a new year sets in, a just and regenerative future is within our grasp, but we need a decisive and immediate course correct to achieve it.</p><p> Our future isn't written - it is ours to write.</p><p>The writer is chief executive officer of Forum for the Future.</p><p>This article first appeared in Forum's Future of Sustainability: Looking Back to Go Forward opinion and commentary series. Forum is an international non-profit which for 25 years has been working in partnership with business, governments and civil society to accelerate the transformation toward a just and regenerative future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Triggered both by the pandemic and by systems that were already transforming pre-Covid-19 - from food to energy - we are living in a moment of accelerated system change.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-388583</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64TJ-FY71-JCF2-82TX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1510\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Or an orang utan. Or a rainforest. And for the most part, they are invisible.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Nature plays a central role in many businesses, yet it rarely gets a seat at the C-suite table.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Companies have long taken for granted the resources that nature provides, from the crops grown in the soil to timber from forests to fish from the sea.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Few think about the \"ecosystem services\" that societies rely on - clean air, water supply from rivers, crop pollination by insects or coastal storm protection by mangroves and coral reefs.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> These environmental assets and services are vital to the functioning of corporates and communities. But they are regarded as free, and existing business models, premised on this assumption, have caused over-extraction of resources, pollution, deforestation, over-fishing, declining water supplies and rapid loss of species.</p><p> All this as climate change impacts get worse and are directly affecting nature, too.</p><p> Nature is deteriorating worldwide at a faster pace than at any time in human history, triggering a biodiversity crisis. Now more than ever, nature needs that seat at the boardroom table.</p><p> Just as companies are increasingly being mandated by regulators to measure and report their climate risks and investment exposure, the same could happen in relation to nature.</p><p> Guidelines are being developed by the Taskforce on Nature-related Financial Disclosures (TNFD), a global initiative. Companies will use the framework crafted by the task force to measure and regularly report their footprint on nature and disclose any risks - that is, how (and where) their businesses are dependent on nature, how their business practices are impacting ecosystems, as well as opportunities to help the natural world - and benefit the bottom line.</p><p> This detailed look will help investors and regulators get a better picture of a company and whether it needs to change, whether it faces material risks from its practices and supply chains or whether it is a nature-friendly actor worthy of investment.</p><p> This analysis could very well become mandatory in a few years, given support by Group of Seven finance ministers for the TNFD's work. The task force is backed by governments, major science bodies and representatives from companies, financial institutions and stock exchanges.</p><p> Among those helping draft the rules, due to be finalised late next year, are the Singapore Exchange and Olam International.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SYSTEMIC RISK&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;The creation of the TNFD follows the crafting of risk-reporting guidelines for climate change by the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures that are now being adopted around the world, including in Singapore.</p><p> Starting next year, listed firms in Singapore will have to disclose their climate-related risks - and opportunities - based on the climate task force's guidelines.</p><p> Just as regulators and investors now see climate change as a major financial risk, the creation of the TNFD is a realisation that damage to nature equals business and systemic risk, too. So it is vital for firms to finally be transparent about their nature risks and dependencies, just as they are for climate change.</p><p> More than half of the world's economic output - US$44 trillion (S$60 trillion) of economic value generation - is highly or moderately dependent on nature, the World Economic Forum (WEF) and PwC UK said in a 2020 assessment. Construction (US$4 trillion), agriculture (US$2.5 trillion) and food and beverage (US$1.4 trillion) were the three largest industries that depend most on nature.</p><p> The global Network for Greening the Financial System acknowledged in a statement last month that \"nature-related risks, including those associated with biodiversity loss, could have significant macroeconomic implications, and that failure to account for, mitigate, and adapt to these implications is a source of risks relevant for financial stability\".</p><p> The network comprises 83 financial regulatory authorities and central banks globally, including the Monetary Authority of Singapore.</p><p> The benefits of being nature-friendly could be immense. The WEF said in a separate report in 2020 that nature-positive solutions - ones that enhance nature - could generate an estimated US$10 trillion in new annual business value and create 395 million jobs by 2030.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;LONG OVERDUE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;The nature disclosure guidelines are long overdue, said Mr Tony Goldner, executive director of the TNFD. \"Nature is not in a position to wait and we can't afford for this to take 10 to 15 years before we start seeing scalable disclosures on nature loss and nature-related impacts,\" he said during a recent visit to Singapore.</p><p> Nature, though, is complex and hard for people to wrap their head around. Exactly how does a company measure its dependency on nature and the impacts'</p><p> The TNFD recently released its draft framework for comment and this will go through several more versions before the final one is released next year.</p><p> The draft framework splits nature up into four realms: the atmosphere, the oceans, land and fresh water. It also looks at what are called environmental assets, such as mineral and energy resources, freshwater ecosystems and renewable energy resources. It also includes services that regulate the planet, such as storm mitigation, air filtration and soil and sediment retention.</p><p> This \"natural capital\" keeps the planet, and people's lives and livelihoods, ticking along.</p><p> To help companies, the task force has created an assessment process called Leap: Locate the interface with nature; Evaluate dependencies and impacts; Assess risks and opportunities; and Prepare to respond to nature-related risks and opportunities and report to investors.</p><p> \"If companies understand how their business and enterprise value creation is driven by the ecological services on which they are reliant, then I think we can have a much clearer perspective on risk. And then we can be informing much better decisions around capital allocation,\" said Mr Goldner.</p><p> But it is going to be a steep learning curve for most companies.</p><p> Mr Goldner said \"how-to\" guidance is vital. \"If I'm a company or a financial institution, what do I do internally to start analysing these nature risks? A lot of investors and a lot of companies have said, 'This is completely new to us. We don't even know where to begin.'\"</p><p> He said the Leap process is a good starting point. But ultimately companies are going to have to build up expertise, just as they have been doing for climate risk assessments.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;CHIEF NATURE OFFICER'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Does this mean companies and financial institutions will have a chief nature officer'</p><p> Ideally, no, he says, because that risks creating a silo mentality.</p><p> \"I think we've got to move the nature agenda away from being a CSR (corporate social responsibility) focused activity into a really strategic C-suite issue because this is fundamentally about risk. And it's about opportunity.\"</p><p> And some of those opportunities tie in with fighting climate change. For instance, investments that restore mangroves.</p><p> Mangroves store up to four times more carbon than rainforests, making them a valuable tool in soaking up excess carbon dioxide emissions. Mangroves also protect shorelines from storm damage and rising seas and are vital fish nurseries.</p><p> \"Nature is not something that we deal with once we've figured out climate, but actually, nature-based solutions can be a huge part of the climate action, which everyone is very much focused on now,\" Mr Goldner said.</p><p> The Pollination Group, a global climate change investment and advisory firm, sees investing in nature as a way to help solve the biodiversity and climate crises and reap a return for investors. It also sees the value in companies assessing their supply chains for nature risks and dependencies.</p><p> \"I think as an engagement tool and an idea, it's really captured both the investor and corporate communities,\" said Ms Laura Waterford, a director at Pollination, referring to the TNFD.</p><p> A lot of larger clients, she said, \"just don't have line of sight to their supply chains. And that's exactly what the TNFD is asking them to report on\".</p><p> And a growing number of clients are also looking at investing in ways that do not damage the environment, such as regenerative agriculture, planting of mangroves and reforestation projects.</p><p> \"We have clients engaged in nature strategy across consumables, the built environment and the agriculture sector. They are thinking about it through a risk and opportunity lens,\" Ms Waterford said from Sydney.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;LITIGATION THREAT&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Companies that fail to act risk being rejected by investors. And there's another risk - litigation.</p><p> There has been a surge in climate lawsuits against governments and companies in recent years. More than 1,800 climate change-related lawsuits have been launched around the world to date, London's Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment says.</p><p> The lawsuits have targeted failure of duty of care by companies and governments, as well as firms that fail to reveal the extent of climate risk exposure or are accused of greenwashing - making inflated claims of doing good when doing the opposite in reality.</p><p> \"All the categories of activist climate litigation are open to be applied in the nature space,\" said Ms Waterford, a lawyer by training who has looked at nature-based litigation. That is because in many countries there are existing environment laws that could provide \"hooks\" for nature-related litigation.</p><p> Precedents for holding directors responsible for foreseeable risks also meant business leaders could be held to account.</p><p> \"Directors do have a duty today to consider nature-related risks because they are absolutely foreseeable,\" said Ms Waterford.</p><p> But how do we know that what companies disclose is truthful'</p><p> The TNFD is already discussing with the Big Four accounting firms, which are part of the task force, about building in third-party assurance procedures, Mr Goldner said.</p><p> Ms Waterford said it was likely the TNFD will become mandatory pretty quickly and therefore company disclosures will be scrutinised by investors and regulators.</p><p> But she noted that in the interim, companies needed access to better data to properly evaluate exactly how reliant they are on nature and the risks to their supply chains. So there will be a learning period.</p><p> Time, though, is running short. With the global hunger for resources and the escalating threat from climate and biodiversity crises pressing in, companies, governments and consumers need to shift towards nature-friendly practices.</p><p> \"People have said before that we are financing ourselves into extinction, and we're all worried about saving up for pension funds and superannuation funds. But for what sort of future, if, in fact, we've destroyed the very ecology on which our prosperity is dependent'\" said Mr Goldner.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1039693</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:657D-MH21-JCF2-815S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-04-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1819\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 SPH Media Holdings Pte.

Our welcome dinner is at the two-Michelin-starred Restaurant Tim Raue, which is known for serving Asian-inspired cuisine.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Lunch next day is at casual eatery The Panda Noodle, where we tuck into Thai and Chinese dishes.</p><p> Slurping dan dan noodles (a Sichuan dish) and getting a tan in the almost-summer heat are not how I expect my first trip in Berlin to start. But I am proud to see touches of Singapore - from chef Tim Raue's inspired version of wasabi prawn to the Tiger Beer crates at The Panda Noodle.</p><p> I am also relishing my unmasked freedom - it is my first overseas trip since the pandemic hit - in a city that requires masking up only on public transport and in healthcare institutions.</p><p> Over the next two days, we meet local restaurateurs, chefs and artisan producers - all pushing to showcase produce from suppliers in and around the region.</p><p> Artisan chocolate maker pars Pralinen gets its cream from cows at a farm a two-hour drive from Berlin. We also meet 400 Jersey cows at another farm 70km south of the city, which provides creamy milk to artisan cheesemaker Urstrom Kaese (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.urstromkaese.de\">www.urstromkaese.de</url>).</p><p> Hyperlocal one-Michelin-starred restaurant Nobelhart &amp; Schmutzig works with Urstrom Kaese and vegetable farm Wilmars Gaerten (wilmarsgaerten.com), which is 40km south of Berlin.</p><p> While bars and clubs might have been the city's main interest, the appetite for Michelin-starred establishments has grown, says Mr Christian Taenzler, spokesman for tourism organisation visitBerlin (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.visitberlin.de\">www.visitberlin.de</url>). International tourism boomed in 2006, he adds, when Berlin hosted the World Cup final between Italy and France.</p><p> Food and beverage entrepreneurs - especially young ones - have also set up shop there, where the people are open to liberal and new ideas. This gave rise to a wider variety of cuisines available over the years, he says, including the boom of Berlin's vegan food scene.</p><p> I eat some of the best vegan pastries and vegetable dishes during my trip. In fact, I have more vegetables than meat. No plant-based meat - just solid cooking, fermenting or pickling done to make the vegetables shine.</p><p> I bookend my trip with \"touristy\" food. I dig into the iconic currywurst for my first meal at the Cu29 restaurant at the James Simon Gallery on Museums Island, and grab a salty pretzel at the Berlin Brandenburg Airport before my 13-hour flight home via Scoot.</p><p> Although I barely scratch the surface of Berlin's food scene during the whirlwind three days, it is enough to help me plan my next visit.</p><p> I will need at least two weeks to visit more attractions and museums, discover more food, and revisit some restaurants that made a deep impression.</p><p>\u00b7Follow The Straits Times Food on Facebook and Instagram @straitstimesfood</p><p>\u00b7This trip was hosted by visitBerlin.</p><p>\u00b7In Quest Of is a new series on the joy of niche exploration amid the resurgence of international travel.</p><p>     &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;DIVERSE TASTES&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;&lt;lnvxe_h&gt;THE PANDA NOODLE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Where: Lausitzer Platz 12, 10997 Berlin</p><p>Info: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/ThePandaNoodle\">www.facebook.com/ThePandaNoodle</url></p><p> Spicy dan dan noodles and Thai chicken salad are not quite what I expect to eat in Berlin.</p><p> At The Panda Noodle, decorated with colourful tinsel and posters, I am transported to a street food joint in Bangkok.</p><p>German-Thai owner Daeng Khamlao offers a simple menu of Thai and Chinese rice and house-made noodle dishes (from (EURO)9, or S$12.80) that pack a spicy punch. Vegan options - tofu replaces the meat - are available too.</p><p> I can picture homesick Singaporeans seeking comfort here - for the homely fare served on melamine plates and bowls. The crates of Tiger Beer stacked by the toilet would also remind them of home.</p><p> But the six-year-old eatery does more than represent Asian food.</p><p> Ms Daeng is the co-founder of Smells Like Collective, which brings together the black, indigenous and people of colour community in the food industry and helps those looking for jobs in the sector.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;BAR NORMAL&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Where: Oderberger Strasse 7, 10435 Berlin</p><p>Info: ganz-normal.eu</p><p> There is no better street for bar hopping than Oderberg Strasse.</p><p> And since January, Bar Normal has quickly become one of the hottest spots for good food, drinks and a lively atmosphere.</p><p> The menu here is mainly vegetable-forward. Sharing dishes include Spanish-style potato tortilla with chilli mayonnaise ((EURO)11, or $15.70), fried cauliflower with vadouvan (a blend of spices) emulsion and herbs ((EURO)16), and oyster mushrooms ragout on crispy corn tortilla ((EURO)17).</p><p> For drinks, go for the apple shrub fizz ((EURO)14), or choose from a selection of natural wines from Germany, France, Italy and the Czech Republic.</p><p> You cannot quite define the cuisine and that is the intention of its Vietnamese-German owner, whose diverse team comes from countries including Colombia.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;RESTAURANT TIM RAUE&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Where: Rudi-Dutschke-Strasse 26, 10969 Berlin</p><p>Info: tim-raue.com</p><p> This is the restaurant I am most curious to try as German celebrity chef Tim Raue is known for serving his spin on Asian cuisine (lunch from (EURO)88, or S$125, and dinner from (EURO)227). It holds two Michelin stars and is ranked No. 31 on The World's 50 Best Restaurants list.</p><p> As I am the only Asian in the group I am travelling with, everyone else would ask me what I think of the food after each course.</p><p> Especially when the signature Wasabi Langoustine is served. It draws inspiration from Singapore's wasabi prawn dish by local veteran chef Sam Leong.</p><p> The coating of deep-fried rice adds a lovely crunch to the perfectly cooked langoustine, with just the right amount of kick from the wasabi mayonnaise balanced with some sweetness from diced mango.</p><p> Each bite takes me back home, although I have at that point been in Berlin for only eight hours.</p><p> Other highlights include Sangohachi Pikeperch, served with junmai sake beurre blanc, green radish and white grapes; and chef Raue's take on Peking Duck.</p><p> The duck dish features various components - including duck liver terrine with pulled duck salad, chawanmushi duck giblets, and duck leg with crispy skin, duck feet jus and five spice pancake cream.</p><p> It is definitely not your typical Peking Duck, but it is refreshing to see how each element is showcased.</p><p> As we walk back to the hotel - The Yard (hotel-theyard.berlin), which is about 20 minutes away - the journalist from Spain asks if I am proud of or offended by the meal.</p><p> \"I'm proud,\" I say, adding that there is no reason to be offended when someone is doing justice to the food. Most importantly, chef Raue is honouring one of Singapore's top chefs.</p><p>      &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;TASTE OF TRADITION&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;&lt;lnvxe_h&gt;VILLA KELLERMANN&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Where: Mangerstrasse 34, 14467 Potsdam</p><p>Info: villakellermann.de/en</p><p> If you have time for a day trip, head to Villa Kellermann in Potsdam, which is less than an hour's drive from central Berlin. Its restaurant is helmed by chef Tim Raue and, here, you will discover a side of his cooking that is very different from his Asianinfluenced restaurant in the city.</p><p> He puts a contemporary spin on the \"food of my grandparents\", albeit in a very posh setting of the \"rich aunt to visit with an amazing home\". I like that the food is not overly embellished at the restaurant, which sits by the picturesque Heiliger See lake.</p><p> One of the starters is a beautiful head of crisp lettuce ((EURO)15, or S$21), which shines with lemon, parsley and green pepper.</p><p> The star dish is the Konigsberg Meatballs ((EURO)27) with beetroot and creamy mashed potatoes. Everyone has a second helping.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;SCHNEEEULE SALON&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Where: Ofener Strasse 1, 13349 Berlin</p><p>Info: schneeeule.berlin</p><p> You cannot leave Berlin without having a beer and the place to go is Schneeeule Salon, home of the Berliner Weisse.</p><p> The tart lactic acid-fermented wheat beer, with a low alcohol content of about 3 to 4 per cent, is perfect for a hot summer's day.</p><p> Owner Ulrike Genz cracks open a bottle and gently pours its contents into a large bowl-shaped glass to get a good amount of head and release the aromas.</p><p> Passionate about developing a Berlin beer culture, Ms Genz started her brewery in 2016 and opened Schneeeule Salon four years later.</p><p> There is a range of beers (from (EURO)4.50, or S$6.40), from the most traditional Marlene to the jasmine-flavoured Yasmin.</p><p> I find the Hot Irmi most interesting. It is flavoured with ginger, orange and lemon peel, as well as habaneros, which gives a mellow lingering heat.</p><p>      &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;GO HYPERLOCAL&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;&lt;lnvxe_h&gt;NOBELHART &amp; SCHMUTZIG&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt;Where: Friedrichstrasse 218, 10969 Berlin</p><p>Info: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nobelhartundschmutzig.com\">www.nobelhartundschmutzig.com</url></p><p> \"More social, less media\", states the menu at this one-Michelin-starred restaurant, ranked No. 45 on The World's 50 Best Restaurants list.</p><p> In this day and age, where the camera usually eats first, it is quite unnerving for anyone - let alone a group of food journalists - to put his or her phone and camera away.</p><p> The focus shifts to the people - whether they are my dining companions, the local food producers and suppliers, or restaurant staff.</p><p> Dining at the seven-year-old establishment is like attending a culinary theatre production.

With the world's increasing population disrupting agriculture supply chains, aggravated further by the COVID-19 pandemic, MaGIC and Deloitte have identified not only an increased need to address challenges in the food security space, but also opportunities for tech solution providers to develop new and unique innovations that can be adopted by the agriculture industry. </p><p><br/> This year, the two institutions collaborated on a roundtable discussion called the Agriculture/Agritech Roundtable and a thought leadership paper titled the 'Emerging Tech &amp; Innovation in Malaysia's Agricultural Landscape[1]' to highlight technological solutions for pressing agriculture issues that have the potential to impact millions of lives. The roundtable initiative seeks to highlight the urgency of solving problems in the agriculture space and the need to have all hands on deck \u2014 particularly tech companies that already possess the tools needed to help bolster and embolden food security. <br/> Khalid Yashaiya, Acting CEO of MaGIC, said that without intervention from new innovations, the world will soon face a food security crisis of unprecedented scale. Rural communities tied to the agriculture sector are especially fragile, having already suffered from loss of income and livelihood during the pandemic. <br/> 'The agriculture sector has been impacted by high market demand, higher production costs due to their dependence on imported goods, declining productivity and revenue, and other challenges which have led to losses in earnings. Despite this, the agriculture sector has a high potential of becoming a major contributor to the increase in shared prosperity and food resources to the world's 9.7 billion population by 2050,' he added. <br/>Malaysia and Agritech Solutions <br/>Khalid highlighted that as it is, Malaysia is abound with solutions anchored on looming issues in agriculture. The country is not lacking when it comes to innovators, from manufacturers of agriculture drones to developers of solutions that enable farmers to sort high quality vegetables, ready to take on the challenges faced by the sector. <br/> 'This is why it is crucial for the government and its agencies to encourage and facilitate this growth,' he said, adding that MaGIC empowers innovative startups by developing a vibrant and sustainable entrepreneurship ecosystem in Malaysia and accelerating their commercialisation journeys. <br/> Also read: Harnessing the power of AI to help improve gastric cancer detection[2] <br/> Justin Ong, Executive Director of Deloitte Southeast Asia and Innovation Leader of Deloitte Malaysia, further said that today's Industry 4.0 offered the perfect opportunity for agriculture players to adopt mature technologies that boost productivity and efficiency. Startups, being the source of new technologies, will be the locomotive of change. <br/> 'The agriculture industry is traditionally labour-intensive. This gives rise to many opportunities for innovative solutions and digitalisation. With their outside-the-box thinking, unconventional way and readiness to adopt new technology and business models, startups disrupt the industry with ideas that close the gap and increase productivity,' he said. <br/>What's sprouting in Malaysia? <br/>Drones, Internet of Things (IoT), big data analytics, and online sales platforms have emerged as crucial innovations for agriculture. Malaysia already has homegrown startups focused on deploying those technologies, as these three startups exemplify. <br/>Braintree Technologies<br/>Braintree Technologies is a local startup that offers drone-as-a-service for plantation mapping, evaluation, design, and planning. The drones run on AI-powered computer vision algorithms that increase precision and automation leading to optimal yield and cost-efficiencies. <br/> 'We build agriculture robots at Braintree Technologies. Right now, we are focusing our solutions for the oil palm &amp; chilli industries. We are building chilli-picking robots and pest-control robots. We offer our solution as Robot-as-a-Service (RaaS) and our clients pay us per hectare of the job done by the robots,' said Arif Makhdzir, Founder and CEO of Braintree Technologies. <br/> Additionally, the increasing use of technology can make the sector more interesting to high-skilled youth. 'My plan is to see a new generation of farmers who are less than 40 years old and they earn lucrative income by just operating their automated farm from anywhere in the world from their phone,' he said. <br/> Makhdzir finds that MaGIC's roundtable initiative is a great platform to hear the perspectives of different parties from varied backgrounds like big plantations, startups, and government, with the hopes of turning the discussion outcomes of the discussion into actual National Agrofood Policy. 'I think it benefits us to have the point of view from varied backgrounds and if we can collaborate to create a better ecosystem,' he concluded. <br/>Langit Collective <br/>Innovations are equally necessary on the consumer side. Langit Collective tackles challenges related to market access by connecting indigenous rural farming communities with consumers via online sales platforms. <br/> Lilian Chen, Co-Founder and CEO of Langit Collective, said that the startup aimed to 'create an alternative economic model for rural indigenous communities by revaluing their existing agriculture produce'. <br/> Langit Collective further empowered farmers through data collection and food chain transparency. The Food Prints Initiative is the startup's brainchild to achieve food integrity and enable consumers to learn more about the source of their rice. 'With the scanning of a unique QR code, consumers will be able to get access to the overview information of where, and who farmed the packet of rice they purchased,' she noted. <br/> Also read: Fast Forward with HPE!: Helping startups grow through community support[3] <br/> Chen expressed that MaGIC's roundtable is a great attempt to bring all the different stakeholders involved in agriculture to further understand each other's challenges in the industry. She hopes that this would lead the way to a more holistic approach in agriculture. <br/> 'In our constant pursuit in improving methodology, precision, and the need to control the environment to produce food or commodities, we become more siloed and our focus skewed only towards solving food security issues,' she said. 'I hope there is more awareness about regenerative agriculture that focuses on rebuilding ecosystems, biodiversity that regenerates the soil (carbon sequestration) whilst producing food.' <br/> Initiatives like this could be a great step for a more collaborative environment that brings better awareness and better solutions, not just to food security issues but other related issues as well. 'It can be a powerful tool to solve environmental problems whilst solving food security issues,' Chen concluded. <br/>Planting seeds for the future <br/>Braintree and Langit Collective are two of the country's budding startups whose innovations can help revolutionise the agriculture space. With these startups leading the charge and supported by reputable institutions like MaGIC, the country can inspire stronger and more collaborative efforts to help foster a more sustainable food system. <br/> Collaboration and fostering a healthy ecosystem for innovations are fundamental for future developments in agritech. According to Justin, coopetition, or the collaboration between competing businesses, which in this case are corporates and startups, will lead to positive outcomes that will reshape the industry. <br/> 'While it is natural for businesses to be wary of new entrants in the market, we believe that many opportunities are there to be realised if traditional players work together with startups,' he pointed out. <br/> Also read: China Mobile International hosts mCloud Carnival 2021[4] <br/> The government continues to play a key role by encouraging startups to hatch innovations in the market. The Malaysian government has created the National Technology &amp; Innovation Sandbox (NTIS)[5] to give space for startups and technology companies to test run their solutions. Khalid mentioned that the sandbox in agritech would bring about insightful case studies that become benchmarks on how the government could form regulations that promote innovations. <br/> 'NTIS ensures that Malaysia doesn't just adopt but create and commercialise solutions using emerging and advanced technologies. It moves products along the technology readiness tranches in an expedient manner, from ideas to invention and implementation \u2014 and onward to commercialisation' he added, emphasising the role of agriculture, food, and water as key socio-economic sectors. <br/> With an agritech industry strengthened by the support of a startup ecosystem whose unique innovations in technology can help yield better and more efficient food production, Malaysia and the rest of the world can look forward to a more bountiful future. <br/> - - <br/> This article is produced by the e27 team, sponsored byMaGIC <br/> We can share your story at e27, too.

Depending on one's age this elicits amusement, anxiety or resignation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Philanthropist Nicole Shanahan refuses to take the facts around menopause and women's reproductive time clock lying down - and women are the better for it. There is, to be sure, little dispute around Reproduction 101, but research into ways to extend women's reproductive capabilities is also far from extensive.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"We never ask men if they believed they were going infertile at 35. We ask this of women because I think women for so long have been held to a standard of struggle. There is a lot of mental burden around losing any physical ability. But when that ability relates to becoming a parent or having your own children... It is a massive mental burden to tell your daughter as she starts to learn about herself in her teens, as she decides what she wants to do and dream of for herself. I want to remove that mental burden.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm excited. I'm optimistic that within my lifetime, we're going to see the entire notion of menopause flipped on its head.\"</p><p>Earlier this year, Ms Shanahan gifted US$8 million to the National University of Singapore's Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine for research into \"reproductive longevity\", to study ways to push the boundaries of female fertility and health. The effort, said NUS in a statement, aims to find ways to improve and lengthen female reproductive health and longevity, \"potentially enabling women to conceive safely in their later years\". It is not just the ability to conceive that deteriorates with age. Women in menopause also grapple with more health issues including metabolic diseases and osteoporosis. The gift was made through Ms Shanahan's Bia-Echo Foundation, based in the United States.</p><p>Ms Shanahan is married to Google co-founder Sergey Brin, who is named by Bloomberg Billionaire Index as the ninth richest person in the world with a net worth of US$86 billion. Mr Brin's family office is setting up a branch in Singapore.</p><p>Ms Shanahan, 35, herself struggled to conceive. At 29 she was told that her body produced immature egg cells, if at all, and that she could be approaching menopause. In-vitro fertilisation (IVF) efforts came to naught. Her story has a happy ending: She and Mr Brin now have a two-and-a-half year old daughter. But for many other women, the journey to conceive is uphill and emotionally wrenching.</p><p>The cause of reproductive longevity has no stronger champion than Ms Shanahan, who reckons she may have coined the term. She brings to the fray not just ample funding, but a doggedness and resilience honed from her hardscrabble roots. Today she lacks for nothing, but she grew up in a poor, single-parent household. She put herself through law school through student loans, where she specialised in intellectual property and high technology.</p><p>Her mother migrated to the US from China in her 20s and spoke no English when she arrived.</p><p>\"It was very hard watching her navigate life. My brother and I were born only a few years after she got to the US. She didn't get a chance to go to college until we were teenagers. She didn't really have access to regular work; she held little jobs here and there...</p><p>\"I'm so proud of how she really instilled in me the work ethic, that work pays off if you just keep going and don't give up. Just trust the system of hard work and merit.\" Her younger brother is a professional snowboard instructor. \"He and I are very fortunate that we both got to follow our dreams.\"</p><p>Her passion for the legal issues around intellectual property was sparked at age 12, when she experienced an epiphany of sorts about the value of human ideas.</p><p>\"We had these really cheesy TV commercials for 1800-PATENTS or something. I remember thinking to myself - wait, every second, every idea must surely have been discovered... As a kid in California in the 1990s you literally saw innovation happening every single day through the Internet. At that time dial-up Internet was incredibly slow and inefficient. But it really stimulated me to think about human invention in a completely different context. No one in my family had ever been to law school, but I just couldn't think of anything better to do or more inspiring than intellectual property law.</p><p>\"It was the concept that humans generate ideas that can be protected as their own entity, and those ideas are basically the foundation for economic development and human evolution, and collaboration. So I begged my way into an internship. I sent out hundreds of resumes, and I really had nothing on my resume. One boutique firm said if I interned for no expense, they may hire me as a paralegal.\"</p><p>She was already a patent specialist even before entering law school. She worked on the sale of the Nortel Network portfolio of patents, a challenging and \"nearly impossible\" task of assessing the value of over 4,000 patents. She was in her 20s then and helped to organise the analyses for an opening bid. Her team lost out, but the experience marked a turning point in her fledgling career.</p><p>\"That experience was why I started ClearAccessIP, because every room I ever worked at and every patent firm I interfaced with had very rudimentary processes for understanding, valuing and trading these incredible assets which I had come to respect so deeply. There was a very clear need and opportunity for technology to play a role.</p><p>\"One human being can only read so many patents. How were I and a team of three others going to read 4,000 patents and properly value them? So in part what happened was we undervalued the portfolio, which was why we didn't get it at the time. It was a really big learning experience for me. I don't like to lose but it was really educational to be that wrong.</p><p>\"We were off by almost half a billion dollars in our valuation analysis. I created ClearAccessIP as a way to cut down the cost of getting the most accurate view of the contents of each patent. And it ultimately became one of the most sophisticated NLP (natural language processing) ever created in legal tech.\"</p><p>Founded in 2013, ClearAccessIP helps the creators and owners of intellectual property to develop, manage and transact patent-protected technology. The firm created one of the world's most advanced patent intelligence AI engines, enabling companies to scour for technologies and helping to bridge the information gap for buyers and sellers of intellectual property. Last year ClearAccessIP was sold to IPwe, though Ms Shanahan continues to own shares.</p><p>It was at a gathering at the home of television producer Norman Lear when the idea for further research on reproductive health grabbed hold of her. She was at the event to present her research on longevity, using ClearAccessIP's intellectual property database on aging.</p><p>\"I wasn't particularly passionate about longevity. I was in my 30s when I delivered the project but I didn't really view it as that interesting.\" She did her presentation, sat down and looked at her Flo app which tracks her monthly cycle. \"I was thinking to myself, there goes another ovulation. Maybe I'll have a baby, or maybe not. I was in my early 30s, and I thought - I'm getting old.\" She sat up when Victor Dzau, president of the US National Academy of Medicine, who was also at the gathering, said it was time to \"change the narrative on aging\".</p><p>\"He said - Once we change the narrative we can line up the science to actually tackle it and hit our goals. As those words were coming in, I thought to myself - how come reproductive longevity did not come up in my research? I went up to Marc Hodosh (founder of TEDMED) and asked - Marc, is there a field on longevity for women's reproduction? He said he'd never heard of the term.\"</p><p>She adds: \"I think I'm the first to turn it into a field of medicine that can produce research and receive grants.\"</p><p>In 2018 the Bia-Echo Foundation tied up with the Buck Institute to establish the Centre for Female Reproductive Longevity and Equality. Ms Shanahan says the centre envisions \"organising the field into new categories of science that can translate into, first, new diagnostic tools, and second, new therapies and treatments\".</p><p>\"What we're learning is that it's not one thing that can make a woman infertile from one day to another. There are multiple variables. I think we need to evolve our diagnostic tools beyond a very rudimentary blood test that measures basic hormone expression in the blood. That's pretty much all we have, and a follicle count. In five years, I think we're going to see that these are very basic diagnostics.</p><p>\"Since I started this work, I've gotten hundreds of letters and emails from women telling me their miracle stories. Women share with me that they were perimenopausal or menopausal, and suddenly found themselves pregnant. Or they were told in their 20s that they were going through early menopause, and they came out of it at 46. I think there is science and so much in this field to be explored.</p><p>\"In terms of framing the question we have to look at the various diagnostic tools and basically understand that fertility ebbs and flows in a woman's life. So rather than look at it as a chart, you have to see it as multi-variable, and see how the ebb and flow happen over time.\"</p><p>It was not by chance that she came to consider NUS for a grant. In 2013 she was attached to NUS for a semester to study IP trade and Chinese law. Prior to that, she obtained a degree majoring in Asian Studies with minors in economics and Mandarin.</p><p>\"Even before I dreamed of being a lawyer I wanted to be someone who could connect the East with the West. I had this strong sense of justice and globalisation, maybe because I never fit in with my Caucasian family nor my Chinese family. Or maybe I fit in with both, but I never felt like I was one or the other.</p><p>\"I kept hearing about Singapore, I was fascinated with the country. And it exceeded my wildest imagination of what was possible. I get emotional thinking about it because to me, it is a country that has achieved everything I hoped for, for a meeting of minds of the East and West. It's like you have a country that is so diverse; it's English speaking but has such strong roots to Chinese culture.</p><p>\"Chinese culture is even more relevant in my life because it's so uniquely cohesive from country to country. It's very strong in the Bay area. And seeing it in a country where you see the result of the coming together of so many cultures - that's my hope for my family and my daughter.\"</p><p>Bia-Echo Foundation has two other causes: criminal justice reform in the US and raising consciousness towards a \"healthy and livable planet\".</p><p>On criminal justice reform, she says: \"My focus is always on understanding where the points of deep injustice lie and trying to meet at those points. It became clear that an inflection point is the prosecutor's office and then secondarily it's the police departments - understanding where bias exists and developing data models.</p><p>\"We have like six dozen different non-profit organisations looking at, for example, alternatives to incarceration for non-violent offences, looking to see if there is an opportunity outside of the prosecutorial process to serve as a community-based alternative to prison.\"</p><p>The goal of a healthy and livable planet centres around \"regenerative agriculture\" which seeks to rebuild the soil's organic matter and restore biodiversity. \"It's just amazing what can be achieved if we start to convert conventionally farmed land into regenerative land. I'm really excited about the economic opportunities. And interestingly, there is a whole area of reproductive longevity science that is focused on soil health. Not every leaf of spinach has the same health benefits, and it's all linked to the soil.\"</p><p>Wealth, she says, has given her \"immense privilege to use my knowledge in really different ways\".</p><p>\"Previously I had a tiny fraction of the wealth I have now and so much debt, like US$120,000 of school debt.</p><p>\"I'm still doing the same passionate things I always cared about, and dreaming in the same ways I've always dreamed. I think of myself as being able to contribute capital, in addition to ideas. Because of the fact that I was able to see things from so many different angles, now I can put capital out from so many different angles of understanding. I wish all people in finance have the same opportunity.\"</p><p>NICOLE SHANAHAN</p><p>Founder and presidentBia-Echo Foundation</p><p>Born in 1985</p><p>EDUCATION</p><p>2003-2007: University of Puget Sound, BA Asian Studies, Economics and Mandarin Chinese</p><p>2011-2014: Santa Clara University School of Law, JD</p><p>CAREER HIGHLIGHTS</p><p>June 2006-Aug 2007: IP Paralegal, Aeon Law (formerly Axios Law Group)</p><p>Aug 2007-Jul 2008: Consultant to the International Practice Group, Longan Law Firm</p><p>March 2009-April 2010: IP Paralegal and Database Specialist, Rutan &amp; Tucker LLP</p><p>March 2010-Dec 2020: Patent Specialist, RPX Corporation</p><p>Dec 2010-Aug 2011: Patent Specialist, PDB Patent Data</p><p>2013-2020: Founder and CEO, ClearAccessIP</p><p>Since 2014: CodeX Fellow, The Stanford Centre for Legal Informatics</p><p>Since 2020: Founder and President, Bia-Echo Foundation</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"I'm excited.

The region houses a third of the cost-effective NCS supply potential from both the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and India,\" said Mr Mikkel Larsen, chief sustainability officer for DBS Bank.</p><p> That makes Singapore a natural centre for investing in these projects and trading the credits - this explains why Temasek, DBS and others are looking at ways for Singapore to capitalise on revamping the market.</p><p> The idea is to leverage Singapore's long history in commodities trading and its well-regulated financial market. Singapore firms could use offsets as part of their emissions reduction strategies and, one day, carbon credits might be included in the nation's carbon tax scheme.</p><p> Temasek has been helping to guide Singapore's evolution into a carbon services hub and has bought offsets from two forest carbon projects to meet its internal emissions targets.</p><p> A Temasek spokesman said multiple approaches should be used in the fight against climate change, including carbon offsets. He added that Temasek hopes to support natural climate solutions and carbon projects that are of high quality and meet other social and environmental aspects, such as conserving and restoring important ecological systems like peatlands, rainforests and mangroves.</p><p> Preserving and rehabilitating these areas also reduce the risk of fires and haze, and are good for local communities.</p><p> Investor interest is being driven by mounting pressure on companies and governments to meet stringent climate targets. Globally there's been a surge in pledges to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. To get there, you're going to need nature.</p><p> \"Eliminating the 51 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere every year requires an enormous amount of global momentum and investment,\" said Mr Dharsono Hartono, co-founder of the Katingan-Mentaya forest preservation project in Central Kalimantan on Borneo island.</p><p> \"This is going to involve entirely rethinking how we produce energy, how we travel and how societies operate. But it also means rethinking how we treat nature. To keep global warming well below 2 deg C, we must protect nature,\" he added.</p><p> The Katingan-Mentaya project, comprising mostly carbon-rich deep peat swamp forest, is about twice the area of Singapore. Saving it from destruction by palm oil companies means about 7.5 million tonnes of CO2 are prevented from being emitted every year. Selling carbon offsets to big corporations, including VW Group, Shell and Bank of America, helps run the project and fund community programmes.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;TRUE POTENTIAL&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; Mr Dharsono's project, though, represents a fraction of the true potential if huge investment is channelled into well-managed and well-funded projects.</p><p> South Pole, a Swiss firm that has developed more than 800 carbon offset projects globally, sees big opportunities for investment.</p><p> \"Nature-based solutions - such as forest protection and restoration - can actually provide over a third of the climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to stabilise warming to below 2 deg C very cost-effectively. So investing in a cost-effective solution that can mitigate over 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions seems like a no-brainer,\" said Ms Leah Wieczorek, South Pole's business development lead for Asia, who is based in Singapore.</p><p> Under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, nearly 200 nations agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 deg C and aim for 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels if possible.</p><p> Professor Koh Lian Pin runs the Centre for Nature-Based Climate Solutions at the National University of Singapore. He and his team have analysed areas of the planet that could yield good returns for investors.</p><p> In a recent study published in Nature Communications, Prof Koh and colleagues show that at an initial carbon price of US$5.80 (S$7.70) a tonne, the protection of tropical forests can generate investible carbon amounting to 1.8 billion tonnes a year globally - roughly the annual emissions of Japan and Australia combined.</p><p> Financially viable carbon projects could generate return-on-investment totalling US$46 billion a year, with the highest returns in the Asia-Pacific at US$24.6 billion, followed by the Americas and Africa.</p><p> And the higher the carbon price, the greater the area of forest carbon sites that could be conserved.</p><p> The recent surge in interest in carbon offsets is pointing to higher prices, especially buyers locking in future flows of offsets at higher prices for high-quality projects.</p><p> Groups such as former Bank of England governor Mark Carney's task force on scaling up the voluntary carbon market foresee exponential growth over the coming decade.</p><p> \"In 2019, just over US$300 million worth of trading took place on the voluntary market when these projects should be measured in the tens of billions of dollars per year,\" he told a green finance summit in London last November.</p><p> Investors such as HSBC and Australia's Pollination group, a climate change advisory firm, agree.</p><p> Last year, both teamed up with the aim of creating the world's largest dedicated natural capital asset management company. They are launching a natural capital fund to invest primarily in regenerative agriculture and sustainable forestry projects. A second carbon fund is also planned aiming to ramp up investment in carbon offset projects. Overall, the intention is to raise up to US$6 billion in funds.</p><p> \"We take the view that there is a huge amount of demand and very little supply such that investment is required in the underlying projects to scale them up rapidly,\" said Mr Martijn Wilder, Pollination's founding partner.</p><p> The funding model for nature-based projects has to change, he said, with significant upfront funding crucial to ensure projects get off the ground, are well managed and well protected.</p><p> \"Protecting a rainforest is an infrastructure project. That's what you're doing.\"</p><p> HSBC said escalating risks to the climate and biodiversity have changed mindsets.\"Today, nature is undervalued and overlooked by our investment community. This must change,\" said Ms Melissa McDonald, the bank's global head of responsible investment.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;HOW TO SCALE UP&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; The existing voluntary carbon market has been around for about two decades and has strict standards for offset projects. But trading has always been small and opaque because it's purely between buyer and seller and not on an open exchange. That needs to change, market players said.</p><p> The main standard-setting body that certifies offset projects, Washington-based Verra, has issued offsets representing 622 million tonnes of CO2 reduced from 1,697 projects to date. That's the equivalent of taking 132 million cars off the road for a year.</p><p> And the market is growing. \"We've seen that in terms of the volumes of the projects coming through the door. That's definitely growing. We've seen in the last few years an increasing trend towards natural climate solutions,\" said Verra CEO David Antonioli.</p><p> South Pole's Ms Wieczorek said interest is growing in Asia, too. \"We are seeing a dramatic increase in clients in Asia looking to make carbon reduction commitments,\" she noted, adding that some clients are looking to lock in long-term offtake contracts.</p><p> \"The vast majority of humankind's carbon emissions are currently unpriced, so having a dedicated budget for offsetting also helps companies set or at least consider an internal price on carbon,\" she added.</p><p> For now, though, Mr Carney, who is the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance, said the voluntary carbon market still struggles with low liquidity and scarce financing.</p><p> To scale things up, Prof Koh said the market must overcome \"pain points\". \"The market will grow with our ability to improve the quality of those nature-based credits, our ability to reduce the cost of validation, of certification, to improve the transparency of monitoring those projects.\"</p><p> Mr Larsen of DBS agrees.</p><p> \"The thing that has plagued the voluntary carbon market for the longest time is issues around trust and integrity. The quality and integrity of the projects is believed to be too low,\" he said. People buy a project and it doesn't do what it is said to do, that's the integrity. Or it creates problems and social issues, that's the quality, he said.</p><p> \"There's no doubt that carbon offsets projects, if done right, do work, and they do sequester carbon,\" he said. But he also feels that transparency around pricing and verification is needed. Technology can help by improving the science and technology around projects, around verification of carbon stock, for example finding ways of improving carbon sequestration.</p><p> One firm that has brought price transparency is Singapore-based AirCarbon Exchange, a digital platform that trades fully verified carbon offsets. The exchange treats carbon offsets like a commodity with a range of offsets available for trading.</p><p> \"The current market construct fails to send a strong price signal due to a fragmented project-based trading environment. A strong price signal will unleash pent-up capital to finance climate mitigating projects,\" said Mr Bill Pazos, AirCarbon's chief operating officer and co-founder.</p><p> Few in the market question the integrity of the standards set by Verra - it's more that the problems lie elsewhere in the market as it has evolved. \"These standards have been around for 15 to 20 years. They are very robust. They are constantly evolving and improving themselves,\" said Pollination's Mr Wilder.</p><p> Verra's Mr Antonioli said they are constantly updating their standards according to changes in technology, regulations and latest scientific evidence.</p><p> &lt;lnvxe_h&gt;GENUINE ACTION'&lt;/lnvxe_h&gt; Some conservation groups say offsets are just a dodge, allowing polluters to buy their way out of making deep emission cuts to their operations.</p><p> That is untrue, key players said.</p><p> \"It is impossible right now for most companies to achieve climate neutrality, a key milestone on the journey to meet net-zero pledges, without the use of carbon credits,\" said South Pole's Ms Wieczorek.</p><p> Offsets from well-run, fully verified projects can help firms that are already cutting emissions go the last mile.</p><p> For DBS' Mr Larsen, carbon credits are responding to an urgent need. \"We talk about carbon offsets as a potential point of delay and inaction. And I always really struggle with that because with a football field of rainforest being cut down every six seconds, the inaction lies in not trying to help.\"</p><p> Mr Wilder said that for now, carbon financing remains a vital source of funding for conservation, despite the detractors. \"The global climate is in crisis and we have to do everything we possibly can to reduce the risks. We shouldn't be ideological about offsets and how we do it, provided the actions are real and have integrity.\"</p><p>TOMORROW \u00b7A look at two Indonesian forest carbon projects</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-796903</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62W1-5RH1-DYX4-04S1-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-06-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2362\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 23, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A3R8</classCode><className>CARBON OFFSETS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000593</classCode><className>EMISSIONS CREDITS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D1F5</classCode><className>NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001348</classCode><className>POLLUTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001956</classCode><className>POLLUTION &amp;

Now investors are planning on pouring billions of dollars into a market that promotes conservation and rewards investors with carbon credits to sell to big polluters. The first of a two-part special looks at the potential of the market, who is investing and what is needed to really get it off the ground.</nitf:hl2></nitf:hedline><nitf:byline><author><person><nameText>David Fogarty</nameText></person></author></nitf:byline></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The vision is grand, the outcome could be just what the planet needs: investing billions of dollars to save vanishing nature and fight climate change at the same time.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The foundations of such a market already exist. Called the voluntary carbon market, it focuses on the ability of nature to soak up huge amounts of planet-warming carbon dioxide (CO2). Developers of conservation projects earn a return by selling carbon credits to buyers, usually big companies, to help them meet their climate goals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Essentially, you are offsetting a portion of your own carbon emissions by paying someone else to do it for you.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The market, though still small, has shown it works. Scores of successful nature-based climate projects exist which avoid or lock away millions of tonnes of CO2.</p><p> Now, faced with the twin emergencies of climate change and biodiversity loss, investors want to remodel the market and channel huge sums into protecting and rehabilitating rainforests, mangroves and grasslands, and greatly expand the volumes of carbon credits, or offsets, for sale.</p><p> By the end of the decade, the market could be worth billions of dollars a year and Singapore is aiming to be a regional carbon credit investment and trading hub.</p><p> Efforts are well under way in Singapore and around the globe to make the market more transparent, more efficient and improve the quality and verification of the nature-based climate projects to entice large-scale investment. If done well, it could be a win for the fight against climate change and curb the loss of nature.</p><p> TRUST AND TRANSPARENCY To get there, the market must overcome questions about transparency and concerns over ensuring every project does what it claims: reduces or locks away CO2 in a fully verifiable way.</p><p> And investors also need reassurance that the conservation or replanting projects are fully protected and not destroyed by fire or cleared for agriculture or logging. That's where technology such as satellite monitoring comes in.</p><p> While existing projects have proved the model, the concern is whether vastly scaled-up investment will undermine the integrity of the market in the rush for carbon gold.</p><p> Carbon credits represent a tonne of CO2 reduced or locked away. It's an attractive idea for customers such as car manufacturers, tech firms, banks and pension funds keen to hedge their future carbon costs.</p><p> A key focus, particularly in South-east Asia, is on saving natural ecosystems rich in carbon and with a high capacity for soaking up CO2, such as peat swamp forests. These forests and replanted areas need to be protected over the long term from logging, illegal clearing for palm oil and fires. Which is why well-run projects hire staff to monitor the project area on the ground, and in space using satellites.</p><p> Ultimately, the idea is about putting a value on ecosystems, a value that helps them compete with mining, industrial agriculture and logging interests.</p><p> The higher the carbon price, the greater the return - and the incentive for investors to take the risk.</p><p> THE SINGAPORE CONNECTION \"Thanks to their rich forest, wetland and mangrove ecosystems, South-east Asia and Asia generally are set to become one of the largest suppliers of natural climate solutions (NCS) globally. The region houses a third of the cost-effective NCS supply potential from both the protection and restoration of natural ecosystems in countries like Indonesia, Malaysia and India,\" said Mr Mikkel Larsen, chief sustainability officer for DBS Bank.</p><p> That makes Singapore a natural centre for investing in these projects and trading the credits - this explains why Temasek, DBS and others are looking at ways for Singapore to capitalise on revamping the market.</p><p> The idea is to leverage Singapore's long history in commodities trading and its well-regulated financial market. Singapore firms could use offsets as part of their emissions reduction strategies and, one day, carbon credits might be included in the nation's carbon tax scheme.</p><p> Temasek has been helping to guide Singapore's evolution into a carbon services hub and has bought offsets from two forest carbon projects to meet its internal emissions targets.</p><p> A Temasek spokesman said multiple approaches should be used in the fight against climate change, including carbon offsets. He added that Temasek hopes to support natural climate solutions and carbon projects that are of high quality and meet other social and environmental aspects, such as conserving and restoring important ecological systems like peatlands, rainforests and mangroves.</p><p> Preserving and rehabilitating these areas also reduce the risk of fires and haze, and are good for local communities.</p><p> Investor interest is being driven by mounting pressure on companies and governments to meet stringent climate targets. Globally there's been a surge in pledges to reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. To get there, you're going to need nature.</p><p> \"Eliminating the 51 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere every year requires an enormous amount of global momentum and investment,\" said Mr Dharsono Hartono, co-founder of the Katingan-Mentaya forest preservation project in Central Kalimantan on Borneo island.</p><p> \"This is going to involve entirely rethinking how we produce energy, how we travel and how societies operate. But it also means rethinking how we treat nature. To keep global warming well below 2 deg C, we must protect nature,\" he added.</p><p> The Katingan-Mentaya project, comprising mostly carbon-rich deep peat swamp forest, is about twice the area of Singapore. Saving it from destruction by palm oil companies means about 7.5 million tonnes of CO2 are prevented from being emitted every year. Selling carbon offsets to big corporations, including VW Group, Shell and Bank of America, helps run the project and fund community programmes.</p><p> TRUE POTENTIAL Mr Dharsono's project, though, represents a fraction of the true potential if huge investment is channelled into well-managed and well-funded projects.</p><p> South Pole, a Swiss firm that has developed more than 800 carbon offset projects globally, sees big opportunities for investment.</p><p> \"Nature-based solutions - such as forest protection and restoration - can actually provide over a third of the climate mitigation needed between now and 2030 to stabilise warming to below 2 deg C very cost-effectively. So investing in a cost-effective solution that can mitigate over 30 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions seems like a no-brainer,\" said Ms Leah Wieczorek, South Pole's business development lead for Asia, who is based in Singapore.</p><p> Under the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement, nearly 200 nations agreed to limit global warming to well below 2 deg C and aim for 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels if possible.</p><p> Professor Koh Lian Pin runs the Centre for Nature-Based Climate Solutions at the National University of Singapore. He and his team have analysed areas of the planet that could yield good returns for investors.</p><p> In a recent study published in Nature Communications, Prof Koh and colleagues show that at an initial carbon price of US$5.80 (S$7.70) a tonne, the protection of tropical forests can generate investible carbon amounting to 1.8 billion tonnes a year globally - roughly the annual emissions of Japan and Australia combined.</p><p> Financially viable carbon projects could generate return-on-investment totalling US$46 billion a year, with the highest returns in the Asia-Pacific at US$24.6 billion, followed by the Americas and Africa.</p><p> And the higher the carbon price, the greater the area of forest carbon sites that could be conserved.</p><p> The recent surge in interest in carbon offsets is pointing to higher prices, especially buyers locking in future flows of offsets at higher prices for high-quality projects.</p><p> Groups such as former Bank of England governor Mark Carney's task force on scaling up the voluntary carbon market foresee exponential growth over the coming decade.</p><p> \"In 2019, just over US$300 million worth of trading took place on the voluntary market when these projects should be measured in the tens of billions of dollars per year,\" he told a green finance summit in London last November.</p><p> Investors such as HSBC and Australia's Pollination group, a climate change advisory firm, agree.</p><p> Last year, both teamed up with the aim of creating the world's largest dedicated natural capital asset management company. They are launching a natural capital fund to invest primarily in regenerative agriculture and sustainable forestry projects. A second carbon fund is also planned aiming to ramp up investment in carbon offset projects. Overall, the intention is to raise up to US$6 billion in funds.</p><p> \"We take the view that there is a huge amount of demand and very little supply such that investment is required in the underlying projects to scale them up rapidly,\" said Mr Martijn Wilder, Pollination's founding partner.</p><p> The funding model for nature-based projects has to change, he said, with significant upfront funding crucial to ensure projects get off the ground, are well managed and well protected.</p><p> \"Protecting a rainforest is an infrastructure project. That's what you're doing.\"</p><p> HSBC said escalating risks to the climate and biodiversity have changed mindsets.\"Today, nature is undervalued and overlooked by our investment community. This must change,\" said Ms Melissa McDonald, the bank's global head of responsible investment.</p><p> HOW TO SCALE UP The existing voluntary carbon market has been around for about two decades and has strict standards for offset projects. But trading has always been small and opaque because it's purely between buyer and seller and not on an open exchange. That needs to change, market players said.</p><p> The main standard-setting body that certifies offset projects, Washington-based Verra, has issued offsets representing 622 million tonnes of CO2 reduced from 1,697 projects to date. That's the equivalent of taking 132 million cars off the road for a year.</p><p> And the market is growing. \"We've seen that in terms of the volumes of the projects coming through the door. That's definitely growing. We've seen in the last few years an increasing trend towards natural climate solutions,\" said Verra CEO David Antonioli.</p><p> South Pole's Ms Wieczorek said interest is growing in Asia, too. \"We are seeing a dramatic increase in clients in Asia looking to make carbon reduction commitments,\" she noted, adding that some clients are looking to lock in long-term offtake contracts.</p><p> \"The vast majority of humankind's carbon emissions are currently unpriced, so having a dedicated budget for offsetting also helps companies set or at least consider an internal price on carbon,\" she added.</p><p> For now, though, Mr Carney, who is the United Nations special envoy for climate action and finance, said the voluntary carbon market still struggles with low liquidity and scarce financing.</p><p> To scale things up, Prof Koh said the market must overcome \"pain points\". \"The market will grow with our ability to improve the quality of those nature-based credits, our ability to reduce the cost of validation, of certification, to improve the transparency of monitoring those projects.\"</p><p> Mr Larsen of DBS agrees.</p><p> \"The thing that has plagued the voluntary carbon market for the longest time is issues around trust and integrity.

Their protein of choice must be ethically produced, with proven animal welfare and with environmental credentials.</p><p> Last year, an environmental sustainability study (carried out by software company Hewlett-Packard in partnership with environmental foundation Planet Ark) showed that 91 per cent of Australian respondents were generally concerned about the environment and 71 per cent were willing to pay extra for sustainable products.</p><p> Another report by market research firm Nielsen states that product sales of sustainable Fast Moving Consumer Goods in the United States grew by 20 per cent between 2014 (US$107.3 billion) and last year (US$128.5 billion, as of October last year), and forecasts continued growth to US$150 billion (S$208 billion) by 2021.</p><p>They pretty much look after themselves, so long as I keep the land healthy.</p><p> FARMER TIM EYES from central coast New South Wales, Australia, on his cattle. He has adopted a way of farming called regenerative agriculture, which places greater importance on keeping the soil and pastures healthy with careful management</p><p>  First-generation farmer Tim Eyes, 27, from central coast New South Wales, Australia, is not ignoring the demands of this consumer group.</p><p> Speaking to The Sunday Times, he said he is adopting a way of farming called regenerative agriculture, which places greater importance on keeping the soil and pastures healthy with careful management.</p><p> This includes moving the cattle and using organic fertilisers - particularly important considering 70 per cent of Australian cattle are pasture fed.</p><p> Not only does this reduce carbon emissions, but it also ensures that the soil remains nutrient-dense.</p><p> Last year, Meat and Livestock Australia (MLA), an industry research and marketing body that services approximately 50,000 cattle, sheep and goat producers, released a statement saying that the meat industry has set a target to be carbon neutral by 2030 - a clear message to global consumers that the Australian red meat industry is serious about addressing greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p> The MLA says that in order to reduce methane (a greenhouse gas similar to carbon dioxide which is emitted by cows when they \"burp\" as part of their digestion process), a variety of measures can be implemented. For example, farms can improve feeding practices which include using new types of food and better pastures.</p><p> Feedlots are also investigating the potential of using methane as a renewable energy source, recycling manure to reduce emissions and creating a renewable fertiliser.</p><p> MLA also found that the vast majority of Australian farmers are using sustainable farming practices. These include carefully managing emissions and water use, increasing biodiversity and reducing waste.</p><p> They are also working with meat producers to ensure the meat produced is of consistently high quality, with safety integrity systems in place as well as high animal welfare standards.</p><p> Mr Michael Finucan, MLA's general manager (International Business), says maintaining trust in Australian red meat is not something that is left to chance.</p><p> He adds: \"It is this system of food safety measures, quality assurance and traceability from paddock to plate that guarantees the integrity of Australia's A$22.9 billion (S$21.3 billion) red meat industry.\"</p><p> Mr Eyes the farmer places great importance on the welfare of his animals, with careful and regular monitoring of his cattle.</p><p> As a result, he says his cattle are the healthiest and happiest they can be. \"They pretty much look after themselves, so long as I keep the land healthy,\" he says.</p><p> In response to health concerns over eating too much red meat, consumers are increasingly looking for better quality meat as they reduce their overall intake.</p><p> With households in South-east Asia with an annual disposable income of at least US$35,000 set to rise 52 per cent between this year and 2022, there is an opportunity for Australia to gain more of the \"premium\" sector of the market.</p><p> Already, the increase in sheep meat and beef exports from Australia to Asean countries is up 12 per cent from the first quarter of last year to the first quarter of this year.</p><p> Though the average age of cattle farmers in Australia is 60, it is the younger farmers like Mr Eyes who are listening carefully to what consumers need.</p><p> By sharing their up-to-date knowledge with other farmers and the wider community, they are making positive changes for the future.</p><p>\u00b7 Ghillie James is a freelance food and travel writer and cookery book author.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-617652</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X0M-BTG1-DYX4-00H0-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-09-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"879\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"09\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>September 8, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><classCode>CC0002KLJ</classCode><className>HP INC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>NAICS334118 COMPUTER TERMINAL &amp;

This is captured in the film, which has won awards at several film festivals.</p><p> Its director is one-half of the couple, John Chester, a 48-year-old film-maker and television director. He and his wife Molly, an organic chef and food blogger, left their lives in the city to buy Apricot Lane Farms, an hour outside of LA.</p><p> Biodiversity and sustainable farming are hot topics now as consumers become more health-conscious and concerned about growing environmental degradation, but Chester says the solution is not simply to blame large-scale agriculture.</p><p>  Instead, people must think about how their buying decisions affect everything and realise the true cost of cheap food.</p><p> Speaking at a screening of the film in LA, Chester says when he and his wife took over the farm more than eight years ago, what they found was not encouraging.</p><p> \"We came to a farm that had been depleted of its biodiversity through 45 years of extractive methods that were used in order to grow food cheaply,\" he says, noting that the same is true of much commercial farming land today.</p><p> But they slowly turned things around using the approach of \"regenerative agriculture\", which refers to holistic practices - such as biodynamic farming and permaculture - aimed at maintaining soil fertility, water levels and biodiversity as well as increasing carbon sequestration.</p><p> This can be applicable on a planetary scale too. \"In reawakening the ecosystem, the goal is to bring back the biodiversity because it is the self-regulating immune system of not only the planet but also the farm.</p><p> \"The whole point is really to maximise biodiversity as a way to help regulate against epidemics of pests and disease. It's a microcosm of the planet's immune system, which we call the ecosystem. There is a direct correlation between species diversity and the happiness of that ecosystem.\"</p><p> Through arduous trial and error, the couple soon discovered how complicated the ecosystem really is.</p><p> But just as they encountered unforeseen setbacks, they also stumbled across solutions, like when they realised that instead of shooting the chicken-killing coyotes - which they did not want to do for humane reasons, but also because coyotes kill pests such as gophers and rabbits - they recruited one of their two Great Pyrenees dogs to protect the birds instead.</p><p> There is \"no science\" to recruiting a guardian dog, Chester explains - one of the pooches had a taste for killing chickens and the other simply did not.</p><p> \"You just put a dog in and if it doesn't eat the chickens, then that's the one that guards them.\"</p><p> Even when some of his other dogs killed a few chickens later on, it was still a more elegant solution. \"I said the coyotes got them beat by 350. And I haven't lost a chicken in a year and a half to a coyote. So you have to make those tough, lesser-of-two-evils decisions.\"</p><p> Asked how members of the public can support small-scale, regenerative farming, he suggests a mindset shift is in order.</p><p> \"The only way we're going to get around large-scale industrialised agriculture and the use of chemicals is to have innovation around it and solutions. That has to be supported by consumers willing to pay for food for what it really costs.\"</p><p> \"Maybe you can't buy the most expensive food all the time,\" he adds. \"But you need to be conscious about those decisions.\"</p><p>\u00b7 The Biggest Little Farm opens in Singapore today.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Directed by John Chester, The Biggest Little Farm (above) is an environmental documentary that follows a California couple who set out to run a small, sustainable, biodynamic farm.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-609442</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5WS1-85F1-DYX4-033D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-08-07</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"699\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"08\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>August 8, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>Animal Protection</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6N0EyNzFDRkFDRjdCNDdDM0I0QjBFNjZDMENCNDJDRDQ7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NkVDMzM4QkJENTg3NDQ0RDg3NTA5OEM3RkMyQTlENDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009V6I</classCode><className>DOCUMENTARY FILMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009UV1</classCode><className>FILM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TL2</classCode><className>GREEN MARKET</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00092L9</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>ST0009FYF</classCode><className>LIFE FORMS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000A5F8</classCode><className>ACTORS &amp;
