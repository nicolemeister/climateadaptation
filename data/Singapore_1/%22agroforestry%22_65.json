and should be made more severe for repeat offenders, said the first two MPs who debated the new Bill before Parliament was adjourned yesterday.</p><p> The Bill - an earlier version of which was up for public consultation earlier this year - was introduced in Parliament in July and holds entities liable for activities inside or outside Singapore that cause unhealthy haze here.</p><p> Its aim is to help combat the haze that blankets Singapore from time to time, especially during the dry season, due to illegal land clearing by burning in Indonesia.</p><p> Mr Christopher de Souza (Holland-Bukit Timah GRC) pointed out that the financial penalties, which are up to $100,000 a day and go up to a maximum of $2 million, may represent only a small sum to large agroforestry firms.</p><p> Ms Lee Bee Wah (Nee Soon GRC) said the fines should be doubled or even tripled.</p><p> \"The fines in the Bill may not be sufficient deterrent against offenders who will weigh the cost of the fine if they are caught, against the profits they will gain.\"</p><p> Monitoring and locating hot spots takes up government resources, while haze also incurs economic and personal health losses here, she added.</p><p> In addition, the new law should contain a provision for whistleblowers, she said.</p><p> Mr de Souza said errant companies' use of illegal slash-and-burn land clearing methods should be exposed, and urged consumers to pressure them economically.</p><p> \"Until and unless consumers are made aware that certain products they purchase are the product of these actions... companies will continue undeterred,\" he said.</p><p> At least seven more MPs are scheduled to debate the Bill, and it is expected to be passed today.</p><p> Separately, the Government said it had offered the Indonesian government the use of a helicopter with a specialised heli-bucket to help fight fires there.</p><p> This adds to its earlier offer in June, of satellite pictures, Singapore Civil Defence Force assistance, and other aircraft for cloud-seeding.</p><p>GRACE CHUA</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier

We thank Mr Chris Cheng Chin Hsien for his views.</p><p>The haze, which blanketed the region last year, was a catastrophe for the environment, the economy and, most importantly, people's lives.</p><p>As a company, we were deeply affected by the events last year, and have intensified our efforts to do whatever we can to ensure that such a tragedy is never repeated.</p><p>Forest fires are complex and rooted in a number of economic, social and political causes.</p><p>Above all, what is required is a multi-stakeholder approach towards seeking solutions.</p><p>We recognise the link between land clearance and the production of forest commodities. That is why Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) Group has been bound by a strict zero-deforestation commitment enshrined in our Forest Conservation Policy (FCP) since February 2013. </p><p>The policy includes a number of key pillars. Among them are that there be no further clearance of natural forests, including peat forests, and the adoption of peatland management best practices by all our pulpwood suppliers.</p><p>Over the past three years, we have worked hard to develop a reliable supply of 100 per cent plantation wood for our mills.</p><p>While the new mill at OKI in South Sumatra significantly increases APP's production capacity, we are absolutely clear that our FCP commitments come first, over and above maximising our production. Any future increase in production will be subject to the availability of raw materials from our suppliers.</p><p>To ensure that our new mill can reach optimum levels of production while fully respecting our commitments made in the FCP, we are taking the following steps:</p><p>First, increasing productivity and yield in our plantations by working on improved control of pests and diseases, reducing mortality and wastage as well as increasing efficiency in our harvesting methods by using mechanisation techniques.</p><p>Second, research into new species in partnership with engineering and development consultancy firm Euroconsult Mott MacDonald to identify alternative plant species that can provide better yields and thrive in wetter peatland conditions.</p><p>Third, embracing community forestry into our supply chain according to government regulations and guidelines to adopt local wisdom, reduce poverty and enhance the alternative livelihoods of communities living in and around our concessions through agroforestry.</p><p>Fourth, sourcing woodchips from global suppliers if the measures above still prove insufficient, but only from suppliers that meet our Responsible Fiber Procurement and Processing Policy requirements. </p><p>The commitments we made in the FCP come first. The OKI mill entering into production will not affect our commitment.</p><p>In the meantime, we remain committed to working with all affected stakeholders to do everything we can to ensure last year's events are not repeated.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A plantation owned by Asia Pulp and Paper along the Musi River in Sumatra.

Fibric peat, on the other hand, is only partially decomposed, said National University of Singapore (NUS) peat scientist Lahiru Wijedasa. Fibric peat appears flaky, with partially decomposed organic matter such as tree debris.</p><p> Wet peat could prove valuable.</p><p> The peat dome we stood on was being restored not just for conservation's sake; if the deep, thick peat remains wet, there is money to be made from it too.</p><p>  Its potential may not be immediately apparent to visitors who have to endure mosquito bites while trudging through dense vegetation to get there.</p><p> The value of a peat forest is underground, and the currency is carbon.</p><p> Think-tank World Resources Institute said that tropical peatlands can store up to 20 times more carbon than non-peat mineral soils.</p><p> Healthy peatlands have plenty of carbon locked in their depths - and that is essentially what the Katingan Mentaya project in Central Kalimantan hopes to \"sell\" as carbon credits. The project, owned and managed by Indonesian company Rimba Makmur Utama (RMU), spans about 150,000ha - an area more than twice the size of Singapore.</p><p> Active conservation and restoration efforts, such as the replanting of trees in degraded areas, have allowed the land to remove carbon from the atmosphere and store it underground, equivalent to taking two million cars off the road each year.</p><p> The 7.5 million carbon credits that the Katingan Mentaya project produces each year are sold to businesses such as oil company Shell and car giant Volkswagen.</p><p> The units are validated and verified by auditors approved by international non-profit organisation Verra, which manages the Verified Carbon Standard.</p><p> The cost of each verified carbon unit sold by Katingan Mentaya is commercially sensitive information. But each unit purchased prevents a tonne of carbon dioxide from entering the earth's atmosphere.</p><p> RMU co-founder and chief executive Dharsono Hartono, 45, said: \"Our goal is to save one of the last remaining peatland forests in Indonesia by turning it into a good business model. This will profit the company, the surrounding communities and also save the environment.\"</p><p> The Volkswagen Group said on its website that its purchase of carbon credits in the Katingan Mentaya project \"compensates for the currently still unavoidable carbon dioxide emissions from the supply chain, production and delivery of the new Volkswagen e-vehicle ID.3, as well as emissions from other areas\".</p><p> Said the group's head of sustainability Ralf Pfitzner: \"Where total decarbonisation is not yet possible, we want to invest in forest conservation programmes that greatly reduce atmospheric carbon dioxide, provide long-term support to local communities, protect biodiversity, while at the same time, help address the climate crisis in line with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.\"</p><p> The purchase of carbon credits allows the peat forests to continue what they do best - \"store carbon, produce oxygen, provide habitat for threatened and endemic species, and support the sustainable development of local community initiatives\", says Katingan Mentaya on its website.</p><p> Animals threatened with extinction can be found in the deep forests of the project site, and an estimated 3,500 critically endangered Bornean orang utans call it home. The Straits Times saw a number of their nests in the trees.</p><p> Through this process of saving the planet, Mr Hartono, a former investment banker with JPMorgan Chase in New York, wants to help local communities too.</p><p> RMU has invested more than US$10 million (S$13.5 million) in schemes to boost the livelihoods of people living in the 34 villages around the project site.</p><p> The aim is to provide the villagers with more profitable means of making a living - such as by processing coconut sugar, which is a higher-value product than dried coconut meat (copra), and by growing vanilla and cashew trees. This way, villagers do not need to enter the project site to log trees.</p><p> Coconut farmer Sugiyono, 27, who goes by one name, is among those who have benefited from the community programme. He used to sell copra at nearby markets, but can now earn up to 10 times more from selling coconut sugar, which is processed on-site in his village.</p><p> The idea of making peat forests pay for their own conservation is a novel business idea in Indonesia.</p><p> There are large swathes of peatland in the country - it has an estimated 21 million ha of peatland, or 36 per cent of the world's tropical peatland, according to figures cited in a 2017 scientific paper.</p><p> But these peatlands are often drained and converted into plantations for cash crops that do not grow well in waterlogged soil, such as oil palm, or acacia, which is grown for the production of pulp and paper.</p><p> Dr Murdiyarso estimates that the area of converted and degraded peatland in Indonesia is about 10 million ha.</p><p> The large-scale drainage of peatlands by agroforestry companies makes the landscape more susceptible to burning.</p><p> So when fires are started - often by farmers employing the slash-and-burn clearing technique - the infernos can spiral out of control, resulting in the perennial haze that clouds Singapore and the rest of South-east Asia, as was the case earlier this year.</p><p> The peat dome that is now the Katingan Mentaya conservation project could have gone the same way - if not for the courage and conviction of Mr Hartono and his business partner Rezal Kusumaatmadja.</p><p> MULTIPLE POSITIVE OUTCOMES</p><p>Our goal is to save one of the last remaining peatland forests in Indonesia by turning it into a good business model. This will profit the company, the surrounding communities and also save the environment.</p><p> RIMBA MAKMUR UTAMA CHIEF EXECUTIVE DHARSONO HARTONO</p><p>  The land, which was formerly a logging concession, had been designated by the Indonesian government as a production forest. This meant it could be converted into plantations, for logging, or for ecosystem restoration.</p><p> In 2007, Mr Hartono started RMU, and subsequently applied for a licence to restore the area. Mr Kusumaatmadja played a part in the decision when he highlighted a new business model with a triple bottom line - profit, planet and people.</p><p> \"We had the choice of either being a small palm oil company, or a global player that could have an impact on the world's climate,\" Mr Hartono told The Straits Times amid the lush foliage of the Katingan Mentaya project site.</p><p> By putting a price on nature, the duo reasoned, people would be more inspired to protect it. But sticking to this conviction was not easy, said Mr Hartono, who received plenty of criticism for his business premise.</p><p> It took more than 10 years and millions of dollars in investment before the company finally turned a profit last year, he said. \"We have finally proven that the forest is worth saving,\" he said.</p><p> Today, Katingan Mentaya is an example of a Redd+ project - a voluntary climate-change mitigation approach.</p><p>  The Katingan Mentaya project got its name from the two rivers that flow to the east and west of the site, which is apt, considering the importance of water to peatland ecosystems.</p><p> Mr Johannes Kieft, a peat expert at the UN Environment Programme in Jakarta, said peatlands are enriched with carbon in a gradual process that could take thousands of years. In Katingan Mentaya, the peat dome had been accumulating for more than 10,000 years, said Mr Kieft, who is also lead technical adviser for the Redd+ programme in Indonesia.</p><p> Peatlands are formed when tropical forest trees, such as those from the genus Shorea, grow in water-logged soil. The leaves of the trees take in carbon dioxide through the process of photosynthesis.</p><p> When leaves and other tree debris fall off, they decompose slowly because they are covered by water. So while carbon dioxide from this decomposition is being released in an intact peatland, more carbon is being stored in the soil, resulting in an overall net removal of carbon from the atmosphere, said Mr Lahiru of NUS.</p><p> Peatland ecosystems may be less well-known than other terrestrial habitats such as rainforests or mangroves. But more attention is being paid to them now, as nations strive to limit global warming to 1.5 deg C above pre-industrial levels, to prevent the worst impact on the climate.</p><p> Peat forests are worth saving for the next generation, said Mr Hartono, who has a nine-year-old son. \"Many people are sceptical about protecting and conserving peatlands, thinking it would be more profitable to open it for cultivation instead,\" he said.</p><p> \"But there are environmental losses we cannot quantify. Our efforts over the past 12 years show there is a real business case for peatland conservation and restoration.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Above: Mr Dharsono Hartono is chief executive of Rimba Makmur Utama, which founded and manages the 150,000ha Katingan Mentaya peatland conservation project in Central Kalimantan.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-644764</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XR9-HSF1-DYX4-00PF-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-12-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1555\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"12\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>December 14, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><classCode>CC0002KER</classCode><className>VOLKSWAGEN AG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><classCode>CC0009F0K</classCode><className>ROYAL DUTCH SHELL PLC</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"54\"><className>WORLD RESOURCES INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>NAICS336111 AUTOMOBILE MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS447110 GASOLINE STATIONS WITH CONVENIENCE STORES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS325110 PETROCHEMICAL MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"81\"><className>VOW (FRA)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>RDSA (LSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>RDSA (AMS)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>RDS.B (NYSE)</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"63\"><className>RDS.A (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;

The key is to select companies whose mission of doing good is integral to their business models.</p><p>\"The way we look at impact investing is quite specific. We define it as an investment whose business model does a social good, instead of the social good being a by-product. With that perspective, the more good it does socially, the stronger the business model, and the more cash flow and resources for the business to grow. There is a reinforcement of the cycle.</p><p>\"If a company makes money and gives it away, or uses it for a non-economically viable activity then there will be a trade-off in terms of returns.''</p><p>The fund will be managed by UOB Venture Management, and Credit Suisse serves as the impact adviser. Credit Suisse provides input on the social metrics and participates in due diligence on potential portfolio companies.</p><p>UOBVM manages close to US$1 billion in assets. Since 2004, it has incorporated ESG (environmental, social and governance) assessment in its evaluation process. On its website, it says part of its capital is also placed in impact investments.</p><p>\"Our impact investment strategy is to target fast growing businesses (across Asean and China) that seek to improve the livelihood of people living at the 'base of the pyramid' (BOP). Currently, an estimated 1.35 billion people in Asean and China live on less than US$8.22 a day.\"</p><p>The Asian Impact vehicle was launched last November, and the goal is to raise roughly US$100 million by the end of the year. So far, about half of the investments secured have been from Asian clients.</p><p>The vehicle aims to invest in companies that have a proven business model, but need a leg-up in terms of expansion. Mr Fung says: \"We're not investing in start-ups, or in micro-scale companies . . . To properly diversify, we probably need 10 to 15 companies each capable of absorbing US$5 million to US$10 million over the life of the investment.\"</p><p>Investments are likely to be in the regions of greater China, Indo-China which includes Laos and Cambodia, and Indonesia. Sector exposures include agriculture, healthcare, water, clean energy and access to finance.</p><p>On the expected rate of return, Mr Fung said that the typical hurdle rate of such funds is between 6 and 8 per cent, and the vehicle is expected to deliver returns that are \"market aligned\". Credit Suisse surveys find that there is an appetite among the wealthy for impact investments. The latter is expected to account for 44 per cent of Asia-Pacific ultra high net worth individuals' \"doing good\" capital allocation by 2018, from 33 per cent in 2015.</p><p>In an earlier statement on the study, Mr Fung said that individuals in Asia were becoming more engaged. \"They are finding more ways to contribute their time and money. They are also increasingly embracing impact investing, believing that it is a more efficient use of funds to achieve social impact than philanthropy.''</p><p>Credit Suisse has issued a number of investment notes with social impact. The \"Higher Education\" note series benefits students around the world with higher education. Note 1 raised US$25 million in 2014, and has a target internal rate of return (IRR) of over 5 per cent in USD. Note 2 raised US$60 million in 2015.</p><p>There is also the \"Nature Conservation Note\" which comprises investments in sustainable agroforestry and ecosystem conservation, and a portfolio of sustainable bonds. The note raised US$14 million in 2014 and has a target IRR of 7 per cent in euro.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>\"To properly diversify, we probably need 10 to 15 companies each capable of absorbing US$5 million to US$10 million over the life of the investment.\" - Credit Suisse's Bernard Fung (above)</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">BUSTMS-116026</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5KCF-B351-DYX4-0276-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2017-05-28</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Business Times Singapore</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"08\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>August 3, 2016 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0001X99</classCode><className>CREDIT SUISSE GROUP AG</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS551111 OFFICES OF BANK HOLDING COMPANIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS524126 DIRECT PROPERTY &amp;

For instance, while satellite data may show hot spots within an area, not all of these may translate into real fires. This is because things like metal rooftops or bodies of water may register as hot spots.</p><p> LONG-TERM SOLUTION</p><p>While law enforcement can be a short-term solution to solve some of these land governance issues, the long-term solution is really to solve land tenure issues, overlapping licences and land allocations to the state and people.</p><p> DR ARIEF WIJAYA, senior manager for climate and forests at think-tank World Resources Institute Indonesia, on the complexity of the perennial fire problem boiling down to unclear land tenure.</p><p>  Dr Arief Wijaya, senior manager for climate and forests at think-tank World Resources Institute (WRI) Indonesia, said: \"It's difficult to say what the exact ratio between hot spots and actual fires is, especially since fires on peat lands (in Indonesia) are smouldering fires, not wildfires like in California.\"</p><p> Analyses done by WRI - which runs the Global Forest Watch Fires platform that tracks hot spots in tropical rainforests - show the percentage of hot spots verified as real fires could range from 20 to 80 per cent, Dr Arief said.</p><p> What is needed, say experts, are boots on the ground. Said Dr Arief: \"Satellite data before and after fires happen are one evidence, but field investigations are needed to support a complete investigation.\"</p><p>  While the haze may have returned for awhile last month, it was not as bad as the 2015 crisis.</p><p> In both years, fires were worsened by drier-than-usual weather caused by natural climate phenomena.</p><p> The recurrence had led to questions about the role of firms with a presence here.</p><p> Earlier this month, about 10 MPs filed parliamentary questions on the role of such firms in causing the haze and actions taken by the Singapore Government in holding them accountable.</p><p> In a written reply, Mr Masagos Zulkifli, Minister for the Environment and Water Resources, said Singapore has undertaken a slew of measures. This includes extending offers of firefighting assistance and requesting information about offences committed by Singapore-registered firms, among others.</p><p>  Officially, Indonesia has named only one firm with a presence here as having plantations sealed off by the authorities after fires were detected on its concession.</p><p> Sealing off means the plantations cannot operate while the authorities conduct investigations.</p><p> On Sept 13, Indonesian Environment and Forestry Minister Siti Nurbaya Bakar named Hutan Ketapang Industri as the Singapore-affiliated company among firms with plantations sealed off.</p><p> Hutan Ketapang Industri is a West Kalimantan province-based rubber plantation subsidiary of another Indonesian company, Sungai Menang, which is a wholly owned subsidiary of Indonesia's Sampoerna Agro. Singapore-based Sampoerna Agri Resources owns two-thirds of Sampoerna Agro.</p><p> But on Sept 22, foresthints.news published a report saying that fires have also been detected in concessions linked to APP and April. The report, which cited satellite data and the Indonesian government, said concessions linked to both firms were also sealed off .</p><p> The firms have disputed these allegations. While fires do occur on their lands, they say the accusations lack nuance and do not reflect the situation on the ground.</p><p>  APP said the satellite data cited by foresthints, which was derived from the European Space Agency's (ESA) Sentinel-2 satellite, showed hot spots aggregated over time.</p><p> \"This made it look as though fires were raging non-stop over a large area. At any single point in time, the reality on the ground was distinctly different from the one presented,\" said APP in a statement .</p><p> \"This is because simply adding up hot spots over the course of multiple days distorts the reality on the ground, where fires were constantly being extinguished by APP's fire team.\"</p><p> APP also said its own satellite data, sourced from the ESA's Sentinel-3 satellite, showed that the fires had started outside of APP's concessions and that they were already put out by Sept 22.</p><p> Mr Bernard Tan, country president for Singapore at Sinar Mas, APP's parent company, said the narrative that big companies burn to clear land for plantations was an \"overly simplistic one\".</p><p> \"Burning to clear land is untenable for corporations who have more to lose - in standing stock and in reputation - than to gain, but farmers in some rural communities continue to burn to clear land in line with some traditional agricultural practices,\" he said. \"This burning takes place in and around concession areas.\"</p><p> For its part, APP said its fire team extinguishes fires up to 5km around its concessions and reaches out to villages by training community fire brigades, and promoting sustainable forms of farming that do not involve burning. APP said it has reached out to 307 villages so far, but Mr Tan said it recognises that more needs to be done.</p><p>  Mr Craig Tribolet, April's sustainability operations manager, said while the company acknowledges that fires do occur in areas where April, or a supply partner, hold concession licences, the fire situation was a complex one.</p><p> For one, accusations of fires do not take into consideration a firm's efforts to put out the fires and stop them from happening in the first place, he said.</p><p> Both the foresthints and Eyes on the Forest reports had pointed out fires burning in PT Sumatera Riang Lestari, one of April's suppliers in Riau province.</p><p> Mr Tribolet noted that the fire there had occurred on land that had not been developed into plantations.</p><p> He said: \"We accept we have to take responsibility as we technically hold the concession licence, even though it's not our fault.\"</p><p> But in this case, efforts to put out the fires had been blocked by communities growing oil palm on the land, said Mr Tribolet, adding: \"They involve community issues that aren't easily resolved.\"</p><p> While the village had not yet agreed to take part in the Fire Free Village Programme (FFVP) - one of April's fire-prevention initiatives - he said April was still reaching out to them.</p><p> A key pillar under FFVP is to provide communities with tools for alternative farming systems that do not involve the use of fire, which is reinforced with educational and awareness initiatives. Villages that achieve a zero-burn target are eligible to receive rewards, including 100 million rupiah (S$9,660) for a needed piece of infrastructure.</p><p> It has reduced the area lost to fire by more than 90 per cent since it started in 2014. To date, the FFVP has engaged with 77 communities, April said.</p><p>  Mr Zulfahmi, managing director of EcoNusantara, an independent organisation that helps agroforestry firms implement zero-deforestation policies, said most of the burnt areas in 2015 and this year had occurred on damaged and dried peat lands, although the extent of burnt areas was larger in 2015 .</p><p> But there have been improvements in the preventive efforts of government, society and the private sectors, he said.</p><p> For instance, the government has issued new regulations and established a peat land restoration agency. The private sector has also undertaken various prevention programmes within and around their concessions.</p><p> Mr Zulfahmi said: \"They provide assistance to farmers to cultivate land without fires, provide firefighting equipment to the community and assist in the operations of fire procurement teams in the villages.\"</p><p> Villages are also starting to build firefighting teams, with some developing rules for the prevention and control of fires, he said.</p><p> But \"the positive efforts made are still small in scale compared to the extent of the burnt areas\", he added.</p><p> WRI Indonesia's Dr Arief said the complexity of the perennial fire problem in Indonesia boils down to unclear land tenure.</p><p> This lack of clarity in who owns the land or has the right to manage it manifests in other ways, such as conflict between communities and companies, said Dr Arief.</p><p> \"While law enforcement can be a short-term solution to solve some of these land governance issues, the long-term solution is really to solve land tenure issues, overlapping licences and land allocations to the state and people,\" he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A tourist wearing a mask at the Merlion park on Sept 18.

Forests are cleared to make way for oil palm plantations. To save on clearing costs, farmers resort to burning.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">While frameworks to stop haze are being established at the regional level as well as in countries like Indonesia and Malaysia, the challenge remains to get on board the actors who currently benefit from drained peatlands - the farmers, companies and investors profiting from oil palm. </p><p>Could a long-term solution to preventing forest fires in the region lie in promoting alternative commodities that can grow in wet peatlands?</p><p>The sine qua non, or the condition without which fires cannot start and spread, is the presence of dry peatlands. </p><p>Peatlands are naturally wet swamps of decomposed matter. They are nutrient-rich, but extremely flammable when dry. Yet, farmers are driven to drain these swamps, because oil palm can grow only in dry soil.</p><p>The initiative of restoring peatlands to their naturally wet state has been emphasised by Indonesia. </p><p>However, unless the practice of draining peatlands is addressed, haze will continue to be a challenge.</p><p>At root is the choice of oil palm as the dominant crop for growing. This happens for two key reasons. </p><p>First, oil palm is highly profitable and offers higher wages than other crops. The World Agroforestry Centre reports that oil palm in Indonesia yields profits of up to 44 million to 295 million rupiah (S$4,600 to S$30,000) per hectare per annum, and oil palm wages are two to seven times greater than average agricultural wages in the country.</p><p>The other reason is the short lead time in growing oil palm, taking three to four years before bearing fruit (with some gestation time before harvesting). This short lead time reduces the risks to investors who wish to invest in oil palm, in comparison to plants such as sago, which can take 10 to 15 years before harvest.</p><p>To prevent farmers and private companies from draining peatlands, it must be economically sustainable to keep them wet. </p><p>Alternative commodities need to be leveraged that can be grown in peatlands while meeting three key conditions. </p><p>First, they must grow in natural wet peat conditions.</p><p>Second, they must compete with oil palm in profitability, to translate into equivalent or higher wages to farmers, and into returns to investors. </p><p>Third, they must be able to reduce investor risk by having shorter lead times before harvest.</p><p>The Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO) of the United Nations has already identified commodities that can grow in naturally wet peat conditions. </p><p>These include sago, papyrus, wild rice, wetland taro, water celery, water spinach and Chinese water chestnut. Apart from these, there are plants that can grow in moderately drained peatlands, such as rice, bananas, beans, carrots, celery, corn, lettuce, mint, onions, potatoes, parsley, radish, pasture-sod, sugar cane chili, soya bean, tobacco and a few horticultural crops.</p><p>The challenge, however, is that there is limited information on which of these commodities meet the second and third conditions - of comparable profitability and time taken before investors start getting net positive returns on their investments. Among the limited studies available, one shows that if sago was chosen as an alternative crop to explore, it takes sago 10 to 15 years before it can start bearing fruit, and that the internal rate of return is up to 8.06 per cent - still low compared with 20 per cent of oil palm.</p><p>Alternatively, some crops, such as radish or celery, can be grown in less than a year, but it is not known if there will be sufficient demand for these. Additional preparations may be needed, such as reducing the acidity of the soil, preventing pests and diseases, or increasing the value-add of producers through additional processing.</p><p>There is need for more research and institutional support in improving the desirability of producing alternative commodities, in both the demand and supply side. These need to be considered in developing and implementing long-term rehabilitation plans.</p><p>Demand-side interventions include research on identifying which among the identified alternative commodities are in demand, who the buyers are, what qualities and traits they desire, and what prices they are sold at. </p><p>Buyers may include domestic buyers within Indonesia and Malaysia, as well as importers from higher-income countries abroad. In Japan, for instance, youth are leaving the agricultural sector, creating opportunities for countries such as Indonesia to provide selected crops.</p><p>Supply-side interventions require identifying technologies that can allow for meeting buyer requirements, while at the same time being cost effective to producers. Research into how to boost yields in producing the commodities, such as through resistance to submergence/flooding, pests and diseases will be needed.</p><p>For instance, if heavy research led to growth in the productivity of cassava production, from just six tonnes/ha to up to 30 tonnes/ha, can this not be done in the case of the crops identified by FAO? </p><p>Along with boosting yields, it will also be important to hasten the time before crops can be harvested.</p><p>Research at the National Institute of Education, Singapore, for instance, shows that certain planting systems and growing environments can shorten grow-out periods. </p><p>Agricultural transformation will have an important part to play in addressing haze, but this requires farmers, businesses, investors, academia and governments to play their part.</p><p>ABOUT THE AUTHOR:</p><p>Jose Montesclaros is Associate Research Fellow at the Centre for Non-Traditional Security Studies at the S.

Indonesian President <person><nameText>Joko Widodo </nameText></person>on Thursday issued a moratorium on new permits for oil palm plantations, and had vowed in January to sack local military and police chiefs for uncontrolled fires in their provinces, for example.</p><p>\"I cannot emphasise how seriously now Indonesia is preparing actions, programmes, and changing policies to prevent fires from happening,\" he said at the event held at the Ritz-Carlton, Millennia Singapore.</p><p>The scale of the disaster last year, which affected tens of millions of people and cost Indonesia up to 475 trillion rupiah and Singapore about S$700 million, shocked the Indonesian government and sparked determination to not allow history to repeat, he added.</p><p>The haze episode in Singapore was protracted last year, lasting from September to November. The Pollutant Standards Index levels breached 2,000 in Central Kalimantan and Indonesians fled their homes for other cities, while in Singapore, the PSI crept to hazardous levels (above 300), causing schools to close on Sept 25. </p><p>The Peatland Restoration Agency was formed in January, with Mr Widodo setting the target to restore two  million hectares of peatland in seven provinces. The agency has mapped out 2.26 million hectares of dry or canalised peatland that has been burnt frequently in recent years. Of this area, 360,000 hectares are on conservation land. The remainder are in cultivation areas - three-quarters are concession areas awarded to companies and one-quarter is community land.</p><p>Of 2.6 million hectares that was burnt last year in Indonesia, nearly one million was peatland. Mr Nazir's agency aims to re-wet the peatland - carbon-rich wetlands that burn easily when drained - and provide alternative livelihoods to communities by identifying crops such as sago palm that grow well in wet conditions.</p><p>Peatland restoration in Riau province's Meranti Islands was launched a few days ago, and Mr Nazir said peatland maps of four districts will be available in about three months.</p><p>His \"dream\" is to make the information publicly available. Asked about legal concerns previously cited that have prevented Indonesia from publicly disclosing the concession maps of companies, Mr Nazir said it is something government institutions need to discuss internally. </p><p>\"What I see (is), there is no national secret in providing the information of the concessions (to the public),\" he said. Instead, companies and land managers would know they are being watched and be motivated to do right.</p><p>When companies, communities and smallholders \"do good, the government has to think how to give incentives to do better, and let the public also see what is happening on the ground. That can only happen if we expose the maps\", he told reporters.</p><p>His agency has its work cut out, working with 12 ministers and seven governors, and ensuring quality dams are built to raise the water table, among other tasks. </p><p>But Mr Nazir reckoned the toughest challenge will be getting companies that have not adopted sustainability measures on board. \"There might be corporations that might think, (it's) not my problem, it's the community that burns the land.\"</p><p>After mapping out the 1.9 million hectares of peatland in cultivation areas at a suitable scale, his agency will engage companies on restoration plans. Pulp companies commonly grow acacia on rather dry land, but Mr Nazir said switching to species that grow well on wet peatland would be ideal. </p><p>Singapore can play a role in the financing of alternative crop cultivation and serve as a market for products, he said.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">TODAYN-1604FPG001APM</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">TODAYN2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5C09-H7M1-DXPH-P0M4-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">408232</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-07-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"790\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 MediaCorp Press Ltd All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>TODAY (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"7288\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><edition>APM Edition</edition><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"04\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>April 16, 2016 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Foreign Affairs</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"80\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

These findings were published in the May 22 edition of the prestigious journal Science.</p><p>Agreeing with the study, Professor Richard Corlett, from the Department of Biological Science at NUS, said: 'What used to be a landscape consisting of patches of forest, irrigated rice and a variety of other crops is now just uniformly rubber.'</p><p>In the report, Prof Ziegler noted that the unrestricted expansion of rubber in mountainous regions in mainland Southeast Asia could have devastating environmental effects.</p><p>With fewer trees, there are far fewer plants to absorb excess carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, accelerating the effects of global warming. Deforestation also causes erosion and landslides, while growing only rubber destabilises regional water systems as the plants tend to suck up excess water.</p><p>There is also a threat to biodiversity.</p><p>Said Dr Koh Lian Pin, a research fellow at ETH Zurich - the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology: 'If this trend continues, it could mean the decline of numerous species of native plants and animals, many of which are already on the brink of extinction.'</p><p>Roughly a quarter of the world's species of animals and plants lives in this region.</p><p>Experts attributed the trend to rising crude oil prices and a burgeoning demand for rubber products, particularly in China.</p><p>Crude oil, which is used to make synthetic rubber, hit a peak of nearly US $150 last year, causing the demand for natural rubber to go up, Dr Koh explained.</p><p>Prof Corlett added: 'Rubber seems to be the most valuable crop in the region.'</p><p>In the report, Prof Ziegler called for more areas to be designated as forest reserves.</p><p>'A substantial increase in natural reserve areas could help to reduce the threats to biodiversity and carbon stocks,' he wrote.</p><p>He also called for the adoption of 'diversified agroforestry systems', where cash crops such as rubber and oil palm play important roles, but are not planted as monocultures.</p><p>Instead, they will co-exist alongside native species of plants, reducing the threat to ecosystems.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:amreshg@sph.com.sg\">amreshg@sph.com.sg</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-09061147</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2009</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:7VWX-60G0-Y9SB-T3VD-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"439\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2009 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"11\" month=\"06\" year=\"2009\"><dateText>June 11, 2009 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009JY5</classCode><className>COLLEGE &amp;

They come with some capital, big enough to rent bulldozers or chainsaws, and wreak havoc. If there are many of them like that, then they can cause large-scale impact.\"</p><p> One of the four authors of the WAC report and the centre's chief science adviser, Dr Meine van Noordwijk, said: \"We are convinced that (these operators) are a non-negligible part of the overall story.\"</p><p> The study comes as Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia gather for a three-day Asean haze meeting in Kuala Lumpur beginning today. The meeting, which will also include Brunei and Thailand, will be the 15th time the Sub-Regional Ministerial Steering Committee on Transboundary Haze Pollution is coming together.</p><p> The group was formed in 2006 to help Indonesia combat the annual haze, which has dogged the region for years. Topping the agenda is an urgent push for Indonesia to provide official and accurate land concession maps.</p><p> About half the hot spots in Riau province during last month's large-scale burning, which caused the worst haze in Singapore in 16 years, was on land with active permits for land concessions, such as for oil palm and timber. But the remaining were outside such permitted areas.</p><p> Some of these are suspected to be caused by independent planters, say activists. The size of their plantations could be between 50ha and 1,000ha.</p><p> Of the 24 farmers caught illegally clearing land by burning earlier this month, up to 15 were working for these types of plantations, said Mr Riko Kurniawan, chief of the Riau chapter of the Indonesian Forum for the Environment (Walhi). \"Our studies found that most of these (owners) are businessmen from North Sumatra, such as from Medan, and some are former generals or politicians, but we are deepening investigations before releasing names,\" he said.</p><p> The hot spots that occurred outside areas permitted for plantations during the haze last month were found to be in conservation areas such as the Tesso Nilo forest complex, which includes a national park and concession areas.</p><p> At least some 21,457ha out of the total 83,068ha of the complex had been encroached on by non-park activities - 15,714ha of it had been cleared illegally for oil palm plantations, the study noted.</p><p> Other non-governmental organisations such as the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF) have also pointed to these violations. WWF urged oil palm companies to take responsibility for the full supply chain and ensure that fruit or processed oil bought from third-party providers are not fuelling the haze.</p><p> Still, forest campaigners said policies need to be adjusted to deal with new actors who acquire land for oil palm expansion under local institutional frameworks that are outside government planning and control.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:zubaidah@sph.com.sg\">zubaidah@sph.com.sg</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-1306148</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2013</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:58WN-V9H1-JCF2-8122-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-02-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"663\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2013 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"07\" year=\"2013\"><dateText>July 15, 2013 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>STX001964</classCode><className>SCIENCE &amp;

In Singapore, people planted trees as part of the Million Trees Project. Changes in our everyday activities, including reducing pesticide use in our gardens or committing to eat more locally sourced foods, can make a big difference.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Although agriculture is often blamed for water scarcity and rising greenhouse gas emissions, farming is also emerging as a solution to global problems. Sustainable farming practices can help mitigate climate change, improve soil fertility and preserve biodiversity.</p><p>Through our research for Worldwatch Institute's Nourishing The Planet project (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.NourishingthePlanet.org\">www.NourishingthePlanet.org</url>), we travelled to 25 countries across sub-Saharan Africa, highlighting innovations that offer effective models that can be scaled up and replicated beyond Africa.</p><p>We offer three recommendations that showcase agriculture's untapped potential to address some of our most urgent environmental challenges.</p><p>Reducing food waste</p><p>In 2008, Singaporeans threw away 0.6 million tons of food waste, only 12 per cent of which was recycled. Large quantities of food rotting in landfills emit methane, a greenhouse gas that is more potent than carbon dioxide.</p><p>In Singapore, local organisations help redistribute waste to keep it out of landfills. Waste Is Not Waste connects businesses getting rid of unwanted items with organisations that can use those materials. Food For All has a food rations matching service to connect food suppliers and community food programmes. Food From The Heart distributes unsold bread from hotels and bakeries to hungry people and welfare organisations, serving over 11,000 people a month.</p><p>In developing countries, 15 per cent to 20 per cent of food is lost each year, decreasing farmers' incomes and increasing malnutrition. But regionally appropriate storage and preservation techniques are helping farmers protect their harvests. In West Africa, farmers have saved around 100,000 fruits by using solar dryers to dry mangoes, papaya and other fruit.</p><p>Increasing local food biodiversity</p><p>The shift from local and indigenous foods to monoculture crops, including maize, wheat, soya beans and rice reduces biodiversity, threatens local economies and undermines the community's cultural identity.</p><p>For countries that import most of their food, like Singapore, a lack of food production for local consumption can mean vulnerability to foreign markets and speculation. But in many places, local and diverse food is gaining ground and beginning to thrive. In Senegal, for example, women farmers are switching back to traditional varieties of fruit, including karkade, pain de singe, tamarindo and ditakh that they process into value-added products, such as juices and jam.</p><p>Using agriculture to cope with climate change and build resilience</p><p>As climate change takes hold, erratic temperatures, shifting growing seasons, and frequent drought will reduce soil fertility and crop yields.</p><p>Singapore will likely be impacted by climate change in many ways, including land loss, flooding, increased temperatures and reduced water resources.</p><p>But agroforestry and intercropping can help mitigate climate change, while also boosting soil quality and improving water management. By planting trees among crops, stewarding nearby forests, and keeping soils planted with crops for more of the year, African farmers can sequester 50 billion tons of carbon dioxide over the next 50 years. This is equivalent to eliminating an entire year of the world's greenhouse gas emissions - a generous contribution from a region that emits only a small share of these gases.</p><p>Urban populations are expanding at an unprecedented rate. The United Nations estimates that more than 65 per cent of the global population will live in cities by 2050. In Vancouver, New York and Nairobi, communities are turning to urban agriculture as a solution that is not only helping to boost food self-sufficiency, but also helping to raise incomes, empower women and improve urban environments.</p><p>Although it is known as the Garden City, Singapore devotes less than 3 per cent of its land to agriculture, and its farmers grow less than 10 per cent of the country's food. But there is a lot of space for food - rooftop space, for example, is about 1,000ha. Taking into account balcony spaces and some ground areas between apartments, Professor Lee Sing Kong from Nanyang Technological University estimates that Singapore could become self-sufficient in vegetable production by expanding urban farming.</p><p>Innovative methods make urban farming easier. Singapore's Agri-Food and Veterinary Authority has created a high-rise farm system for spare warehouse space or any tight areas, where vegetables in soil-filled trays can be stacked up to 10 shelves high, and can be grown indoors with LED lighting. The National Parks Board's Community In Bloom programme encourages residents to start community gardening by providing land.</p><p>By focusing on agriculture to not only alleviate hunger and malnutrition, but also to achieve our environmental goals, we can make every day Earth Day.</p><p>The writers are from the Washington-based environmental group Worldwatch Institute, where the former is co-director of the Nourishing The Planet project and the latter is a research intern.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-110425134</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:52PH-FPT1-DYX3-Y4R9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"893\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"04\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>April 25, 2011 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><className>WORLDWATCH INSTITUTE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000A093</classCode><className>EARTH DAY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

Since then, the world has seen countless acts of violence, terrorism, famine, environmental degradation and natural disaster (earthquakes and tsunami). In 2005, we can begin to change direction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Knowledge, scientific advance, travel, and global communications give us many opportunities to find solutions for the world's great problems.</p><p>When a new disease called Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome hit China in 2003, the World Health Organisation coordinated the actions of dozens of governments, and the crisis was quickly brought under control, at least for now.</p><p>When Bill Gates donated US$1 billion to bring vaccines to poor children, he made it possible to protect millions of young people from preventable diseases. When an agricultural research unit called the World Agroforestry Centre discovered that a certain tree could help African farmers grow more food, they introduced a new and valuable approach to overcoming Africa's chronic food crisis.</p><p>Unfortunately, such examples of international cooperation are as rare as they are impressive. With our knowledge, science, and technology, the horrendous living conditions of the world's poorest people could be dramatically improved. Millions of people could be spared malaria, HIV/AIDS, hunger, and life in slums. The problem is not that we lack good solutions. The problem is that we fail to cooperate globally to put those solutions into practice.</p><p>United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has honoured me by making me his Special Adviser on the Millennium Development Goals and asking me to lead a group of scholars and development experts in identifying practical steps to reach the goals by the target date in 2015. This effort, known as the UN Millennium Project, will issue its report to Annan on Jan 17, 2005. Our study, \"Investing in Development: A Practical Plan to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals\", will be available for free around the world at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.unmillenniumproject.org\">www.unmillenniumproject.org</url>. </p><p>What we learnt is easily summarised. For every major problem - hunger, illiteracy, malnutrition, malaria, AIDS, drought, and so forth - there are practical solutions that are proven and affordable. These investments, in turn, would strengthen the private sector and economic growth. Yet, they require global partnership between the rich and poor countries of the world. Most importantly, the world's richest countries need to do much more to help the poorest countries make use of modern science and technology to solve these great problems.</p><p>The US, for example, currently spends around US$450 billion each year on its military, but less than US$15 billion to help the world's poorest countries fight disease, educate their children, and protect the environment. This is a mistake, because military approaches alone cannot make America safe. Only shared prosperity can truly make the planet secure. The US should be investing much more in peaceful economic development.</p><p>Germany, Japan, and several other rich countries are also doing much less than they should - and much less than they promised the poor countries that they would do. In 2002, all donor countries committed to \"make concrete efforts\" to reach 0.7% of national income in development aid to poor countries. Germany, Japan, and the US, among others, remain far below this commitment.</p><p>This year will offer many opportunities for citizens around the world to insist that their leaders keep their millennium promises. After our report is issued, Annan will issue a report to the world in the spring, identifying the practical steps that should be taken this year. Around the same time, an important commission on Africa will issue a report to United Kingdom Prime Minister Tony Blair. Then, in July, the UK will host the annual G-8 summit of the rich countries.</p><p>Blair has promised that he will make the fight against poverty and long-term climate change the two priorities of the summit. In September, the world's leaders will reconvene at the UN to decide on their actions during the coming decade.</p><p>The rich and powerful nations often declare their leadership in the world. The US claims that it helps the world fight poverty, but instead spends its money on weapons. Germany and Japan say that they want a permanent seat on the UN Security Council, but neither has yet followed through on its own pledges to help the world's poorest people. The world's poorest countries will ask themselves why they should vote for Germany and Japan to have permanent seats on the Security Council if they can't keep their promises.</p><p>Nothing would be wiser for the world's rich countries than to fulfil their pledges to the world's poor, hungry and disease-ridden peoples.</p><p>Therein lies the path to sustained peace. 2005 is the year in which words can become reality, and the world can begin to fulfil its hopes for our new millennium. Let us make our leaders aware that we aspire to shared peace and prosperity. Let us pledge that the rich and powerful should take real actions to help the poor, the weak, and the suffering. - Project Syndicate</p><p>Jeffrey D Sachs is professor of economics and director of the Earth Institute at Columbia University</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">EDGESI2005</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:4FPB-3680-01KV-1454-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">261523</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"882\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>The Edge Singapore</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 2005 The Edge Publishing PTE LTD.

It can replace many functions of wood and has more than 5,000 uses. It has a tensile strength that rivals steel and, when used as a building material, survives earthquakes better than traditional brick and cement houses.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So what is this miracle material that can be harvested in four years compared to a 20-year wait for most softwoods? Nothing earthshaking really, just your humble bamboo -also known as the \"poor man's timber\".</p><p>More familiar to us as good old-fashioned scaffolding, the usefulness and versatility of bamboo is not as widely understood as it should be.  But in the face of deforestation and worries over the shortage of timber resources, bamboo is emerging as a viable alternative. It was with this in mind that Linda Garland, a world renowned interior designer and environmentalist, started the Environmental Bamboo Foundation (EBF) in 1993.</p><p>Ms Garland's love affair with bamboo started more than 20 years ago, when she left London to visit Bali. Impressed by the many uses of the plant in Balinese religious ceremonies, houses, furniture and utensils, she began designing bamboo furniture.</p><p>She started a factory in Bali -the first to use local species of giant bamboo. To prevent starch-loving powder post beetles from destroying bamboo, she tried to treat the plants with an environmentally friendly product. Unfortunately, the treatment did not work and her shipments of furniture to customers abroad ended up in dust.</p><p>After abandoning bamboo for several years, she turned her attention back to the plant, hoping that it would be a substitute for tropical hardwoods used in housing, furniture and wood-pulp industries.</p><p>In her research on bamboo, she found that hundreds of scientists, architects, engineers and environmentalists were also using the plant to save rainforests, reclaim land destroyed by agriculture and mining, and replace tropical woods in parquet flooring and iron rods in reinforced concrete.</p><p>It was at this time that Ms Garland discovered an environmentally friendly treatment against powder post beetles and took US$ 200,000 from her own pocket to start the non-profit EBF. The foundation is involved in research and data collection, conservation and agroforestry, education and training, design and marketing, as well as networking and building global awareness of the advantages of bamboo. Estimates of worldwide revenue generated from bamboo and its by-products range between US$ 4.5 billion and US$ 7 billion.</p><p>But bamboo, fast becoming a favoured choice for paper manufacturers in a world where paper demand is growing at 5 per cent a year, is also suffering for its popularity. About 20 million tonnes of bamboo are harvested annually worldwide. Overexploitation has wiped out many bamboo forests in India, Bangladesh and Indonesia. While bamboo is a quick, renewable crop, it is important to ensure that collections of bamboo specimens are maintained and those lost are replenished.</p><p>With the environmental, social and economic aspects of bamboo in mind, the Fourth International Bamboo Congress will be held from June 19 to 22 in Bali. This year's event is organised by the International Network of Bamboo and Rattan, the International Bamboo Association (representing bamboo societies in 35 countries) and the EBF. Supported by various ministries in the Indonesian government, the congress will cover the latest news in bamboo activities around the world, conduct research workshops on state-of-the-art bamboo technologies and a trade show for bamboo products around the world.</p><p>A music festival will feature international bamboo musicians, and a competition will be held to pick the most innovative architectural constructions.</p><p>\"The primary aim of this event is to link together people who can, through their interest and use of bamboo, save endangered hardwoods and better the environment in many places all over the world,\" says Ms Garland. \"Since we have the product and the technology, we must now combine our assets and make it work.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A plant with many uses: history in China was written on bamboo slips</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">BUSTMS1995</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:3S89-07T0-0002-M3P9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11432</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2016-01-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"947\"/><publicationInfo><publicationName>Business Times (Singapore)</publicationName><copyright>Copyright 1995 Times Business Publications</copyright><publicationDate month=\"06\" day=\"17\" year=\"1995\"><dateText>June 17, 1995, Weekend Edition</dateText></publicationDate></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

It's one of the things that needs somewhat more details,' she told reporters.</p><p>And even while policymakers were dragging their feet on the scheme, other countries such as Bolivia and various indigenous groups have condemned it as a 'privatisation of natural resources', further polarising the international community.</p><p>Environmental non-governmental organisation (NGO) Friends of the Earth had issued a report prior to Cancun that stated: 'There are significant risks that REDD will lead to the privatisation of the world's forests, transferring them out of the hands of indigenous peoples and local communities and into the hands of bankers and carbon traders.'</p><p>This, however, has not prevented a global 'REDD rush' where biodiversity conservationists, governments and private sector firms alike have raced to ink deals to conserve swathes of forests in exchange for carbon credits that can potentially be cashed out in the world's carbon markets.</p><p>Indonesia and Norway, for example, have signed a US $1 billion (S $1.3 billion) deal to protect Indonesia's forests, which will see a two-year forest-clearing moratorium.</p><p>It is this rush, combined with the hazy outlook of REDD+, that has led a trio of academics to warn biodiversity conservationists that the REDD+ scheme may be short-lived, and it may be too risky to put all the eggs in this one basket.</p><p>The paper, published last month in Conservation Letters, a journal for the Society for Conservation Biology, was written by assistant professor Edward Webb and PhD student Jacob Phelps of the National University of Singapore's department of biological sciences, and research fellow Koh Lian Pin at Swiss institute ETH Zurich.</p><p>In an interview with The Sunday Times, Mr Webb said that REDD has been somewhat overhyped as a secure financing source for biodiversity conservation.</p><p>While potentially a radical scheme that could halt massive deforestation, it also has unintended consequences, such as forest governance being re-centralised in the hands of national governments.</p><p>As it is now, decentralisation to the local authorities and native peoples has helped boost carbon storage through local management of the forests, said Mr Webb. There is also the sensitive issue of wider socio-economic opportunity costs of withholding development, he added.</p><p>'The working mechanisms of REDD are still a long way off from implementation... we don't want to see conservation projects over-leveraging on REDD-related finance only to be left high and dry a few years later,' he said.</p><p>The paper further highlights some risks: REDD+ is still not legally adopted by the UN and the absence of any global legally binding cuts to greenhouse gases also adds to the uncertainty about the longevity of the scheme.</p><p>At the same time, although private investments have been inked - such as the Ulu Massen initiative in Banda Aceh, Indonesia (government-led and partly-funded by Merrill Lynch) - such projects remain small.</p><p>Investors are wary of uncertain climate policies, volatile carbon prices and speculative interest in REDD+ projects.</p><p>The private sector's conservatism contrasts with the conservation sector's high expectations for REDD, the paper said.</p><p>There is also the risk of 'mismatched time horizons' where REDD+ projects, which typically have a 20-year horizon, will be a short-lived lifeline for cash-strapped conservation projects, which usually last beyond two decades.</p><p>Furthermore, the paper highlights that REDD+ is often proposed as a 'bridge strategy' to buy time for industrialised countries to develop low-carbon technologies and renewable energy sources.</p><p>The authors point out that once this is achieved, forest carbon markets could become obsolete, potentially within a couple of decades. REDD+ projects like Indonesia's Ulu Massen Reserve could lose their core funding, as could species such as the Sumatran tiger and the Sumatran orang utan, it said.</p><p>Then, there are the technical details. How will land owners prove the conservation of certain forest areas are additional to what would have been conserved anyway, how do we measure the carbon content of varying sites and how will this all feed into one regulated market?</p><p>During the interview, Mr Webb makes one radical suggestion: set up an Opec (Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries) for forests.</p><p>'There needs to be an organisation like that, that controls the supply of forest carbon credits, much the same way Opec controls the world's oil supply to match demand and supply,' he said.</p><p>Until there is a solid mechanism set up for REDD+ that everyone buys into, conservation efforts cannot count on it.</p><p>Meanwhile, such projects as harvesting non-timber forest products and agroforestry for money will do best to diversify their sources of funding, he said.</p><p>At the international level, reliable funding could also be ensured with minimum contributions from top carbon-emitting countries. Already, the UN-backed scheme has attracted about US $4 billion in pledges from rich nations, including Norway and the United States.</p><p>At the national level, countries could manage REDD+ funding through conservation trust funds, to increase financial stability and provide a form of precautionary savings, the report suggested.</p><p>'Don't get me wrong,' Mr Webb added. Whatever money REDD+ gets for forest conservation is very valuable, and the potential of this scheme is massive, he acknowledged.</p><p>When finally implemented, it could unlock billions of dollars that will truly value forests and nature for what they are worth.</p><p>But as to how we get there and when?</p><p>'That's the billion-dollar question,' he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:jcheam@sph.com.sg\">jcheam@sph.com.sg</email></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.facebook.com/cheamjessica\">www.facebook.com/cheamjessica</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">STRAIT-11012372</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">STRAIT2011</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:520X-4SF1-DYX3-Y4YC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">144965</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2015-09-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1237\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2011 Singapore Press Holdings Limited All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Straits Times (Singapore)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"01\" year=\"2011\"><dateText>January 23, 2011 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0009GET</classCode><className>DEFORESTATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DS5C</classCode><className>FORESTS &amp;

It is my pleasure to be here at the 3rd Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">2. Since its inaugural session in 2014, the Singapore Dialogue on Sustainable World Resources has grown in stature and scale, and played a significant role in bringing together relevant stakeholders to address key environmental and sustainability issues in our region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">3. I am happy to see that many of the participants and speakers are from around the region. All of us want to see our region thrive and do well, and no less Singapore, because a prosperous region benefits us all. One key contributor to economic wellbeing in South-east Asia is a viable and sustainable agro-forestry sector, and there are good prospects for this sector. However, to achieve true prosperity for the people in this region, we all have begun to realise that the agro-forestry sector needs to pursue its economic ambitions in an environmentally sustainable way.</p><p>4. Palm oil cultivation, for example, has enabled many local people to improve their lives. It plays a vital role in the global economy, and is used widely in our everyday products that many of us may not even realise.Surpassing other oil crops in terms of yield, it requires less land to produce the same amount of oil, and is a very efficient crop. However, unsustainable land clearing practices, such as the burning of forests and peatlands, risk giving the entire industry a bad reputation, and palm oil consequentially can also be affected. This can threaten the long-term viability of the sector, as consumers and investors increasingly feel compelled to distance themselves from the sector and its products.</p><p>5. To do well for the long term, agro-forestry companies need to pursue sustainable growth - growth that takes into account environmental and other important concerns. Let me highlight some practical measures that all agro-forestry companies should implement now, as part of their commitment to sustainable growth.</p><p>6. First, agro-forestry companies should take full responsibility for fire prevention and mitigation in their concessions. There must not be a repeat of last year's fires, because the prolonged season of dryness allowed fires to burn uncontrollably and in a very widespread way. Second, companies should invest in efforts to rehabilitate degraded and fire-prone peatlands. We laud the appointment of Pak Nazir Foead by the government of Indonesia to look at the rehabilitation of peatlands in Indonesia. We cannot afford to have massive releases of carbon that negate global efforts to combat climate change as what happened last year. Third, companies must ensure that sustainable policies and practices don't stop with them, but are implemented throughout their supply chain. Just last week, Unilever, Mars and Kellogg cancelled their contracts with a major palm oil producer following a suspension of the company's certification by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) over deforestation practices. The government lauds the efforts of these companies in taking proactive steps to incorporate environmental sustainability into their entire supply chains and operations.</p><p>7. What measures can we take to prevent the recurrence of last year's fires? I have highlighted in my Committee of Supply speech on Tuesday that it requires a multi-faceted approach from all stakeholders. Let me reiterate the key points of my speech.</p><p>8. First, we have to actively promote regional cooperation because haze is a multilateral issue. Second, we will continue to support Indonesia's efforts to tackle the haze. And therefore, Pak Jokowi's announcement yesterday to have a moratorium on new concessions for palm oil plantations and land for mining, is certainly laudable. Third, as consumers, each one of us can influence the agro-forestry industry through our purchasing decisions.</p><p>9. Fourth, I would like to emphasise that the government is sparing no efforts to address the commercial roots of transboundary haze by pursuing errant companies under the Transboundary Haze Pollution Act (THPA). NEA recently served Notices under Sections 10 and 11 of the THPA on a foreign Director when he was in Singapore. These Notices require him to provide information relevant to the haze and attend an interview in relation to the ongoing investigations. In accordance with the law, we will take every necessary step to enforce the THPA, bearing in mind that outside of Singapore, there are limited possibilities. We will of course, hold any Singapore-linked persons or entities to account. At the same time, even if the errant company's officers are foreigners, they will have to comply with the laws of the country, including the notices under the THPA, should they come to Singapore.</p><p>10. The THPA has also given us the tools to be effective in getting companies to take notice and take actions. I note that some prominent agro-forestry companies have frantically taken out advertisements and gone on talk shows to show that they are doing something. This goes to show that companies like these have sat up and taken notice of our actions through the THPA. My message to all these companies is simply this - companies practising unsustainable production that affect us with haze must know that their actions will not lead to profitability and that they will have to face the consequences sooner or later.</p><p>11. Let me now touch on how civil society can play its role in promoting a sustainable agro-forestry sector.</p><p>12. First and foremost, civil society is a key enabler to foster an informed consumer movement and strengthen support for sustainably-sourced products. Second, civil society plays a critical role in enhancing the transparency and accountability of companies and their supply chains, thereby enabling consumers and investors to give greater support to sustainable businesses.</p><p>13. As consumers, we have choices, and we should make our choices count.When the haze hit Singapore last year, there was a noticeable ground-up movement, the likes of which we had not seen before. This effort was led by civic organisations and responsible businesses. As mentioned by its Chairman Isabella Loh, the Singapore Environment Council (SEC) instituted a temporary restriction on the use of the Green Label by Asia Pulp and Paper (APP) in October last year, and together with the Consumers Association of Singapore (CASE), jointly led a movement to advocate against unsustainable practices. Consequently, large supermarket chains such as NTUC FairPrice, Sheng Siong and Prime Supermarket responded by removing all APP products from their shelves, while the Dairy Farm Group stopped the purchase of all APP products. Organisations such as the World Wildlife Fund (WWF)-Singapore, People's Movement to Stop Haze (PM.Haze) and the Singapore Institute of International Affairs also jointly organised the \"We Breathe What We Buy\" campaign to increase public awareness on the sustainability of agroforestry products.These actions demonstrate the significant power of a collective consumer voice, and an increasingly active and empowered consumer movement, led by civil society.</p><p>14. Recently, a report by an Indonesian activist group \"Eyes on the Forest\" highlighted that while companies have made commitments to stop deforestation, their supply chains remain tainted with palm oil grown on protected lands with fragile ecosystems, that are home to the endangered Sumatran tigers, elephants and Orang Utans. This demonstrates the crucial role that civil society plays in bringing malpractices to light, and enhancing the transparency of supply chains and accountability of companies in the palm oil and forestry sectors.</p><p>15. One such area relates to the transparency of information on concessions and hotspots. Where progress on ASEAN efforts such as the Regional Haze Monitoring System has been slow, NGOs have been quick to find a solution to this.</p><p>16. The Global Forest Watch, spearheaded by the World Resources Institute has helped to improve the transparency of forest management and commodity production through its tie-up with the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) on maps of certified sustainable palm oil production sites. More recently, GreenpeaceIndonesia launched a public GIS portal - \"Peta Kepo Hutan\" which overlays concession information from various official sources, allowing tracking of fires on different concession types, from palm oil, to logging, wood fibre and mining concessions. A useful feature is that \"Peta Kepo Hutan\" now allows the identification of companies that own such concessions.</p><p>17. Another area relates to eco-certification, which enables consumers to readily identify sustainably-sourced products. Last year, the RSPO announced RSPO Next, a voluntary addendum to its existing principles and criteria for certification. It is an initiative to encourage RSPO member companies that have met the current requirements of the RSPO, to exceed these requirements. This is a good initiative and I hope companies will respond positively.</p><p>18. Nevertheless, I would not want to paint an overly optimistic picture. Currently, only 21% of global palm oil is currently certified by RSPO, and there is a lot more work required to increase demand for sustainable palm oil, as well as for the certification of supply chains.Hence, I am glad that the SEC has recently launched a new category under the Singapore Green Label Scheme for products containing palm oil that builds on the RSPO certification.</p><p>19. I am also happy to note the significant progress made in the area of pulp and paper products.In October last year, SEC and CASE stepped up their engagement efforts by getting leading supermarkets, pharmacies, furniture retailers with paper products certified under the Singapore Green Labelling Scheme (SGLS) administered by the SEC to declare that they had not procured or used wood, paper or pulp materials from unsustainable sources.As part of its continuous efforts to help the public identify environmentally-friendly products and enhance eco-consumerism, SEC has just announced that it is now taking it further and working on a new category for products with pulp and paper which will include in its criteria the requirement for peatland management and fire prevention standards. When fully developed, I believe this standard will be the most holistic certification standard for pulp and paper in the world. It will be a tool that empowers consumers to make a very safe non-haze pro-conservation choice for sustainable paper products. This will not only be very good for Singapore but can also set the standard for global consumers. I commend SEC for taking this bold initiative.</p><p>20. I also strongly encourage companies which have not participated in the SGLS to be part of the certification. And as consumers, we should now start buying and using products from companies that have pledged to be socially responsible. The Singapore Government will also do its part as a major consumer.From the third quarter of 2016, the Government will only procure printing paper products that carry the Singapore Green Label. We will also spearhead efforts in fighting climate change by procuring electrical products that have been certified as being highly energy efficient, starting with four of the most commonly procured electrical items, air-conditioners, lighting, televisions and refrigerators. Through our efforts, we hope to spur individuals and businesses to likewise make a deliberate choice to support environmental sustainability.</p><p>21. My final point is on the pivotal role that the financial sector plays in advancing and raising the bar on sustainable financing and investment practices.</p><p>22. There is growing recognition that adopting environmental, social and corporate governance (ESG) practices positively affect long-term, risk adjusted returns, and high ESG ratings, more often than not, correlates with a lower cost of capital. It is a sustainable way to run businesses, and a hedge against reputational and environmental risks.Banks and investment institutions will therefore be promoting their clients' interests by encouraging the wider adoption of ESG practices.</p><p>23. At the height of the haze episode last year, the Association of Banks in Singapore (ABS) issued its Guidelines on Responsible Financing. Specifically, banks in Singapore are required to disclose their commitment to responsible financing, publish their policy framework, and implement governance systems by 2017. The three local banks - DBS, OCBC and UOB - have issued commitments to responsible financing in their respective annual reports released recently. The ABS is also actively engaging the industry to raise awareness and build capacity on sustainable financing. Early this month, the ABS and WWF conducted capacity building workshops to prepare the industry for the implementation of the ABS' guidelines.</p><p>24. On the capital markets front, SGX will be introducing sustainability reporting on a \"comply or explain\" basis, and had in February this year concluded its public consultation on the proposed rules and guidelines.SGX expects the new rules and guide on sustainability reporting to apply to companies from the financial year ending on or after 31 December 2017, with reports published from 2018.</p><p>25. These are positive steps, and I encourage our financial sector to take even bolder measures to support sustainability, in line with international best practices.</p><p>26. Internationally, there are encouraging signs that major international investors are distancing themselves from unsustainable business practices. For example, Norway's Government Pension Fund Global (GPFG), the world's largest sovereign wealth fund, recently dropped 11 companies because of connections to deforestation.</p><p>27. There are also efforts underway by international bodies. The United Nations Environment Programme launched its final report on its Inquiry into the Design of a Sustainable Financial System last October. The report discussed how the full potential of the financial system can be harnessed, and policy options that could mobilize capital to sustainable development, and towards a green and inclusive economy. Second, the Financial Stability Board (FSB) has announced the launch of an industry led Task Force on climate-related financial risk disclosures, chaired by Michael Bloomberg. The Task Force will develop voluntary, consistent climate-related financial risk disclosures for use by companies. Singapore Exchange's Yeo Lian Sim is the Vice Chair of this task force, which held its second meeting last month in Singapore. The task force is currently working on developing specific recommendations in consultation with key stakeholders and will deliver to the FSB its report by December 2016.</p><p>28. With China holding the G20 Presidency this year, it has made green financing a core part of its agenda. China has set up the Green Finance Study Group (\"GFSG\"), which countries like Singapore and Switzerland are part of. Germany has also agreed to carry the theme of green finance on the G20 agenda through to their Presidency in 2017.</p><p>29. Banks and central banking authorities in the region have also progressed. In November 2015, Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK), the central bank of Indonesia, released its Sustainable Finance Roadmap, covering areas such as micro-finance, capital markets, SME lending, pension funds and insurance. The sustainable finance roadmap comes with time frames and deliverables driven by market-based incentives. OJK had also announced its collaboration with the WWF to launch an 18-month project to help Indonesian banks integrate ESG criteria in its credit approval framework. Just last month, Bank Mandiri, Indonesia's largest bank, announced that it will tighten credit loans to oil palm plantations, and new loans to finance development of new oil palm plantations in peat lands will be ceased.</p><p>30. These efforts are testament to the commitment of international, regional bodies and our domestic financial institutions in promoting the cause of sustainability. Our financial institutions can and should continue to exercise influence over forestry and palm oil companies, and promote the adoption of sustainable practices by factoring sustainability issues into their lending and investment activities.</p><p>31. To bring about a more sustainable agro-forestry sector, we will need all stakeholders - consumers, investors and lenders and businesses themselves to move ahead together.We cannot expect transformational changes overnight. Together, the different actors within the ecosystem must collectively step up efforts, even as we know that challenges abound. The government has taken a stand, and we hope to have you along with us on this journey towards sustainability. Let us all work together towards clear skies and clean air for all, now and into the future.</p><p>32. In closing, I would like to congratulate SIIA for organising this event. SIIA has also been active on the haze front, through its diplomacy and networking efforts, and the regular commentaries on haze that it publishes.</p><p>33. Thank you all, and I wish you a lively, constructive discussion ahead.</p><p>Source: Ministry of the Environment &amp; Water Resources, Government of Singapore</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGGONW-0017221057</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGGONW2016</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5JJ4-BWY1-JB5M-W50D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">365160</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2018-02-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2908\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Singapore Government News, distributed by Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Singapore Government News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"15\" month=\"04\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>April 15, 2016 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><classCode>CC0002HQ4</classCode><className>UNILEVER PLC/NV</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>FINANCIAL CONDUCT AUTHORITY</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS325620 TOILET PREPARATION MANUFACTURING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>NAICS325611 SOAP &amp;

Plants are planned for other islands as part of an $8US billion ($11S.5 billion) expansion. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So, officials were understandably silent over the programme in the lead-up to the UN climate change conference in Bali this month, but it does underline the problem of getting large developing countries to commit to a set reduction in carbon dioxide emissions if it risks hampering their economic growth.</p><p>Why coal? It is the quickest and probably the cheapest to bring into operation. The boost to the country's overall generating capacity will add at least 65 million tonnes to the 45 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent that Indonesia's coal-fired stations already pump into the atmosphere each year.</p><p>But while Jakarta is adding more smokestacks, it is also trying to undo some of the damage caused by former president Suharto's ill-fated scheme in the 1990s to convert 1 million ha of Central Kalimantan peatland into productive rice fields.</p><p>The resulting ecological disaster helped push the country into third place among the world's biggest carbon emitters - a position it contests, but which was still a source of profound embarrassment to the hosts of the just-concluded Bali conference.</p><p>Kalimantan is only part of the problem. More damage has been done by loggers and oil palm planters in Riau - so much so that the Sumatran province contributes 70 per cent of the 516 million tonnes of carbon Indonesia's degraded peatlands emit each year.</p><p>In all, that adds up to 82 per cent of South-east Asian peat emissions, 58 per cent of global emissions and twice what Indonesia burns annually in fossil fuels - just some of the statistics trotted out to support the inclusion of reforestation and avoided deforestation in a new addendum to the Kyoto Protocol.</p><p>Overall, deforestation, degradation and land-use changes are responsible for 18 per cent of global greenhouse gas emissions, yet there is no incentive in the current protocol for Indonesia and 10 other developing countries to curb them or do more to slow the destruction of their forests.</p><p>Jakarta wants peatlands in the proposed Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (Redd) pact for a good reason. Simple re-flooding and other rehabilitation will bring far more short-term benefits than reforestation and reduced logging in any global carbon trading market.</p><p>'Peatlands are the low- hanging fruit, given their huge value of emissions and the fact that they bring few economic benefits,' said Mr Meine van Noordwijk, regional coordinator for the International Centre for Research and Agroforestry.</p><p>'If they are not included, about 50 per cent of Indonesia's emissions will not be within the domain.'</p><p>Carbon trading offers financial incentives for businesses not to pump greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. It is already a $30US billion business, but Mr Anthony Moody, executive chairman of Sindicatum Carbon Capital, believes it could soar to $200US billion over the next three years.</p><p>The ultimate goal of climate change negotiators is to map out a two-year path aimed at forging a global system for imposing and enforcing emission reductions.</p><p>Some developed countries do not want to pay for actions that are not taken and worry about the difficulty of measuring avoided deforestation, particularly in countries such as Indonesia, where graft is rife and rules notoriously slippery.</p><p>Under Kyoto, so-called Annex 1 countries - all developed nations except the US - set a ceiling on the greenhouse gases they can can emit in a year. When Europe implemented its cap-and-trade system, which sets a benchline for emissions, it did not specifically give offset credits for avoided deforestation because it feared they would flood the system, though it did make some exceptions.</p><p>London is the financial centre for carbon trading because Britain and the European Union signed up early to Kyoto, and the financiers quickly got to work and figured out how to profit from it.</p><p>Indonesian businessmen say carbon credit trading will not work because it is just too difficult. But they said the same thing when the Jakarta Stock Exchange opened in 1988 with 24 listed companies and little else. </p><p>'It involved a process, and you had to go through the process and be transparent,' recalled Ms Agnes Safford, director of Singapore-based AsiaWorksAsia.</p><p>'You are dealing with the same thing in the carbon market - auditors, accountants and engineers are the only people who understand it.'</p><p>In the short term, a lot can still happen because power plants, industry, transportation, landfills - even lighting in city buildings - can all create carbon credits by making efficiency savings and shifting away from fossil fuels.</p><p>Mr Moody's Sindicatum recently hooked up with petroleum firm Odira Energy Persada in eight projects that will cut 20 million tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions by converting flared gas to liquid petroleum gas for use in diesel and coal-fired power stations.</p><p>Swiss-owned Indocement, Indonesia's second-largest cement maker, has already introduced substitute fuels and efficiencies in power usage to generate emission credits that can be offset in Switzerland.</p><p>The Swiss should be cleaning up their own country, but it is cheaper to do it in Indonesia, which has only nine projects registered so far with the UN Convention for Climate Change.</p><p>Of course, for climate change activists, the idea of offsets is not as attractive as absolute cuts which, as the US has stubbornly shown, are tough to attain in an industrialised giant seeking to keep its extravagant living standards.</p><p>Indonesia can do it easier, but Ms Safford said the earliest actual credits for reforestation and avoided deforestation will probably not be paid until 2014, two years after Redd is enshrined under a new protocol and Jakarta decides on an emissions cap.</p><p>Until then, investors can trade in voluntary emission reduction (VER) credits - private deals in which carbon credits for maintaining a forest can be used - not traded - to offset carbon emissions.</p><p>In the first pilot project of its kind, the Borneo Tropical Rainforest Foundation has a deal with East Kalimantan's Malinau district to carry out a study of carbon stocks in 325,000ha of virgin forest. It aims to create a baseline for Indonesia's future voluntary carbon market. That means coming up with a comprehensive assessment of the amount of carbon dioxide a forest absorbs, given the fact that different trees do not suck up the same amount of carbon.</p><p>Ms Safford said a VER credit in Indonesia is worth $2US to $3US a tonne, against $20US or more for those traded in Europe. So far, the global VER market only amounts to about $50US million, largely because the bureaucracy is not involved and a lot of the deals are built on trust.</p><p>'But the minute it falls under a new protocol, you will start seeing forest deals done,' said Ms Safford. 'Why? Because all the big funds see the writing on the wall - they see the Western world will pay for this. In the end, I am sure it is going to be a conscience thing.'</p><p>But back to that huge increase in coal-fired power generation. What might happen if the price of carbon doubles and suddenly scrubbers and other clean technologies become a profitable part of the electricity business?</p><p>Ms Safford said: 'It will happen eventually, but we still have to go through this tedious process to get there. The framework has to be in place before the private sector can pile in.' </p><p>That is the good news.
