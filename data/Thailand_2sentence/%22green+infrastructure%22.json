Limited access to stable work severely hinders local development and deepens household vulnerability. Chronic drought and unique windstorms, known locally as Tiomena, cause lasting damage to agriculture, livestock, and core livelihoods. This ongoing stress places pressure on food security, nutrition, and overall community resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To address these challenges, the Government of Madagascar launched the MIONJO Project in December 2020. With funding from the World Bank, the project is implemented under the leadership of the Ministry of the Interior and Decentralization (MID) and coordinated closely with the Ministry of Land Planning and Land Services (MDAT) and the Ministry of Environment and Sustainable Development (MEDD). These ministries not only guide strategic planning but also oversee operational aspects such as community targeting, coordination, and monitoring of progress.</p><p>With a budget of $188 million, of which $11.4 million is allocated to green infrastructure, MIONJO is part of Madagascar's country strategy and supports its climate change commitments under the Nationally Determined Contributions and the National Adaptation Plan. The project's core goals are to improve access to basic infrastructure and livelihoods, strengthen local governance with a focus on youth and women, and ensure rapid and effective responses to food security crises and other emergencies.</p><p>MIONJO's subcomponent 3D, overseen by MEDD, involves partnerships with local organizations like Catholic Relief Services (CRS) Madagascar. This subcomponent focuses on green infrastructure and resilient landscape development.</p><p>The implementation approach is cash-for-work, ensuring that environmental restoration meets urgent community needs. This approach not only allows community members to earn income but also promotes savings, financial literacy, and even seed capital for small businesses, laying the foundation for long-term livelihood resilience. Operational coordination at the local level is conducted under the supervision of MDAT and MEDD, ensuring strong public leadership in the field.</p><p>Sambeterake Marchetine, a 38-year-old mother of five, is one of the many community members who benefited from this initiative. Previously, she struggled to meet her family's basic needs, with scarce food, children missing school, and fields buried under sand. Her situation improved when she was selected to work as a team leader for a local cash-for-work activity. Over 87 days, she earned a daily income and saved part of it. Through a savings group, she built small financial reserves. With her savings, Marchetine opened a small grocery shop that allows her to provide regular meals, pay for her children's schooling, and make home improvements including a sturdy roof and a water basin. Her once barren land is now fertile again, with agricultural production five times higher than before.</p><p>This same combination of opportunity and structure helped transform the life of Tsiombota, a fisherman in a coastal village. Until recently, Tsiombota had to rent his fishing net and canoe, drastically limiting his earnings. After participating in 98 days of cash-for-work activities, including dune stabilization and watershed rehabilitation, he saved enough income to purchase his own fishing net. He can now fish on his own schedule and has significantly increased his daily income. Encouraged by this progress, Tsiombota also plans to purchase a canoe. He intends to use his earnings and apply for a loan from his savings group, which he joined after the project introduced financial support systems such as savings and lending communities and village savings and loan associations.</p><p>These are not just stories of economic uplift; they demonstrate how the financial tools and structured engagement promoted by MIONJO equip people to expand their potential through small but transformative investments.</p><p>The project's environmental impacts are equally tangible. In a village once haunted by the fear of sand engulfing fields, residents are now reclaiming their land. Botoasa, the village chief of Ankilimiary, recalls, We were afraid to plant anything because the sand would destroy it. Our fields were left untouched, out of fear.</p><p>In response, the community mobilized around land protection efforts. They planted native species such as laloasy, lalanda, and mozotse around vulnerable areas. These plants were selected for their suitability to local conditions and their ability to stabilize the soil. A few months after planting, residents began seeing results: young plants thrived, the dunes stopped advancing, and the soil once again became suitable for cultivation.</p><p>Our crops are growing again, and the soil is protected. We have regained hope, says Botoasa, who, although not personally involved in the labor, witnessed the transformation. His testimony is a reminder that community-wide mobilization, paired with technical expertise, can restore both land and confidence.</p><p>In April 2025, MIONJO expanded its efforts in Androy and Anosy, selecting new participants for reforestation and dune stabilization activities. Simultaneously, CRS reinforced its financial support structures to bolster savings, credit, and entrepreneurship. Results to date are impressive: 1,020 hectares of land reforested, over 1,094 hectares of dunes stabilized, 100 kilometers of windbreak trees planted, and more than 1.7 million seedlings grown in local nurseries.</p><p>These numbers are more than statistics, they represent lives like Marchetine's, Tsiombota's, and Botoasa's. Each figure reflects a family with greater income security, a farmer returning to cultivated fields, or a fisherman steering his future. The MIONJO Project, through its integrated approach, shows how a carefully designed intervention can meet both immediate needs and long-term goals, helping southern Madagascar's communities not just survive, but build forward with dignity and hope.</p><p>Through the MIONJO project, implemented with financial and technical support from the World Bank, the Government of Madagascar reaffirms its commitment to promoting sustainable, resilient development.

Worse, the climate change impact intensifies weather turbulences with intense, localised rainfall -- known as \"rain bombs\" or cloudbursts -- that may cause severe floods in areas with a poor drainage system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We have to say, the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration (BMA) did quite well preparing for heavy downpours in the past months, such as through dredging canals, removing waste from waterways and cooking fat from drainage pipes. There are also active flood tunnels, and some are under construction. Yet, several areas still remain flood-prone. The sight of rain-related paralysed traffic underneath and on the Bang Na-Trat expressway, with a backlog 31km long, during a major rain event in late May was indeed horrible.</p><p>Undeniably, rainy events remain a threat to several parts of Bangkok as the city is not porous enough. It's time for a change.</p><p>Over the past years, urban porosity -- an increase of green spaces, permeable surfaces with the use of porous asphalt/concrete -- has gained more attention from city planners around the world. Green areas include rain gardens and rooftop gardens that help retain and capture water in a heavy rain event, so that it will not overwhelm drainage systems. By accommodating porosity, the city will not have to depend solely on the conventional drainage system. Several cities around the world have adopted urban porosity strategies to cope better with floods. Shanghai and Wuhan in China, for instance, have embraced such a strategy. In effect, they increase green spaces, water-retention areas, and permeable surfaces for roads as well as footpaths.</p><p>In Europe, Copenhagen has implemented a plan to tackle cloudbursts by spreading rain gardens around the city. There are also bioswales -- a shallow, vegetated channel that helps manage stormwater runoff by capturing it in the ground.</p><p>Other cities not far away from Bangkok also adopt this strategy. Singapore, for example, has increased green areas. More importantly, Singaporean city administrators engage the private sector in tree planting and in vertical garden campaigns. Although this strategy primarily aims to reduce the heat island effect, it also significantly accommodates urban porosity.</p><p>It should be noted that, while adopting a porosity strategy, these cities do not totally abandon conventional water management systems that include the use of water pumps and drainage pipes. In fact, such a system still remains the backbone of water management, and it requires standard maintenance to maintain, if not improve, its efficiency.</p><p>In fact, the ideal water management system must ensure joint operation between the green and blue infrastructure (meaning extensive green space and water retention area) as well as grey infrastructure (or water drainage system).</p><p>But if we look at Bangkok, we have to ask if it's time for the BMA to improve the city's drainage system by incorporating more blue-green infrastructure to ensure more porous surfaces so as to drain the rainwater more efficiently.

Tour buses sit idle. Empty beaches. The culprit? Not mass protests. Not pandemics. But smoke, dust, and heat. Tourism fuels Thailand's economy, yet smog, heat waves, and flash floods are rapidly choking it. Can paradise still sell if it's unbreathable?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The signs are worrying.</p><p>Tourism is a key driver of Thailand's economy, contributing significantly to GDP and employing over 4.5 million people. This year, however, foreign tourist arrivals have dropped by 5.62% compared to the same period last year.</p><p>The setbacks are many: global economic slowdown and wars in various parts of the world. Thailand is also losing ground to newer, cheaper, and more enticing destinations.</p><p>But the real threat is closer to home. Toxic haze. Flash floods. Heavy storms. Climate shocks that are no longer rare but routine. Together, air pollution and unpredictable, extreme weather are clouding Thailand's tourism recovery prospects and long-term growth. For a country that sells itself on natural beauty, the crossroads is clear: adapt -- or be left behind.</p><p>Toxic haze</p><p>First, the smog. When the air is unbreathable, choking livability, the tourism industry suffers. Every year, from January to April, Thailand's peak tourist season, Bangkok and Chiang Mai are blanketed in smog. The fine dust, known as PM2.5, doesn't just cloud the skies. It drives travellers away.</p><p>Data from 2016 to 2024 shows Chiang Mai's pollution levels often exceed global safety limits. Health-conscious visitors from Europe and North America are starting to take notice -- and cancel.</p><p>The source? Forest fires in protected areas. Crop burning in the North. Not just in Thailand, but across the border in Myanmar and Laos, where forests are cleared to grow corn and cassava for export.</p><p>Bangkok, meanwhile, has its own mix of trouble: car exhaust, construction dust, and a weather quirk called \"temperature inversion\" that traps toxic air close to the ground.</p><p>The wildfires, crop burnings, and car exhaust have created more than 11.9 billion tonnes of greenhouse gases globally each year, fuelling a crisis that hits the tourism industry hard.</p><p>The short-term damage is clear on public health and the economy. Fearing serious health hazards, visitors stay away. Local businesses lose income. Hotels, restaurants, and tour operators are left struggling, particularly where tourism is their major source of income.</p><p>Unstable weather</p><p>In the long run, unchecked emissions will aggravate unstable weather from global warming further. Frequent natural disasters will make travel less predictable, less enjoyable, and far more risky.</p><p>The seasons aren't just shifting -- they're breaking down.</p><p>Examples abound. Flash floods hit Phuket and Pattaya without warning. Strong winds batter boats in the Andaman Sea. Krabi and Koh Samui face water shortages as droughts drag on. Even the year-end cool season, once a reliable tourist draw, is losing its chill.</p><p>It's already costing the country. A 2016 study by Roson and Sartori warned that a global temperature rise of 2C could slash over 62 billion baht from Thailand's annual tourism revenue. It's a looming reality.</p><p>Other studies show how nature's decline is affecting tourist satisfaction. Bleached corals. Eroded beaches. Shorter stays. Fewer return visits. Take Patong and Hua Hin. Once postcard-perfect, now their shorelines are shrinking. Or the Similan Islands, where coral reefs are fading fast.</p><p>Lagging behind</p><p>Other countries are adapting to the threats from global warming. The US and China have shown what's possible with political commitment. Strong laws. Big investments in clean technology and public transport that don't choke the air.</p><p>China, for instance, has cut its PM2.5 levels by over 35% in the past decade by ditching coal, reforming industry, and pushing electric cars. California lets farmers burn crop waste, but only with permits and expert oversight, to minimise harm to surrounding communities.</p><p>Unfortunately, Thailand is lagging behind. Although it has taken some steps, they are not producing real results. For example, governors now have the power to regulate open burning. However, poor system coordination, a lack of weather advisers, and farmers' limited understanding have prevented the measure from being effective.</p><p>Opportunity</p><p>Despite the challenges, there's still hope.</p><p>The global tourism market is now shifting towards quality over quantity. New generations of travellers aren't just chasing sights. They now seek ecotourism and responsible travel. They want experiences that respect nature and communities. Thailand can tap into this growing market.</p><p>Some government efforts are on the right track. Projects like coral conservation zones, the closure of Maya Bay for recovery, and \"OTOP Nawatwithi\" village tourism show what's possible when the government understands the trend and steps in. These good models can go further if expanded and systematically sustained.</p><p>Aligning with the UN's Sustainable Development Goals, especially those on decent work, responsible consumption, and the protection of land and sea, can also help guide Thailand's responsible tourism policy, ensuring that growth and environmental care go hand in hand.</p><p>This includes investing in green infrastructure, providing skills training for a changing world, and improving water and clean energy systems in tourist towns.</p><p>New direction</p><p>It's clear. Thailand must take a new direction to save the tourism industry. And it takes all hands on deck. The state must lead with vision, and businesses must move fast.</p><p>The government must act boldly with a clear long-term roadmap. That means cutting carbon from tourism, creating national \"Green Destination\" standards, and supporting sustainable investments through green bonds or environmental tax incentives.</p><p>But the private sector must not wait. Businesses should lead by example by switching to clean energy, managing waste responsibly, and partnering with local communities to co-manage tourism sites better and more fairly.</p><p>The Covid-19 crisis showed us that overreliance on tourism can be risky without a backup plan. And failing to address today's environmental issues will only drive up the cost of recovery in the future.</p><p>The wind of global tourism has shifted. Thailand must act fast because those who adjust their sails first will win.</p><p>Thailand's tourism industry is at a crossroads. It can cling to the old model of mass tourism and risk collapse. Or it can shift to a new tourism that is cleaner, ready for future challenges, and sustainable.</p><p>Air pollution and climate change aren't distant threats. They're already reshaping where and how people travel. They're wake-up calls for a new tourism direction.

Very good morning to all of you. Sa-wat-dee-krub.</p><p>2. It is a great privilege and a great pleasure to join you today for the 9th Singapore Regional Business Forum (SRBF), in the vibrant city of Bangkok.</p><p>3. I am indeed very heartened to see such strong participation by companies from Singapore, Thailand, and the wider region, united all by one common goal: to strengthen business resilience and to seize new opportunities.</p><p>Strong Singapore and Thailand Partnership</p><p>4. This year's SRBF also holds a special significance - because we are commemorating the 60th anniversary of diplomatic relations between Singapore and Thailand. The theme for this significant milestone is STRONG@60. It captures the essence of our longstanding bilateral relationship - which is a robust and resilient partnership. Ladies and gentlemen, the numbers speak for themselves:</p><p>a. Our bilateral trade reached over S$44 billion last year, which is a 6.4% increase from the year before. Thailand was Singapore's 9th largest trading partner, and the third largest in ASEAN.</p><p>b. Since 2015, Singapore has consistently ranked amongst Thailand's top investors, and in 2024, we emerged as the largest foreign investor in Thailand.</p><p>5. However, beyond the numbers, it is our people and the business ties that form the foundation of this strong partnership. During my meeting with DPM Pichai this morning, he had asked, \"What drew Singapore entrepreneurs and businesses to Thailand?\" I responded that it was the people, the strong business ties, and the hospitality that really laid the foundation. I want to illustrate two examples and share them with all of you:</p><p>a. In the sustainable energy space, Keppel, in partnership with BCPG Public Company Limited, pioneered a first-of-its-kind district cooling system for the Samyan Smart City in Bangkok.</p><p>b. In the healthcare innovation space, Singapore-based CoNEX Healthcare's AI-powered patient monitoring solution, PreSAGE, has been adopted by several Thai hospitals. Using thermal imaging, machine learning and predictive algorithms, the system reduces falls amongst elderly patients and contributes towards Thailand's efforts to care for its ageing population.</p><p>6. At the 7th Singapore-Thailand Enhanced Economic Relationship (STEER) Ministerial Meeting earlier in March this year, we continue to forge partnerships in new areas. I witnessed the signing of five Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) which span the areas of e-commerce, consumer protection, fintech, and agri-trade, as well as the announcement of a refreshed workplan on intellectual property collaboration.</p><p>7. As Singapore and Thailand celebrate our success in the last 60 years, I hope that we can reflect not just on our shared path, but think ahead and look at how we can shape the next 60 years of our partnership.</p><p>Navigating a Complex Global Landscape Through Regional Collaboration</p><p>8. This is especially important at a time where the global environment is undergoing profound changes:</p><p>a. Geopolitical tensions are threatening to fragment trade flows;</p><p>b. Our supply chains are being reshaped;</p><p>c. Climate risks and the need for energy securities are accelerating;</p><p>d. Technological disruptions, especially with the increasing prominence of AI, are transforming how we live, how we work, and how we do businesses.</p><p>9. In the face of such volatilities and to navigate these uncertainties, I think it is sll the more important for trusted partners to come together and to collaborate both on the bilateral and regional level because that would be a critical way forward.</p><p>10. Amidst these challenges, ASEAN remains a critical anchor for stability and growth:</p><p>a. ASEAN's economy is projected to grow at 4.7% this year1, and it remains on track to become the fourth-largest global economy by 2030.</p><p>b. ASEAN is home to more than 680 million people, with an expanding middle class that is also tech savvy. This will be a very powerful driver of innovation and consumption.</p><p>c. We are also seeing a reconfiguration of global supply chains that favour this region - especially in Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, and Indonesia.</p><p>11. Structural changes within ASEAN are also creating new engines of growth.</p><p>a. On the digital front, ASEAN is emerging as a global hub for digital finance and e-commerce. Digital payments alone are expected to surpass US$1 trillion in gross transaction value by 2025.2 With the emergence of Artificial Intelligence, these digital innovations are set to transform existing business models and create entirely new industries across various sectors.</p><p>b. On the green transition front, ASEAN's green economy could unlock an additional US$300 billion in annual revenue through the development of green infrastructure, modernising domestic and regional electricity grids, accelerating the electric vehicle ecosystem, and leveraging the region's rich natural assets to develop carbon markets.3 This green transition is not only a tangible step towards creating and combatting the effects of climate change, but will also help to create new jobs and it can enhance our collective regional energy security.4</p><p>12. To unlock its full potential, all of us have to work together, both at the bilateral and regional levels. Thailand and Singapore have been strong advocates of regional economic integration.</p><p>a. Thailand as the Chair of the ASEAN Digital Economy Framework Agreement (DEFA) plays a key role. Singapore will support Thailand in working towards an ambitious and forward-looking agreement by the end this year, that will enhance interoperability and inclusivity across ASEAN's digital economies. Singapore also welcomes Thailand's application to join the Digital Economy Partnership Agreement (DEPA).</p><p>b. To support ASEAN's green economy development and the longer-term energy vision, we also look forward to accelerating discussions on the ASEAN Power Grid, so as to achieve a more resilient and sustainable future for ASEAN.</p><p>Seizing Opportunities: A Call to Action for Businesses</p><p>13. What do they mean for Singaporean and Thai businesses? I want to humbly suggest that they present business opportunities in three areas.</p><p>14. First, it deepens trade and investment. There remains scope for our companies to forge closer partnerships in mutual areas of interests, such as in advanced manufacturing, fintech, agri-tech, and electric vehicles.</p><p>a. For instance, in the Fintech space, iFAST signed an MOU with Thailand's TSFC Securities Public Company Limited earlier this year to explore a fintech platform to facilitate access for Thai securities companies and other financial institutions. This will allow companies to seamlessly trade offshore bonds, with immediate executable pricing and full price transparency.</p><p>b. Riding on Thailand's interest in electric vehicles (EV) development, Singapore tech start-up Voltality has partnered with Thai industrial estate conglomerate WHA Group last year to offer a multilateral roaming platform for EVs in Thailand. Currently, Voltality provides access to over 2,000 EV charging points.</p><p>15. Secondly, accelerating digital collaboration. Singapore and Thailand are digital frontrunners in ASEAN, and our countries would benefit significantly by enhancing digital collaboration.</p><p>a. For example, our Paynow-PromptPay real-time payment linkage launched since 2021 have allowed users to transfer funds securely and seamlessly between accounts in Singapore and Thailand. This is a practical demonstration of how technology can bring about tangible benefits to our people and to our businesses.</p><p>b. As digital trade between both our countries continue to grow, Singapore and Thai businesses will have much to gain by leveraging cross-border e-commerce for better connectivity and better market access.</p><p>16. Third, pioneering sustainability collaboration. Carbon markets would allow us to unlock new economic opportunities across our entire region whilst mitigating carbon emissions.</p><p>a. Thailand is a forerunner in this space. Since 2024, Thailand has developed and implemented its own national carbon standard, the Thailand Voluntary Emission Reduction (TVER) programme. It is the first country to complete an Article 6.2 carbon credits transfer under its cooperation with Switzerland.</p><p>b. I am about to announce with great pleasure that this afternoon, I will be signing an Implementation Agreement pursuant to Article 6 of the Paris Agreement with Minister of Natural Resources and Environment, Chalermchai Sri-on. I am really looking forward to this Agreement because this Agreement will be the first between two ASEAN member states, and this is a significant milestone in our bilateral climate cooperation.</p><p>c. This Agreement will unlock additional climate finance and catalyse and uplift investments into credible carbon projects in Thailand, such as in forestry and e-mobility. It will also support Singapore in meeting our climate targets.</p><p>d. I am confident that our collaborations on this front will serve as a pathfinder for the region, by demonstrating how countries can work together to achieve both economic and environmental good outcomes.</p><p>e. We look forward to working closely with Thailand to implement the Agreement. I would like to encourage our business communities to look and explore joint projects that can advance sustainable development, that can contribute to a dynamic carbon market in ASEAN. This will bring significant meaningful impact to all of our communities.</p><p>Closing</p><p>17. Ladies and gentlemen, let me conclude with this thought: in this era of uncertainty, collaboration and partnerships have never been more vital.</p><p>18. It is through all of us working together, Singapore and Thailand, alongside with the rest of ASEAN, we can prevail by turning challenges into opportunities.

But as the international community calls on multilateral development banks to work more effectively together, it's becoming clear that collaboration must be front and center to deliver greater development impact.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Caribbean is showing why this shift is urgent.</p><p>Here, the urgency of disaster threats, economic volatility, and institutional overload compresses everything. Governments operate with lean teams and wide mandates, grappling with the pressure to implement reforms and deliver resilient, inclusive, and green infrastructure and services-often within tight fiscal constraints and amid rising debt levels. A single hurricane can wipe out development gains built over many years of reform and investment.</p><p>In this context, collaboration is not a bonus - it is the engine that makes delivery possible when in-country institutional capacity is stretched and resources are limited. By reducing transaction costs and aligning efforts, collaboration becomes both essential and cost-efficient.</p><p>This understanding is already reshaping how the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), and the Caribbean Development Bank (CDB) engage in the region - informing their strategic and operational planning, strengthening project cycle management and delivery, and encouraging more coordinated partnerships.</p><p>From Coordination to Strategic Alignment</p><p>This shift is already influencing how development partners work together in practice. In May 2025, representatives from the World Bank Group and CDB convened to deepen cooperation across key sectors-macroeconomics, private sector development, human development, sustainable development, and infrastructure. Discussions focused on opportunities to strengthen partnerships and improve impact, share achievements and challenges, and address barriers to effective coordination.</p><p>Building on that strategic alignment, Jamaica's regular portfolio review took a new form in 2024: for the first time, the World Bank and IDB participated together. The format-proposed by the World Bank-enabled all three parties to identify common implementation challenges across the project cycle, discuss coordinated solutions, and agree on next steps to strengthen delivery and ensure future support aligns with Jamaica's development goals.</p><p>These examples reflect a broader trend across the region, where country portfolio reviews and joint engagements reinforce a more coordinated and results-driven approach to development.</p><p>From Coordination to Co-Creation and Delivery</p><p>As collaboration deepens, institutions are moving beyond coordination to co-creating solutions together-with shared ownership from the start. One such example is Digilab Finance, a joint initiative by the World Bank and CDB that supports the modernization of financial institutions in the Caribbean through digital transformation. The program combines the World Bank's technical depth with CDB's regional networks-offering hands-on support to institutions navigating change.</p><p>Digilab Finance didn't emerge from a formal strategy; it grew out of collaboration between teams and institutions that saw the value in building something new together.</p><p>Harmonizing Delivery in Fragile Contexts</p><p>The true test of collaboration comes in fragile contexts, where fragmented support can overwhelm ministries already struggling to deliver. With this in mind, the World Bank and CDB took a unified approach in Haiti's education sector, where both institutions support national programs.</p><p>Rather than establish separate implementation arrangements, they chose to work through a shared project implementation unit and to coordinate procurement through a common government counterpart. This approach reduced the burden on the Ministry of Education and enabled greater continuity of delivery-critical in a context where political instability and security challenges often disrupt public services.</p><p>These early shifts reflect a deeper recognition: even small operational choices can create real breathing room for governments navigating complex delivery demands.</p><p>Regional Platforms for Shared Learning</p><p>Beyond individual countries, the institutions are also coming together at the regional level. In June 2025, the World Bank and CDB co-hosted a joint Procurement Week in Belize, bringing together procurement professionals and policymakers from across the Caribbean.</p><p>Procurement is often where fragmentation is most visible-and most costly. In small states, where limited staff manage large and diverse portfolios, overlapping systems can slow delivery and stall reform.</p><p>The forum gave countries space to exchange experiences, explore pooled procurement, and consider how systems can better serve small states. This effort reflects a broader realization: when countries face shared constraints, they also benefit from shared solutions-and institutions have a role to play in creating the space for that exchange to happen.</p><p>From Haiti's harmonized education delivery to a joint portfolio review in Jamaica and regional learning platforms, these examples point to a more adaptive model-one where development partners align how they engage, support, deliver, and respond to government priorities.</p><p>As development challenges become more urgent and complex, and expectations rise, progress in the Caribbean must continue to evolve-not through more fragmented initiatives, but through stronger alignment, strategic partnerships, meaningful collaboration, and a shared commitment to results.</p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["The Caribbean is showing why this shift is urgent.

Since assuming my post seven months ago, this ancient land has left me deeply inspired. I was honored to present credentials to His Majesty Sultan Haitham, profoundly moved by his emphasis on enhancing our relations. I have visited Omani government departments, universities, and museums, toured the magnificent Sultan Qaboos Grand Mosque, explored Nizwa Fort and the Special Economic Zone at Duqm, and celebrated the inaugural Omani Rutab Festival with the people of South Batinah. When I hear Omani youth greet me with \"N ho\" at cultural events - alongside seeing Chinese electric vehicles on your roads - I witness our friendship flourishing with renewed vitality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This Forum's birth stems from shared aspirations. Throughout our preparations this year - whether meeting Omani friends or consulting Chinese enterprises - one consistent theme emerged: our collective desire to enhance practical cooperation. Building on previous Friendship Forums, the word \"Cooperation\" was incorporated into its good name. We hope to shape this forum into a platform for dialogue between companies, policymakers, and stakeholders, aims to deliver tangible outcomes, thus contribute to accelerating practical cooperation between our two countries.</p><p>Today's theme - \"Chinese Modernization and Oman Vision 2040: Our actions and suggestions\" - reflects the forum's forward-looking spirit. I urge everyone to seize this opportunity for open dialogue and joint planning, injecting strong new momentum into the long-standing friendship between China and Oman!</p><p>Dear friends, Chinese Modernization is an Opportunity for Oman's Development. In 2022, President Xi Jinping proposed comprehensively advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation through Chinese Modernization - a concept rich in meaning and of global significance. This path of modernization is unique: it is pursued in a country with a massive population, aims to achieve common prosperity for all, promotes the coordinated development of material and spiritual civilization, seeks harmony between humanity and nature, and firmly follows the path of peaceful development. In the face of accelerating global changes unseen in a century and an increasingly complex and volatile international landscape, China has remained steadfast in pursuing its own development path, committed to peaceful development and win-win cooperation.</p><p>After decades of dedicated efforts, China has built strong foundations in economic infrastructure, technological innovation, manufacturing capabilities, and market scale. China now possesses the most complete industrial system in the world. It leads the world in smart manufacturing, with 78 Lighthouse Factories - the highest number globally. In cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence, China is a front-runner: nearly 70% of global patents for foundational AI models originate from China, and more than 42% of 5G standard-essential patents declared globally are held by Chinese entities. At the same time, China's green energy transition has entered a phase of acceleration. Nearly 60% of its installed power generation capacity now comes from non-fossil fuel sources. As Achim Steiner, Administrator of the United Nations Development Programme, once noted: \"China is the only major economy in the world that has achieved rapid economic growth while significantly reducing emissions.\"</p><p>Friends, We Chinese often refer to the Yellow River as the mother river thus serving as a symbol of our nation. Chinese modernization is like the endless snowmelt from the Tianshan Mountains, continuously revitalizing this ancient river. No matter how rugged the terrain or harsh the climate, its mighty current surges forward ceaselessly-nourishing the children of China while bringing greenery to the world.</p><p>China and Oman are good friends and reliable partners. Our friendship dates back to 1200 years ago. Since the establishment of diplomatic relationship in 1978, we have consistently upheld shared moral values, treat each other with mutual respect, and pursue win-win cooperation, maintaining a high level of political mutual trust. In 2018, China and Oman established strategic partnership and signed a Memorandum of Understanding on the Belt and Road Initiative Cooperation. In 2022, China-Arab community with a shared future in the new era and China-GCC strategic partnership were announced at the first China-Arab States Summit and the China-GCC Summit, which gave great momentum to this relationship.</p><p>China has been actively implementing the outcomes of the summits and advancing practical cooperation. In 2024, the trade volume between China and GCC countries reached $288 billion, making China the GCC's largest trading partner. China's investment in GCC countries has maintained robust growth. In the first half of 2025, Chinese investment in GCC nations surged by over 30%, with particularly notable expansions in energy and digital economy-far exceeding the overall growth rate of 20.7% in Belt and Road Initiative investments.</p><p>Now, China stands steady as the largest trading partner of Oman, with bilateral trade volume reaching 36.7 billion US dollars in 2024. China is also the third largest investor of Oman. Our collaboration shines through projects like November 2024's successful launch of Oman's first satellite, strategic energy infrastructure including Oman's largest power transmission project, and the Manah Solar Project reducing annual emissions by one million tonnes. Over 1200 Omani technicians and executives have received specialized training through programs by China's Ministry of Commerce and companies like Huawei.</p><p>Into the new era, Oman Vision 2040 proposed by His Majesty Sultan Haitham has charted a clear course for the nation's future development. To China, Oman's strategic advantages extend beyond its unique location and stable environment to include thriving economic zones and other assets. China and Oman are like minds as we share core values in blending heritage with modern governance, prioritizing green transition, and championing dialogue. This alignment makes ChinaOman's natural partner in achieving Vision 2040, and Oman possesses full potential and should indeed play a more important role in cooperation with China under the Belt and Road Initiative.</p><p>Distinguished guests, China and Oman are truly kindred spirits-companions and steadfast partners on the path of development. President Xi Jinping and Sultan Haitham attach great importance to developing bilateral relations, providing strategic leadership and encouraging pragmatic cooperation. Since the beginning of this year, they have exchanged letters and had active interactions many times. Guided by the strategic leadership of the two heads of state, we therefore strive to realize the development blueprints of our respective countries. Deepening cooperation for mutual benefit is our shared optimal choice. To implement the outcomes of the China-Arab States Summit and the China-GCC Summit, we must be steadfast doers.</p><p>As Arabic wisdom goes \"Time is gold\"-compels us to act. With the second China-Arab States Summit approaching, let us use this forum as a platform to accelerate business matchmaking and strive to propel practical China-Oman cooperation into fast gear. To this end, I would like to propose the following concrete suggestions:</p><p>First, Accelerate Policy Integration. We must jointly expedite implementation of the China-GCC Free Trade Agreement, creating freer, more predictable trade conditions. Simultaneously, we should enhance mutual recognition of standards - particularly in product quality, technical regulations, and conformity assessment - to eliminate non-tariff barriers.</p><p>Second, Accelerate Innovation Synergy. We should expand joint R&amp;D and industrial collaboration in new energy, IT, AI, and space technology. China stands ready to enhance cooperation in government capacity-building and vocational training, developing Omani specialists to support industrialization.</p><p>Third, Accelerate Green Financing. Financial institutions are encouraged to establish cross -border branches, strengthening collaboration to provide diversified green financing for clean energy, green infrastructure, and energy efficiency projects - accelerating Oman's green transition.</p><p>Forth, Accelerate Digital Transformation. We propose signing a framework agreement on digital economy cooperation while encouraging enterprises to explore collaborations in smart cities and digital healthcare - cultivating new cooperation drivers.</p><p>Meanwhile, We should enhance People-to-People Exchange. China has already implemented unilateral visa exemption for Oman, opening new doors for personnel exchanges. As a next step, we should work jointly to expedite the launch of direct flights between our countries - making \"distant neighbors feel close.\" China will continue robust support for Chinese language education, with Dhofar University and four Omani high schools launching courses this year. We'll deepen cultural exchanges through tourism, museum collaborations, artistic performances, and media productions - allowing our unique cultures to resonate deeply and become a model of civilizational dialogue.</p><p>Friends, as we gather here to discuss cooperation, the humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza persists, testing the conscience of humanity. We commend Oman's longstanding commitment to a just stance on the Palestinian issue and its active mediation efforts to promote peace talks. China remains a steadfast promoter of peace in the Middle East, firmly supporting the \"two-state solution.\" We call on relevant parties to immediately cease fire and hostilities, restore humanitarian access, and return to the right track of political settlement at the earliest possible date. Together with Oman and the international community, China stands ready to advance a comprehensive, just and lasting resolution of the Palestinian question on the basis of achieving an immediate ceasefire in Gaza.</p><p>In conclusion, China and Oman are kindred spirits and steadfast partners. Under our leaders' strategic guidance and through our collective efforts, the China-Oman strategic partnership will embrace a brilliant future!</p><p>I wish this Forum complete success!

Hundreds of lives were lost, and critical infrastructure - from drainage systems to schools - was destroyed. The Cyclone Idai and Kenneth Emergency Recovery and Resilience Project was launched in response, aiming not only to rebuild but to strengthen climate resilience, particularly in Beira, a city severely affected.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This project, co-financed by World Bank and German cooperation through KfW, integrated green and grey infrastructure. It is being delivered through a shared implementation structure, reinforcing government leadership and reducing fragmentation. It also foreshadowed the deepened collaboration formalized in a 2024 co-financing framework agreement between the World Bank and KfW. That agreement provides a roadmap for joint projects with harmonized standards and coordinated approaches - laying the groundwork for more impactful co-financing efforts going forward.</p><p>In this conversation, Xavier Chavana, a Senior Disaster Risk Management Specialist for the World Bank in Mozambique, and KfW colleagues Ingo Baum and Susana Gomes, both Portfolio Managers for Good Governance and Biodiversity, reflect on how co-financing worked in practice - what enabled it, where the pressure points were, and what lessons it offers for future joint operations.</p><p>Q: This project brought together two major institutions in the wake of a devastating national crisis. What conditions made it possible for this co-financing partnership to deliver effectively in such a demanding setting?</p><p>Xavier Chavana: We were operating in a very complex environment - post-cyclone recovery, institutional fragility, climate risks, and major infrastructure needs. But what helped us move forward was the trust and understanding already built between our teams. We'd worked together on a previous project in Beira, which gave us a solid foundation - a shared sense of purpose and familiarity with the city's needs. That allowed us to focus on delivery rather than alignment.</p><p>Ingo Baum: I agree - what stood out was the level of continuity. Often with projects like these, the teams change and you lose momentum. Our team had worked on the first Beira project, and when we moved into the recovery phase, we were able to build on that. The relationships were already there - with each other, and with the government. And that meant we could focus on delivery rather than getting to know each other's systems from scratch.</p><p>Susana Gomes: We weren't locked into rigid roles. We were able to say: What needs to happen now, and who is best placed to do it? And that flexibility was essential. In a post-disaster context, you don't have time to coordinate every detail from headquarters. You need to empower the teams on the ground.</p><p>Q: Navigating institutional differences - from timelines to procedures to risk frameworks - is often a major hurdle in joint operations. How did you work through those differences in this case?</p><p>Ingo Baum: Alignment wasn't about eliminating differences, it was about managing them. The World Bank and KfW have different internal structures, different approval processes. But we didn't try to harmonize everything. Instead, we figured out where we could complement each other. For example, the Bank moved quickly to advance parts of the feasibility study. That allowed KfW to proceed with its own internal steps more efficiently. It was about sequencing, not duplication.</p><p>Susana Gomes: Exactly. It helped that both institutions are outcome-oriented. We didn't get stuck on whose procurement system would be used for which contract. We asked: what's the most effective way to deliver this? Sometimes that meant KfW taking the lead on certain components, sometimes the Bank. What mattered was that we agreed upfront on the big picture - one project, one roadmap, and a shared long-term vision for what we are trying to achieve - and then found practical solutions to get there.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: And we invested time early on to define that shared vision. There were months of technical preparation and design work before implementation began. We set up a single implementation unit, agreed on reporting lines, and held weekly meetings with the government to track progress and solve issues as they emerged. That kind of coordination is intense, but it's what makes co-financing more than just pooled money. It becomes a joint commitment.</p><p>Q: What were the advantages of co-financing this project? Did co-financing enable more ambitious, integrated solutions? How did that play out in the design and delivery of this project?</p><p>Xavier Chavana: In many cities, you see piecemeal solutions: one project addresses drainage, another focuses on green space or flood protection. In Beira, we had the opportunity to design a single, integrated approach. We combined conventional infrastructure like drainage canals and pumping stations with nature-based solutions - restoring mangroves, expanding retention basins, and rehabilitating the Chiveve River ecosystem. That dual approach not only reduced flood risk, it also created co-benefits for biodiversity and community use.</p><p>Susana Gomes: From KfW's side, this integration was very intentional. On behalf of the German government, we've supported green infrastructure in many countries, but the key in Beira was embedding it within a broader system. That required detailed technical coordination. For example, retention basins had to be placed strategically in relation to the urban drainage works. And those decisions couldn't be made in isolation - they depended on shared data, shared design timelines, and constant dialogue between our teams.</p><p>Ingo Baum: It also required a different mindset. You can't design green-grey infrastructure in silos. You have to start with the question: what combination of interventions will reduce risk and support long-term resilience in this specific place? German cooperation through KfW helped the city set up systems for long-term management. For example, we supported a park management unit to maintain new green infrastructure. This wasn't just about building; it was about making sure it could work - and last.</p><p>Q: A challenge we often hear about in development finance is fragmentation-too many uncoordinated efforts. How does co-financing help reduce that and support more coherent efforts, especially from the country's point of view?</p><p>Xavier Chavana: That's a real risk. If each partner runs its own process, the government ends up coordinating between institutions instead of focusing on delivery. From the outset, we made a conscious decision to avoid that. We agreed to work through a single implementation unit housed in the Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources, and to streamline our engagement with contractors and consultants. In some cases, we even had the same contractor delivering both Bank- and KfW-financed components. That's rare - and it made the project more coherent and efficient.</p><p>Susana Gomes: Many of the government counterparts had worked on earlier phases of the Chiveve project, so we weren't starting from scratch. That institutional memory really helped reduce friction. But more importantly, we were able to build on existing capacity rather than creating something new for the sake of it. That's often the most sustainable way forward.</p><p>Ingo Baum: One of the strengths of co-financing is that it brings more technical expertise to the table - different institutions contribute different skills, and that can really elevate the quality of a project. But it also introduces more complexity in terms of financing and delivery. That complexity only works if the teams - across institutions - can collaborate effectively. The day-to-day decisions, the sequencing, the problem solving - all of that depends on people who trust each other and can work through differences. In the end, coordination isn't just an institutional issue - it's a deeply human one.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: That shared structure also gave local actors more clarity. When different institutions coordinate behind one process, it's easier for implementing partners to engage, plan, and deliver. It reduces confusion and makes the whole project more manageable from the ground up.</p><p>Q: What do we need to get right to unlock more successful co-financing partnerships in the future?</p><p>Ingo Baum: You have to give people room to work. Institutions have their procedures, and that's important - but when the country is facing real challenges, the question isn't Is this a KfW-approved process or a World Bank one? It's: Can we deliver? And to do that, you need people on the ground who are empowered, who know each other, and who are trusted to make decisions. That's what made this work.</p><p>Susana Gomes: This experience showed what's possible when co-financing goes beyond alignment on paper to real collaboration in practice. We weren't just reacting to a crisis - we were helping lay foundations for long-term resilience. That meant thinking not only about what to build, but how to support local capacity to maintain and adapt those solutions in the future.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: Co-financing isn't just about bigger budgets - it's about better outcomes. When it works, it brings together complementary strengths and enables solutions that no one partner could deliver alone.</p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["That dual approach not only reduced flood risk, it also created co-benefits for biodiversity and community use.

I don't want my children, or any future generation, to suffer the way we have from droughts, says Ralahy Fid\\xE8le, a resident of Iritsoka, a village in the Betroka district of Madagascar's Atsimo-Andrefana region. This is one of the three regions that form the Great South of Madagascar, a part of the country known for its stark beauty, but also for its harsh realities.</p><p>Life in southern Madagascar is tough. Over 90% of the population lives in poverty, relying on farming and fishing to survive while climate change is putting these livelihoods at risk. The region faces repeated droughts and water scarcity, which affect families in their daily lives. Because of climate change, extreme weather is becoming more common. When the droughts end, the rains that follow are often too strong, causing heavy floods like those that happened just a few months ago. Violent southern winds, called Tiokatimo have also become more frequent and intense. These winds sweep red sand across the land, covering fields and homes. As desertification advances and sand dunes spread, families are left struggling to grow food or remain on their ancestral lands.</p><p>In the past 20 years, southern Madagascar has faced five major droughts. The most recent in 2021 was devastating. The gradual loss of natural ecosystems has exacerbated the effect of climate change and increased the vulnerability of the local communities.

The standard is set at 0.4 for residential development, which means there is a target in place for approximately 40% of residential developments to have green and blue spaces, green roofs or green walls. When adopted by a local planning authority it provides clarity about the quantity and quality of green infrastructure required to secure planning approval in a major new development. The Greater London Authority is already applying this principle.</p><p>Urban Tree Canopy Cover Standard - promotes an increase in tree canopy cover in urban environments. Trees are vital for capturing carbon and can mitigate flood risk as they absorb excess water during flooding incidents. The standard sets out that major residential and commercial development should be designed to meet locally agreed targets.</p><p>Accessible Greenspace Standards - promote access to good quality green and blue space within 15 minutes' walk from home. The People and Nature Survey published by Natural England found that 82% of adults agree that being in nature makes them very happy over but one third of people in England do not have access to green space within this distance and one in eight households do not have access to a private garden.

The Philippines Sustainability Now Forum is more than just a venue for dialogue; it is a call to action. I extend my heartfelt gratitude to the Italian Chamber, as well as our partners from the diplomatic corps, the business sector, and our development organizations, for advocating for this cause that must and should graduate from mere policy to actual practice across our destinations. Sustainability should not be a mere preference. It should be a mandate. And this is something that we feel very strongly about in the Department of Tourism-so much so that in crafting the National Tourism Development Plan under the administration of President Ferdinand R. Marcos, Jr., sustainable tourism development underpins all of our programs, the Tourism Chief stated in her keynote address.</p><p>Secretary Frasco presented the Department's transformational tourism agenda, built on the pillars of infrastructure, connectivity, product diversification, and heritage-centered promotion. She highlighted the government's investments in airports, tourism roads, and flood resilience through partnerships with the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) and the Tourism Infrastructure and Enterprise Zone Authority (TIEZA).</p><p>To enhance visitor comfort and improve tourism quality, Secretary Frasco shared updates on the DOT's rollout of 100 Tourist Rest Areas (TRAs) nationwide, which now feature solar power and rainwater harvesting systems. From an initial 10 launched since 2023, the TRAs are on track to reach 100, benefitting travelers across Luzon, Visayas, and Mindanao.</p><p>Also at the heart of these efforts is the Tourism Champions Challenge (TCC), a flagship program awarding over Php 250 million in grants to 15 local government units for infrastructure projects that meet the criteria of sustainability, inclusivity, and resilience. Projects include Panay: A Coastal Resource Experience, a mangrove-based ecotourism site in Panay, Capiz, and Legacy of the Sea, a community-based conservation initiative in Bolinao, Pangasinan. The program will soon launch its second cycle with expanded funding.</p><p>The Tourism Chief also reported the growing impact of the Philippine Experience Program (PEP), which promotes regional culture, heritage, and creative industries through tourism circuits co-developed with LGUs and communities. The initiative, now implemented in 12 regions, puts the spotlight on festivals, traditions, and local products.</p><p>As chair of the National Ecotourism Council (NEC) this year, the DOT recently launched the National Ecotourism Strategy and Action Plan (NESAP) 2024-2028, reinforcing the country's commitment to becoming a global leader in ecotourism built on conservation, stewardship, and climate resilience.</p><p>Secretary Frasco further highlighted the agency's push to institutionalize sustainability through updated National Accommodation Standards, sustainable tourism training with the Asian Institute of Management (AIM), and green infrastructure projects, including bike-friendly roads and ecotourism circuits. She also cited the solar-powered, locally woven Philippine Pavilion at Expo 2025 Osaka as a showcase of sustainable tourism values, which will be repatriated to the country for reuse after the expo.</p><p>We must graduate from this concept of simply counting arrivals to measuring the true value of tourism in our destinations, and most importantly, what it contributes to the host, to the local communities, and to community-based tourism organizations. It cannot be simply about quantity-it must be about quality...If we are to truly pursue sustainable tourism development, then we must ensure that tourism growth benefits our local stakeholders, manages capacities in our destinations, and offer experiences that have a deeper engagement between tourists and our communities, for them to value our assets and our destinations, Secretary Frasco emphasized.</p><p>Among the distinguished officials and resource speakers present at the forum were H.E.

The first is green finance.</p><p>Vietnam is one of the few industrialised countries with the potential to meet all its national energy needs from renewable sources. To achieve this ambitious goal Vietnam will need to significant increase in investment in green infrastructure and expand its deployment of green finance.</p><p>The second strength, according to Lottner, is digital financial services. In Vietnam, one in three people owns digital assets or cryptocurrencies. Vietnam has vast potential to develop digital financial products, including real digital assets, asset tokenisation and digital currencies. Businesses are increasingly adopting these technologies, and their practical needs will drive innovation in the digital finance sector.</p><p>The third area is trade finance. Lottner stated that this is a rapidly growing field that could be entirely reimagined through technology. Vietnam is poised to become a smart manufacturing hub, with significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) from major FDI corporations like Foxconn.</p><p>\"We can easily envision a world where every product, such as an iPad, can be tracked from the assembly line to delivery using blockchain technology.

These enhancements would require increased investment in building internal capabilities aligned with international standards, a strategy that Techcombank has embarked on over the last three to four years.</p><p>Lottner also noted that the formation of an IFC in Vietnam could enable domestic banks and businesses to secure foreign syndicated loans locally, instead of abroad. This would open doors for domestic banks to mobilise large resources of capital to fund business operations and growth, he added.</p><p>The CEO also highlighted opportunities to apply blockchain in unified financial management, as Techcom Securities, Techcombank's brokerage subsidiary, is already doing. The use of the latest technologies, like blockchain, would serve to enhance the operation of a new IFC.</p><p>Lottner added that TCBS is pursuing a 'Wealthtech' strategy, pioneering the use of blockchain and smart contracts in bond issuance, transaction management and corporate bond ownership for Vietnamese clients. These efforts will contribute to shaping IFC products and services.</p><p>The CEO's contributions to the national IFC strategy reaffirm Techcombank's leading position in the banking sector and its firm commitment to being partner to Vietnam's sustainable development and to supporting its new 'era of rising'. - VNS</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["The first is green finance.

But higher economic output doesn't guarantee shared benefits or sustainable growth.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To paint a fuller picture, UN Trade and Development's (UNCTAD) Inclusive Growth Index combines GDP with other data on living conditions, equality and environmental sustainability.

It draws on 10 indicators covering income, poverty, education, employment and political representation.</p><p>Developed economies generate twice as much waste per capita</p><p>The index highlights the urgent need to break the link between economic growth and resource consumption and waste. Developed economies generate about twice as much waste per capita as developing ones.</p><p>For example, Luxembourg, a top economic performer, produces an estimated 760 kilograms of municipal solid waste per person each year - over 2 kilograms a day. In contrast, the Lao People's Democratic Republic, a least developed country, generates just 50 kilograms per person annually, or about 0.15 kilograms per day - the weight of an apple.</p><p>This means the average person in Luxembourg produces over 15 times more waste than someone in Lao PDR. In general, least developed countries and small island developing states have the lowest per capita waste rates.</p><p>While economic growth and urban density generally lead to more waste, Japan and the Republic of Korea (South Korea) show that effective management is possible.</p><p>Environmental sustainability varies widely across regions</p><p>Developed economies lead in sustainability, thanks to stronger policies and better infrastructure.

The three organisations are also working closely with NatureScot, Natural Resources Wales and Northern Ireland Environment Agency to take the initiative UK-wide.</p><p>Local authorities and their partners, including community and other civic organisations, are invited to apply for capacity-building grants as part of the initiative. From early next year there will also be the opportunity to join a peer network to share learning and practical solutions and take advantage of schemes to attract new investment.</p><p>Nature Towns &amp; Cities builds on the legacy of the Future Parks Accelerator, a previous partnership between The National Lottery Heritage Fund and the National Trust, as well as closely aligning with Natural England's Green Infrastructure Framework and standards. It will also help local authorities to develop and implement Local Nature Recovery Strategies, identifying the best opportunities to recover nature in their urban areas.</p><p>From 1 October, local authorities and their community partners will be able to apply forgrants of between \\xA3250k to \\xA31million, with The National Lottery Heritage Fund making \\xA315m in funding available UK-wide. Grants have been designed to provide organisations with capacity and headspace to think and plan their urban green space for the long term. Grants will help to develop partnerships, leadership and capability and build the foundations for change, help to attract new income and investment for delivery and sustainability.</p><p>From early 2025, organisations will also be able to connect to a UK-wide network of peers working on similar challenges, sharing answers and expertise to tap into best practice, and unlock the benefits of green spaces and nature for residents and communities. The network will serve local government, community organisations, charities and professionals across the UK, with access to a programme of events and training, a library of resources and tailored support.</p><p>Linda Anglin, Edinburgh City Council, said:</p><p>Rethinking our parks, green spaces and the ways they connect across the city has been transformational in Edinburgh over the last 5 years. We were part of the Future Parks Accelerator programme, a precursor to this Nature Towns and Cities initiative, which helped us find new ways of maximising nature's contribution to the wellbeing of our communities. We are now pioneers of Scotland's first Nature Network. With over 200 actions identified to manage, restore and enhance the urban landscape in Edinburgh, we've seen tangible changes on the ground which are making a difference for both people and nature.</p><p>Eilish McGuinness, Chief Executive, The National Lottery Heritage Fund, says:</p><p>We are delighted to be part of this partnership initiative to ensure nature is championed across our urban environments and across the UK. It fits with our ambitions to increase our support for strategic projects that help habitats and species thrive, reducing and mitigating the impacts of climate change, while helping people and communities connect to our unique natural heritage and supports our vision for heritage to be valued, cared for and sustained for everyone, now and in the future.</p><p>Hilary McGrady, Director-General of the National Trust said:</p><p>There is overwhelming evidence that access to green space improves our mental and physical health and wellbeing. Yet in England well over 40 million people don't have access to green space close to home. Councils are uniquely placed to tackle this, working with their communities and local partners. We understand the difficulties caused by long term cuts to budgets and capacity, and we hope this initiative gives them the inspiration and support they need to improve everyday access to nature and the outdoors for all.</p><p>We have seen from our work over the last decade what amazing results can be achieved by Councils working with their communities and civic partners to bring nature into neighbourhoods and across their towns and cities. We know many other places have similar ambitions to enhance the lives of their residents, bringing hope and aspiration for their futures and we want to help make these a reality.</p><p>Marian Spain, Chief Executive, Natural England said:</p><p>Everybody should be able to connect with nature in their neighbourhood, and that includes people living in urban areas. Improved access to green spaces at the heart of our towns and cities creates healthier and better places to live which are resilient to climate change, and it provides huge support for people's mental and physical wellbeing.</p><p>Nature Towns and Cities will offer local authorities and community groups the resources and expertise that they need to bring people closer to the natural environment and give them more opportunities to enjoy the great outdoors.</p><p>For further details on Nature Towns &amp; Cities, please visit naturetownsandcities.org.uk.
