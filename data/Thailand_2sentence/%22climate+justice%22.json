I see your invitation as a tribute to UN staff working around the world for human rights and for justice. And I see it as a reflection of our shared, fundamental conviction in the equal dignity and worth of every person - a founding principle of both our organizations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One morning in the early 60s, a British lawyer opened his newspaper on his way to work. It reported that the dictatorship then ruling my country - Portugal - had imprisoned two students. Their crime: raising a toast to freedom. The barrister - Peter Benenson - was so outraged by their plight that he launched a global movement. And Amnesty International was founded.</p><p>And ever since, you have been at the forefront of the global struggle for human rights - fearless, principled and relentless: Campaigning to free prisoners of conscience around the world. Contributing to the establishment of a number of international institutions and the conclusion of a number of treaties - including the Convention Against Torture. Defending the full spectrum of human rights - civil, political, social, economic and cultural. Winning landmark victories for justice - and earning the Nobel Peace Prize along the way.</p><p>The work of Amnesty International reflects truths I lived under dictatorship: that morality demands the courage to stand against oppression; that solidarity and justice are both personal and global; and that the fight for freedom on one continent can reverberate across the globe. I saw this first-hand - when liberation struggles in Africa helped end Portugal's authoritarian rule.</p><p>Today, all these truths are more important than ever. Because powerful forces are ranged against human rights - and against the international system built to protect and uphold them. We see attacks on the International Criminal Court. Attacks on the international human rights system and its representatives. And flagrant violations of international law: from the horrors in Sudan and beyond to Russia's invasion in Ukraine where we need a just and lasting peace based on the UN Charter, international law and UN resolutions. And, of course, the relentless Israeli onslaught on Gaza.</p><p>I commend Amnesty International for your strong voices. From the beginning, I have repeatedly condemned the horrific 7 October terror attacks by Hamas. But nothing can justify the explosion of death and destruction since. The scale and scope is beyond anything we have seen in recent times.</p><p>I cannot explain the level of indifference and inaction we see by too many in the international community. The lack of compassion. The lack of truth. The lack of humanity. Our own heroic staff continue to serve in unimaginable conditions. Many are so numb and depleted that they say they feel neither dead nor alive. Children speaking of wanting to go to heaven, because at least, they say, there is food there.</p><p>We hold video calls with our own humanitarians who are starving before our eyes. This is not just a humanitarian crisis. It is a moral crisis that challenges the global conscience. We will continue to speak out at every opportunity. But words don't feed hungry children.</p><p>The United Nations stands ready to make the most of a possible ceasefire to dramatically scale up humanitarian operations across the Gaza Strip, as we successfully did during the previous pause in fighting. Our plans are ready, and they are finalized. We know what works - and we know what does not.</p><p>Since 27 May, the United Nations has recorded over 1,000 Palestinians killed trying to access food. Let me repeat: 1,000 people - killed not in combat, but in desperation - while the entire population starves.</p><p>We need action. An immediate and permanent ceasefire. The immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. Immediate and unimpeded humanitarian access. At the same time, we need urgent, concrete and irreversible steps towards a two-State solution.</p><p>We are in a global battle for human dignity. For human rights. For justice. For the multilateral system itself. Amnesty International is indispensable in that fight.</p><p>So, my central message to you today is this: the world needs you more than ever. We need your courage, your creativity, and your clarity. We need your movements - rooted in communities and rising from the ground up - making it clear that leaders cannot turn a blind eye to their obligations.</p><p>And, yes, we need what you've called troublemaking. The kind that challenges complacency and inaction. That exposes injustice. That drives lasting change. Because as I scan the global landscape, I see too many leaders who view human rights as the problem.</p><p>But we know human rights are the solution. They are the foundation of peace. They are the engine of progress. And they are the path out of conflict and chaos to security and hope. You know better than anyone: this work is never easy. And the struggle is always hardest when it matters most - when the urgency is greatest and the stakes are highest.</p><p>But I want to assure you: you are not alone. Human rights are - and will remain - a central pillar of the United Nations. Despite financial challenges, we are determined to reinforce human rights for the twenty-first century. The UN80 initiative, grounded in the UN Charter and international law, is aimed at strengthening our core work across peace, human rights and development. And our Call to Action for Human Rights is mobilizing every part of the UN system.</p><p>In the face of crisis, we must stand together - and act together. Let me turn to your focus for this year's Global Assembly: confronting the rise of authoritarian practices - and advancing climate justice.</p><p>First - authoritarianism. Around the world, we are witnessing a surge in repressive tactics aiming at corroding respect for human rights. And these are contaminating some democracies. This is not a series of isolated events. It is a global contagion. Political opposition crushed. Accountability dismantled. Equality and non-discrimination trampled. The rule of law cast aside.</p><p>On the other hand, civil society - the lifeblood of any free nation - is suffocated. We see activists and journalists silenced - even murdered. Minorities scapegoated. Women and girls stripped of their most basic rights - most brutally in Afghanistan. And all of this is amplified by digital technology.</p><p>We must right these wrongs. Many countries we must recognize stand firm with human rights. And we must push all countries to defend them - consistently, and universally, even - or especially - when inconvenient. We must urge them to protect and strengthen the international human rights system. We must demand accountability for human rights violations - without fear or favour. And insist that countries honour commitments in the Pact of the Future - to protect civic space and uphold human rights and gender equality.</p><p>We must also demand action to confront the flood of lies and hate polluting our digital spaces. Social media manipulation has become a powerful weapon in the authoritarian playbook. Many algorithms are boosting the worst of humanity - rewarding falsehoods, fuelling racism and misogyny and deepening division.</p><p>Last year, countries took steps to tackle these issues. They adopted in the UN General Assembly the Global Digital Compact - committing to apply human rights to cyberspace - and to protect information integrity. Now we must hold them to it.</p><p>And we must go further - to rebuild trust in the international system by grounding it in justice, inclusion and results. That means reforming the United Nations Security Council. It is a scandal that Africa still has no permanent seat at the table. It means delivering on the 2030 Sustainable Development Agenda.</p><p>And it means transforming the international financial system - with debt relief, a surge in development finance, and a stronger voice and greater participation for developing countries in international financial institutions. I applaud your work on such issues, including through the 2048 Commission - helping to shape a fairer, more inclusive global order.</p><p>The second focus of this Global Assembly is one of the defining struggles of our time: securing climate justice. The climate crisis is not just an environmental emergency. It is a human rights catastrophe. We must confront and correct the deep injustices it has laid bare: The poor, the vulnerable and the marginalized - suffering most from a crisis they did nothing to create.</p><p>Environmental defenders - arrested, threatened, and even killed for protecting communities and ecosystems. Land and livelihoods - plundered in the race for minerals critical to clean energy. And climate finance - still wholly inadequate as fossil fuels are propped up by subsidies as others pay the price. All while their political enablers stall and sabotage action.</p><p>But we have seen what people power can achieve: from Amnesty's role in promoting international recognition of the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment to legal victories that have led courts to clarify States' obligations on climate.</p><p>Just two days ago, the International Court of Justice issued a historic advisory opinion. It made clear that States are obliged to protect the global climate system, that climate change is a human rights issue. And that the goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius must guide climate policies, in accordance with the Paris Agreement. We have young Pacific Islanders to thank for this landmark victory.</p><p>And all of us must build on these hard-won gains - by insisting on legal accountability and demanding climate justice. That means the biggest economies and emitters leading an urgent global reduction in emissions, and a just transition away from fossil fuels.</p><p>New national climate action plans - or NDCs - must align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. They must respect human rights. And they must be shaped in partnership with those most affected - especially marginalized groups.</p><p>We also need action on critical minerals - to protect the rights of Indigenous Peoples and front-line communities. We cannot accept a clean energy future built on dirty practices with enormous violations of human rights and many times of human rights of children. Our United Nations Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals has laid out a path - placing human rights at the core of the critical mineral value chains. We are working with partners to deliver.</p><p>And we need finance - real finance - for developing countries to cut emissions, adapt to climate shocks, and recover from loss and damage. We must push governments to provide funds they have pledged. And explore new sources of finance - including putting an effective price on carbon and establishing solidarity levies on polluting sectors and industries.</p><p>As a young man living under dictatorship in Portugal I learned - as Amnesty's founders knew - that standing up for freedom is standing on the right side of history.</p><p>And today, I am more certain than ever: When you stand for human rights, you stand with what is right. That is your history. When Amnesty was founded in the 60s the fight for a fairer world was raging: for civil rights; for women's rights; for liberation from colonial rule.</p><p>These causes once seemed a distant dream. So did Portuguese democracy. I can assure you that your courage continues to change lives. Your persistence is shifting the course of history. Let's keep going. Let's keep fighting. Let's meet this moment with the urgency it demands.

In winter, he takes tourists up to the icy heights of the Peruvian Andes.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Now the farmer from the mountain village of Huaraz is in the global spotlight. On the other side of the world, in the northwestern German city of Hamm, a trial between Lliuya and the German energy company RWE is taking place at the higher regional court.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"I'm a bit excited, but also worried,\" Lliuya told DW. It is the third time that he has traveled from Peru to Germany for the climate lawsuit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nine years ago, with the help of non-governmental organizations, he sued the energy company, and made legal history.</p><p>He claimed climate change was threatening his house with flooding from an overflowing glacial lake above the village. Lliuya accused RWE, a major greenhouse gas polluter, of significantly increasing this danger through its climate-damaging emissions. He argued that the company should take responsibility and bear some of the costs for the protection of his house and village.</p><p>RWE rejects responsibility</p><p>During the hearing in the coming days, it will be decided whether Lliyua's house is really in danger of being flooded and if so, to what extent RWE can be held responsible.</p><p>Lliuya's first lawsuit against the company in a German court was rejected in 2015, but two years later the higher regional court granted an appeal.</p><p>\"I feel a great responsibility,\" says Lliuya. For him, the case is about fighting climate change and the melting of glaciers and \"holding those who have caused the damage to account.\"</p><p>\"If there were such a claim under German law, every car driver could also be held liable. We consider this to be legally inadmissible and the wrong approach from a socio-political point of view,\" RWE said in a statement to DW.</p><p>The multinational, which is headquartered in the German city of Essen, points out that it has always complied with national legal regulations. The company is not active in Peru.</p><p>Flooding could affect thousands</p><p>Lliuya's house and the Andean community of Huaraz are in a valley below a glacial lake which is steadily rising due to melting ice. An international study by scientists from Switzerland and the USA, found the lake's water levels have increased 34-fold between 1990 and 2010 alone.</p><p>According to the plaintiffs, higher temperatures and the melting of the permafrost also increase the risk of chunks of ice or rock falling from the rock face, which is 2,000-meters (6,560 feet) high, into the lake. They say flooding caused by this could have dramatic consequences for Lliuya's home and around 50,000 people in the local community.</p><p>In 1941, an avalanche caused a devastating flood in Huaraz that killed around 1,800 people.</p><p>Only recently, an avalanche of debris filled the lake to the brim, says Lliuya.</p><p>A 2021 study published in the British journal Nature concluded that the melting glacier near Huaraz cannot be explained without climate change. The glacier ice has been continuously receding for more than 36 years.</p><p>How much responsibility should big polluters take?</p><p>This case is basically about the polluter pays principle, says lawyer Roda Verheyen, who is representing Lliuya. \"There is someone who does something - it may be permitted, it may be prohibited - but it leads to really unbelievably large and unacceptable consequences, in this case climate change.\"</p><p>According to a 2014 study by Greenpeace and the environmental law non-profit Climate Justice Program, RWE is responsible for a total of 0.47% of climate-damaging emissions since the beginning of industrialization.</p><p>Lliuya is, therefore, calling for the company to contribute a corresponding share to the financing of protective measures. These include drainage systems that allow meltwater to run off the glacier lagoon and an enlargement of the dam. Verheyen says Lliuya is not interested in receiving money himself, but wants RWE to pay a share of the costs of the protective measures.</p><p>Simulations from 2016 showed that a lower water level could significantly reduce the risk to the community, even in the event of significant rockfall or avalanches.</p><p>Although RWE recognizes it is one of the largest CO2 emitters in Europe, it also says that it has always adhered to the legal limits for emissions. \"In addition, since 2005, the plants have been subject to the European Emissions Trading Scheme, which was introduced at the time and under which we have to pay for every ton of CO2,\" the company added in its statement.</p><p>In 2023, the court had an expert opinion drawn up during an on-site inspection in Peru to check whether Lluiya's house would be affected by heavy flooding.</p><p>Why is a climate case from Peru taking place in Germany?</p><p>For the lawsuit, the plaintiffs have made use of a neighborhood clause which can, for example, oblige highway operators to build noise protection because nearby residents are disturbed.</p><p>\"We have a source of danger here that could potentially kill thousands of people, and we have no hazard prevention and no risk prevention, and that's what it's all about and what it is all about in the Andes,\" Verheyen told DW.</p><p>In the RWE case, the court ruled in an earlier hearing that the transboundary effects of climate change lead to a kind of global neighborhood relationship, even if the damage occurs thousands of kilometers away from the polluter.</p><p>RWE is just one of many polluters \"but you have to start somewhere,\" Verheyen said.</p><p>\"If the court upholds the claim, this will send a clear signal to other major emitters,\" said Petra Minnerop, professor of international law at Durham University, adding that though it is being heard in Germany, the case could set a serious international precedent.</p><p>The energy company RWE is of the opinion that it is not legally possible to attribute the effects of climate change to a single emitter.</p><p>Growing international climate lawsuits</p><p>Since the initial proceedings began in 2015, cross-border climate lawsuits have also been filed in other countries.</p><p>In the Netherlands, the oil and gas company Shell was in court until recently.Non-governmental organizations claimed the right to \"protection from climate change\" but were ultimately unsuccessful in their demands that the company rapidly halve its emissions.</p><p>In France, the fossil fuel giant TotalEnergies was sued in a case demanding it align business practices with the Paris Climate Agreement.</p><p>According to Minnerop, negotiating questions of responsibility for climate risks exclusively at a national level is not enough in the long term.</p><p>\"Climate justice can only be achieved if we see it as a serious task within the framework of international law and pursue it with the priority that results from the scientific evidence,\" she said.</p><p>If he loses, Lluiya fears that he and his village will end up without protection from flooding.

The retraction of multilateralism reflects not just weakened institutions and geopolitical tensions but also a loss of shared principles for international cooperation and a shift toward unilateralism, transactional diplomacy, and zero-sum nationalism.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Far-right political forces have accelerated this erosion by turning ideals like gender equality, climate justice, and indigenous rights into objects of ridicule. Such culture-war rhetoric is undermining the ethical foundations of both democracy and global cooperation, with the populist backlash against solidarity and shared responsibility crossing into the international arena. As nationalism displaces multilateralism, international cooperation is losing its moral direction.</p><p>In addition, as Hannah Arendt warned, the absence of shared values erodes the human capacity for judgment and opens the door to authoritarianism. Trust collapses, cooperation becomes purely transactional, and instability becomes the norm. International governance becomes brittle; diplomacy becomes coercive. Perceived injustice and ineffectiveness fuel resentment and resistance. A world order driven solely by geopolitics and expanding notions of national security inevitably breeds short-termism, deepens divisions, and heightens the chance of major conflict. No single actor, however powerful, is insulated from these risks.</p><p>But rebuilding global economic governance cannot mean simply restoring the past. While the postwar order did embed common ideals like human dignity and solidarity in its foundation documents (starting with the United Nations Charter), it also reflected -- and fuelled -- the power imbalances of its time. Any new system must be grounded in care, solidarity, sovereign equality, and ecological stewardship, which also means updating earlier frameworks to meet current needs and ensuring broader representation.</p><p>Establishing a new values-based system is not utopian; it is strategically necessary. Institutions that are perceived as fair are more resilient and more likely to command broad-based compliance, which is crucial when our biggest challenges require globally coordinated action.</p><p>Moreover, reputational capital matters more than ever. In a multipolar world, influence depends on legitimacy. Achieving inclusive prosperity, social cohesion, and adequate provision of public goods (whether global, regional, national, or local) is essential for long-term well-being and resilience. Combatting hunger, poverty, and inequality is not charity; it is sound strategy.</p><p>Equity, access to finance, and the distribution of green technology will be central concerns as countries seek to transform their economies to meet climate goals. In the absence of global norms to guide industrial policy in a sustainable direction, these transitions risk reproducing old hierarchies and dependencies. Reform of the international trade system -- which is currently deeply regressive, with net flows from the Global South to the North -- is about delivering a green transition that avoids the pitfalls of a world order shaped by and for the benefit of the few.</p><p>History offers lessons here. The Bretton Woods institutions and early trade frameworks emerged from the catastrophe of World War II, when leaders recognised the need for cooperation anchored in values, even if their efforts were uneven. The Havana Charter of 1948 went so far as to call for full employment and labour rights (it was stillborn because the US never ratified it).</p><p>But the neoliberal turn of the 1980s brought austerity, deregulation, and the rise of structural adjustment policies, which curtailed many countries' development, deepened inequality, and sidelined labour rights and ecological considerations. The creation of the World Trade Organization in 1995 reflected this shift: while it promised fairness and predictability, it put liberalisation and enforcement first. The resulting popular backlash -- from the Seattle protests in 1999 to ongoing criticism of trade rules on agriculture and intellectual property -- revealed how disconnected the system had become from social and ecological priorities.</p><p>Despite these failures, foundational values have endured as moral benchmarks. Reformers, civil-society movements, and many leaders continue to invoke them as guideposts for an alternative global order characterised by democratised decision-making, sustainable development, and climate justice. These are not abstract ideals. They are tools for building a more effective system.</p><p>Discussions about values are insufficient. To ensure that the global architecture reflects and reinforces shared norms, rather than undermining them, outcomes must be methodically implemented by institutions.</p><p>To move forward, values must be paired with accountability mechanisms. That means improving institutional oversight, facilitating greater civil-society participation, and creating tools to measure progress in terms not only of GDP, but also of equity and well-being. Discussions about such principles must be embedded in real-world forums: the G20, which convenes major economies from both the Global South and North; the Brics+ grouping of major emerging economies; the UN's Financing for Development process, including the upcoming summit in Seville; and the UN Climate Change Conference, starting with COP30 in Bel\u00e9m. And it must be central to any discussion of reforming the UN system, including via charter review.</p><p>Fragmentation, inequality, and dysfunction are not inevitable. They reflect choices. The alternative to a failing order is not retreat into nationalism or technocracy, but rather bold re-commitment by states, civil society, and the private sector to the values that can guide us through complexity toward a more humane, sustainable, and resilient economic order.</p>", "publisher": "The Bangkok Post (Thailand)", "instances": ["Even before US President Donald Trump launched his assault on the global economy, it was facing not only a structural crisis but a collapse in the values that once justified and guided international cooperation.

I am particularly grateful to the resident coordinators that joined us here in Addis and will now go back to work with renewed impetus to make food systems transformation a reality.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The energy and vitality of this movement continues to inspire. This gathering has reminded us of the value of coming together as a global community to benefit from the perspectives and experiences of others and to shape new, bold action for the future.</p><p>At the UNFood Systems Summit (UNFSS) in 2021, in the midst of a global pandemic, we embarked on a journey to grow and catalyse energy behind an emerging movement for the transformation of our food systems to achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Too often food systems are seen as part of our challenges, when they can be one of the greatest solutions to deliver for people, planet, peace and prosperity.</p><p>Two years ago, still grappling with the socioeconomic impacts of the pandemic, facing planetary crises and the effects of new conflicts, the Call to Action from the First Stocktake of the UNFood Systems Summit (UNFSS+2) in Rome appealed for inclusivity to strengthen our efforts to drive more targeted investment and mutual accountability.</p><p>Since then, Governments have continued to shift how they govern and shape policy for food systems. A total of 130 countries have articulated integrated, multisectoral National Pathways for Food Systems Transformation and here again; I want to acknowledge the incredible contribution of Sir David Nabarro.</p><p>In 168 countries, nationally determined contributions are now reflecting the critical role of food and agriculture in reducing greenhouse gas emissions as we seek to adapt and transform.</p><p>More than 170 countries are implementing school meal programmes that support child nutrition, often connecting with local producers and contributing to regenerative production practices.

We have heard powerful stories of progress and rising ambition since 2021 from a diverse ecosystem of partners, who are reforming policies, championing local innovation and digitalization, mobilizing investments and partnerships and empowering women and youth.</p><p>And when it comes to our young people, there is increased understanding that ensuring youth-inclusive and youth-led food systems transformation is important both for enhancing youth welfare and building sustainable and resilient food systems.</p><p>The food systems movement has taken root in global and regional agreements - from the Twenty-Eighth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28) Declaration to initiatives emerging from the Group of Seven (G7) and Group of Twenty (G20) to regional agreements, such as the Kampala Declaration earlier this year.</p><p>These are powerful commitments to transform food systems for people and the planet that you have helped inspire.

Climate shocks, conflict, debt and inequality are widening the cracks in our systems.</p><p>It is estimated that between 638 and 720 million people - a bit less than 1 in 10 people in the world - faced hunger in 2024. 2.6 billion people are still unable to afford a healthy diet. Only about one third of children aged 6 to 23 months and two thirds of women aged 15 to 49 years achieved minimum dietary diversity globally.</p><p>People's access to food in conflict zones is highly constrained and - in some instances - attempts to access humanitarian relief has led to injury and death. Whole communities experience man-made food insecurity and malnutrition, with extreme long-term consequences for their children.</p><p>Farmers everywhere are facing unprecedented adverse climate impacts, threatening livelihoods and food security. Developing economies are still coping with impacts of inflation, severe fiscal constraints, debt challenges and the high cost of capital. Looking ahead, 512 million people are still projected to be facing hunger in 2030, of whom nearly 60 per cent will be in Africa.</p><p>As we consider the pathway to 2030, peace and respect for human rights must anchor our ambition. Every person in our world - rich or poor, young or old - has the right to food that is accessible, affordable, safe and nutritious. Present and future generations are depending on our choices. Only through inclusive dialogue and genuine partnerships can countries and communities ensure faster and more effective progress.</p><p>As we leave this Stocktake and take what we achieved here in Addis back home and to other milestones, clear points of emphasis have been identified:</p><p>First, we must act urgently to summon the funding, innovations and global solidarity to build the food-secure and climate-resilient future that every person, everywhere, needs and deserves. The dramatic reduction in life-saving humanitarian funding to respond to these needs must be immediately reversed and safe access to life-saving humanitarian support granted.</p><p>Second, is to deepen the implementation of National Pathways for Food Systems Transformation. The effective and meaningful participation of all relevant stakeholders is a priority, with particular attention to involving family farmers, front-line food workers, women, youth, Indigenous Peoples and local communities.</p><p>Third, we must unlock finance and investment. That means mobilizing domestic resources and investments at scale for all dimensions of food systems transformation. It also means scaling up finance and investment by multilateral development banks, international financial institutions, and public development banks behind country priorities.</p><p>And we have work to do to scale up private sector investment in agriculture and food systems. This should include the small and medium-sized enterprises that serve as a backbone of our food systems interfacing with millions of food producers and consumers.</p><p>Fourth, we must continue the drive for an integrated approach. We need to simultaneously pursue policy measures that focus on equity and resilience through linking environmental, economic and social dimensions of food systems. Policies should be rooted in local culture, communities and traditional knowledge to help guide approaches that can accelerate transformation and enhance self-reliance.</p><p>Fifth, we must continue to leverage science, technology and knowledge. Science and innovation are prerequisites for food systems transformation and can support alignment of health, agriculture, climate, biodiversity and economic objectives and policies. Strong science-policy-society interfaces are essential and must appreciate traditional knowledge.</p><p>New technologies, such as artificial intelligence, are changing our economies and our societies. The road ahead demands we leverage the appropriate and responsible use of technology to ensure prosperity for all in a healthy and liveable planet. The digital public infrastructure needs more investment to ensure the connectivity of our rural communities.</p><p>And, finally, we must connect with our future. I agree with our young people - they are not merely future beneficiaries of food systems change, they are active co-leaders in transformation. Policies should enhance opportunities for young people to create, innovate and thrive.</p><p>On the road to 2030, there will be important milestones that the outcomes of UNFSS+4 will inform and in which this movement will engage. These include the World Social Summit, United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) COP30, UN Convention on Biological Diversity COP17 and the 2027 SDG Summit.</p><p>UNFSS+4 has reinforced the value of a dedicated space to foster collaboration, deepen systems approaches and encourage the emergence of food systems whose purposes are at the heart of the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>The UNFood Systems Coordination Hub will continue to advance progress at country level, through our resident coordinators and country teams, accompanying National Convenors and collaborating with other partners. Our movement has shown what is possible when we work together in deliberate ways across sectors, stakeholders and countries with a shared purpose.</p><p>I call on Governments and people everywhere to build on what has been accomplished and continue to work together for peace and to realize the vision of the 2030 Agenda.

The rising global temperatures are triggering more frequent and severe weather events, from prolonged droughts to intense flooding. Thailand, with its low-lying coastal areas and reliance on agriculture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. To safeguard its future, the country must prioritize sustainable practices, invest in resilient infrastructure, and foster community awareness about climate adaptation. Failure to act swiftly could lead to devastating impacts on livelihoods, ecosystems, and the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Arctic is melting, seas are rising, and extreme weather is reshaping the planet. If we don't act to protect ourselves in time, we'll face catastrophic consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are entering an entirely new world where once unimaginable things are becoming a reality. Take Japan's Mount Fuji. For the first time in 130 years, its summit was snow-free in October, a stark symbol of global warming. What ensues, however, is not only environmental but also economic and political challenges.</p><p>Around the world, permafrost is melting in Siberia, revealing ancient mammoth tusks with new ivory businesses. Greenland's melting ice and new mining opportunities are fuelling aspirations for political independence. The new Arctic shipping routes have also stirred geopolitical tensions over control.</p><p>Closer to home, Indonesia is planning to move its capital from sinking Jakarta, and the Pacific islands are struggling to survive rising seas.</p><p>Thailand, too, faces this inevitable future.</p><p>Ahead is a new world fraught with risks. Rising temperatures threaten agriculture, food security, health, and the economy. Farm production will plunge. Biodiversity will shrink from widespread species extinction.</p><p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), half the world will face extreme heat lasting more than 20 days at a 2\u00b0C temperature rise. At 3\u00b0C, this figure jumps to 74%. At 3\u00b0C, droughts may last more than 10 months a year. The melting permafrost in Siberia could release lethal methane, intensifying global heat and natural disasters. Beyond 3\u00b0C, the damage would be catastrophic, triggering global tipping points.</p><p>Thailand is highly vulnerable to rising seas, severe floods, prolonged droughts, and heatwaves. Extreme heat \u2014 days over 35\u00b0C will become common, and 40\u00b0C heatwaves could be regular.</p><p>High temperatures aren't just uncomfortable; they are deadly, particularly for outdoor workers in agriculture, construction, and delivery services who need to cut work hours. As economic hardship spreads, crime could rise, and birth rates could fall.</p><p>Natural disasters will intensify. The 2011 floods in central Thailand were one of the worst disasters, and this year's deadly floods in the North remind us of the ongoing threat.</p><p>Key to survival is timely climate change adaptation to protect the populace, particularly vulnerable groups who will be most affected by climate disasters.</p><p>Despite contributing less than 1% of global greenhouse gases, Thailand ranks 9th in the Climate Risk Index. Over the past 20 years, the country has experienced 146 extreme weather events, causing damages of approximately US$7.7 billion per year.</p><p>Coastal flooding poses a critical threat. Within 30 years, parts of Bangkok and the Central Plains close to the Gulf of Thailand could be underwater. It is already happening. In Samut Prakan, the Khun Samut Chin Temple, once inland, now sits on an island due to coastal erosion. Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian district shows utility poles standing in the water as the land sinks.</p><p>A study supported by the TDRI also suggests that areas like Phetchaburi could experience 487mm of rainfall over five consecutive days \u2014 truly catastrophic.</p><p>Droughts, too, are intensifying, threatening tourism, the country's cash cow. Certain areas, such as Mae Hong Son, could experience over 100 rain-free days a year, leading to extreme heat and water scarcity. The result? Dangerous heatwaves and dwindling water supplies.</p><p>Thailand already endures 50 days a year with temperatures over 35\u00b0C. That number is rising. Health issues will worsen, and productivity losses could drag down GDP.</p><p>So, what can Thailand do? There are three main strategies: prevention, preparation, and recovery.</p><p>Prevention and Risk Reduction: We must develop drought-resistant crops, update farming practices, and adapt our infrastructure to withstand storms and floods. Sustainable land use, especially in coastal areas, is vital. Building flood barriers with comprehensive feasibility studies and community input, as well as using mangroves to protect coastlines, are important steps. In some cases, relocation may be the only viable option.</p><p>Preparation and Response: Early warning systems and reliable weather forecasts are essential. For instance, the recent floods in the North caused unnecessary damage due to poor warnings. We need to support communities with relocation and essential recovery services where needed.</p><p>Recovery and Resilience: Post-disaster recovery should focus on resilience. Insurance and social safety nets help communities recover, and infrastructure should prioritise durability over quick fixes.</p><p>We should also avoid \"maladaptation\" \u2014 actions that worsen climate impacts.</p><p>Sea walls, often seen as essential against rising seas, need careful planning. Thailand's proposed sea wall to protect Bangkok must undergo thorough environmental studies, or it could backfire by shifting risks to vulnerable areas.</p><p>True adaptation requires addressing inequality since not everyone can adapt equally. Wealthier groups have more resources, while the poor face the greatest climate risks. Climate justice must be a priority to ensure everyone has the support they need.</p><p>A look abroad offers valuable lessons. The Netherlands has built a seawall system informed by environmental studies and community input. Japan uses \"Digital Twin\" technology to simulate flood scenarios and plan evacuations. Israel is a model for water management in drought conditions, and Singapore invests in green spaces to counteract heat waves.</p><p>To get the most from adaptation investments, measures should reduce losses, boost the economy, and benefits society and the environment. Key steps include establishing an advanced weather forecasting system, building resilient infrastructure, developing drought-resistant crops, protecting mangroves, and improving water management.</p><p>Thailand should levy a carbon tax to create a Green Transition and Adaptation Fund. This fund would support climate adaptation, help vulnerable groups, and improve infrastructure to transition to a low-carbon future. Additionally, the government should use insurance to support those affected by natural disasters instead of relying on one-off handouts.</p><p>To prepare for a hotter world, Thailand must create new jobs that don't rely on outdoor work, shift away from traditional farming, consider using biotech seeds, and start charging for water in agriculture. Planning for sea walls and even relocating cities should be on the agenda.</p><p>One significant challenge is decentralising power so local communities can manage risk effectively. Reforming uncontrolled land use is also necessary, as it exacerbates floods and other natural disasters.</p><p>While Thailand's adaptation plans are steps in the right direction, they still rely on outdated governance models and lack the proper budgeting needed for urgent change. We must take bold action, transforming crises into opportunities for survival through effective adaptation.</p><p>The climate crisis, tough as it is, could push Thailand to make overdue reforms for the common good. This includes decentralising state governance, developing robust climate protection systems, modernising agriculture, building climate-resilient cities, expanding eco-tourism, and creating climate insurance.</p><p>Thailand needs to act decisively.

Swaminathan, the Prime Minister described him as a visionary whose contributions transcend any single era. He added that Professor Swaminathan was a great scientist who transformed science into a medium of public service. Shri Modi highlighted that Professor Swaminathan dedicated his life to ensuring food security for the nation. Noting that Professor Swaminathan awakened a consciousness that will continue to guide India's policies and priorities for centuries to come. He extended his best wishes to all on the occasion of the Swaminathan Birth Centenary Celebrations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Prime Minister acknowledged the occasion of National Handloom Day and highlighted that in the past ten years, the handloom sector has gained new recognition and strength across the country. He extended his greetings to all, especially to those associated with the handloom sector, on National Handloom Day.</p><p>Sharing his association with Dr. M. S. Swaminathan spanned many years, Shri Modi recalled the earlier conditions in Gujarat, where agriculture faced severe challenges due to droughts and cyclones. Noting that during his tenure as Chief Minister, work began on the Soil Health Card initiative, he remembered Professor Swaminathan showing great interest in the initiative, offering open-hearted suggestions that significantly contributed to its success. Shri Modi mentioned visiting Professor Swaminathan's Research Foundation Centre in Tamil Nadu nearly twenty years ago. He stated that in 2017, he had the opportunity to release Professor Swaminathan's book, 'The Quest for a World Without Hunger'. He added that in 2018, during the inauguration of the International Rice Research Institute's Regional Centre in Varanasi, Professor Swaminathan's guidance was invaluable. The Prime Minister remarked that every interaction with Professor Swaminathan was a learning experience. He recalled Professor Swaminathan once saying, Science is not just about discovery, but delivery, and affirmed that he proved this through his work. Shri Modi emphasized that Professor Swaminathan not only conducted research but also inspired farmers to transform agricultural practices. He stated that even today, Professor Swaminathan's approach and ideas are visible throughout India's agriculture sector. Describing him as a true gem of Mother India, Shri Modi expressed his privilege that Professor Swaminathan was conferred the Bharat Ratna during his government's tenure.</p><p>Dr. M. S. Swaminathan led the campaign to make India self-reliant in food production, emphasised the Prime Minister stating that Professor Swaminathan's identity extended beyond the Green Revolution. He highlighted that Professor Swaminathan consistently raised awareness among farmers about the risks of increasing chemical use and monoculture farming. Shri Modi noted that while Professor Swaminathan worked to boost grain production, he was equally concerned about the environment and Mother Earth. To balance both objectives and address emerging challenges, the Prime Minister said that Professor Swaminathan introduced the concept of the Evergreen Revolution. He added that Professor Swaminathan proposed the idea of Bio-Villages to empower rural communities and farmers. The Prime Minister remarked that Professor Swaminathan promoted innovative ideas such as Community Seed Banks and Opportunity Crops.</p><p>Dr. M. S. Swaminathan believed the solutions to climate change and nutritional challenges lie in the very crops that have been forgotten, said the Prime Minister highlighting Professor Swaminathan's focus on drought tolerance and salt tolerance in agriculture. He noted that Professor Swaminathan worked on millets or Shri Anna at a time when they were largely overlooked. Shri Modi recalled that years ago, Professor Swaminathan had suggested transferring the genetic qualities of mangroves into rice, which would help make crops more climate-resilient. He emphasized that today, as climate adaptation becomes a global priority, it is evident how far-sighted Professor Swaminathan's thinking truly was.</p><p>Prime Minister stated that while biodiversity is a topic of global discussion and governments are taking various steps to preserve it, Dr. M. S. Swaminathan went a step further by introducing the idea of biohappiness. He remarked that the gathering today is a celebration of that very idea. Quoting Dr. Swaminathan, who believed that the power of biodiversity could bring transformative change to the lives of local communities, Shri Modi highlighted that through the use of local resources, new livelihood opportunities could be created for people. He noted that true to his nature, Dr. Swaminathan had a unique ability to translate ideas into ground-level action. The Prime Minister emphasized that through his Research Foundation, Dr. Swaminathan consistently worked to ensure that the benefits of new discoveries reached farmers. He stated that small farmers, fisherfolk, and tribal communities greatly benefited from Dr. Swaminathan's efforts.</p><p>Expressing happiness over the launch of the M. S. Swaminathan Award for Food and Peace, instituted to honour the legacy of Professor Swaminathan, the Prime Minister stated that this international award will be conferred upon individuals from developing countries who have made significant contributions in the field of food security. He emphasized that the relationship between food and peace is not only philosophical but also deeply practical. Quoting a verse from the Upanishads, Shri Modi underlined the sanctity of food, asserting that food is life itself, and must never be disrespected or neglected. Warning that any crisis of food inevitably leads to a crisis of life, and when the lives of millions are endangered, global unrest becomes inevitable, Shri Modi underscored the importance of the M. S. Swaminathan Award for Food and Peace in today's world. The Prime Minister congratulated Professor Adenle of Nigeria, the first recipient of the award, describing him as a talented scientist whose work exemplifies the spirit of the honour.</p><p>Witnessing the current heights of Indian agriculture, Dr. M. S. Swaminathan would surely feel proud wherever he may be, stated Shri Modi highlighting that India today ranks first in the production of milk, pulses, and jute. He noted that India is second in the world in the production of rice, wheat, cotton, fruits, and vegetables and added that India is also the world's second-largest fish producer. The Prime Minister shared that last year, India achieved its highest-ever food grain production. He emphasized that India is setting records in oilseeds as well, with soybean, mustard, and groundnut production reaching record levels.</p><p>Welfare of farmers is the nation's highest priority, affirmed the Prime Minister declaring that India will never compromise on the interests of its farmers, livestock rearers, and fisherfolk. He reiterated the government's continuous efforts to increase farmers' income, reduce agricultural expenses, and create new sources of revenue.</p><p>The government has always considered the strength of farmers as the foundation of national progress, affirmed the Prime Minister, stating that the policies formulated in recent years were not merely about assistance, but about instilling confidence among farmers. He highlighted that the PM-Kisan Samman Nidhi has empowered small farmers through direct financial support, while PM Fasal Bima Yojana has provided farmers with protection against agricultural risks and irrigation challenges have been addressed through the PM Krishi Sinchai Yojana. Shri Modi further emphasized that the creation of 10,000 Farmer Producer Organizations (FPOs) has strengthened the collective power of small farmers. He stated that financial support to cooperatives and self-help groups has given fresh momentum to the rural economy. Mentioning the e-NAM platform, Shri Modi said it has made it easier for farmers to sell their produce while the PM Kisan Sampada Yojana has accelerated the development of new food processing units and storage infrastructure. He informed that the recently approved PM Dhan Dhanya Yojana aims to uplift 100 districts where agriculture has lagged behind. By providing facilities and financial assistance in these districts, the government is instilling new confidence in farming, said the PM.</p><p>21st century India is fully committed to becoming a developed nation and this goal will be achieved through the contribution of every section of society and every profession, emphasised Shri Modi. Drawing inspiration from Dr. M. S. Swaminathan, the Prime Minister stated that India's scientists now have another opportunity to create history. He highlighted that the previous generation of scientists ensured food security, stressing that the current focus must shift towards nutritional security. Calling for the large-scale promotion of bio-fortified and nutrition-rich crops to improve public health, Shri Modi advocated for reducing the use of chemicals in agriculture. He urged for greater promotion of natural farming, stating that more urgency and proactive efforts are required in this direction.</p><p>Acknowledging that the challenges posed by climate change are well known, the Prime Minister stressed on the need to develop a greater number of climate-resilient crop varieties. He highlighted the importance of focusing on drought-tolerant, heat-resistant, and flood-adaptive crops. Shri Modi called for increased research on crop rotation and soil-specific suitability and further stressed the need to develop affordable soil testing tools and effective nutrient management techniques.</p><p>Emphasizing the need to intensify efforts towards solar-powered micro-irrigation, the Prime Minister stated that drip systems and precision irrigation must be made more widespread and effective. Posing the question of integrating satellite data, AI, and machine learning into agricultural systems, Shri Modi asked whether a system can be developed that forecasts crop yields, monitors pests, and guides sowing practices and whether such a real-time decision support system can be made accessible in every district. The Prime Minister urged experts to continuously guide agri-tech startups. He noted that a large number of innovative youth are working to solve agricultural challenges and remarked that with guidance from experienced professionals, the products developed by these youth will be more impactful.</p><p>India's farming communities possess a rich repository of traditional knowledge. By combining traditional Indian agricultural practices with modern science, a holistic knowledge base can be created, emphasised the Prime Minister. Underlining that crop diversification is a national priority, Shri Modi stressed the need to inform farmers about its importance. He stated that farmers must be made aware of the benefits of diversification, as well as the consequences of not adopting it. He remarked that experts can play a highly effective role in this effort.</p><p>Recalling his visit to the PUSA campus on 11 August 2024, where he had urged for intensified efforts to take agricultural technology from lab to land, Shri Modi expressed happiness over the launch of the Viksit Krishi Sankalp Abhiyan during the months of May and June 2025. He highlighted that, for the first time, over 2,200 teams of scientists participated across more than 700 districts. Noting that more than 60,000 programmes were conducted, the Prime Minister stated that these efforts directly connected scientists with approximately 1.25 crore farmers. He commended the initiative as a highly commendable effort to expand scientific outreach to farmers.</p><p>Dr. M. S. Swaminathan taught us that agriculture is not just about crops, it is about life, stated Shri Modi emphasizing that farming is the livelihood of people. He highlighted that the dignity of every individual connected to the field, the prosperity of every community, and the protection of nature form the strength of the government's agricultural policy. Stressing the need to connect science and society through a common thread, the Prime Minister stated that the interests of small farmers must be given top priority. He emphasized the importance of empowering women working in the fields. Concluding his address, the Prime Minister affirmed that the nation must move forward with this vision and remarked that the inspiration of Dr. Swaminathan continues to guide all.</p><p>Union Minister, Shri Shivraj Singh Chouhan; Member, Niti Aayog, Dr. Ramesh Chand; Chairperson of M.S.

The advisory opinion reflects the long-standing stance and proposition of developing countries, including China. It is of positive significance to maintaining and advancing international climate cooperation.</p><p>China took an active part in this advisory opinion. As the biggest major developing country, China has been a staunch doer in and important contributor to green development. China is actively and prudently working towards its goals on carbon peak and carbon neutrality. We will will make the world's biggest cut in carbon emission intensity and move from carbon peak to carbon neutrality in the shortest time frame ever seen in history. In the meantime, China's quality and low-cost clean energy technologies and products have significantly cut the costs for global green and low-carbon transition. China has also provided as much assistance as we can to fellow developing countries through the channel of South-South cooperation.</p><p>However the world may change, China will not slow down its climate actions, will not reduce its support for international cooperation, and will not cease its efforts to build a community with a shared future for mankind.

China has released a readout, which you may refer to.</p><p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of China-EU diplomatic relations and the 80th anniversary of the founding of the United Nations. China-EU relations come to another critical historic juncture. Over the past 50 years, China-EU exchanges and cooperation have achieved fruitful results. The important experiences and lessons from them are mutual respect, seeking common ground while shelving differences, open cooperation and mutual benefits. These are also the important principles and direction of efforts for developing China-EU relations in the future. China and the EU both advocate multilateralism and openness and cooperation. The more severe and complex the international landscape becomes, the more necessary it is that China and the EU should strengthen communication, enhance mutual trust and deepen cooperation.</p><p>President Xi Jinping put forward three propositions on the future development of China-EU relations. First, we should uphold mutual respect and consolidate partnership. Second, we should uphold open cooperation and properly handle frictions and differences. Third, we should practice multilateralism and safeguard international rules and order.

Around the world, environmental human rights defenders (EHRDs) are risking their lives and liberty for defending their lands and communities' right to a healthy environment, such as the Warriors for the Amazon in Ecuador.</p><p>The conference is an opportunity to spotlight the situation in COP29 host Azerbaijan, where environmental human rights defender Anar Mammadli and journalist Nargiz Absalamova who reported on environmental issues remain behind bars. Other journalists who reported on the human rights situation including during COP29 were arrested afterwards in apparent reprisals. Brazil, the host of COP30, is one of the most dangerous countries for EHRDs, who face killings, violence, threats and stigmatization for their work.</p><p>The voices, views, knowledge and wisdom of Indigenous Peoples, frontline and fence line communities and human rights defenders must be incorporated into climate policies, plans and action, said Ann Harrison.</p><p>Once again, we have heard reports of limited badges and visa problems for those from the majority world wishing to attend the conference in Bonn. Nor are the COP Host Country Agreements - a key tool that must be strengthened to ensure freedom of expression and peaceful assembly for participants - available publicly as a matter of routine.</p><p>Climate finance must be addressed</p><p>Amnesty International is also calling for states to tackle climate finance. Currently, lower-income countries are paying more in debt repayments than they are receiving as climate finance from high-income countries.</p><p>High income historically high emitting countries are most responsible for climate change, yet continue to shirk their obligations to provide climate finance to lower income countries to cut emissions and to help communities to adapt to climate change, as well as providing reparations for loss and damage, which could ease the burden in countries suffering climate harms.</p><p>Taxing fossil fuel companies, corporate windfall profits and high net worth individuals, as well as ending subsidies and investments in fossil fuels and ending global tax abuses, could raise over USD 3 trillion per year which could go a huge way towards the cost of tackling climate change, said Ann Harrison.</p><p>Huge changes need to be made</p><p>The Bonn Climate Conference is a key preparatory moment for the annual UN Climate Conference, which takes place as COP30 later this year in Brazil - a country that wants to publicly lead a message of global environmental protection. Yet, internally some of its institutions are taking actions contrary to this agenda, including requiring less stringent licensing for environmentally destructive projects and expanding fossil fuel production.</p><p>If climate change is to be taken seriously and to keep global warming below 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels, we need to see concrete progress with clear timelines towards massively scaled-up needs-based climate finance, particularly for adaptation and loss and damage, in the form of grants, not loans, with those most responsible for emissions contributing the most, said Ann Harrison.</p><p>Amnesty International is calling for states commit to a full, fast, fair and funded fossil fuel phase out through just transitions across all sectors, without relying on risky and unproven technologies or offsets that do not lead to genuine emissions reductions. It is also calling for inclusive discussions around climate change, involving the people most affected by it, and ensuring they can meaningfully access these high-level negotiations without discrimination.</p><p>Source: Amnesty International</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["The devastating new human rights harms resulting from climate change will escalate dramatically unless global heating is kept in check.

This is also the African Union's theme for 2025, as it was already said. And it is a call gathering momentum around the world - from Freetown to Bridgetown. Understandably so.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Africa is a continent of boundless energy and possibility. But, for too long, the colossal injustices inflicted by enslavement, the transatlantic slave trade and colonialism have been left unacknowledged and unaddressed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I deeply regret that these wrongs were perpetrated by many countries, including my own. And they continue to distort our world today. Decolonization did not free African countries, or people of African descent, from the structures and prejudices that made those projects possible.</p><p>When African countries gained their independence, they inherited a system built to serve others - not them. The inherited economic model and years of neglect in social and institutional investments during the colonial era created lasting challenges, shaping post-independence reality. Structures based on exploitation persisted. So did racism.</p><p>And the long shadow of colonialism can be felt in many of the continent's current conflicts and governance challenges. Many African countries were under colonial domination when today's multilateral institutions were created. And that injustice is reflected to this day.</p><p>We point to the poisoned legacies of enslavement and colonialism, not to sow divisions, but to heal them. Reparatory justice frameworks are critical - to redress historic wrongs, address today's challenges, and ensure the rights and dignity of all. Such frameworks encompass a broad range of measures.</p><p>We need a comprehensive approach, developed with the participation of affected communities, to achieve accountability and redress. And we must be clear-eyed about the fact that attempts to repair the past ring hollow unless they also seek to dismantle its manifestations in the present: From racism, to extraction of African resources, to the injustices embedded in structures, institutions and global governance.</p><p>Animated by honesty and justice, we can transform the legacies of slavery and colonialism into equal and respectful partnerships: Partnerships that ensure African countries take their rightful place in shaping global decision-making; that help to deliver on the priorities of African and Caribbean countries, and people of African descent; and that help to ensure that all Africans - and the African diaspora - have the opportunity to thrive.</p><p>We must push for the second International Decade for People of African Descent to deliver on reparatory justice, equal rights, and the Durban Declaration - the world's blueprint to tackle racism and racial discrimination.</p><p>Yes, these are turbulent times: Times of trade barriers, deep cuts to life-saving assistance and international cooperation itself called into question. But, that does not alter the truth that justice for Africa, for the Caribbean and for all people of African descent requires global action and global partnerships. We need partnerships to reform global governance.</p><p>The Pact for the Future agreed last year drove progress. I thank African countries sincerely for their support in getting an ambitious text over the line. And we must keep pushing for fair representation within international institutions - including permanent African representation on the United Nations Security Council.</p><p>We need partnerships for peace founded on the principles of justice and international law, as set out in the United Nations Charter. The international community must play its part in preventing and ending conflicts, relieving their appalling effects and ensuring justice for victims. And the United Nations will never relent in pursuing peace for the great continent of Africa.</p><p>We need partnerships to advance sustainable development. The Pact for the Future includes important commitments: To advance a Sustainable Development Goal stimulus, to reform the international financial architecture and to take action on debt, which is suffocating economies and sapping investment in many countries in Africa and the Caribbean.</p><p>The upcoming Financing for Development Conference in Sevilla is an important opportunity to push this agenda forward. We need concrete commitments on debt: to lower the cost of borrowing, improve debt restructuring and prevent crises from taking hold. We will keep pushing to boost the lending capacity of Multilateral Development Banks, making them bigger and bolder, able to mobilize far more private finance at reasonable cost to the African continent and the Caribbean.</p><p>And we need action to unleash a surge in finance across the board. Developed countries must keep their promises on development spending, Governments must strengthen domestic resource mobilization and we must keep working towards an inclusive, effective global tax regime able to meaningfully reduce tax evasion and to fight elicit financial flows and money-laundering that is so dramatically impacting the African continent.</p><p>Finally, we need partnerships for climate justice. African countries did not cause the climate crisis. Yet, the effects of our heating planet are wreaking havoc across the continent: Fuelling hunger and displacement, hobbling economies, destroying livelihoods and taking lives. The Caribbean is also suffering disproportionately.</p><p>Justice is long overdue: We need significant contributions - together with innovative sources of financing - to the new fund for responding to loss and damage. We need a boom in adaptation finance - starting with developed countries honouring their commitment to at least $40 billion a year by this year. And we need massive investments in clean energy.</p><p>Africa is home to 60 per cent of the world's best solar resources and around a third of the minerals critical to the renewable energy revolution. Yet, the continent has just 1.5 per cent of global installed solar capacity. Around 600 million people remain without power. And African countries and communities are pushed to the bottom of the critical minerals value chain, while others feast on their resources.</p><p>The centuries-old exploitation of the continent's natural resources - which fuels conflict and misery - must end. We need action for Africa to take its rightful place as the clean powerhouse of the world, to derisk and boost investment, and to ensure African countries and communities receive maximum benefit from their critical minerals.</p><p>New national climate action plans, or NDCs - must be submitted this year and align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C, especially in countries that are the major polluters.</p><p>These represent an immense opportunity. I urge African leaders to take it. And to use these new plans to bring together climate, energy and sustainable development goals to attract investment. And I urge countries, companies and more to work with us to deliver on the recommendations of our Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals - to ensure human rights, justice and equity through the value chain, and to retain maximum benefit in African countries.</p><p>Across all these critical fronts, let's work to leave no person, no country and no continent behind. And together, let's deliver justice for Africa and people of African Descent.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["And we need action to unleash a surge in finance across the board.

They ruled out an appeal.</p><p>But in a legal first, the court did rule that companies can be held liable for the impacts of their emissions.</p><p>Speaking after the verdict, Lluiya's lawyer Roda Verheyen said that although the court had not recognised the risk to her client's home, the ruling was a \"milestone\" that would \"give a tailwind to climate lawsuits against fossil fuel companies.\"</p><p>\"The judgement that we've just heard means that every community and every person that is affected by climate change today can look at large emitters to take a responsibility, legal responsibility, and it is an immense historic shifting of the dial that's happened today,\" she later told DW</p><p>The environmental NGO Germanwatch, which has supported the plaintiff throughout the long legal proceedings, said the ruling marked \"a great success.\"</p><p>\"The court's decision, which at first glance sounds like a defeat due to the dismissal of the case, is actually a historic landmark ruling that can be invoked by those affected in many places around the world,\" the nonprofit said in a statement.</p><p>\"This is because there are very similar legal requirements in numerous other countries, such as the UK, the Netherlands, the USA and Japan.\"</p><p>A long road of litigation</p><p>It is almost a decade since Saul Luciano Lluiya first filed a lawsuit against German energy giant RWE, calling on the company to pay its fair share to protect his home in Peru.</p><p>Lliuya's town of Huaraz is located in the west of the country, in a valley below the Palcacocha mountain lake. As greenhouse gas emissions have caused global temperatures to rise, glaciers in the region have been melting.</p><p>Water in the lake above Lluiya's home has increased more than fourfold since 2003 alone, leading experts to warn of an increased risk of flooding, with potentially dire consequences for the region. They say if large blocks of ice were to break off the glacier and fall into the lake, it could trigger meter-high flooding in lower-lying urban areas.</p><p>Lliuya has been suing RWE under a German neighborhood law, which works to protect residents from disturbances resulting from the actions of their neighbors - for example, from tree roots causing damage from an adjacent property. His initial lawsuit was rejected in 2015 by a court in Essen, the western German city where the energy company is headquartered.</p><p>But in 2017, a higher court in the nearby city of Hamm granted an appeal. In March this year, judges at that court heard evidence over whether Lliuya's house was really in jeopardy and whether RWE can be held responsible.</p><p>The Peruvian farmer, who earlier this year told DW the case was about \"holding those who have caused the damage to account,\" was calling on RWE to cover a pro rata percentage of the estimated costs to build flood defenses to protect his home from the rising lake water. This would equate to around 17,000 ($19,000).</p><p>RWE, which is not active in Peru, says it has always complied with national legal regulations and has repeatedly questioned why it has been singled out.</p><p>In a statement after the ruling, the energy giant said it had always considered such civil 'climate liability' to be inadmissible under German law. \"It would have unforeseeable consequences for Germany as an industrial location, because ultimately claims could be asserted against any German company anywhere in the world for damage caused by climate change.\"</p><p>However, Lluiya's lawyer Verheyen said her client's problem was not going away.</p><p>\"The risk from the Palcacocha Glacier Lake and from glacial lakes all over the world actually is still there and the global community and everybody needs to do something about it because we can't just have people living in such danger zones,\" she told DW.</p><p>Corporate responsibility for global emissions?</p><p>As an energy powerhouse with a history of largely using coal to generate electricity, RWE is one of Europe's biggest polluters. A 2023 analysis found the company to be responsible for just under 0.4% of global emissions - more than twice that of Greece.</p><p>In ruling the case as admissible in an earlier hearing, experts saw the court as effectively recognizing the transboundary effects of climate change - even if the damage occurs thousands of kilometers away.</p><p>\"Some of the arguments made in the case are of course transferable, even if not directly applicable in any other jurisdiction,\" said Petra Minnerop, a professor of international law at Durham University.</p><p>\"And this is what we see in litigation generally that litigants have tried to transfer the arguments and also learn from the court outcomes and then provided improved evidence and the adjusted legal argument,\" she added.</p><p>Could it still set a precedent?</p><p>Since the RWE proceedings began, Noah Walker-Crawford, a research fellow at the London-based Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment says around 40 cases have sprung up.

The National Security Law criminalizes positive comments about North Korea and the possession of materials alleged to be North Korean propaganda. The convictions under the defamation laws are not based on the veracity of the accused's statements, but whether they are in the public interest. The December 2024 martial law declaration showed how emergency powers can imperil democratic space in the country.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Repeal the National Security Law and address genuine threats to national security through existing criminal laws.</p><p>- Reform existing laws to end the criminalization of defamation and stop bringing criminal defamation charges against journalists or other members of the media for criticizing the government.</p><p>- Ensure presidential emergency powers are consistent with international human rights law.</p><p>Discrimination</p><p>Despite widespread support for anti-discrimination legislation, South Korea remains one of the two countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), a group of 38 high-income economies, without a comprehensive anti-discrimination law.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Pass a comprehensive anti-discrimination law that would provide equal protections against all forms of discrimination and safeguard the rights of women and marginalized groups.</p><p>Rights of Women and Girls</p><p>Discrimination against women and girls in South Korea is widespread and structural. Women and girls in South Korea face the widest pay gap between men and women in all OECD countries, as well as an uptick in digital sex crimes, including a 227 percent increase in registered cases involving artificial intelligence (AI)-generated deepfake sexual images that primarily target high school girls and young women.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Take urgent actions to protect women and girls from all forms of gender-based violence, including online gender-based violence (such as digital sex crimes).</p><p>- Establish comprehensive and effective protections against gender discrimination, including in the workplace through strong anti-discrimination legislation that includes protections for women and girls.</p><p>- Implement measures that increase women's economic and leadership opportunities, including those that guarantee pay transparency and equal pay.</p><p>- Adopt legislation aimed at reducing the prevalence and impact of digital sex crimes, including by reforming the provision of sexuality education, as discussed in greater detail below, to ensure that it aligns with international best practices and provides young people with a strong understanding of consent and gender-based violence including in a digital context.</p><p>- Ensure that investigations of alleged digital sex crimes are survivor-centered, and work closely with platforms to ensure the full and permanent removal of all abusive content.</p><p>- Ratify and fully implement the International Labor Organization Convention No. 190 on Violence and Harassment at Work.</p><p>LGBT Rights</p><p>Same-sex couples in South Korea lack the same legal recognition and protections as their heterosexual counterparts, and face discrimination in family and inheritance law, taxation, housing, and other areas of law and policy.</p><p>Article 92-6 of the Military Criminal Act criminalizes same-sex sexual acts with a military person regardless of whether the acts are consensual or happened within or outside of military facilities. This article was upheld by the Constitutional Court in October 2023.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Legalize same-sex marriage and ensure that same-sex couples have access to family and inheritance, housing, and taxation benefits.</p><p>- Repeal article 92-6 of the Military Criminal Act and drop prosecutions for consensual same-sex conduct in the military.</p><p>Children's Rights and Digital Safety</p><p>In South Korea, girls are the primary victims of AI-generated deepfake child sexual abuse and digital sex crime material, while refugee and migrant, disabled, and LGBT children face educational barriers and discrimination in schools. This new form of tech-enabled sexual abuse is facilitated by the continuing absence of adequate protections by the government and platforms, as well as the lack of comprehensive sexuality education that meets international standards and provides age-appropriate and accurate information on sexual health, consent, healthy relationships, and gender equality. Without this sexuality education, children are less able to distinguish between healthy sexual relationships and abuse, and more likely to normalize coercive sexual behaviors and misinterpret or feel unable to report or seek help in response to sexual abuse. Many children also lack the language to describe sexual exploitation, especially in digital spaces.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Require comprehensive and rights-respecting education on sexuality and digital literacy in all schools.</p><p>- Ensure that education programs are inclusive and rights-based.</p><p>- Require that tech companies fully enforce their content moderation policies and strengthen user reporting mechanisms to better protect children's rights.</p><p>- Participate actively in the Intergovernmental Working Group in Geneva on September 1-4, 2025, and support an optional protocol that explicitly recognizes every child's right to early childhood care and free public education from pre-primary through secondary school.</p><p>Digital Rights and Privacy</p><p>You recently pledged to make South Korea an AI powerhouse, which will be supported by the newly enacted Basic Act on the Development of Artificial Intelligence and the Establishment of a Trust-based Foundation, known as AI Basic Act, which sets the national framework for advancing AI technologies. You announced plans for public investment in AI infrastructure but have not proposed regulations on AI to ensure that the technology protects digital rights and is not exploited to abuse children and engage in digital sex crimes. Without these provisions, efforts to promote AI technology risk undermining privacy rights and exacerbating existing discrimination and abuse. In addition, the UN Convention on Cybercrime, adopted by the UN General Assembly in December 2024, could facilitate unchecked surveillance if not carefully aligned with international human rights law.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Ensure human rights protections, including privacy, transparency, non-discrimination, and safeguards that protect children's rights and prevent digital sex crimes, into the implementation of the AI Basic Act and other AI development projects.</p><p>- Pass robust data-protection laws and ensure judicial oversight of surveillance.</p><p>- Require human rights impact assessments for government-funded AI infrastructure and public-private AI partnerships.</p><p>- Withhold ratifying the UN Cybercrime Convention until it can be demonstrated that domestic safeguards are in place in South Korea to ensure adequate protection of privacy and freedom of expression.</p><p>Older People's Rights</p><p>Laws and policies that discriminate against older workers and rampant ageism put older people at risk of financial and mental harm that affects a number of basic rights. They permit employers to adopt a mandatory retirement age of 60 or older, regardless of their workers' job skills, while the peak wage system allows employers to reduce older workers' wages during the three to five years preceding their mandatory retirement. South Korea has the highest poverty rate among older people in the OECD, with older women being disproportionately affected.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Abolish the mandatory retirement age of 60 or older and the peak wage system, and ensure all differential treatment based on age does not amount to discrimination.</p><p>- Review re-employment programs to ensure older people have equal access to just, favorable, and meaningful employment opportunities that provide at least a living wage.</p><p>- Review whether the Basic Pension, the National Pension System's Old Age Pension, and other social security entitlements are adequate to guarantee older people an income at least equivalent to a living wage, and ensure they are available to everyone.</p><p>Holding Companies Accountable, Climate Justice, and Environmental Rights</p><p>Many South Korean companies have operations abroad, ranging from investments to manufacturing. Foreign corporations also have parts of their value chains in South Korea. These connections bring with them responsibilities to protect human rights, labor rights, environmental and climate impacts. Under the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights, companies have a responsibility to identify, prevent, mitigate, and remediate these risks and harms. In recent years, South Korean civil society organizations have urged the South Korean government to enact a robust mandatory human rights and environmental due diligence law that addresses such impacts.</p><p>The burning of fossil fuels remains South Korea's main source of greenhouse gas emissions. In August 2024, the Constitutional Court ruled that the government was failing to safeguard the fundamental rights of young people with its inadequate emissions reduction targets.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Enact robust climate legislation that sets greenhouse gas emissions reduction targets that are in accordance with South Korea's obligations under the Paris Agreement on climate change and are in line with the best available science, notably the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change's 1.5 degrees Celsius report from 2018.</p><p>- Adopt a science-based emissions-reduction pathway and transparent accountability mechanisms.</p><p>- Adopt a moratorium on the import of wood pellets and on new fossil fuel projects - notably Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) projects and financing - and instead invest in renewable energy sources that do not fuel deforestation.</p><p>- Adopt a mandatory environmental and human rights due diligence law that requires all companies to map and monitor their value chains, and identify, mitigate, and remediate actual and potential human rights and adverse environmental impacts, including to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions from scopes 1 through 3. Such laws should apply to all sectors and carry a combination of administrative penalties and other forms of civil and criminal liability for corporations, with a right of action in courts, drawing from the best comparative practices from the United Kingdom, European Union and its member states, and the United States.</p><p>Policy on Human Rights in North Korea</p><p>The human rights situation in North Korea remains dire. However, South Korea's policy on North Korean human rights has been deeply politicized, with past administrations choosing either unprincipled engagement or muted attempts at human rights promotion. The 2016 North Korean Human Rights Act created important mechanisms, such as the North Korean Human Rights Foundation, which has yet to be established. In your inaugural address, you pledged to promote dialogue and peace on the Korean peninsula, but did not address human rights concerns in North Korea.</p><p>North Korea's deployment of soldiers to Ukraine raises responsibilities for South Korea. North Korean prisoners of war who express reluctance to return to North Korea-as one such soldier did in January-could face enforced disappearance, torture, wrongful imprisonment, forced labor, or execution for disobeying orders or attempting desertion if returned to North Korea. Under the North Korean Defectors Protection and Settlement Support Act, North Korean escapees who want to live in South Korea can receive protection and support from the South Korean government.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Ensure that North Korea's human rights abuses are addressed in tandem with concerns surrounding international peace and security, and integrate human rights benchmarks into any engagement, humanitarian, or development dialogue with North Korea.</p><p>- Fully implement the 2016 North Korean Human Rights Act, including promptly establishing and funding the North Korean Human Rights Foundation.</p><p>- Commit to protecting the rights of North Korean escapees, including captured soldiers and refugees abroad.</p><p>- Ensure that North Korean prisoners of war are informed of their rights, treated with dignity, and protected from forced return to North Korea if they express reluctance to return to North Korea, where they could be subject to imprisonment, torture, or summary execution, in violation of the principle of nonrefoulement.</p><p>Capital Punishment</p><p>South Korea has not executed anyone since 1997 but still retains the death penalty in various laws. Human Rights Watch opposes the death penalty in all circumstances because of its inherent cruelty.</p><p>We urge your government to:</p><p>- Commute all death sentences, abolish the death penalty, and ratify the Second Optional Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</p><p>Source: Human Rights Watch</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["- Review re-employment programs to ensure older people have equal access to just, favorable, and meaningful employment opportunities that provide at least a living wage. - Review whether the Basic Pension, the National Pension System's Old Age Pension, and other social security entitlements are adequate to guarantee older people an income at least equivalent to a living wage, and ensure they are available to everyone.

This must be taken up by all countries, without exaggeration, by all humankind. This meeting provides an excellent opportunity to discuss a broad range of environmental issues. Equally important is outlining shared approaches to balance environmental protection with socioeconomic development.</p><p>The Russian Federation is deeply engaged in environmental initiatives across multiple bilateral and multilateral formats, including the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, BRICS, and others. Crucially, we must ensure that all agreements reached are implemented in practice as well as expanded to address other pressing challenges. Let me now highlight a few key priorities.</p><p>First, we must strengthen collaboration to improve environmental quality.</p><p>In Russia, we have launched the General Cleaning federal project, in response to Presidential instructions, to address accumulated ecological damage. Over the past six years, we have eliminated 185 unauthorised city landfills along with hazardous wells and abandoned industrial facilities. To date, we have also successfully raised and disposed of over 200 sunken vessels across the country.</p><p>Building on the President's initiative, we are now establishing a circular economy framework. Currently, more than half of all municipal solid waste undergoes processing, supported by the construction of approximately 300 integrated waste management facilities nationwide. The reuse rate for recyclables across key sectors - agriculture, industry, construction, and housing utilities - has risen to 10 percent. Looking ahead, we are committed to increasing this figure to 25 percent within the next five years.</p><p>Of course, we are ready to share our best practices with our friends.</p><p>Lean water management is another important track for us. We must ensure that our people can access clean water at all times.</p><p>The Russian Federation has about 3 million rivers with a total length of almost 12.5 million kilometres. There are also over 2.5 million lakes. There are vast freshwater reserves.</p><p>In keeping with the President's instructions, the Government also takes action to restore and reclaim rivers, water bodies, and to expand the network of hydrotechnical structures for ensuring flood and drought protection. We are building special water treatment systems for ruling out any water pollution with residential and industrial wastewater.</p><p>There are quite a few major and medium-size rivers in Russia flowing through neighbouring countries. We also work together on using lake resources. The total area of these cross-border water bodies is about 3 million square kilometres.</p><p>Of course, it is essential that we step up our cooperation for protecting them and to ensure that we monitor them and share data in real time, while also coordinating our flood control initiatives and ensuring that our research teams work together when carrying out their studies and surveys.</p><p>We have been keeping a close eye on the Caspian Sea's shallowing - these matters require our attention and result from global climate change. In this regard, one of the main goals, as we have been telling our partners, is to devise an effective long-term model for forecasting changes in the water levels of this unique and beautiful water body. This model would serve as a foundation for planning our economic activity and minimising the possible negative consequences.</p><p>Statement by Mikhail Mishustin at the plenary session of the International Environmental Conference</p><p>Russia's Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is already working on this agenda. Taking this opportunity, I would like to invite our foreign colleagues to join these efforts. Millions of people depend on the Caspian Sea and its state. Preserving it and ensuring its sustainable use is our shared responsibility and our common objective.</p><p>The same goes for preserving forests. In Russia, they cover a territory of almost 1.2 billion hectares, which is a fifth of the global forest acreage.</p><p>The Government has taken action to prevent it from shrinking. For several years now, the area of recovered forest has exceeded the territories where the forests disappeared or where removed. This is a very important indicator. To give you an example, last year the former exceeded the latter by a factor of 1.5. Since 2019, we have restored about 8 million hectares of forests.</p><p>We are introducing advanced technologies. By using drones, we can get updates on the damaged and dead trees in real time, as well as identify any damage quicker. Satellite imagery enables us to monitor natural forest regeneration processes. In this regard too, we are ready to share all these solutions and technologies with our partners.</p><p>The next track is also very important - it deals with the endangered flora and fauna. We must step up our intergovernmental efforts in order to better protect rare species. This is instrumental for preserving biodiversity.</p><p>Russia attaches a lot of attention to this topic. Our country offers state protection status to over 400 animal species and almost 750 plants. This republic alone is home to the Altaisky and Katunsky state nature reserves which are designate as UNESCO natural heritage sites. Our country has a total of over 12,000 specially protected areas.</p><p>Selected areas are being made accessible to travellers, provided they exhibit a responsible and considerate attitude towards nature. Pursuant to the decision of the Head of State, we are establishing the necessary infrastructure that does not disrupt fragile ecosystems.</p><p>The number of visitors to federal national parks continues to grow. Last year alone, it increased by 150 percent. Over 17 million people have now had the opportunity to witness pristine nature.</p><p>I believe this form of tourism holds tremendous potential, and I propose we develop it together.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>To successfully address environmental challenges and mitigate the consequences of climate change, it is vital that we combine the efforts of scientists and innovators across our nations. We must employ the most advanced technologies to monitor the state of ecosystems, air, water, solar activity, radiation levels, and wind patterns.</p><p>Russian researchers obtain such data in real time thanks to the extensive observation network of the Federal Service for Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring (Rosgidromet) and our domestic orbital constellation of 18 satellites.</p><p>Statement by Mikhail Mishustin at the plenary session of the International Environmental Conference</p><p>For the study of Arctic natural processes, we have constructed an ice-resistant self-propelled platform named North Pole. This is a unique vessel - the only one of its kind in the world. It has enabled scientists to access high-latitude Arctic regions previously deemed unreachable. The data collected is now instrumental in improving navigation along the Northern Sea Route, a critical transport artery and logistics corridor.</p><p>Research in Antarctica is also underway. Last year, we inaugurated a new wintering complex named Vostok. This modern facility, located at the heart of the continent, was built in less than five years. Spanning nearly 3,000 square metres, it houses scientific laboratories, residential and communal spaces, energy centres, and technical units.</p><p>The studies conducted there hold substantial scientific value, offering insights into the causes of climatic shifts. We must, of course, enhance conditions for collaboration among our scientists so that such projects - including joint initiatives - continue to multiply.</p><p>Friends,</p><p>Environmental improvement and nature conservation remain at the forefront of the Russian Government's priorities. Our President, Vladimir Putin, has identified environmental well-being as one of the nation's key development goals. We will do everything necessary to achieve this objective. However, as I have stated earlier, no country can tackle such challenges alone. I propose intensifying our collaborative efforts in this direction - for the benefit of present and future generations.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Nikol Pashinyan: Mr Mishustin, heads of delegations, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister of Armenia Nikol Pashinyan at the plenary session of the International Environmental Conference</p><p>First and foremost, I would like to express my gratitude for the invitation to participate in this International Environmental Conference and to extend my appreciation to the Prime Minister of the Russian Federation for his hospitality and the high-level organisation of today's event.</p><p>It is symbolic that this critically important discussion is taking place in Altai, a region renowned for its natural beauty.</p><p>Heads of delegations, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Armenia is a mountainous country, with 80 percent of its territory comprised of highland regions. Our country is known for its diverse climatic zones - ranging from arid subtropical to alpine.</p><p>Armenia boasts numerous endemic flora species. Four national parks and three reserves occupy over 10 percent of the country's territory. Among these is the Khosrov Reserve, founded upon an artificial forest established as early as the 4th century as a royal hunting ground. The jewel of Armenia - Lake Sevan - is the largest freshwater body in our region.</p><p>The mountain ecosystems of our country are acutely vulnerable to climate change. Droughts, floods, and flash floods are becoming increasingly frequent. Although Armenia's carbon dioxide emissions are negligible on a global scale, our country is among those most severely affected by global warming.</p><p>The consequences of climate change manifest in accelerated glacial melt, reduced precipitation, landslides, soil erosion, and desertification. Water scarcity leads to diminished pasture and arable land productivity, as well as declining forest resources. In this context, we attach great importance to enhancing water resource efficiency, adopting innovative technologies, and implementing drip irrigation programmes.</p><p>It is for this reason that the Government of Armenia has approved the Climate Change Adaptation Programme for the Water Sector, covering the period 2022 to 2026. A new draft law on climate has also been developed in the Republic of Armenia.</p><p>The purpose of this draft law is to establish legal and institutional frameworks for formulating and implementing the country's climate agenda. In response to national needs and international commitments, the Government approved the National Climate Change Adaptation Action Plan and a corresponding set of measures for 2021-2026 in May 2021. Thus, we are defining the strategic parameters for adaptation and planning efforts on a permanent and ongoing basis.</p><p>Armenia welcomes cooperation among EAEU member states on the climate agenda. Eurasian low-carbon development programmes are equally vital.</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Placing high importance on biodiversity conservation, Armenia is implementing programmes to restore populations of wild animals.</p><p>The programme to revive the Caucasian leopard population, carried out jointly with the World Wildlife Fund since 2002, has yielded tangible results. Permanent habitation of this species within Armenia's borders - along with the birth of cubs - has already been recorded, signalling the establishment of a stable habitat and food supply for the Caucasian leopard.</p><p>In collaboration with the Fund, we are also executing a programme to restore the Caucasian red deer population in the Dilijan Reserve.</p><p>Armenia supports the agenda of mountainous countries within the UN framework. We actively participate in the Group of Friends of Mountainous Countries at the UN, an initiative launched by Kyrgyzstan. Additionally, we have joined the Kyrgyz side's initiative, the Mountain Partnership Group, under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Conference of the Parties. We hope this group will become an active participant in the negotiation processes of climate conferences, and to this end, we stand ready to facilitate the development of a requisite agenda within the group.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>As you are aware, the 17th Conference of the Parties (COP17) on Biological Diversity will be held in Armenia in October 2026. We anticipate the participation of high-level delegations from your countries, as well as representatives from academic and expert communities, in COP17 proceedings.</p><p>As the chair and host nation, Armenia will spare no effort to foster productive dialogue, bridge differences among parties, and adopt balanced, substantive decisions that account for the interests and priorities of all stakeholders.</p><p>We are confident that together, we can make a substantial contribution to global efforts in preserving biodiversity and promoting the sustainable use of natural resources - in the spirit of shared responsibility for our planet.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Prime Minister of the Republic of Belarus Alexander Turchin: Ladies and gentlemen, colleagues,</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister of Belarus Alexander Turchin</p><p>First and foremost, allow me to extend my gratitude to the organisers of this conference and to the leadership of the Republic of Altai for their invitation and the opportunity to discuss environmental agenda issues in such a picturesque and symbolic location. The nature of Altai serves as a reminder of how fragile and beautiful is our planet is, and how crucial it is to unite our efforts in preserving it.</p><p>With each passing year, the international community devotes increasing attention to environmental protection and maintaining the planet's ecological integrity. This is not merely a matter of following trends but rather a commitment to establishing a robust model of sustainable socio-economic development. In Belarus, environmental protection is a cornerstone of state policy and is approached in a comprehensive manner. It encompasses all natural components, ecosystems, as well as the economy, healthcare, science, education, and other spheres of state and human activity.</p><p>In accordance with the national security concept of the Republic of Belarus, the primary national interests within the environmental sphere include ecologically oriented socio-economic development of the state, preservation of a favourable environment, and adaptation to climate change.</p><p>Thus, we regard the conservation of natural resources and the minimisation of anthropogenic impact on climate change as strategic imperatives upon which the well-being of future generations depends. In our country, the principles of green and circular economies are enshrined in legislation through the National Strategy for Sustainable Development of the Republic of Belarus until 2040, as well as other long- and medium-term planning documents.</p><p>One of the key priorities in the environmental agenda for the near future is maximising the reintegration of waste into secondary circulation. Today, the republic achieves a waste utilisation rate of approximately 90 percent for industrial waste (excluding large-tonnage waste), while the rate for municipal solid waste stands at around 40 percent.</p><p>In May 2025, the President of our country set the task of establishing a comprehensive waste management system covering all types of waste, alongside the creation of an automated tracking system for waste volumes - from generation to reuse - at every stage. In the near future, Belarus will adopt a strategy for the management of industrial and consumer waste.</p><p>This strategy will serve as the foundational document, outlining in detail the objectives and long-term development of the waste management system, with the ultimate aim of ensuring that, by 2040, no less than 90 percent of industrial and consumer waste is utilised.</p><p>Water resources, as a natural asset, constitute a national treasure for all nations. Belarus is home to over 20,000 watercourses and more than 10,000 lakes.</p><p>National policy concerning water protection and usage is founded on principles aimed at improving the ecological state of surface water bodies while preventing pollution, depletion, and degradation. The assessment of rational water resource usage is conducted based on the integration of circulating and reused water supply systems into industrial processes.</p><p>The Republic of Belarus has successfully ensured economic growth while decreasing water consumption, achieving a 24 percent reduction in water extraction since 2000. Through timely modernisation and upgrade of municipal treatment facilities, discharges of insufficiently treated wastewater have decreased by a factor of 7.8 over the past 20 years, now representing less than 0.2 percent of total wastewater entering surface waters.</p><p>On air quality, the country maintains rigorous standards through an ever-expanding monitoring network covering all industrial cities, with continuous improvements to both coverage and technology.</p><p>Belarus has implemented an automated environmental monitoring system that aggregates real-time data from air quality stations and industrial emissions sensors. This system streams information directly to regional offices of the Ministry of Natural Resources, enabling immediate action against regulatory violations.</p><p>Our commitment to international climate obligations remains unwavering. Under the Paris Agreement, Belarus pledged to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 35 to 40 percent by 2030 (against 1990 levels) - a target we have already surpassed. We are now advancing toward an even more ambitious goal: deeper emissions cuts by 2035.</p><p>Belarus has made significant strides in renewable energy adoption, with wind, hydro, solar, and biogas now contributing 7.3 percent of total heat and electricity generation.</p><p>The transition to electric transport is accelerating nationwide. In 2024 alone, the number of electric cars surged by a factor of 3,4. In Minsk, electric public transport already accounts for over 40 percent of the fleet, with its share climbing steadily.</p><p>Belarus' network of specially protected natural areas forms a robust foundation for environmental conservation. Over the past decade, we have made significant progress in expanding these protected areas, achieving some tangible outcomes. Our system now encompasses 1,355 designated natural areas covering nearly 2 million hectares (representing 9.2 percent of the nation's total territory) through sustained, systematic efforts.</p><p>In closing, Belarus' systematic efforts have earned us 32nd place out of 180 countries on the Environmental Performance Index ranking - a notable achievement, but not a reason to pause our progress. We remain committed to advancing our environmental targets and ensuring the sustainable use of natural resources.</p><p>We stand ready to actively shape the green agenda within the CIS and pursue joint projects with our partners in the CIS and across other integration associations.</p><p>Thank you. I wish all participants productive discussions and rewarding outcomes from this conference. Thank you.</p><p>Olzhas Bektenov: Mr Mikhail Mishustin, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister of Kazakhstan Olzhas Bektenov</p><p>First and foremost, allow me to sincerely thank the Russian side for their warm welcome, traditional hospitality and the excellent organisation of today's event.</p><p>We live in an era of rapid technological progress and global challenges. Alongside achievements in the economy and social development, environmental protection has become an increasingly pressing issue.</p><p>Environmental security is not just part of the international green agenda; it is a vital condition for the sustainable development of any country. The conservation of natural resources, ensuring access to clean air and water, as well as the frugal use of available resources, are top priorities that directly impact the wellbeing of current and future generations.</p><p>With this in mind, President of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kassym-Jomart Tokayev has launched the Taza Kazakstan (Clean Kazakhstan) initiative, aimed at fostering a culture of environmental responsibility and care for nature and the land. As part of this initiative, large-scale clean-up efforts, tree-planting drives and other environmental campaigns are being held systematically across the country.</p><p>Importantly, Taza Kazakstan is not a one-time project. It is a continuous effort to transform public attitudes toward cleanliness, urban and rural aesthetics, and environmental stewardship. Today, the initiative has grown into a large-scale movement and an integral part of daily life for the people of Kazakhstan, influencing both individual values and the development of public spaces and the natural environment.</p><p>In parallel, the Government is undertaking efforts to modernise environmental legislation and introduce advanced nature conservation technologies. A real-time emission monitoring system is being introduced as part of the digitalisation of environmental oversight. This system enables the timely tracking of environmental impact and prompt responses to abnormal occurrences.</p><p>Kazakhstan is also actively participating in global efforts to preserve biodiversity. New protected natural areas are being created and existing ones expanded. Work is underway to establish a biodiversity conservation fund, with the primary goal of protecting and restoring wildlife populations, including the Caspian seal, the greater flamingo and many other species.</p><p>Special attention is being given to rare and endangered species, such as the Bukhara deer, kulan, argali sheep, and goitered gazelles. Kazakhstan is also working on the reintroduction of the Turan tiger and Przewalski's horse. Thanks to the measures being implemented, we are seeing encouraging growth in populations of the snow leopard and the saiga antelope.</p><p>One of the most urgent issues facing Kazakhstan is the environmental and economic impact of changes to water bodies. Since the early 2000s, the Caspian Sea has experienced a steady decline in water levels. To study this and related issues, the Kazakh Research Institute of the Caspian Sea was established. Unfortunately, expert forecasts remain disturbing. Coordinated and decisive action by all Caspian littoral states is urgently needed to preserve this unique body of water. Kazakhstan is also taking steps to partially restore the Aral Sea and its surrounding ecosystems.</p><p>In this context, Kazakhstan is undertaking initiatives to fortify the Kok-Aral Dam, restore the Syr Darya Delta, support the region's fishing industry, and embark on extensive afforestation of the Aral Sea bed. Last year, Kazakhstan assumed the leadership of the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea. Under our nation's chairmanship, a series of international events have been convened in the Aral region. These include the establishment of new monitoring centres, the launch of collaborative programmes to preserve the unique ecosystems of the Aral area, and expeditions involving leading international environmentalists and biodiversity specialists.</p><p>The initiatives being executed underscore the readiness of Central Asian states to engage in collaborative action to address environmental challenges. Within the global water agenda, one of the most urgent issues is the preservation of glaciers. According to expert forecasts, the volume of glaciers in Central Asia is projected to decline significantly by the year 2100.</p><p>In this regard, at the 2024 One Water Summit in Riyadh, the President of Kazakhstan proposed the Water Towers Partnership initiative. Its objective is to systematise support for glaciological science by uniting the efforts of global research centres to study glacier protection. It is important to acknowledge the contributions of the UNESCO-affiliated Central Asian Regional Glaciological Centre, based in Almaty.</p><p>The centre has consolidated regional research and serves as a scientific platform for assessing the impact of global climate change on mountain ice masses. Kazakhstan has enacted institutional reforms in water management, now centrally coordinated by the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation. Key priorities are outlined in the Water Resource Management Development Concept and the new Water Code. These strategic documents are founded on principles of conservation and sustainable water use, the adoption of water-saving technologies, ecosystem protection, and climate change adaptation.</p><p>We stand ready to implement joint interstate hydraulic projects, ranging from regulated reservoirs and canals to monitoring stations and automated water accounting systems. Kazakhstan's participation in developing the promenade around Lake Manzherok has been an excellent opportunity to contribute to the shared environmental agenda. Symbolically, Altai - the cradle of Turkic civilisation - was chosen as the venue for the inaugural session of this International Environmental Conference.</p><p>Preserving the natural heritage of this unique region is not merely an environmental imperative but also a vital component of cultural and humanitarian cooperation between our nations.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>Despite emerging natural and climatic challenges, Kazakhstan remains committed to resolving them through mutual understanding and good-neighbourly relations. We are prepared to share our experience and work in a spirit of partnership.</p><p>Taking this opportunity, I would like to invite you to the regional environmental summit, to be held in Kazakhstan in 2026.</p><p>I am confident it will serve as a logical continuation of our efforts and define new avenues for collaboration.</p><p>Once again, I thank the organisers of this event and extend my best wishes to all conference participants.</p><p>Adylbek Kasymaliev: Mr Mishustin,</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister - Head of the Presidential Administration of Kyrgyzstan Adylbek Kasymaliev</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>Conference participants,</p><p>First of all, I would like to express my sincere gratitude to you, Mr Mishustin, for your traditional hospitality and proposal to hold this international conference.</p><p>The conference is dedicated to environmental problems which cause growing concern across almost the entire world.</p><p>It is deeply symbolic that we have gathered in the Altai Republic, a region renowned for its unique natural beauty, majestic mountains, pristine rivers, and rich cultural heritage. This land offers valuable experience in preserving biodiversity and caring for natural resources, an experience that matters not only for this region but for the entire planet.</p><p>Today, environmental issues such as climate change, eroding biodiversity and pollution, require urgent and coordinated action at the international level. Only by working together can we find fair and effective solutions that will preserve our ecosystems for future generations.</p><p>Esteemed conference participants,</p><p>Kyrgyzstan has a rich and diverse natural heritage. Its highlands, glaciers, pastures, and lakes form unique ecosystems. Our country is home to about 2 percent of all plant species and over 3 percent of animal species on the planet: more than 26,000 species, many of them endemic; with 209 of them listed in the Red Data Book of Kyrgyzstan.</p><p>Like mountainous areas in many parts of the world, Kyrgyzstan's ecosystems are under severe pressure from climate change. Over the past seven decades, glaciers have shrunk by 16 percent, leading to an increase in natural disasters such as mudflows, landslides, and floods, and disrupting water and energy balances.</p><p>According to World Bank estimates, water shortages in the Central Asian region may reach 20-30 percent by 2050. In this regard, Kyrgyzstan prioritises joint efforts to strengthen climate resilience. We have established a system of glacier monitoring across the Northern, Central, and Inner Tien Shan, the Issyk-Kul Basin, and the Pamir-Alai, with key sites designated for continuous observation. Within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and despite our comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions, Kyrgyzstan has voluntarily committed to reducing emissions by 16 percent by 2030, and, with the support of international donors, by up to 44 percent.</p><p>We have also adopted a concept of carbon neutrality by 2050. In this context, it must be highlighted that the states responsible for 80 percent of emissions must help ensure climate justice, including providing financing and technologies to low-emission countries.</p><p>Esteemed participants,</p><p>Kyrgyzstan has been promoting the mountain agenda on the world arena for over 20 years. We have initiated a dialogue on mountains and climate change under the UN Framework Convention. We appreciate the countries' support for our initiative, including from the Russian Federation.</p><p>At the Kyrgyz Republic's initiative, the 77th session of the UN General Assembly adopted the resolution on Sustainable Mountain Development.</p><p>This past April Bishkek held the Global Mountain Dialogue conference attended by 50 countries from Europe, Asia, America and Africa, and 29 international organisations. Given the global climatic processes, we have been promoting the Declaration on Climate Change, Mountains and Glaciers, which has so far been supported by 21 states, including the Russian Federation.</p><p>We are going to hold the Second Mountain Summit Bishkek +25 in 2027. I will avail myself of this opportunity to invite you to take part in that event and support our global mountain dialogue.</p><p>In 2024, at the Kyrgyz Republic's initiative, the United Nations proclaimed October 23 International Day of the Snow Leopard as a reminder of the importance to preserve its population. Given that the snow leopard is a symbol of mountain ecosystems' health, we are undertaking some active measures. Thus, we have adopted a presidential decree on the snow leopard as a national symbol and worked out a government strategy for its protection. Just a month ago Cholpon Ata hosted the ninth meeting of the committee of the Global Snow Leopard and Ecosystem Protection Programme involving 12 countries of its habitat, international partners and experts.</p><p>Thanks to the support measures, the current snow leopard population in Kyrgyzstan exceeds 500 animals. I want to underscore the fruitful cooperation between Kyrgyzstan and the Republic of Altai in preserving the snow leopard. In March 2025, the Snow Leopard centre in the Altai Republic received three snow leopards as an important step in reintroducing and improving the population. That was not just a symbolic act but a contribution to the sustainability of the Altai-Sayan region's ecosystem.</p><p>In general, starting from 2019, we together with our international partners have implemented over 10 joint projects in protecting biodiversity, laying nature trails and mounting expeditions. Kyrgyzstan has made two ecological corridors. The first one is Chatkal and the second is Ak Ilbirs.</p><p>With a view to preserve the biodiversity in Central Asia, we suggest considering creation of transborder ecological corridors extending to adjacent countries. Transborder ecological corridors will not only help preserving the biodiversity but will also open new opportunities for sustainable development, including in the ecotourism.</p><p>At present, to maintain biodiversity in Kyrgyzstan, a network of 96 specially protected natural territories has been established and is operational, covering a total area of over 2 million hectares.</p><p>Kyrgyzstan also regards ecotourism as one of the priority areas for ecologically and economically balanced growth. Last year, the country welcomed 8.9 million tourists, of whom more than 20 percent specifically chose ecotourism routes. The most popular destinations include trekking, ethno-tourism, birdwatching, as well as horseback and cycling routes in mountainous regions.</p><p>At the same time, ecotourism cannot develop without proper protection of natural areas from pollution, primarily from plastic products. Plastic waste poses a serious threat to vulnerable ecosystems, including Issyk-Kul and the fragile mountainous regions of the Tien Shan. In this regard, restrictions were introduced in 2023 on the circulation of polymer film bags and certain plastic products in the Issyk-Kul resort area, and since January of last year - on specially protected natural and biosphere territories.</p><p>From 2027, a complete ban is planned on single-use plastic items that cannot be recycled. The Kyrgyz Republic is open to exchanging expertise in plastic waste management, adopting recycling technologies, developing infrastructure for waste collection and disposal, and establishing joint cross-border environmental standards.</p><p>Greening plays a crucial role in the ecological well-being of any region. Amid climate change and increasing air pollution, tree planting and the expansion of green zones have become priority tasks for environmental preservation and improving the quality of life for our citizens. Since 2022, under the initiative of President of the Kyrgyz Republic Sadyr Japarov, the Jashyl Muras campaign - meaning Green Legacy - has been implemented.</p><p>Over the past three years, more than 29 million saplings have been planted. In total, the campaign aims to plant over 70 million trees. These are millions of small dots of hope on the map of our country that, with careful nurturing, will grow into forests and orchards tomorrow.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to emphasise that joining efforts to protect the environment and preserve natural resources is the foundation of sustainable development and the well-being of our peoples. We must act today to secure a future where humanity and nature coexist in harmony. The Kyrgyz Republic is open to cooperation and knowledge-sharing so that together, we may build a world where nature is valued, safeguarded, and restored.</p><p>I hope that our discussions and productive deliberations today on the hospitable Altai land will contribute to the global efforts in addressing the environmental challenges of our time. Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Statement by Prime Minister of Tajikistan Kohir Rasulzoda</p><p>Kokhir Rasulzoda: Colleagues,</p><p>Ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>Let me first of all express my gratitude to the Government of the Russian Federation and personally to Mr Mishustin, for inviting me to take part in this International Environmental Conference. I believe that this forum will help consolidate our collective efforts to counter growing environmental challenges. These problems are transnational by nature and require coordinated, multilateral actions to be effectively addressed.</p><p>Turning to national priorities, I would like to emphasise that the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan, fully aware of the importance of careful management of natural resources and their preservation for future generations, is making significant efforts to protect and expand them. This approach is a cornerstone for ensuring a sustainable economic and social development of our country.</p><p>In this context, it must be noted that Tajikistan has been actively promoting the water and climate agenda on the international stage for many years. The adoption of 14 relevant resolutions by the United Nations General Assembly, initiated by Tajikistan, has laid a solid foundation for achieving coordinated global water goals. These resolutions have also contributed significantly to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals included in the 2030 Agenda.</p><p>The close connection between energy and climate change cannot be denied. We believe that developing green energy is a constructive step toward preserving the global climate. Today, Tajikistan generates 98 percent of its electricity from hydropower, ranking sixth in the world in terms of the share of renewable green energy in its total energy production.</p><p>By 2032, Tajikistan plans to achieve a complete transition to renewable energy sources, and by 2037, to become, in essence, a fully green country.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>Considering these priorities, it is particularly relevant to underscore that the Government of the Republic of Tajikistan pays special attention to climate change and environmental sustainability, as these issues have profound and multifaceted impacts on our natural resources: most notably, the melting of glaciers. Tajikistan's glaciers are a key water source for the entire region, with 60 percent of Central Asia's water resources coming from the territory of our country. At the initiative of Tajikistan, the UN General Assembly declared 2025 the International Year for the Conservation of Glaciers, and designated 21 March as World Glacier Day.</p><p>In continuation of the topic of international cooperation, it is noteworthy that in May Dushanbe hosted an International High-Level Conference on the Conservation of Glaciers organised on the basis of the UN resolution.</p><p>The conference's key outcome documents were the Dushanbe Declaration on Glaciers and the Dushanbe Call to Action, which urge UN Member States and interested parties to take specific measures to strengthen international cooperation in promoting and coordinating the global agenda for the study and conservation of the cryosphere and glaciers. It is also important that last August, the UN General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution declaring the Decade of Action in Cryospheric Sciences (2025-2034), an initiative jointly proposed by Tajikistan and France.</p><p>In order to further advance these initiatives, and recognising the importance of studying the impacts of climate change on regional glaciers, a regional glaciology coordination centre will be established in Dushanbe under the auspices of the World Meteorological Organisation in cooperation with other development partners. This will become yet another substantial contribution by Tajikistan to the global climate agenda.</p><p>Colleagues,</p><p>To underscore our commitment to the sustainable development principles, I would like to highlight that the political will of our country, outlined and supported in the annual messages of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, His Excellency Emomali Rahmon, confirms our national dedication to preserving natural wealth as both a priceless heritage and the foundation for sustainable progress.</p><p>Tajikistan's biodiversity is truly unique, comprising more than 6,500 plant species as well as a rich variety of wildlife, including rare and endemic species.</p><p>However, it is evident that climate change continues to affect the ecosystems of our region. Many species of wild animals and plants are now on the verge of extinction. One such species is the markhor, a rare wild goat species inhabiting several Central and South Asian countries. In order to safeguard and increase the population of this endangered animal, the UN General Assembly adopted a resolution in May 2024, at the initiative of the President of the Republic of Tajikistan, declaring 24 May International Markhor Day.</p><p>Snow leopard is another emblematic species, unique for our region. To protect this majestic animal, the Government of Tajikistan has adopted the State Programme for the Conservation of the Snow Leopard for 2024-2028.</p><p>It is also noteworthy that the Snow Leopard Rehabilitation Centre has been established in the Murghab district of the Gorno-Badakhshan Autonomous Region. Tajikistan closely cooperates with the Russian Federation and other countries within the snow leopard's natural habitat to exchange experience and coordinate efforts to preserve snow leopards.</p><p>For a truly comprehensive approach to environmental protection, it is crucial to not only take direct measures to preserve individual species but also to ensure sustainable management of natural resources. This includes fostering environmental education, creating new protected areas, and implementing restoration programmes.</p><p>As a result of these efforts, over the past 30 years the total area of protected territories in Tajikistan has increased from 3 percent of the country's territory to 23 percent.</p><p>Tajikistan National Park, which is the largest protected territory in the country, was included in the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2013.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to note that close cooperation and coordinated actions make it possible to address global environmental challenges more effectively, preserve the natural diversity of our countries, and ensure a sustainable future for our peoples.</p><p>I wish you all well-being, fruitful discussions, and success in your meaninful work. Thank you for your attention.</p><p>Abdulla Aripov: Mr Mishustin, heads of delegations, ladies and gentlemen,</p><p>First of all, allow me to express our gratitude for the traditionally warm welcome and brilliant organisation of the International Environmental Conference.</p><p>I would like to emphasise that all the necessary conditions have been created for fruitful work and exchange of views on the issues on our forum's agenda.</p><p>Esteemed conference participants, all countries and the entire population of the Earth are now facing an environmental crisis causes by climate change, the loss of biodiversity, environmental pollution, and a growing number of natural disasters.</p><p>Taken together, this complicates the task of ensuring food and energy security and hinders access to water and natural resources. Climate issues are becoming a new obstacle to improving the living standards for the people and implementing national development strategies aimed at overcoming poverty.</p><p>Dear friends, we have been working at the initiative of President of the Republic of Uzbekistan Shavkat Mirziyoyev to implement large-scale reforms aimed at creating favourable environmental conditions for the people and the green transition.</p><p>Uzbekistan has declared 2025 the Year of Environmental Protection and Green Economy. We are working within a state programme to introduce green technologies and green economy principles. Our objective is to ensure a rational use of mineral resources, save energy and water, and improve public health. In addition, we are also implementing the Yashil Makon (Green Belt) national initiative proposed by the President of Uzbekistan.</p><p>Under it, we plant more than 200 million trees every year, aiming to increase the share of green areas in the republic to 30 percent by 2030. We are implementing one of the region's largest revegetation programmes within the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration. Since 2018, we have planted over 2 million hectares of the dry bed of the Aral Sea with drought and salt-tolerant plants.</p><p>This year alone, we plan to revegetate 250,000 hectares of land in the Aral Sea Region, including 115,000 hectares of the dry bed of the sea. In addition, we are implementing long-term strategic documents, including the Green Economy Transition and Green Growth Programme in Uzbekistan until 2030, and an energy saving concept in various industrial sectors.</p><p>Green energy is becoming a driver of economic growth in the country. We plan to increase its share to 54 percent by 2030, which will allow us to reduce the emission of greenhouse gases by nearly 16 million tonnes.</p><p>We are working closely together with our partners within the International Fund for Saving the Aral Sea (IFAS). The UN Multi-Partner Human Security Trust Fund for the Aral Sea Region, which has been established to support social and environmental projects in the Aral Sea Region, has become a reliable platform for implementing relevant initiatives in the region.</p><p>We cement irrigation networks to save water. We have created an industrial base for the production of water saving technologies, which have been installed on an area of nearly 2 million hectares, or approximately half of our irrigated land. These measures have helped us save about 8 billion cubic metres of water last year.</p><p>We have established the Central Asian University of Environmental Protection and Climate Change Studies (Green University), where the first regional office of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) for the CIS (Eastern Europe and Central Asia) has opened a representative office.</p><p>We invite researchers and relevant professionals to take part in the work of the climate residence at the Green University to conduct joint climate studies. The first International Climate Forum was held under the UN umbrella in Samarkand in April 2025. Uzbekistan has also proposed several UN resolutions in this sphere, including a recent resolution on the Decade for Afforestation and Reforestation.</p><p>All this is graphic proof of Uzbekistan's active role in advocating the climate agenda at the regional and global levels. Besides, we are paying special attention to the development of ecotourism, which combines recreation with care for the environment.</p><p>Uzbekistan has unique ecosystems, from deserts and mountains to biosphere reserves that are on the UNESCO's World Heritage List and on the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands of International Importance, especially as Waterfowl Habitat.</p><p>In 2024, the village of Sentab in Uzbekistan was recognised as one of the Best Tourism Villages by UNTourism (formerly UNWTO), and Samarkand was promoted as a Tourism Capital.</p><p>We are actively implementing projects to create all-season and mountain ski resorts and also developing ecotourism. We invite everyone to discover the natural and cultural wealth of Uzbekistan.</p><p>Dear conference participants, Uzbekistan intends to increase its practical contribution to joint efforts to overcome the consequences of climate change. Our priority is to do everything in our power so the future generations live in a sustainable, safe and prosperous world. We firmly believe that the initiatives and proposals advanced during this conference will contribute to the cause of rallying the international community towards adopting effective decisions in the name of green and sustainable development.</p><p>In conclusion, I would like to thank the Russian side once again for their hospitality and for organising this event. I wish all conference participants fruitful discussions and productive work. Thank you.</p><p>Statement by Deputy Prime Minister of Turkmenistan Nokerguly Atagulyev</p><p>Nokerguly Atagulyev: Mr Mishustin, heads and members of delegations, forum participants,</p><p>First, allow me to express my sincere gratitude to the Government of the Russian Federation and the Altai Republic Government for the warm and cordial welcome extended to our delegation. Special thanks for your kind invitation. We are truly delighted to be hosted in this land of the flourishing Altai Territory.</p><p>The beauty of this untouched nature leaves an unforgettable impression. Today's nature conservation forum is highly relevant given the growing environmental challenges and their impact on people's lives and our planet as a whole. Environmental diplomacy and sustainable development remain undoubtedly effective tools for strengthening international cooperation and trust among states.</p><p>Turkmenistan has joined several key international environmental conventions, including the Convention on Biological Diversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, the Paris Climate Agreement, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora.</p><p>Furthermore, our country is actively engaged in implementing the Central Asian Subregional Programme of Action to Combat Desertification.</p><p>Turkmenistan is pursuing a robust environmental policy under the leadership of the National Leader of the Turkmen people, Gurbanguly Berdimuhamedov, and President of Turkmenistan Serdar Berdimuhamedov. This policy is aimed at ensuring environmental safety, sustainable development, and the preservation of the country's natural heritage.</p><p>The pillars of this policy include upholding constitutional rights, developing a national environmental security system, and enforcing liability for environmental damage - as enshrined in Turkmenistan's Law on Environmental Safety.</p><p>To mitigate climate risks and strengthen the resilience of key economic sectors, the President resolved to adopt Turkmenistan's National Climate Change Strategy. In 2022, Turkmenistan approved its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement, outlining commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2030.</p><p>As part of its environmental policy, Turkmenistan has planted over 162 million seedlings of diverse tree species nationwide over the past two decades. These afforestation initiatives are supported by international partners, including the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).</p><p>Turkmenistan is actively expanding its specially protected natural areas, which currently include nine nature reserves and 16 wildlife sanctuaries. These protected zones are vital for conserving the country's unique nature. However, Turkmenistan faces growing threats from water scarcity, driven by climate change, rising agricultural demand, and upstream economic activities in neighbouring countries.</p><p>Our water supply mostly relies on transboundary rivers - the Amu Darya, Murghab, Tejen, and Atrek - with annual demand reaching 25 cubic kilometres, most of which originates abroad. To address this, Turkmenistan is prioritising water-saving technologies and strengthened legal frameworks for sustainable water management. Under a Presidential resolution, agricultural producers now receive 10-year preferential loans at 1-percent interest to purchase farm machinery and water-saving equipment.</p><p>Proactive measures are being taken to protect rare and endangered species. Turkmenistan collaborates closely with international conservation organisations, achieving notable successes - such as a leopard population recovery project, which has expanded their habitat beyond Turkmenistan into Kazakhstan's neighbouring Mangystau Region.</p><p>The country also holds significant renewable energy potential, particularly in solar and wind power. A hybrid solar-wind power plant has been built in western Turkmenistan to supply clean energy to communities along Lake Altyn Asyr.</p><p>A cornerstone of this initiative is the development of a solar energy roadmap, incorporating innovative urban solutions like Arkadag - Turkmenistan's first smart green city. The project envisions feasibility studies and a pilot urban solar plant, projected to generate over 4 GW annually thereby reducing national greenhouse gas emissions by over 3,000 tonnes.</p><p>Four distinctive desert ecosystems - Bereketli Garagum, Gapla\\xF2gyr, Repetek, and Yeraji - are now included on the UNESCO World Heritage List. Encouragingly, private sector representatives are playing an increasingly active role in addressing environmental challenges. Across Turkmenistan's agriculture and industry, cutting-edge waste-free technologies are being introduced, dramatically reducing environmental impacts while boosting resource efficiency.</p><p>Colleagues, friends,</p><p>This year marks a historic milestone for Turkmenistan - the 30th anniversary of our Permanent Neutrality status. At the same time, we remain fully committed to active international cooperation in developing sustainable solutions.</p><p>Turkmenistan stands ready to champion joint initiatives focused on nature conservation, climate adaptation, and sustainable development. In closing, I wish all participants productive discussions.</p><p>Thank you for your attention.</p><p>(The Russian Government)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Within the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, and despite our comparatively low greenhouse gas emissions, Kyrgyzstan has voluntarily committed to reducing emissions by 16 percent by 2030, and, with the support of international donors, by up to 44 percent.

South Africa's theme points the way - solidarity, equality and sustainability. Reaching all three goals requires justice. Justice for the developing world - and justice in particular for Africa and the Africans.</p><p>So many of the global challenges we face are deeply rooted in the injustice that the African continent historically suffered. Being from Portugal, the last colonial country in Africa, I know exactly what I am talking about.</p><p>And indeed the challenges are here in front of us.</p><p>From poverty, hunger and inequalities...</p><p>To deepening conflicts and the climate crisis...</p><p>And at the same time, we recognize that the global governance institutions that reflect the world of 1945 and do not adequately serve or represent developing countries - in particular African countries.</p><p>Our inability to tackle these challenges and more is eroding people's faith in Governments and institutions. And so the message is clear: Our institutions need an update.</p><p>In November, leaders committed, in the Summit of the Future, to reforming the tools of global governance - from global financial institutions to the United Nations itself, in particular the UN Security Council, which lacks legitimacy and effectiveness.</p><p>This agenda of reform was clearly reflected in the Pact for the Future, which was adopted at the UN Summit of the Future.</p><p>And you are critical to bringing that Pact to life and helping to lead this process of reform and renewal.</p><p>How can we do that?</p><p>First - the G20 must lead on delivering financial justice.</p><p>As you know well, financing is fundamental.</p><p>From inclusive economic growth, to supporting industrialization and food security, or addressing inequalities.</p><p>The Pact for the Future includes commitments that provide a road map to reform global financial institutions.</p><p>These institutions must represent today's economy - not the world of decades past. And developing countries must be represented fairly in their governance.</p><p>These institutions must also protect economies - particularly vulnerable ones - from global shocks.</p><p>It is time to mend and strengthen the global safety net that during the Covid we detected that it was no longer fit for purpose.</p><p>And we need to mobilize finance at scale to close the Sustainable Development Goals financing gap.</p><p>This means substantially increasing the capital and lending capacity of multilateral development banks, making them bigger and bolder.</p><p>And allow me a personal note. We are all aware that there is not enough money to address all the challenges that we face. Development challenges, climate challenges, many other dramatic problems that our world is full of.</p><p>And when we do not have enough money, the capacity to multiply the money that exits becomes vital. And that is where I truly believe that an enhanced role of multilateral development banks is absolutely crucial.</p><p>When your country puts $1 in a project of support in some place of the world, $1 is $1. If the same country puts $1 in the capital of the multilateral development bank, that $1 is 5, 7, depending now on how the bank has access to financial markets.</p><p>And indeed I am a true believer that we need to make a strong bet in making bigger and bolder, our multilateral development banks, and that the capitalization of the banks is one of the key instruments.</p><p>And if I remember well [from] my times as the Prime Minister, when you put some capital in an international financial institution, you do not need to put it in the deficit of your budgets, so there is another advantage for using this kind of mechanisms to multiply the resources that we have and we recognize are not enough for all the challenges that we face.</p><p>At the same time, it's very important to boost concessional funding, but to take into account that not only gross domestic product (GDP) must be the metrics, it's very important to look especially also at vulnerability, and we have just approved at the General Assembly a comprehensive vulnerability index.</p><p>At the same time, we need action to make the debt resolution architecture work in a more timely and effective manner. We need meaningful solutions to address the debt crisis, so countries can invest in meeting the basic needs of their people and drive long-term development.</p><p>The Pact for the Future includes a proposal for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to lead a review of ways to strengthen and improve the sovereign debt architecture in collaboration with key partners.</p><p>I recognize all the efforts the G20 has made in relation to the so-called framework. But let's be clear, we are far from having an instrument able to address the debt problem that exits at global level.</p><p>A number of examples are positive, but examples do not represent the total reality that we face.</p><p>And July's conference on Financing for Development in Spain is a critical opportunity to make progress in all these key areas. And I urge finance ministries and central banks to fully engage in the preparations for this conference, so leaders can arrive prepared to advance high-impact solutions on financing for development.</p><p>One of the problems that we still have in international institutions, and I was Prime Minister and I know how difficult it is to coordinate the Government when you have different ministries with different views.</p><p>The truth is that in many of these institutions, countries are represented by different ministries and so the capacity to have ministers of finance fully engaged in the preparation of these international conferences, to make sure that what makes things move is part of the agenda, is absolutely essential.</p><p>Second - we need the G20 to lead on delivering climate justice.</p><p>Many vulnerable countries are being forced to respond to a crisis they did nothing to create. Meanwhile, they lack the necessary financial support to seize the benefits of clean energy to spur prosperity and eliminate poverty.</p><p>As the world's top emitters, G20 countries must lead the way in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. But recognizing that every G20 country have to do more in the reduction of emissions.</p><p>By next year, every Government must deliver new economy-wide national climate plans and align with limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C.</p><p>These new plans must cover all emissions and the whole economy, accelerate a just fossil fuel phase out, and contribute to the energy transition goals agreed at the twenty-eighth UN Climate Change Conference.</p><p>At the same time, we need developed countries supporting developing ones with adequate, affordable, and accessible finance and technology.</p><p>Through meaningful contributions to the new loss and damage fund...</p><p>By doubling adaptation finance by next year, as promised...</p><p>And by forging new partnerships - like the Just Energy Transition Partnership - that South Africa is a pioneer - to pave the way to a renewable future for all countries, swiftly and fairly.</p><p>And we must also ensure that Africa's critical mineral resources - that can power the renewables revolution worldwide - benefit Africans first and most.</p><p>We cannot repeat the mistakes of the past.</p><p>The UN Panel on Critical Energy Transition Minerals, co-chaired by South Africa and the European Union, identified a set of principles and recommendations to empower communities, create accountability, and ensure that clean energy drives equitable and resilient growth, with maximum added value in producing countries.</p><p>And third - we need the G20 to lead on technological justice. From digital technology to artificial intelligence (AI), the developing world needs to access and benefit from the technological revolution.</p><p>At September's Summit of the Future, world leaders endorsed the Global Digital Compact to spur progress across all these areas.</p><p>The Compact includes the first universal agreement on the international governance of artificial intelligence, ensuring that every country has a seat at the AI table. It calls for an independent international scientific panel on AI and initiating a global dialogue on its governance within the United Nations. And it requests options for innovative voluntary financing for AI capacity-building in developing countries.</p><p>We need the G20 supporting developing countries as they invest in the digitally driven systems and solutions that their people need to boost prosperity, create jobs and drive sustainable development.</p><p>Across all these areas, you - as G20 sherpas, finance ministries and central bank representatives - are essential in helping to set the agenda and ensure that resources are aligned globally and nationally to bring it to life.</p><p>I look forward to working with the G20 presidency of South Africa to help transform the words and commitments of the Pact into results for all countries.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["One of the problems that we still have in international institutions, and I was Prime Minister and I know how difficult it is to coordinate the Government when you have different ministries with different views.

But, as we approach the possibility of seismic shifts in British voting patterns, it is crucial to caution: a party's green sheen should not allow us to drop our guard, particularly when figures like Zack Polanski, a recent arrival to prominence within the Greens, arise as potential leaders.

And so, with your permission I would like to address the distinguished members by simply saying dear colleagues. Dumelang. [Good day.]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I wish to begin by expressing my deepest gratitude to His Majesty King Letsie III, and to the people of Lesotho for your warm welcome. I am honoured to be in the Kingdom of Lesotho more than 20 years after the visit of my dear friend and predecessor Kofi Annan. And I am honoured to address this Parliament as you celebrate the bicentenary of the Basotho nation.</p><p>Two centuries ago, as profound upheaval was reshaping southern Africa, King Moshoeshoe charted a revolutionary path. While others chose conflict, he embraced dialogue. When faced with hostility, he responded with wisdom and courage His vision transcended the challenges of his time - transforming this great land into a sanctuary of peace through diplomatic and moral courage.</p><p>By welcoming displaced communities and building bridges across divides, he showed the world how diversity can strengthen the fabric of nationhood. The principles he embodied - human dignity, diplomacy and the courage to embrace differences - lie at the heart of our shared aspirations at the United Nations.</p><p>Lesotho's partnership with the United Nations began even before your independence. In 1963, the General Assembly adopted a landmark resolution that warned against any attempt to annex or encroach upon the territorial integrity of Basutoland. That principled stand of the international community reaffirmed your inalienable right to self-determination and independence. And three years later, Lesotho joined the UN as a sovereign State.</p><p>Since then, you have been an unwavering voice for peace - honouring King Moshoeshoe's legacy of dialogue and solidarity. Your consistent support for multilateral solutions shows that a nation's true strength lies in its principles.</p><p>For all these reasons, I am especially honoured to convey a message not only to the people of Lesotho, but to Africa and indeed the world. A message of solidarity and justice for this great continent. We all know Africa's enormous potential.</p><p>But, let's be clear: deep injustices are denying Africa's rightful place on the world stage. These injustices share a common root: a global system designed without African voices; maintained without African participation; and perpetuated despite African protests.</p><p>When a continent that is home to nearly a fifth of humanity, remains systematically excluded from global decision-making, we must call this what it is: A relic of colonialism that has no place in today's world. Start with the UN Security Council. Nearly 80 years after its creation, Africa still awaits even a single permanent seat.</p><p>This hurts Africa, but it also hurts the Council - its effectiveness, its legitimacy and its credibility. From Sudan to the Sahel, conflicts rage and communities suffer. These crises demand not just global attention, they demand African leadership. Yet, Africa has no permanent voice when the world decides on matters of war and peace... in Africa, through the Security Council. That is unacceptable - and it must change. But we must also act to correct the injustices across many other fronts.</p><p>First, financial justice. The current international financial system is outdated, dysfunctional and unfair - to Africa and beyond. It was built for the world of 1945, not the twenty-first century. The current system not only reflects historical injustices - it exacerbates them.</p><p>Today, so many countries across Africa must choose between servicing debt and realizing their people's rights and needs. Their legitimate development aspirations are subject to credit ratings that do not reflect the enormous potential of the African continent.</p><p>African nations pay up to eight times more for borrowing than developed countries. So, for every dollar that a country like Lesotho spends on education or infrastructure, disproportionate sums are drained away in interest payments - with 11 per cent of your budget going into debt servicing. It is time to change it.</p><p>And the Pact for the Future adopted by the General Assembly in September charts a new course. It calls for reforming and boosting the lending capacity of Multilateral Development Banks, it calls for an Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) Stimulus Plan of $500 billion a year for developing countries, and it calls for comprehensive debt relief.</p><p>And until now, the framework created by the Group of 20 (G20) has been applied to four countries. There are so many more that need debt relief, and I would say deserve debt relief because they are not responsible for the conditions that led to the high levels of debt that they face.</p><p>Africa's perspective and leadership must guide these reforms, to help create a system that serves all countries, not just the privileged few. And Lesotho has an important voice in advocating for these changes - a voice rooted in its proud history of resilience and justice.</p><p>Second, climate justice. Climate change is destroying our planet - from the snow-capped peaks of the Maluti Mountains to the sinking islands of the Pacific. Rising temperatures, extreme weather and soil erosion are threatening agricultural productivity and food security. Families are grappling with food shortages, water scarcity and the loss of livelihoods.</p><p>The continent accounts for less than 4 per cent of global carbon emissions - but suffers from some of the most devastating climate impacts. The environmental damage and lost productivity cost African economies billions each year - yet you receive only a fraction of global climate finance. In short: you are paying twice for a crisis that you did not cause. This is profoundly unfair.</p><p>Africa must not be forced to choose between economic development and climate action. The continent's vast renewable energy potential, from solar to wind to hydropower - and Lesotho is a fantastic example of that potential - remains largely untapped, while 600 million Africans still lack access to electricity.</p><p>A just transition means investing in renewable technologies, providing concessional finance for green investments and supporting the transfer of knowledge and technologies. And no other country would use better these instruments than Lesotho. You have demonstrated it in the past, I am sure you will do it in the future.</p><p>We need solidarity and justice in action, not just words. The Loss and Damage Fund must be operationalized swiftly and funded generously by those most responsible for climate destruction. And allow me to tell you a true story. The Loss and Damage Funds was a strong, strong demand of developing countries. So much loss and damage are taking place in the world. And it is fair that those who have responsibility about that loss and damage contribute to the response that is needed to avoid loss and to correct the causes of damage.</p><p>Now, when the Loss and Damage Fund was created there was a number of countries that have pledged support to the Loss and Damage Fund. And we could imagine when one sees the dimension of the loss of damage in the world that it would be a massive amount of money. Now the truth is, the amount pledged when the Loss and Damage Fund was created is exactly corresponding to the sum of the 10 annual salaries of the 10 most well-paid football players in the world. And we can see that we are far from having a serious commitment to the Loss and Damage Fund, and this must be quickly corrected.</p><p>Developed countries must meet their commitments to double adaptation finance to at least $40 billion a year by next year and deliver the promised $300 billion annually for climate finance that were approved now in the last Conference of the Parties.</p><p>Landlocked and least developed countries like yours are especially vulnerable. And they require special support and easier access to finance and technology. We cannot treat the same way a least developed land-locked country as we treat a middle-income country, even if the middle-income country still has a number of difficulties.</p><p>And we must also enhance regional cooperation for climate-resilient development. The Lesotho Highlands Water Project is a perfect example - and I look forward to visiting the Katse Dam tomorrow.</p><p>Justice for Africa also means justice and opportunities for all Africans. By respecting, protecting and promoting human rights; by harnessing the energy, innovation and aspirations of the world's youngest population. including in Lesotho, you have an enormous potential and you are young people, but this economic global system must create the conditions for job to be available for that group of young people that is the future richness of your country.</p><p>Two thirds of your population is under the age of 30; that it is an enormous potential, but it needs to be properly invested, and for that, international support is necessary.</p><p>On the other hand, by confronting health challenges with renewed determination - particularly HIV/AIDS, which continues to affect too many families in Lesotho and across the continent; by pursuing disability inclusion; and by advancing gender equality.</p><p>No society can thrive while half its population is held back. Eliminating gender-based violence and child marriages, closing the education gap and offering equal opportunities are not just moral imperatives - they are essential for sustainable development in all countries in the continent and in the world.</p><p>Gender equality is fundamentally a question of power - and a means of redefining and transforming power that will yield benefits for all. We need bold, systemic change, including through affirmative measures such as quotas, to ensure women have a voice and can meaningfully participate in decision-making. And the United Nations is your partner in the journey toward sustainable and inclusive development.</p><p>Your role transcends these chambers. You represent the hopes and aspirations of all Basotho people. Through your legislative power, you can shape a prosperous and equitable future; invest in clean energy and climate resilience; advance economic transformation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals; champion good governance, transparency and accountability; and leave no one behind - including women and girls, young people and persons with disabilities.</p><p>Your parliamentary diplomacy serves as a bridge, connecting Lesotho's aspirations with regional and global partnerships. Your history as a nation is one of courage and perseverance. Your rich natural resources, your location at the heart of Southern Africa and your commitment to sustainable development put you in a unique position. As you celebrate your bicentenary, you have the chance to build a new legacy for future generations. And in doing so, Lesotho is not alone.</p><p>Across the continent, nations are rising, drawing strength from their history, their culture, and their shared aspirations. Together, Africa is crafting a vision of transformation, built on the foundations of justice and solidarity.</p><p>This is your moment to show the world that from the challenges of today, a new era of hope and equality can be born. As you say in Sesotho: \"Mohale o tsoa maroleng\" - heroes emerge from the dust. May we find in this ancient wisdom the courage to face our shared future. And forge a heroic response worthy of the peoples' aspirations:Khotso, Pula, Nala. [Peace, Rain, Prosperity - the national motto]. Kea leboha.

This could not be more timely. There is much uncertainty and instability in our world. But, today, we meet in the wake of some good news.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Just this morning, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) officially confirmed that 2024 was a record year for renewables additions to global power capacity. Renewables represented more than 92 per cent of all new electricity-generation capacity installed last year.</p><p>The amount of renewables added represents more than the total electricity capacity of Brazil and Japan combined. Europe's capacity grew by 9 per cent - with Germany contributing more than one quarter of that growth. Africa's capacity grew by almost 7 per cent.</p><p>All of this is another reminder of a twenty-first century truth: Renewables are renewing economies. They are powering growth, creating jobs, lowering energy bills and cleaning our air. And every day, they become an even smarter investment.</p><p>Since 2010, the average cost of wind power has plunged 60 per cent. Solar is 90 per cent cheaper. In 2023, clean energy sectors accounted for 5 per cent of economic growth in India and 6 [per cent] in the United States. It accounted for a fifth of China's GDP [gross domestic product] growth, and a third of the European Union's.</p><p>The economic case for - and opportunities of - climate action have become ever clearer - particularly for those who choose to lead. And leadership is what we need - as today's IRENA report shows:</p><p>To accelerate the shift to renewables and to correct the imbalances in the transition, which is still starving developing countries - outside China - of the investment needed to fully embrace clean energy.</p><p>As the title of this session puts it so well: we are indeed at a turning point to the future. In the 10 years since Paris, we have seen other important progress.

But, it requires urgent action. And it requires leadership. I see two critical fronts to drive action.</p><p>First, new national climate plans - or NDCs - due by September. Investors need certainty and predictability. These new plans are a unique opportunity to deliver and lay out a coherent vision for a just green transition. They must align with the 1.5\\xB0C limit, as agreed at COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]. And cover all emissions and the whole economy.</p><p>Together, they must reduce global emissions 60 per cent by 2035 compared to 2019 and contribute to the COP28 global energy transition goals.</p><p>All this must be achieved in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of national circumstances but everybody, everybody must do more. The Group of 20 (G20) - the largest emitters and economies - must lead.</p><p>Every country must step up and play their part. The United Nations is with you all. President Lula and I are working to secure the highest ambition from the largest economies.</p><p>The United Nations Climate Promise is supporting 100 countries to prepare their new climate plans.

The COP29 finance agreement must be implemented in full. I count on the leadership of the COP29 and COP30 presidencies to deliver a credible road map to mobilize $1.3 trillion a year by 2035.</p><p>We need new and innovative sources of financing, and credible carbon pricing. Developed countries must honour their promise to double adaptation finance to at least $40 billion a year, by this year.</p><p>And we need serious contributions to the fund for responding to loss and damage, and to get it up and running.</p><p>We can only meet these goals with stronger collaboration between Governments, and across society and sectors.

He had witnessed the tropical cyclone Chido crawling over the rooftops of houses he had always known. On December 14, 2024, after devastating the island of Mayotte, the cyclone hit the islands of Anjouan and Moh\\xE9li, causing floods, landslides, blackouts, and leaving families homeless. For small farmers, the impact was particularly severe: in a country where most people rely on subsistence agriculture, cyclone Chido caused extensive damage to crop. Today, months after the storm, the scars are still visible and, with the tropical cyclone season still underway, the fear of another catastrophe looms.</p><p>Nestled between Madagascar and Mozambique in the Indian Ocean, Comoros is among the world's most climate-vulnerable countries. More than half of its population-i.e., 54.2%-lives in at-risk areas and is particularly susceptible to natural disasters. In this part of the globe, climate change has increased the frequency and severity of cyclones, torrential rainfalls, and severe droughts. These disasters have tragically impacted the lives and livelihoods of vulnerable populations already living in poverty, disrupting basic infrastructures and public services and sometimes wiping out hard-earned development gains.</p><p>Readiness saves lives</p><p>In the wake of cyclone Chido, the Comorian authorities, with the support of the World Bank, swiftly mobilized emergency relief-food, water, temporary shelters, and emergency kits-to help the affected families. This quick reaction was made possible by Comoros's operational and financial emergency response system, which has been built by learning from previous disasters and aims at being capable of offering timely support to the population when a shock occurs.</p><p>In September 2024, Comoros, alongside Madagascar and Mozambique, joined the Regional Emergency Preparedness and Access to Inclusive Recovery Program (REPAIR), a regional climate risk fund established as a partnership between African Risk Capacity Limited (ARC Ltd, the African insurance risk pool) and the World Bank. This program, which is backed by a $926 million envelope from the International Development Association (IDA)/International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and Global Shield Financing Facility, is supporting 12 African countries in strengthening their financial preparedness to climate disasters and enabling them to deliver prompt assistance to the populations in distress. The REPAIR program is thus pioneering a truly African disaster response system through a platform that showcases how countries can join forces by pooling funds and knowledge to address the common challenges caused by climate change.</p><p>The recent experience of Comoros, the first country to activate the REPAIR program in response to an emergency, underscored a crucial lesson: how and when assistance reaches those in need is just as important as the funding itself. Comoros's experience with REPAIR demonstrated that rapid, well-coordinated responses can make all the difference. The coordination between ministries, civil protection agencies, and local communities was instrumental in delivering aid effectively-whether to households, farmers, or small firms that play a key role in the recovery process.</p><p>As Country Manager for Comoros, Boubacar-Sid had a chance to witness where the help went. The reality is that no one ever knows when the next disaster will strike. But what we do know is that preparedness saves lives. Working hand in hand with partner countries, we can provide better protection for vulnerable populations and lay the groundwork for inclusive recovery.</p><p>Over the rainbow</p><p>Looking forward, cyclone-hit Comoros has been capitalizing on its achievements with REPAIR by investing in climate resilience and improving contingency planning with experts from ARC Ltd. The goal is clear: to be better prepared before the next disaster hits. This March, Comoros will share its experience with nine other African countries at a regional workshop entirely dedicated to disaster risk finance organized in South Africa. This event will be a key milestone in accelerating climate adaptation efforts by bringing countries together to discuss strategies for a more resilient and livable planet.</p><p>The road ahead is challenging, but the actions taken today will shape the future. For Comoros and many vulnerable nations, resilience is not just an option-it is a necessity.

At least 242 million students globally had their education disrupted by extreme weather in 2024, according to UNICEF. That includes heat waves, tropical cyclones, storms, floods and droughts - all of which are intensifying with climate change. Almost three quarters of the affected students live in low- and lower-middle-income countries.</p><p>'It can be life-altering'</p><p>Around a billion children are living in countries extremely vulnerable to environmental and climate shocks, said UNICEF, where events like storms or floods often upend lives, destroying entire neighborhoods, roads or even schools. School buildings that do stay intact sometimes double as shelters, which also delays the return to classes.</p><p>Though some educational facilities could technically stay open during events like heat waves, high temperatures can make it difficult for students to focus or take in information.</p><p>\"It can be a small event, but it can also be life-altering,\" said Megan Kuhfeld, a senior research scientist at NWEA, a company providing education services in the US. \"For many children, routine and predictability are more important than for adults.

In 2009, two major typhoons, Ketsana and Parma, interrupted her schooling in a way that trickled down for years.</p><p>\"When it was time to apply for universities, there was a big chunk of stuff we hadn't learned. So, we had to do a crash course just to be able to take the entrance exams,\" said Tan, who went on to study at the University of the Philippines Diliman.</p><p>NWEA's Kuhfeld analyzed different US studies that examine the correlation between the time students were absent from school - not necessarily because of climate extremes - and how far behind they are in their learning.</p><p>She found that length of absence and impact on learning didn't map onto each other one to one. So, for example, a week of missed classes could set students back several weeks depending on their circumstances.</p><p>One thing that does play a role in the impact of missing classes is how far a child is in their school career. Middle school curricula are more advanced than elementary ones, building on what students already know. So missing classes then makes it harder to keep up.</p><p>However, Kuhfeld also noted that the studies she analyzed on absenteeism due to inclement weather observed more significant learning setbacks than the other studies. Possibly because many of these students are also dealing with the stress of recovering from a natural disaster.</p><p>\"This is probably picking up on the fact that it's not just about missing school. There are other mental health aspects at play,\" she said.</p><p>Back to school.

In Pakistan's Sindh Province, Britto said she saw how hard it was for girls to stay engaged after floods closed their schools because their education is already not being promoted very much.</p><p>In the Philippines, climate activist Tan knows of low-income students who must choose between returning to class or supporting their families.</p><p>\"If their house has been completely flooded and destroyed, it's very hard to ask the student to go to school and learn about something that seems so far removed from their reality,\" she said.</p><p>How to make education more resilient as the planet heats up</p><p>Education experts agree that the school system has to become more climate resilient, though that is also a question of finances.</p><p>In many ways, they can prepare to be more flexible. Schools can come up with contingency plans if the building is damaged, like moving classes to churches or public halls. They can also adapt the school calendar to avoid months where extreme weather is more likely.</p><p>Heat waves have disrupted schools in the Philippines partly because the calendar had been altered to synchronize it with other countries. That meant students are in class during the peak of the dry, hot season in April and May. Now the government is changing the schedule back.</p><p>However, the most important step is to make schools and students resilient. That means climate-proofing the buildings by insulating them or building them with materials that naturally regulate temperature, elevating them to protect them from flooding and building sturdier roofs to withstand cyclone winds.</p><p>It also means arming students with better information about climate change in the curricula. That way they can make sense of what happened to them and the role that burning fossil fuels played in causing climate change and fueling extreme weather.</p><p>\"It's important they learn about it in a contextualized way so that they see it's something that cuts across all sectors of life and that they can participate in policymaking and policy changing,\" said Tan. \"They represent the generations forward.\"</p><p>Source: DW - Deutsche Welle</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["\"For many children, routine and predictability are more important than for adults.

It is important to note that even 1.5\\xB0C of warming will entail mass displacement, harm to livelihoods, and loss of life, with lower-income countries the worst affected. At present, the world is on track for an increase of 2.6 to 3.1\\xB0C this century.</p><p>3. What's on the agenda this year?</p><p>COP29 has been called the finance COP, due to its focus on scaling up climate finance. Climate finance refers to the funding that is needed to help lower-income countries transition to zero-carbon economies, and to help the most affected communities adapt to the effects of climate change. A major objective of COP29 is to increase this funding and to produce a new goal for future climate finance.</p><p>4. Where will that money come from?</p><p>Under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement, the funding must come from the high-income countries that are historically most responsible for climate change. In addition, under international human rights law, all states in a position to do so must also contribute.</p><p>In addition to setting a financial target, COP29 negotiators must also agree clear timeframes for the provision of funds to lower-income countries. Money should be given in the form of grants, not loans, to avoid worsening existing debt crises.</p><p>5. What should the funds be used for?</p><p>This target should also contain sub-goals to make clear where the money should go. For example, Amnesty International is also calling for the target to include loss and damage finance. This is essentially compensation, paid by high-income countries to lower income ones, to help them recover from the existing impacts of climate change, and from others that they will unavoidably face in the future.</p><p>One of the Azerbaijan presidency's more positive moves has been to make adaptation, long sidelined in climate negotiations, a priority of the talks. While preventing further climate change through a full, fast fair and funded phase -out of fossil fuels is critical, the reality is that climate change is already here. Helping people adjust to existing and future impacts of global warming is a crucial part of climate justice.</p><p>6. How much money is needed?</p><p>Trillions of dollars are needed to help lower-income states carry out the climate action needed, including transitioning away from fossil fuels in a way that protects peoples' rights. Amnesty International and others in the climate justice movement are calling for a target of at least 1 trillion USD annually.</p><p>Azerbaijan has an alarming human rights record, with longstanding restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly.</p><p>7. What are Amnesty's human rights concerns regarding Azerbaijan?</p><p>Azerbaijan has an alarming human rights record, with longstanding restrictions on the rights to freedom of expression, association and assembly. Peaceful protests, including those held by environmental groups, are routinely met with violent suppression, and according to the local NGOs more than 300 people are currently imprisoned on politically motivated charges. The work of independent media outlets in Azerbaijan is severely hampered by draconian laws, and the constant threat of retaliation for any real or perceived criticism of the authorities. Most independent media outlets have been crushed out of existence, as have vast swathes of Azerbaijan's civil society. Torture and other ill-treatment in detention are widespread in Azerbaijan, and impunity is entrenched.</p><p>8. Have there been any improvements since Azerbaijan was given the COP29 Presidency?</p><p>No. In fact, the grave human rights situation in Azerbaijan has worsened sincethe country was announced as the host of COP29 in December 2023. The authorities claim they are ensuring everyone's voices are heard at the summit - but they have prosecuted more than a dozen activists and journalists this year, and silenced key voices on the climate crisis.</p><p>In April, for example, Azerbaijani authorities arrested human rights and climate justice activist Anar Mammadli on bogus smuggling charges, and placed him in pre-trial detention, where he remains. Anar Mammadli was among the first activists in Azerbaijan to speak about the connection between human rights and climate justice, and he has been involved in international advocacy at the EU and UN level. In prison he has been denied adequate medical treatment for several worsening health conditions, and he is facing a lengthy sentence.</p><p>9. How does the human rights situation in Azerbaijan affect COP29?</p><p>It is essential that civil society can participate in climate negotiations. Activists, union leaders, and human rights defenders help to advocate for ambitious targets and play a vital role in ensuring that the plans developed at COP29 align with governments' human rights obligations and that they are actually implemented. But the involvement of Azerbaijan's own civil society is likely to be extremely limited. Threats and harassment have forced many local activists to leave the country, while others are arbitrarily detained on politically motivated charges. The few remaining independent voices risk prosecution and retaliation if they dare to voice any criticism during COP29.</p><p>The void left by local civil society groups has been filled in part by organizations known as GONGOs (government-organized non-governmental organizations). These state-supported groups do not provide the independent perspectives needed, but their presence allows Azerbaijani authorities to project a false picture of respect for freedom of expression and association.</p><p>Amnesty International is monitoring the crackdown in Azerbaijan, and will continue to document violations, both during and after the summit.</p><p>10 .What about Azerbaijan's record on climate change?</p><p>Fossil fuel makes up about half of Azerbaijan's economy and the vast majority of its export revenues. The state-owned oil and gas company, SOCAR, is a major source of income for President Ilham Aliyev's government. Nonetheless, Azerbaijan must also do its fair share to achieve a fast and fair fossil fuel phase out; this means no new fossil fuel projects anywhere. But earlier this year, President Aliyev announced plans for expanding gas production which are grossly incompatible with Azerbaijan's commitments under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Like previous climate summits, COP29 will host many participants whose agendas are seriously at odds with climate justice. Thousands of fossil fuel lobbyists, along with the heads of oil giants like Shell and BP, are expected to be in attendance. These participants have used previous summits to advance their own interests, opposing essential efforts to phase out fossil fuels and pushing for false solutions like carbon offsetting. Amnesty International is calling for a robust conflict of interest policy to prevent fossil fuel lobbyists undermining the aims of global climate treaties.</p><p>11. How has climate change impacted people in 2024?</p><p>Climate change is causing a dramatic increase in the frequency of extreme temperatures, and 2024 is expected to be the hottest year ever recorded. Around the world, people have been displaced by floods, hurricanes, droughts and other unnatural disasters, all made worse by global warming. Worldwide, Indigenous Peoples and land-dependent communities continue to bear the heaviest burden of biodiversity loss.</p><p>Lives have been lost; livelihoods, languages, and entire cultures are in peril; and disease, hunger and displacement is causing extreme suffering. The cost of these losses amounts to trillions of dollars in damages, which dwarf the cost of current investments in renewable energy, and threaten governments' capacity to fund policies to protect human rights.</p><p>12. What is Amnesty calling for at COP29?</p><p>Human rights must be at the heart of all climate action decision-making; States in a position to do so must massively scale up climate finance and funding for loss and damage; All states must commit to fully phasing out fossil fuels, in a way that is fast and fair; COP29 participants must not chase risky technologies, like carbon capture and storage and removals, or push gas as a transition fuel, as a means of distracting from the urgent need to phase out fossil fuels; The UNFCCC Secretariat, the government of Azerbaijan, and other governments must protect civic space, and guarantee the rights to freedom of expression, association and peaceful assembly.

We have our work cut out for us.</p><p>Human rights are the oxygen of humanity. But, one by one, human rights are being suffocated. By autocrats, crushing opposition because they fear what a truly empowered people would do. By a patriarchy that keeps girls out of school, and women at arm's length from basic rights. By wars and violence that strip populations of their right to food, water and education. By warmongers who thumb their nose at international law, international humanitarian law and the UN Charter.</p><p>Human rights are being suffocated by the climate crisis. And by a morally bankrupt global financial system that too often obstructs the path to greater equality and sustainable development. By runaway technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) that hold great promise, but also the ability to violate human rights at the touch of a button. By growing intolerance against entire groups - from Indigenous Peoples, to migrants and refugees, to the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, queer, intersex and other identities (LGBTQI+) community, to persons with disabilities. And by voices of division and anger who view human rights not as a boon to humanity, but as a barrier to the power, profit and control they seek.</p><p>In short - human rights are on the ropes and being pummelled hard. This represents a direct threat to all of the hard-won mechanisms and systems established over the last 80 years to protect and advance human rights.</p><p>But, as the recently adopted Pact for the Future reminds us, human rights are, in fact, a source of solutions. The Pact provides a playbook on how we can win the fight for human rights on several fronts.</p><p>First - human rights through peace and peace through human rights. Conflicts inflict human rights violations on a massive scale. In the Occupied Palestinian Territory, violations of human rights have skyrocketed since the horrific Hamas attacks of 7 October 2023 and the intolerable levels of death and destruction in Gaza.</p><p>And I am gravely concerned by the rising violence in the occupied West Bank by Israeli settlers and other violations, as well as calls for annexation. We are witnessing a precarious ceasefire. We must avoid at all costs a resumption of hostilities. The people in Gaza have already suffered too much.</p><p>It's time for a permanent ceasefire, the dignified release of all remaining hostages, irreversible progress towards a two-State solution, an end to the occupation and the establishment of an independent Palestinian State, with Gaza as an integral part.</p><p>In Sudan, bloodshed, displacement and famine are engulfing the country. The warring parties must take immediate action to protect civilians, uphold human rights, cease hostilities and forge peace. And domestic and international human rights monitoring and investigation mechanisms should be permitted to document what is happening on the ground.</p><p>In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, we see a deadly whirlwind of violence and horrifying human rights abuses, amplified by the recent M23 [23 March Movement] offensive, supported by the Rwandan Defence Forces. As more cities fall, the risk of a regional war rises.</p><p>It's time to silence the guns. It's time for diplomacy and dialogue. The recent joint summit in the United Republic of Tanzania offered a way forward with a renewed call for an immediate ceasefire. The sovereignty and territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the Congo must be respected. The Congolese people deserve peace.</p><p>In the Sahel, I call for a renewed regional dialogue to protect citizens from terrorism and systemic violations of human rights, and to create the conditions for sustainable development.</p><p>In Myanmar, the situation has grown far worse in the four years since the military seized power and arbitrarily detained members of the democratically elected Government. We need greater cooperation to bring an end to the hostilities and forge a path towards an inclusive democratic transition and a return to civilian rule, allowing for the safe return of the Rohingya refugees.</p><p>And in Haiti, we are seeing massive human rights violations - including more than a million people displaced, and children facing a horrific increase in sexual violence and recruitment into gangs. In the coming days, I will put forward proposals to the United Nations Security Council for greater stability and security for the people of Haiti - namely through an effective UN assistance mechanism to support the Multilateral Security Support mission, the national police and Haitian authorities. A durable solution requires a political process - led and owned by the Haitian people - that restores democratic institutions through elections.</p><p>The Pact for the Future calls for peace processes and approaches rooted in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, international law and the UN Charter. It proposes specific actions to prioritize conflict prevention, mediation, resolution and peacebuilding. And it includes a commitment to tackle the root causes of conflict, which are so often enmeshed in denials of basic human needs and rights.</p><p>Second - the Pact for the Future advances human rights through development. The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and human rights are fundamentally intertwined. They represent real human needs - health, food, water, education, decent work and social protection.</p><p>With less than one fifth of the Goals on track, the Pact calls for a massive acceleration through an SDG Stimulus, reforming the global financial architecture, and taking meaningful action for countries drowning in debt. This must include focused action to conquer the most widespread human rights abuse in history - inequality for women and girls.</p><p>The Pact calls for investing in battling all forms of discrimination and violence against women and girls, and ensuring their meaningful participation and leadership across all walks of life. And along with the Declaration on Future Generations, the Pact calls for supporting the rights and futures of young people through decent work, removing barriers for youth participation, and enhancing training. And the Global Digital Compact calls on nations to champion young innovators, nurture entrepreneurial spirit and equip the next generation with digital literacy and skills.</p><p>Third - the Pact for the Future recognizes that the rule of law and human rights go hand-in-hand. The rule of law, when founded on human rights, is an essential pillar of protection. It shields the most vulnerable. It's the first line of defence against crime and corruption. It supports fair, just and inclusive economies and societies. It holds perpetrators of human rights atrocities to account. It enables civic space for people to make their voices heard - and for journalists to carry out their essential work, free from interference or threats. And it reaffirms the world's commitment to equal access to justice, good governance and transparent and accountable institutions.</p><p>Fourth - human rights through climate action. Last year was the hottest on record - capping the hottest decade on record. Rising heat, melting glaciers and hotter oceans are a recipe for disaster. Floods, droughts, deadly storms, hunger, mass displacement - our war on nature is also a war on human rights. We must choose a different path.</p><p>I salute the many Member States who legally recognize the right to a healthy environment - and I call on all countries to do the same. Governments must keep their promise to produce new, economy-wide national climate action plans this year, well ahead of thirtieth UN Climate Change Conference in Brazil. Those plans must limit the rise in global temperature to 1.5\\xB0C - including by accelerating the global energy transition.</p><p>We also need a surge in finance for climate action in developing countries, to adapt to global heating, slash emissions and accelerate the renewables revolution, which represents a massive economic opportunity. We must stand up to the misleading campaign of many in the fossil fuel industry and its enablers who are aiding and abetting this madness, while also protecting and defending those on the front lines of climate justice.</p><p>And fifth - human rights through stronger, better governance of technology. As fast-moving technologies expand into every aspect of our lives, I am deeply concerned about human rights being undermined.</p><p>At its best, social media is a meeting ground for people to exchange ideas and spark respectful debate. But, it can also be an arena of fiery combat and blatant ignorance. A place where the poisons of misinformation, disinformation, racism, misogyny and hate speech are not only tolerated - but often encouraged. Verbal violence online can easily spill into physical violence in real life.</p><p>Recent rollbacks on social media fact-checking and content moderation are reopening the floodgates to more hate, more threats and more violence. Make no mistake. These rollbacks will lead to less free speech, not more, as people become increasingly fearful to engage on these platforms. Meanwhile, the great promise of AI is matched by limitless peril to undermine human autonomy, human identity, human control - and yes, human rights.</p><p>In the face of these threats, the Global Digital Compact brings the world together to ensure that human rights are not sacrificed on the altar of technology. This includes working with digital companies and policymakers to extend human rights to every corner of cyberspace - including a new focus on information integrity across digital platforms.</p><p>The Global Principles for Information Integrity I launched last year will support and inform this work as we push for a more humane information ecosystem.</p><p>The Global Digital Compact also includes the first universal agreement on the governance of AI that brings every country to the table and commitments on capacity-building, so all countries and people benefit from AI's potential. By investing in affordable Internet, digital literacy and infrastructure. By helping developing countries use AI to grow small businesses, improve public services and connect communities to new markets. And by placing human rights at the centre of AI-driven systems.</p><p>The Pact's decisions to create an Independent International Scientific Panel on AI and an ongoing Global Dialogue that ensure all countries have a voice in shaping its future are important steps forward. We must implement them.</p><p>We can help end the suffocation of human rights by breathing life into the Pact for the Future and the work of this Council. Let's do that together. We don't have a moment to lose.</p><p>(United Nations News Centre)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["5\\xB0C - including by accelerating the global energy transition.

He said, What we decide here, will enable all of us, particularly those in the Global South, to not only take ambitious mitigation action but also adapt to Climate Change. This CoP is historic in this context.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Minister reiterated that the decisions on this forum should be guided by the core principles of Equity, Climate Justice and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities provided in the UNFCCC and its Paris Agreement. The context of different national circumstances, sustainable development goals and poverty eradication, particularly in respect of the Global South should not be lost sight of, he added.</p><p>India's statement noted that the high Carbon Emission Development Pathways of the Global North in past have left very little carbon space for the Global South. However, it read, the growth trajectories for fulfilling the primary needs of sustainable development and poverty eradication cannot be compromised. The Minister asserted, Despite not contributing to the problem, we in the Global South are bearing huge financial burden on account of climate actions for mitigation on the one hand, and losses and damages caused by climate change on the other, thus severely limiting our capacity to meet our developmental needs. But these have not dampened India's resolve and commitment to take ambitious climate actions.</p><p>Informing the gathering about India's initiatives towards combating Climate Change, Shri Singh said that the country has achieved the 2015 NDC targets on emission intensity reduction and non fossil based installed electricity generation capacity much earlier than 2030 and have further enhanced its ambition. The Minister talked about how India's Renewable Energy Capacity has nearly tripled from its 2014 levels and the country is on the course to achieve the 500 GW target by 2030. Further, he said, India has launched the Mission LiFE- Lifestyle for Environment to encourage the sustainable lifestyle practices at the global level. Mission LiFE inspires individuals, communities and societies to exercise choices and behaviours that focus on mindful utilisation of resources.</p><p>Talking about how India is at the forefront of pro-planet actions, Shri Singh stated, The campaign - 'Ek Ped Maa ke Naam' - was launched by Prime Minister Shri Narendra Modi, on World Environment Day 2024, wherein one billion saplings have been planted already. 'Plant4Mother', which exhorts everyone to plant a tree as a mark of love, respect and honour of our mother and Mother Earth has resonated across the spectrum because of its powerful, inspirational and emotional connect, the Minister added.</p><p>Furthermore, the Indian statement informed about its initiatives like the International Solar Alliance, Coalition for Disaster Resilience Infrastructure (CDRI), Global Biofuel Alliance, Leadership Group on Industry Transition and Resource Efficiency and Circular Economy Industry Coalition that have been launched with different partner countries, in pursuance of global climate actions.</p><p>India called out some of the developed countries that have resorted to unilateral measures making climate actions more difficult for the Global South. Raising of climate ambitions to align with Paris Temperature Goals has to be preceded by free availability of green technologies, producing them on scale and availability of finance for their deployment, particularly in the Global South. The statement read, The emergent situation we are in, there is no option but to break all barriers to flow of technology, finances and capacity to the Global South. The theme of this CoP - 'enabling actions and enhanced ambition' is very relevant in this context.

Participating Nations had to deliberate on the expectations on the UAE 'Just Transition Work' programme, and how can it serve as an effective tool for assisting Parties in further defining and implementing their climate plans in the context of just transition pathways that promote sustainable development and poverty eradication. The Parties were expected to engage on how can international cooperation and support on the full range of means of implementation assist them to advance their just transition pathways in the context of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Leading the intervention,Secretary (MoEFCC) &amp; Dy. Leader of Indian Delegation, Ms. Leena Nandan, thankedall Parties for their recognition of the importance of justice in climate action. She clarified that India's interpretation of 'Just Transitions' is far broader than the narrow framing of the questions. Ms. Nandan said. Global climate justice is at the core of our work here under the Convention and its Paris Agreement. The principles of equity and Common But Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC) are foundational to all work under the Convention and its Paris Agreement.</p><p>India's intervention reminded all Parties that it is high time that these principles are actually well understood by all in context of the global climate action. It stated, The principles have embedded within themselves the historical emissions and consequent responsibilities on parties and the aspirations of development for the developing countries. Development is the over-riding priority for countries of the global South. The fact of stark inequalities in access to energy, infrastructure, amenities, and well-being are not hidden from the world. Developing countries like India have per capita energy consumption at one third of the global average, not to compare with the average of the developed countries, which is much higher.</p><p>Clearly stating India's stance on 'Just Transitions', the intervention said, Our understanding and operationalisation of just transitions must foreground the fact of these vastly different starting points and national circumstance. At CoP27, it was decided that the issues of just transition are not very narrow, but are linked to wider economic and social aspects of the transition, among others. The denial of international equity narrows our domestic options and poses further challenges to our objectives of achieving immediate, rapid, and sustained access to development opportunities and affects the most vulnerable communities in our countries the most.</p><p>Therefore, the statement read, the global dimensions of just transitions must be recognised and reflected in the work being undertaken at COP29. In the spirit of international cooperation that is embedded in this multilateral process, our discussion here must include discussion of key enablers and disenablers of global just transitions, it added. India's intervention called all Parties to discuss the following:</p><p>- Unilateral coercive measures that restrict trade flows and restrict countries from accessing equitable development opportunities.</p><p>- Intellectual Property Rights on green technologies, which hinders their free and scalable access to developing countries.</p><p>- Carbon debt that is owed by Developed countries to Developing countries for their overuse of the global carbon budget. Monetization of this carbon debt would be in trillions.</p><p>- Science that guides all climate discourse - whether it is based on considerations of global equity and environmental justice?</p><p>- How the inequity continues to be perpetuated in the climate discourse.</p><p>- The choices of citizens in Developed countries being sacrosanct vs the costs imposed on the citizens of Developing countries due to transition.</p><p>- Promotion of sustainable lifestyles that we all agreed to at the United Nations Environment Assembly in Nairobi this year.</p><p>India reminded all the Parties that a frank discussion of these issues and their inclusion in the decisions taken at CoP29 will be the cornerstone of building trust that would unlock a truly equitable and just global transition.</p><p>Therefore, the statement read, We feel it is premature to discuss just transition pathways in context of NDCs and NAPs. Just transition has to begin with transition in Developed countries.We underscore the need forDeveloped countries to take lead in transitions to achieve net zero emissions by end of this decade not only to provide carbon space for Developing countries, but also to lower the costs of transition unduly put on citizen of Developing countries.</p><p>India asserted that provision of adequate means of implementation is the most critical enabler for just transitions. At the same time, transitions in Developing countries should not be seen as investment opportunities. They undermine the 'just' element of just transitions by making the victim pay up for remedies rather than providing him the remedy.</p><p>Mincing no words in saying that Just transitions must be Just, India's intervention noted that all Parties must work with the aim to strengthening the work programme implementation. At the same time CBDR-RC, equity and climate justice should be core for discussions of just transitions pathways and should not be seen as another platform to push for prescriptive top-down approaches in disregard to the nationally determined nature of transition pathways.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Ms. Nandan said.
