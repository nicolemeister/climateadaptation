More systematic risk assessments are needed to make affected regions more resilient.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In many parts of Europe, summer 2022 has been brutal: long periods of drought combined with record high temperatures. Heat waves, water shortages and forest fires are particularly affecting Southern, Western and Central Europe. Such weather extremes, which are mutually reinforcing, affect a wide range of sectors and systems -- healthcare, agriculture, food production, energy supply and ecosystems, as well as the wider economy and society.</p><p>Large financial losses due to extreme heat and drought</p><p>To better understand the consequences of such extreme climatic events in different areas, researchers from the Department of Geography at the University of Zurich (UZH) analyzed eight extreme heat and drought events in Europe, Australia and Africa occurring during the last 20 years. Besides examining the direct and indirect consequences for various sectors and systems, they also studied the impact of responses to such events. \"The financial losses, for example, can be substantial,\" says Laura Niggli, first author of the study. \"In the cases studied they ranged from several hundred million to several billion US dollars.\" In extreme cases such as the 2019/2020 Australian bushfires, losses were up to approximately 100 billion US dollars, which is equivalent to over 5 percent of Australia's GDP.</p><p>Additional damage due to cascade effects</p><p>As the researchers show, the effects of simultaneous heat and drought are not limited to just their individual direct effects on different areas. \"We identified an interconnected web of sectors that interact in direct and indirect ways, which causes additional loss and damage in several other sectors, particularly health, energy, agriculture and food supply,\" says PhD candidate Niggli. It is this multi-layered interconnectedness that makes the risks of extreme events so complex -- and critical. The cascading effects spread across numerous sectors and can have far-reaching consequences for essential systems. \"Simultaneous weather extremes are potentially capable of destabilizing entire societally-important systems, such as global trade,\" Niggli points out.</p><p>The analysis also shows that adaptation measures taken against extreme heat and drought events were mostly reactive and of limited scope. In several cases, the scientists found evidence of misalignment of measures: that is, actions taken by one sector sometimes had negative effects on other sectors, particularly on the energy and water sectors, the economy, society, culture and ecosystems.</p><p>More systematic risk assessment for better adaptability</p><p>The researchers make the case that in the future, risk assessment should not just take into account the consequences of extreme events on individual sectors, but should systematically consider the interconnectedness of sectors and systems. This would help to improve the adaptability and resilience of the affected regions. \"This is especially important as in the future we are likely to see unprecedented, combined extreme events with cascading effects exceeding all previous historical cases. These effects need to be carefully analyzed to support the planning of adaptive and reactive measures,\" says UZH professor of geography Christian Huggel, who led the study.</p><p>As the climate gets warmer, extreme heat and drought events will happen more and more often, be more intense and last longer.

In the decade since, these extreme weather events have only intensified.</p><p>The world's driest inhabited continent, Australia is among the nations most vulnerable to climate change. East coast towns were submerged by once-in-a-millennium floods in March and April. Around 90% of the Great Barrier Reef succumbed to yet another mass bleaching event this year due to heat stress.</p><p>Polls show that most Australians want government to take action to mitigate worsening climate impacts. Yet those demands have barely registered in debates ahead of the election.</p><p>So why are Australian lawmakers silent on climate?</p><p>For one, Australia is the world's second-biggest exporter of coal, the world's dirtiest fossil fuel. It might be a dying industry, with new renewable energy half the price of coal or gas power in Europe, but the country's all-powerful mining lobby continues to obstruct attempts to limit emission reductions - and an exit from fossil fuels.</p><p>As the country burns and waterfront mansions wash into the sea, neither the ruling coalition government - comprising the conservative Liberal Party and National Party - nor the opposition Labor Party want to threaten mining jobs, especially in key marginal seats that could decide the election.</p><p>While a market-driven energy transition is happening at home - renewables provided five times more power than gas in 2021 - action to limit global heating has been a political poisoned chalice. It's an issue that has collapsed successive governments during the so-called climate wars.</p><p>Climate wars derail action</p><p>A decade ago, myself and my climate-conscious friends rejoiced when the governing Labor Party instituted a carbon pricing system and a super tax on mining industry profits.</p><p>But such rare ambition was immediately rolled back when the Liberal Party's arch climate skeptic, Tony Abbott, was elected prime minister in 2013.</p><p>Now led by Liberal leader Scott Morrison - the man who infamously cuddled a chunk of coal in parliament - the ruling coalition has become a global climate pariah.

Altogether 3,400 rai of forest on the mountain top was consumed in the blaze which was extinguished about 2am in the following day.</p><p> It was said to be the worst fire to hit the park in nearly two decades. The Phu Kradueng park office is certain it was a man-made incident, pointing the finger at some locals who during a search for forest products might have set fire to the area to collect wild animals and plants.</p><p> According to an initial investigation, the fire began at the foot of a hill and rapidly spread up the mountain, fuelled by latex in the pine sap. Strong winds also helped fan the blaze while rugged terrain made the fightfighting mission tough.</p><p> Moving to calm public anxiety, the park insisted that only the outer rim of the national park was damaged while the inner core of the compound where wildlife such as chamois, tigers and elephants live and wild plants are concentrated was not disturbed. It was fortunate that there was no huge fauna loss.</p><p> As the Phu Kradueng blaze took place just weeks after the great Australian bushfires, it triggered fears the country might face something similar to the horrific blazes which took hold Down Under in a months-long crisis that killed more than 30 people, and took the lives of many wildlife animals. New South Wales was hard hit in the fires that began in September and came to an end this month.</p><p> The Phu Kradueng authorities said there is a major risk next month of further fires when the weather becomes really dry, while the park remains open to tourists until June before closing until September. The drought could make the situation worse.</p><p> Even if it is found the fire was indeed man-made, those concerned should not stop at that. The authorities must look seriously for preventive measures, especially given concerns the blaze might also have resulted from forest mismanagement.</p><p> Some conservationists said Phu Kradueng pine forests might be too dense as the authorities over the course of 30 years have expanded pine plantations in areas that used to be prairie grasslands. Sasin Chalermlap, secretary-general of the Seub Nakasathien foundation, argued that while the mountain looks more beautiful with green pines, the plantations have changed the Phu Kradueng ecology and, as a side effect, the area is now more susceptible to forest fires which are more dangerous during a time of climate change.</p><p> He also argued that pines consume large amounts of underground water, and the large plantations have sucked up water sources on the mountain top. Before the expansion of the pine plantations, Mr Sasin said, there were a number of small water sources scattered across the area.</p><p> Sadly there are a few, if any, now. The conservationist saw the fire as a \"blessing in disguise.</p><p>\" Instead of replanting pines, he urged the authorities to leave the area to recuperate as grassland, leaving vacant space that will serve as a natural fire break. This is to prevent an Australia-style fire experience.</p><p> Mr Sasin's calls merit further discussion which will happen if the park authorities are open to communication. It's good for park authorities to follow the Australian approach by aiming for long term measures.</p><p> The Australian government told the media this month that it was to hold a wide-ranging inquiry into the causes of the bushfires which were blamed on a long period of drought. Thai authorities need to learn lessons of their own and that of Australia as they roll out a fire prevention plan focussing on pro-active measures.</p><p> They have to extend cooperation to state and non-state agencies and set up a surveillance system to make sure that the Phu Kradueng park will stand tall and remain safe from forest fires.

Real-time information helps paint a more complete picture of where affected people are located, so that resources like food, water, and medical supplies can be efficiently distributed where they are needed most. We launched Facebook Disaster Maps specifically to help fill information gaps during these events. So when the Australia fires began, we quickly shared real-time maps with our more than 100 Data for Good partners. Those maps illustrate how populations are evacuating and whether they have access to cellular networks, which are helping response organizations optimize their response efforts. To help support and amplify the efforts of our community, we will also be matching up to AU$1 million in donations made to GlobalGiving and donating AU$250,000 to the Australian Red Cross.</p><p>Currently, Disaster Maps in Australia are being used by a range of national and international relief, response, and academic organizations. Direct Relief, a humanitarian aid organization focused on health and emergency response, is using these tools to analyze evacuation proceedings and has plans to distribute more than 500,000 respiratory masks to the Australian states of Victoria and New South Wales. Direct Relief first used Disaster Maps to respond to the Thomas Fire and Montecito mudslides of December 2017 and January 2018 to learn how large numbers of people behave during crisis events and to develop insights about how best to respond to medical needs.</p><p>How Facebook Disaster Maps Help</p><p>Traditional forms of data often do not provide an accurate real-time view of affected areas, which makes it extremely difficult to understand how to best direct response efforts. To combat gaps in information, Facebook Disaster Maps are generated within 24 hours of disaster striking, then refreshed daily throughout the event. The data in these maps is gathered from people using the Facebook app who have chosen to turn on Location Services and opt into a feature called Location History, which can be modified at any time under Privacy Settings. Access to this near real-time data on evacuations, displacement, and network connectivity access means disaster response agencies can act quickly and efficiently to save lives. Plus, continuously updating information allows them to respond to changing circumstances on the ground during and after the event. To assist with the bushfires, four maps have been shared: the South Coast of New South Wales; East Gippsland in Victoria; Green Wattle Creek Fire in New South Wales; and the Cudlee Creek Fire in South Australia.</p><p>Such real-time information helps responders effectively deploy resources to serve the neediest survivors and protect vulnerable populations by painting a more complete picture of where affected people are located. Disaster Maps' Facebook population density map for the bushfires clearly illustrates the quick and massive evacuation of Batemans Bay over the course of several days, from December 31 to January 3, as fire swept over the town.</p><p>These maps allow responders to quickly get a read on how people are actually behaving during a specific emergency, rather than making assumptions or predicting behaviors based on past events. They're proving to be a remarkable tool for responders to the catastrophic Australian bushfires, the second-largest fire event ever recorded globally based on land size, which so far have destroyed more than 15 million acres, more than seven times the acreage of the shocking California fires of 2018 or last year's Amazon wildfire. At least a billion animals have been killed, wiping out multiple species of native Australian wildlife, including 30 percent of the world's koala population.</p><p>Since its inception, Facebook Data for Good has generated Disaster Maps for hundreds of natural disasters, including Hurricanes Dorian and Barry, Typhoon Tisoy in the Philippines, and the recent earthquake in Puerto Rico. In addition to guiding response efforts, universities and researchers are also using Disaster Maps to analyze how disaster-affected populations utilize social services, what prompts them to obey evacuation orders, and how social ties affect their resilience after a disaster.</p><p>More Ways to Help</p><p>As part of our efforts to assist with the bushfires, we are donating AU$250,000 to the Australian Red Cross to support relief and recovery efforts.
