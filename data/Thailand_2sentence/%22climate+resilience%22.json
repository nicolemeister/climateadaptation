NBS can also complement traditional engineering in hybrid solutions to retrofit or enhance existing infrastructure. The advantages of NBS include hazard mitigation, biodiversity benefits, improved water quality, carbon sequestration, and their dual-use as recreational spaces. These benefits can reduce capital investments, lower maintenance costs, and yield multifaceted positive outcomes.</p><p>The guidance note identifies four key families of NBS opportunities for port resilience:</p><p>- Working with Coastal Systems: Strategies that integrate natural coastal processes, addressing challenges like sedimentation within ports and optimizing port location and design.</p><p>- Wave and Coastal Dynamics Attenuation: Solutions using living shorelines, reefs, vegetation, and landscape features to reduce wave impacts, manage the movement of sediments, and mitigate storm impacts.</p><p>- Beneficial Reuse of Dredged Sediment: Approaches that reduce capital and maintenance dredging costs by reusing sediments or coordinating dredging activities with NBS projects.</p><p>- Enhancement of Grey Structures: Retrofits such as micro-habitat creation and other solutions can increase the environmental value of traditional port infrastructure.</p><p>To demonstrate practical applications of these opportunities, the guidance note includes key case studies. For example, in Nigeria, the Lekki sandbar breakwater facilitates sediment transport and wave dynamics for the port, decreasing construction time, construction costs, and maintenance needs. In Indonesia, Jakarta's Batavia port, which was long hampered by outdated facilities, expanded its fishing port using local materials and mangroves to reinforce the breakwater-an approach well suited to areas facing subsidence and sea-level rise.</p><p>The guide also includes insights for navigating various phases of a NBS project cycle, providing information on evaluating technical and economic feasibility, securing financing, and developing detailed designs and implementation plans. Key phases for screening NBS opportunities include:</p><p>1. Identifying NBS opportunities within the spatial scope of the port and its hinterland to address governance, development challenges, and the license to operate.</p><p>2. Leveraging examples and case studies from similar settings.</p><p>3. Conceptualizing projects and crafting a compelling value proposition.</p><p>4. Exploring key enablers for successful implementation and maximizing value.</p><p>5. Assessing the full range of NBS benefits for ports and stakeholders.</p><p>6. Evaluating financing options and project bankability.</p><p>While the ports sector has long worked with coastal landscapes and ecosystems, recent innovations such as ecological breakwaters and strategic sediment management offer novel approaches that build on traditional practices through emerging nature-based engineering and green financing mechanisms. A growing number of examples are showing what is possible -from reusing sediment to build wetlands and improve navigation, to using concrete mixtures that support habitat creation, to rethinking breakwater design in Africa and Asia. By working with nature, port authorities can find a pathway to align resilience and sustainability goals. This guidance note provides an initial starting point to help unlock such opportunities.</p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["- This new guide, Nature-Based Solutions for Ports, offers practical strategies and real-world examples to help port authorities and planners integrate natural processes into planning, design, and daily operations. - Solutions that are built with nature can reduce costs, enhance environmental and social outcomes, and support a port's license to operate in an evolving climate and regulatory landscape.", "- Solutions that are built with nature can reduce costs, enhance environmental and social outcomes, and support a port's license to operate in an evolving climate and regulatory landscape.

In response, the World Bank is helping client countries scale nature-based solutions (NBS), innovative and cost-effective measures that draw on natural systems to tackle these inter-related challenges. Since 2012, the World Bank has financed approximately 250 projects that have used NBS or combined natural and engineered approaches to reduce disaster risks (such as flooding and heat), restore ecosystems, improve biodiversity, and boost local economies. In 2020, the World Bank launched the Global Program on NBS for Climate Resilience (GPNBS), systematizing support for NBS through the creation and sharing of knowledge, deploying NBS in relevant World Bank projects, and partnering with other organizations to enhance impact. The World Bank will continue to strengthen its support for NBS operations and expand the knowledge base for successful NBS implementation to drive resilient, inclusive development with long-term economic and environmental benefits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Between 2012 and 2024, the World Bank financed about 250 investment projects that harness nature to build climate resilience. This includes investment in urban resilience, coastal resilience, and landscape restoration. Among these projects, 66 have benefited 9.5 million people and restored 1.1 million hectares of ecosystems with climate resilience benefits.</p><p>- Active projects are expected to benefit 19.4 million people and restore 3.5 million hectares of nature and green space.</p><p>- NBS help strengthen climate resilience. The construction of a retention basin in 2020 reduced flood risks and minimized economic disruptions for more than 3 million people in Argentina. The creation of a 17-hectare urban park, also in 2020, protected 50,000 people in Mozambique from flooding.</p><p>- NBS deliver critical biodiversity benefits. The restoration of a Sri Lankan wetland in 2022 led to a country-wide effort to rehabilitate and protect these ecosystems, and ensured protection of endangered species. The rehabilitation of mangroves in Indonesia supports coastal ecosystem and boosts fishing incomes.</p><p>- NBS support jobs and livelihoods, such as by providing temporary employment that has benefited 745,000 households in Tanzania during lean seasons between 2017 and 2025.</p><p>- The development of new analytical tools such as the NBS Opportunity Scan has been critical to the expanded use of NBS, helping identify optimal investments in 100 cities and 5,000 kilometers of coastline, informing at least $1.8 billion in development financing for NBS activities to date.</p><p>\"Mangroves provide endless benefits for communities. They protect communities from the impact of climate change and generate income through ecotourism and its products, such as mangrove crabs, syrup and crackers. The carbon stored in mangroves can also be traded, and we ensure these benefits reach coastal communities to generate incentives for continued mangrove management.</p><p>Nani Hendiarti</p><p>Deputy Minister for Environment Coordination and Forestry,</p><p>Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment (CMMAI) of Indonesia.</p><p>Challenge</p><p>Countries face increasing environmental challenges associated with compounding risks: natural disasters push over 26 million people into poverty each year, biodiversity loss is accelerating, and unplanned urbanization increases exposure to hazards. NBS use natural systems like forests and wetlands to enhance resilience, prevent erosion, stabilize slopes, protect roads from flooding, and support water management. When combined with traditional infrastructure, NBS can cut costs, extend asset lifespans, and boost economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, scaling NBS remains difficult, especially in low-income areas. Significant technical and financial support is needed to unlock their full potential and meet resilience and biodiversity goals.</p><p>Approach</p><p>The World Bank helps countries adopt NBS by sharing knowledge, providing technical assistance, mobilizing finance, and improving policies to support scalable, replicable results. While the World Bank Group has worked to advance the use of NBS for well over a decade, in 2020 it activated a new platform to advance NBS: the Global Program on NBS for Climate Resilience (GPNBS). Led by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), the GPNBS enables the World Bank to take a cross-sectoral approach to address technical challenges and promote the integration of NBS into development operations globally. The approach focuses on three key areas:</p><p>Awareness and knowledge: The World Bank is driving the knowledge agenda on NBS by developing essential knowledge products and supporting the integration of NBS priorities in global agreements, such as COP22, and country development strategies. Guidance notes like the Catalogue of NBS for Urban Resilience, Assessing the Benefits and Costs of NBS, and Integrating Gender and Social Inclusion in NBS have helped shape NBS investments across sectors and institutions. In partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank also advanced knowledge on private sector opportunities and applied it in operational dialogue.</p><p>Embedding NBS in our work with countries: Tools like the NBS Opportunity Scan have identified optimal NBS investments in over 100 cities and 5,000 kilometers of coastline, informing at least $1.8 billion in development financing for NBS. For instance, the Scan's recommended investments were integrated into the $200 million Secondary Cities Urban Mobility and Development Project in Burkina Faso, which will create and protect urban green spaces to reduce temperatures and limit flooding, benefiting 819,000 people.</p><p>Strategic partnerships: The World Bank works with technical partners, including United Nations (UN) agencies, the World Resources Institute, The Nature Conservancy, and the US Army Corps of Engineers, to develop joint knowledge and guidance products. It also works with development partners such as the government of the Netherlands and World Bank-administered trust funds to co-finance projects and shape the global narrative. Knowledge products like Scaling up Finance for Nature (presented at COP15) and the Climate and Development Brief: NBS for Climate Resilience and Adaptation (presented at COP 27) have helped elevate NBS in global climate discussions.</p><p>Results: 2012 - 2024</p><p>Between 2012 and 2024, the World Bank financed about 250 investment projects that harness nature to build climate resilience. This includes investment in urban resilience, coastal resilience, and landscape restoration. Of these 250 projects, 66 closed projects have benefited 9.5 million people and restored 1.1 million hectares of ecosystems with climate resilience benefits. Active projects are expected to benefit 19.4 million people and restore 3.5 million hectares of nature and green space.</p><p>NBS have been instrumental in strengthening climate resilience. In Mozambique, the Cities and Climate Change project created a 17-hectare urban park along the Chiveve river in Beira, while also restoring the river's retention function by rehabilitating degraded mangroves and native flora. These activities protected 50,000 people from flooding and expanded livelihood and recreational opportunities. Argentina integrated its first large-scale NBS in Buenos Aires through the construction of a retention basin in the Parque Indoamericano, reducing flood risks for more than 3 million people and minimizing economic disruptions. In Burkina Faso, the NBS Opportunity Scan helped identify green spaces for heat reduction and water absorption, with the aim of improving living conditions for 819,000 people. The World Bank's regional NBS approach in Central Asia and the Caucuses is supporting governments to restore landscapes, mitigate mudflows, and manage water resources in fragile, arid and mountainous areas, and is expected to bring 190,000 hectares under sustainable land management in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan alone.</p><p>NBS deliver important biodiversity benefits. In Indonesia, an integrated spatial and economic assessment informed the design of the Mangroves for Coastal Resilience Project, which aims to rehabilitate 45,000 hectares of mangrove and support sustainable livelihoods for almost 10,000 people. In Colombo, Sri Lanka, the restoration and protection of a 20 square kilometer urban wetland protected the ecosystem's 280 wildlife species and enhanced its role as a carbon sponge (the wetlands absorb up to 90 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emission). The success of the project led the government of Sri Lanka to approve nearly 50 additional development plans to conserve wetlands across the country.</p><p>These NBS related investments have created jobs and enhanced livelihoods. In Tanzania, more than 745,000 households were provided temporary employment for public works including tree planting, boosting incomes during lean seasons. In Brazil, the restoration of a major park in Fortaleza revitalized the local economy by creating a vibrant hub for food vendors and community gatherings, benefiting 70,000 people. More than 900 jobs were created in Sierra Leone by an initiative to grow, plant, and nurture close to a million trees that help address flooding, landslides, and urban heat.</p><p>The World Bank has also supported private sector engagement in NBS by helping countries like Costa Rica and Brazil develop Payments for Environmental Services (PES) programs and tapping carbon finance to engage private sector in ecosystem restoration.</p><p>Globally, World Bank-supported tools such as the NBS Opportunity Scan (NBSOS), and knowledge products have shaped policies and investments around the globe. The NBSOS has been delivered for 100 cities and across 5,000 kilometers of coastline to directly inform investment in NBS. Outcomes like the examples described above demonstrate how countries, with World Bank support, are turning nature into a powerful asset-protecting lives, supporting livelihoods, and delivering lasting development results.</p><p>Collaborating across the World Bank Group</p><p>The World Bank is working with IFC in Colombia, Panama, and Brazil to increase the uptake of NBS and help identify potential investments. The World Bank and IFC also jointly published a report Nature-Based Solutions in Cities: Solutions and Examples for Municipalities and the Private Sector, which has already supported dialogue with private sector and governments on NBS investments, including in Colombia, the Philippines, and South Africa.</p><p>IFC works with clients in water, energy, mining, and cities to promote NBS for resilience, while MIGA identifies NBS opportunities to enhance asset resilience and mobilize public sector funding through its guarantee products. IFC's draft Biodiversity Finance Guide also aligns NBS investments with Green Bond and Green Loan Principles.</p><p>World Bank Group Contribution</p><p>World Bank financing for NBS and green-gray activities is estimated at $12 billion from 2012 to 2024, including $7.5 billion from IDA, $3.7 billion from IBRD, and $800 million from Trust Funds.</p><p>Multi-donor trust funds from different sectors, including disaster resilience (GFDRR), environmental management (the Program for the Blue Economy, PROBLUE; the Global Partnership for Sustainable and Resilient Landscapes, PROGREEN; and the City Climate Finance Gap Fund), and water (the Global Water Security and Sanitation Partnership, GWSP), have also financed NBS across the globe, as well as contributing to \\xACthe creation of critical knowledge products. With close to $4 million, GFDRR is the initiator and main contributor to the GPNBS. But GPNBS is not the only initiative that helps drive investment in NBS. The NBS Invest Project, which is led by the World Bank's environment sector and collaborates closely with GPNBS, received $10 million in GEF financing to increase the utilization of NBS in climate mitigation projects in the world's least Developed Countries. And the Urban Nature Program, led by the World Bank's Global Platform for Sustainable Cities with support from the GEF, specifically helps cities integrate nature into urban planning.</p><p>Partnerships</p><p>The World Bank has cultivated partnerships on NBS with more than 30 external organizations. This includes the UN Environment Program-led Platform on Ecosystems for Disaster Risk Reduction and Adaptation (PEDRR), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and the G20 Working Group on NBS.</p><p>These relationships have led to new knowledge products, such as the recently-published Growing Resilience: Unlocking the Potential of NBS for Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa with the World Resource Institute and African Development Bank. Another is the International Guidelines on Natural and Nature-Based Features, developed under the International NBS Working Group that the World Bank participates in.</p><p>These strategic alliances enable the World Bank to leverage a shared pool of knowledge to identify gaps and best practices for the successful implementation of NBS, helping to support client countries to tackle the environmental impact of climate change and manage future risks. Moreover, these partnerships help amplify the World Bank's messaging around the power of harnessing nature for climate resilience and sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>In the immediate term, the World Bank will continue to invest in NBS to enhance climate resilience in low- and middle-income countries by providing operational support, assisting with investment identification, and supporting successful implementation of NBS.</p><p>The World Bank will explore opportunities to further harness NBS to create jobs and attract private sector investment.

With public budgets under pressure, much of the adaptation effort will need to come from the private sector. A new World Bank report lays out policy reforms that would help households and firms adapt to increasingly frequent and damaging weather events.</p><p>Released today, From Risk to Resilience: Helping People and Firms Adapt in South Asia, finds that awareness of climate risk is high. More than 60 percent of households and firms have experienced extreme weather in the last five years, and more than 75 percent expect it for the next decade. Many households and businesses are already taking steps to adapt to climate risks. Around 80 percent of households and 63 percent of firms have taken some measures to adapt. However, most of these measures are basic, such as raising house foundations or installing fans. More advanced options, like using climate-resilient seeds, or relocating from high-risk areas, remain less common.</p><p>The urgency is growing. People and firms are already adapting, but they are doing so with limited tools and few resources, said Martin Raiser, World Bank Vice President for South Asia. Governments must act quickly to remove the barriers that prevent more effective adaptation. This includes removing distortions in land and labor markets, expanding access to finance and investing in public infrastructure to support people and businesses as they respond to climate risks.</p><p>The report finds that market barriers and income constraints are holding back stronger adaptation. Households with more education or access to formal finance are more likely to adopt advanced strategies. Similarly, better-managed firms with fewer regulatory barriers tend to be more adaptive. Removing these barriers would enable more effective adaptation by households and firms.</p><p>Private sector adaptation could reduce one third of the region's projected climate damage, but this requires governments to strengthen enabling environments, said Franziska Ohnsorge, World Bank Chief Economist for South Asia. Adaptation is most effective when markets function well and when essential services like transport, water, healthcare, and digital connectivity are widely accessible.</p><p>The report calls for both targeted adaptation efforts and broader development measures that also build climate resilience. Governments have a critical role to play, even with limited fiscal space.

Often referred to as the lifeline of India, the monsoon rains impact agriculture, water availability, power generation, and the livelihoods of millions across the nation.</p><p>The Indian monsoon system, driven by the seasonal reversal of winds due to differences in land and sea temperatures, brings two distinct rainy seasons: the Southwest Monsoon (June-September) and the Northeast Monsoon (October-December). The former contributes nearly 75% of the country's total annual rainfall and is essential for the kharif crop season, which includes staples like rice, cotton, and sugarcane.</p><p>The onset of the southwest monsoon in early June triggers a cycle of activity that supports farming, replenishes rivers and lakes, and powers hydroelectric plants, said a senior official from the India Meteorological Department. Moisture-laden winds from the Arabian Sea and Bay of Bengal spread across the country, delivering rain as they rise over mountain ranges like the Western Ghats and the Himalayas.</p><p>The northeast monsoon, while shorter and more localized, plays a crucial role for the southeastern states, particularly Tamil Nadu and parts of Andhra Pradesh, which receive most of their rainfall during this period.</p><p>India's dependence on monsoon rainfall remains high - with about 55% of the country's cultivated land is irrigated - leaving the rest farmland part dependent on timely and adequate rain. With nearly two-thirds of the population engaged in agriculture, the economy is highly sensitive to monsoon variability. A good monsoon boosts rural incomes, food production, and national GDP, while a weak or erratic one can lead to droughts, crop losses, and inflation.</p><p>Uneven rainfall, intensified by climate change, is already affecting crop cycles. Delayed rains, excessive downpours, or prolonged dry spells can result in soil erosion, reduced farm productivity, and rural distress. Even winter rains brought by western disturbances are vital for rabi crops like wheat in northern India.</p><p>Beyond the economy, the monsoon is deeply woven into India's cultural identity. From ancient poetry and classical music to festivals and daily traditions, the monsoon influences food, clothing, architecture, and societal rhythms.</p><p>With changing climate patterns making monsoons more unpredictable, understanding and adapting to these shifts has become increasingly important.

Thailand, with its low-lying coastal areas and reliance on agriculture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. To safeguard its future, the country must prioritize sustainable practices, invest in resilient infrastructure, and foster community awareness about climate adaptation. Failure to act swiftly could lead to devastating impacts on livelihoods, ecosystems, and the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Arctic is melting, seas are rising, and extreme weather is reshaping the planet. If we don't act to protect ourselves in time, we'll face catastrophic consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are entering an entirely new world where once unimaginable things are becoming a reality. Take Japan's Mount Fuji. For the first time in 130 years, its summit was snow-free in October, a stark symbol of global warming. What ensues, however, is not only environmental but also economic and political challenges.</p><p>Around the world, permafrost is melting in Siberia, revealing ancient mammoth tusks with new ivory businesses. Greenland's melting ice and new mining opportunities are fuelling aspirations for political independence. The new Arctic shipping routes have also stirred geopolitical tensions over control.</p><p>Closer to home, Indonesia is planning to move its capital from sinking Jakarta, and the Pacific islands are struggling to survive rising seas.</p><p>Thailand, too, faces this inevitable future.</p><p>Ahead is a new world fraught with risks. Rising temperatures threaten agriculture, food security, health, and the economy. Farm production will plunge. Biodiversity will shrink from widespread species extinction.</p><p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), half the world will face extreme heat lasting more than 20 days at a 2\u00b0C temperature rise. At 3\u00b0C, this figure jumps to 74%. At 3\u00b0C, droughts may last more than 10 months a year. The melting permafrost in Siberia could release lethal methane, intensifying global heat and natural disasters. Beyond 3\u00b0C, the damage would be catastrophic, triggering global tipping points.</p><p>Thailand is highly vulnerable to rising seas, severe floods, prolonged droughts, and heatwaves. Extreme heat \u2014 days over 35\u00b0C will become common, and 40\u00b0C heatwaves could be regular.</p><p>High temperatures aren't just uncomfortable; they are deadly, particularly for outdoor workers in agriculture, construction, and delivery services who need to cut work hours. As economic hardship spreads, crime could rise, and birth rates could fall.</p><p>Natural disasters will intensify. The 2011 floods in central Thailand were one of the worst disasters, and this year's deadly floods in the North remind us of the ongoing threat.</p><p>Key to survival is timely climate change adaptation to protect the populace, particularly vulnerable groups who will be most affected by climate disasters.</p><p>Despite contributing less than 1% of global greenhouse gases, Thailand ranks 9th in the Climate Risk Index. Over the past 20 years, the country has experienced 146 extreme weather events, causing damages of approximately US$7.7 billion per year.</p><p>Coastal flooding poses a critical threat. Within 30 years, parts of Bangkok and the Central Plains close to the Gulf of Thailand could be underwater. It is already happening. In Samut Prakan, the Khun Samut Chin Temple, once inland, now sits on an island due to coastal erosion. Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian district shows utility poles standing in the water as the land sinks.</p><p>A study supported by the TDRI also suggests that areas like Phetchaburi could experience 487mm of rainfall over five consecutive days \u2014 truly catastrophic.</p><p>Droughts, too, are intensifying, threatening tourism, the country's cash cow. Certain areas, such as Mae Hong Son, could experience over 100 rain-free days a year, leading to extreme heat and water scarcity. The result? Dangerous heatwaves and dwindling water supplies.</p><p>Thailand already endures 50 days a year with temperatures over 35\u00b0C. That number is rising. Health issues will worsen, and productivity losses could drag down GDP.</p><p>So, what can Thailand do? There are three main strategies: prevention, preparation, and recovery.</p><p>Prevention and Risk Reduction: We must develop drought-resistant crops, update farming practices, and adapt our infrastructure to withstand storms and floods. Sustainable land use, especially in coastal areas, is vital. Building flood barriers with comprehensive feasibility studies and community input, as well as using mangroves to protect coastlines, are important steps. In some cases, relocation may be the only viable option.</p><p>Preparation and Response: Early warning systems and reliable weather forecasts are essential. For instance, the recent floods in the North caused unnecessary damage due to poor warnings. We need to support communities with relocation and essential recovery services where needed.</p><p>Recovery and Resilience: Post-disaster recovery should focus on resilience. Insurance and social safety nets help communities recover, and infrastructure should prioritise durability over quick fixes.</p><p>We should also avoid \"maladaptation\" \u2014 actions that worsen climate impacts.</p><p>Sea walls, often seen as essential against rising seas, need careful planning. Thailand's proposed sea wall to protect Bangkok must undergo thorough environmental studies, or it could backfire by shifting risks to vulnerable areas.</p><p>True adaptation requires addressing inequality since not everyone can adapt equally. Wealthier groups have more resources, while the poor face the greatest climate risks. Climate justice must be a priority to ensure everyone has the support they need.</p><p>A look abroad offers valuable lessons. The Netherlands has built a seawall system informed by environmental studies and community input. Japan uses \"Digital Twin\" technology to simulate flood scenarios and plan evacuations. Israel is a model for water management in drought conditions, and Singapore invests in green spaces to counteract heat waves.</p><p>To get the most from adaptation investments, measures should reduce losses, boost the economy, and benefits society and the environment. Key steps include establishing an advanced weather forecasting system, building resilient infrastructure, developing drought-resistant crops, protecting mangroves, and improving water management.</p><p>Thailand should levy a carbon tax to create a Green Transition and Adaptation Fund. This fund would support climate adaptation, help vulnerable groups, and improve infrastructure to transition to a low-carbon future. Additionally, the government should use insurance to support those affected by natural disasters instead of relying on one-off handouts.</p><p>To prepare for a hotter world, Thailand must create new jobs that don't rely on outdoor work, shift away from traditional farming, consider using biotech seeds, and start charging for water in agriculture. Planning for sea walls and even relocating cities should be on the agenda.</p><p>One significant challenge is decentralising power so local communities can manage risk effectively. Reforming uncontrolled land use is also necessary, as it exacerbates floods and other natural disasters.</p><p>While Thailand's adaptation plans are steps in the right direction, they still rely on outdated governance models and lack the proper budgeting needed for urgent change. We must take bold action, transforming crises into opportunities for survival through effective adaptation.</p><p>The climate crisis, tough as it is, could push Thailand to make overdue reforms for the common good. This includes decentralising state governance, developing robust climate protection systems, modernising agriculture, building climate-resilient cities, expanding eco-tourism, and creating climate insurance.</p><p>Thailand needs to act decisively. Our future depends on how we adapt now. This is our chance to turn a crisis into an opportunity for survival. Let's rise to the challenge.</p><p>Writer: Somkiat Tangkitvanich, Ph.D, is the president of the Thailand Development Research Institute.</p><p>Note: This article is adapted from his keynote speech at the 2024 TDRI Annual Public Conference on 'Adapting to Climate Change', held on Oct 30, 2024.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://tdri.or.th/en/2025/01/building-thailands-climate-defences/?rand=86529\">Read More</url></p>", "publisher": "Thailand Business News", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 16, "title": "Guinea: World Bank Group Support to Boost Climate Resilience and Economic Growth in Guinea", "published": "2025-06-16", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The World Bank Group has approved a $100 million International Development Association (IDA) credit for Guinea's Kounki Fisheries and Aquaculture Project.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The project will focus on strengthening climate resilience and develop value chains in fishing and aquaculture communities in targeted areas.

The MME approach uses the coupled global climate models (CGCMs) from different global climate prediction and research centers, including IMD's Monsoon Mission Climate Forecasting System (MMCFS) model. The MMCFS and MME forecasts are updated every month. This was to satisfy the demands from different users and Government authorities for the forecasts of the spatial distribution of monthly and seasonal rainfall along with the regionally averaged rainfall forecasts for better regional planning of activities.</p><p>Since introducing the Statistical Ensemble Forecasting System (SEFS) in 2007 and implementing the MME approach in 2021 for seasonal forecasting, IMD operational forecast for the monsoon rainfall has shown noticeable improvement. For example, the average absolute forecast error in the forecasting of all India's seasonal rainfall has reduced by about 21% during the recent 18 years (2007-2024) compared to the same number of previous years (1989-2006), which indicates a highly successful forecast in recent years compared to previous years. The anomaly correlation between the observed and forecast ISMR during 2007-2023 was 0.55 compared to -0.21 during 1989-2006. It may be noted that IMD was able to correctly forecast the twin deficient monsoon years of 2014-2015, as well as the below-normal rainfall in 2023 and above-normal rainfall in 2024. These clearly indicate improvement made in the operational forecast system in the recent 18 years period compared to the earlier 18 years period. For 2025, the MME approach will continue to be used as this method introduced in 2021 has shown good skill in forecasting both the area-averaged rainfall at various geographical regions and spatial distribution of rainfall across the country at monthly as well as seasonal scales.</p><p>To strengthen weather and climate services for the agriculture sector, the MoES has launched the Mission Mausam, which is envisaged to be a multi-faceted and transformative initiative to boost India's weather and climate-related science, research, and services. The Mission is launched to make Bharat a weather-ready and climate-smart nation with the aim that no weather will go undetected and early warning for all. It will help monsoon-dependent agricultural regions, citizens, and last-mile users to tackle extreme weather events and the impacts of climate change in a better way.</p><p>Further, the Mission's focus includes improving the observations by augmenting various observational networks throughout the country to provide highly accurate and timely weather and climate information across temporal and spatial scales, capacity building, and awareness generation. Apart from physics-based numerical models, the Ministry is developing new methods based on artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies for weather, climate, and ocean forecasting systems. And the formulation of collaborative research projects with academic institutions to share knowledge and develop innovative solutions for weather forecasting and climate modeling capabilities. Local user communities such as farmers/agricultural authorities, aviation authorities, power generation &amp; distribution agencies, industries, health agencies, etc., are constantly involved/engaged, and periodic familiarization is imparted through user meet/stakeholder meet awareness programs, etc. The feedback is taken from the communities for the improvement of all-weather &amp; climate services. Extensive use of local languages in forecast dissemination and regularly organizing workshops and awareness programs for community outreach is being undertaken.</p><p>By strengthening the observational network will also help to observe the changes in long-term weather patterns compared to past years to assess the changes in the climate and take measures towards climate resilience.</p><p>The India Meteorological Department (IMD) has been using satellite technology extensively for weather monitoring and forecasting. This started with the use of photographs from Television Infrared Observation Satellites (TIROS-1) launched by the United States of America (USA) in April 1960. These photographs provided new information on cloud systems, including spiral formations associated with large storms, immediately proving their value to operational meteorologists. Over the years, IMD has embraced new developments in satellites and their applications, boosted through global coordination and support, such as geostationary satellites in 1974 and polar-orbiting satellites. With the advent of Indian National Satellites (INSAT) developed by the Space Research Organisation (ISRO) satellites in 1982, IMD has augmented satellite applications utilizing image and data products in collaboration with the ISRO. Currently, IMD is utilizing available international satellites, including European Organisation for the Exploitation of Meteorological Satellites (EUMETSAT) and INSAT-3DR/3DS, as well as polar-orbiting satellites, including Oceansat-3 and Metop-B/C. The utilization of satellite data and products has improved nowcasting and severe weather along with timely detection of large-scale systems like monsoon circulation, cyclones, western disturbances, thunderstorms, etc. Above 90% of the data in the numerical models run by the Ministry of Earth Sciences (MoES) is satellite-based. The assimilation of satellite data in the models has improved the accuracy in short to medium range forecasting by about 20% to 30%. Algorithms/tools developed by IMD/ISRO and other international institutes, such as EUMETSAT, like nowcast tools, RAPID, Dvorak technique, etc., have improved decision-making and forecasting. These data and products are proven to be useful for disaster preparedness. However, there are still gaps in detecting small-scale weather events, such as cloudbursts, thunderstorms, localized heavy rainfall, squalls, hail storms, etc., due to a lack of high-resolution data, products, and satellite-based tools. Considering this, IMD and ISRO are working together for the development of the INSAT-4 series with better sensors and resolution.</p><p>This information was given by Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences, MoS PMO, Department of Personnel, Public Grievances and Pensions, Department of Space and Department of Atomic Energy, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["The feedback is taken from the communities for the improvement of all-weather &amp; climate services.

Now, Belize has access to around US$77 million (based on today's exchange rate) to advance its development agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Previously only a recipient of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) funding, Belize now also has access to IDA's low-interest loans with longer repayment terms.</p><p>This reclassification comes after the World Bank's Board approved a proposal to extend the Small Island Economies Exception to eligible non-island small states, acknowledging Belize's unique vulnerabilities and development needs. Belize's IDA eligibility opens new opportunities for the country to strengthen its economic growth, enhance resilience, and tackle long-standing development challenges.</p><p>Here are five key ways Belize stands to benefit from its new IDA status and access to the IDA Crisis Response Window:</p><p>1. Access to Concessional Financing for Development Projects</p><p>One of the most significant advantages of IDA membership is access to concessional financing. IDA loans, known as credits, come with highly favorable terms such as low or zero interest rates, long repayment periods (up to 40 years), and extended grace periods - a set time during which no loan payments are required.</p><p>These terms are a stark contrast to more expensive, commercial borrowing options. The new funding will allow Belize to invest in critical infrastructure, health, and education projects without worsening its fiscal outlook.</p><p>2. Better Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness</p><p>Belize loses almost 4% of its GDP to natural disasters every year, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. IDA membership will enable Belize to tap into specific funding windows that target climate resilience and disaster preparedness. With these resources, Belize can invest in climate resiliency and long-term strategies to mitigate climate risks, restore vital ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs, and invest in critical development areas such as safe water supply and education. Given that climate change is one of the most pressing threats to Belize's economic stability, IDA funding will provide a lifeline for future-proofing its economy.</p><p>3. Bolstering Economic Growth and Job Creation</p><p>Belize's Medium-Term Development Strategy sets ambitious goals, including achieving 5% annual economic growth and creating 50,000 jobs over the next five years. IDA resources will play a pivotal role in financing initiatives aimed at boosting economic productivity, particularly in key sectors like education, tourism, agriculture, and renewable energy. By supporting large-scale infrastructure projects, fostering private sector development, and improving the business environment, IDA's concessional financing will help Belize create new employment opportunities and lift thousands out of poverty.</p><p>4. Better Debt Management and Financial Stability</p><p>Belize has struggled with high levels of public debt, which has been exacerbated by the economic fallout from the COVID-19 pandemic and the high costs associated with borrowing from international markets. With IDA's concessional financing, Belize will face lower debt service burdens, making it easier to manage its fiscal balance. This improved debt sustainability will allow the country to invest more of its budget in essential services like healthcare, education, and social protection programs, all while reducing the risk of future debt crises.</p><p>5. Enhanced Global Partnerships and Knowledge Sharing</p><p>As a member of IDA, Belize gains access not only to concessional financing but also to the global expertise and technical assistance that IDA offers. The World Bank, through the International Development Association, provides knowledge sharing, policy advice, and capacity-building support, which will be crucial for Belize as it seeks to implement its Medium-Term Development Strategy. In particular, Belize can leverage these resources to enhance its institutional capacities in areas such as climate adaptation, disaster risk management, and public financial management. This increased collaboration will help Belize strengthen its domestic policies and improve its global competitiveness.</p><p>One of the first initiatives under IDA will be the Blue Cities project, which will help Belize improve its management capacity for sustainable development of its coastal areas and blue economy, increase safe water supply and reduce land-based pollution discharges in targeted coastal areas.</p><p>Belize also will benefit from the preparation of Catastrophe Deferred Drawdown Option (Cat DDO), which is a contingent financing line that will provide immediate liquidity to address shocks related to natural disasters and public health emergencies. The quick-disbursing Cat DDO will be an effective part of Belize's broader risk management strategy and a critical instrument given Belize's high exposure to natural disasters.</p><p>Additionally, the planned Early Childhood Care and Education and Female Employment project will focus on improving access to quality early childhood education services and boosting female employment opportunities.</p><p>Belize's membership to the International Development Association marks a significant milestone. This partnership opens up new opportunities for us to access crucial resources and support, enabling us to strengthen our resilience and improve the well-being of all Belizeans, \" said Christopher Coye, Minister of State in the Ministry of Finance, Economic Development, and Investment of the Government of Belize. \"Through this collaboration, we are better equipped to face global challenges - climate change being the main one - while advancing our national development goals.</p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["The new funding will allow Belize to invest in critical infrastructure, health, and education projects without worsening its fiscal outlook. 2.

Seaweed farming, the main marine aquaculture activity, employs 25,000 people, 80 percent of whom are women. It is also Zanzibar's third largest export. However, the sustainability of these resources is threatened by overfishing and climate change. These trends make the TAFSAM project both timely and relevant to the sustainability of marine resources in Tanzania.</p><p>SCALE will use a Program for Results (PforR) approach, where funding is tied to achieving specific results, and focuses on two key areas.

Recent events, including three cyclones and El Ni\u0144o rains, have led to the deaths of 155 people, affected the lives of over 200,000 people, and resulted in US$368 million in damages. In Dar es Salaam alone, flooding in 2018 cost an estimated US$100 million, or about 2 percent of GDP. With drought affecting an estimated 4.8 million people annually, adaptation measures are needed to reduce future climate-related economic losses.</p><p>*The World Bank's International Development Association (IDA), established in 1960, helps the world's poorest countries by providing grants and low to zero-interest loans for projects and programs that boost economic growth, reduce poverty, and improve poor people's lives.
