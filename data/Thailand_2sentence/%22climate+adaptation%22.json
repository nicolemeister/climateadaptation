For the latter, Thailand needs around 5-7 trillion baht in climate finance to achieve its carbon neutrality and net-zero emissions by 2050 and 2065, respectively. However, that's a target the country is still a long way away from.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Relatively speaking, only 1.7 trillion baht has been spent on climate mitigation efforts between 2018 and May 2025. The picture for climate adaptation funding is much bleaker at only 148 billion baht.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This serious gap in funding was the major talking point during the launch of the 2025 Climate Finance Tracker last month by Climate Finance NetworkThailand (CFNT).</p><p>Across two panel discussions and two keynote addresses (comprising leading voices from the Thai government, Bank of Thailand, the World Bank, and leading financial and academic institutions), the message was clear: more climate finance is needed, and the mechanisms to raise it must appeal to more investors.</p><p>Why is there such a big difference in climate mitigation and adaptation funding? The answer is the private sector. A CFNT presentation on the climate finance landscape shows that it is the biggest contributor to climate mitigation finance, at over half of the 1.7 trillion-baht amount, surpassing contributions from the government and state-owned enterprises. However, adaptation finance is almost solely done by the government, as there is less of a commercial reason to do so.</p><p>While funding for mitigation efforts still needs to be increased, it shows the strength of blended finance in action -- namely, the critical role of private investments that support government efforts. So what more can be done to spur more activity, for both mitigation and adaptation outcomes?</p><p>Blended finance in a nutshell</p><p>According to the OECD, blended finance refers to \"the strategic use of development finance for the mobilisation of additional finance towards sustainable development\", with the additional finance largely referring to funding from commercial sources. When looking through the lens of climate finance, blended finance can help to strategically meld funding from the public sector (like the government), multilateral development finance institutions (MDFIs), and philanthropic organisations with private capital to spur investments in climate activities, especially in developing countries where such financing can be considered 'risky'.</p><p>This risk aspect is important to understand how blended finance works. Commercial and private investors typically deem investments into climate mitigation -- and even more so, adaptation -- activities to be financially unviable and something that would not generate returns.</p><p>So, blended finance puts the burden of risk on governments, MDFIs, and philanthropies to make climate financing more viable and enticing to the private sector (for example, corporations or commercial financial institutions). It can also be seen as a form of concessional capital, whereby such mechanisms can facilitate private funding under terms more favourable than existing market conditions.</p><p>The adaptation finance shortfall</p><p>Blended finance isn't new. Yet, as noted earlier, much of its activity has been in the climate mitigation space.</p><p>There are typically more commercial reasons for private investors to fund climate mitigation. For instance, to help manage supply chain disruption risks caused by climate change, and, in some markets (especially more advanced ones), it is necessary to adhere to state-mandated emissions regulations. There are also reputational reasons in terms of enhancing a brand's image or attracting consumers and investors who are more environmentally conscious. Here, the \"carrot\" and \"stick\" are clear.</p><p>However, for climate adaptation, only the \"stick\" is really present, coming in the form of climate impacts clearly causing harm to societal health and well-being. While there are economic losses projected -- of a not-so-insignificant amount of up to 1 trillion baht, according to Unescap estimates -- this is seen as abstract and includes factors well beyond just commercial activities. This is why financing for adaptation pales in comparison to mitigation.</p><p>But what sort of blended finance mechanisms can spark more private sector interest in adaptation funding? Here are a few:</p><p>Guarantees</p><p>This mechanism utilises capital from public or philanthropic sources to absorb some of the risk associated with climate-related investments. For private investors, such guarantees can reduce the potential for loss and encourage them to take part in projects that address climate change.</p><p>Examples include first-loss guarantees, whereby the guarantor absorbs the initial losses, making the project more appealing to other investors. There are also partial credit guarantees, which can cover some of the potential losses to reduce overall private investor risk. Meanwhile, green guarantees refer to specific guarantee types that focus on climate-related projects, often used to support the issuance of green bonds.</p><p>Grants</p><p>Essentially, these are funds given without any expectation of returns. They often come from MDFIs (such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank) and philanthropies, and are typically used to jumpstart projects.</p><p>They are usually supplemented with research and capacity development via technical assistance.</p><p>Preferably, this assistance should be provided for the entire duration of the project being funded, from the initial planning stages to ensuring that it can be operated and monitored in the long run.</p><p>Subordinated debts</p><p>A financing mechanism where the lender agrees to be repaid after other, senior creditors in case of a default.</p><p>The subordinate debt, in this context, is considered \"junior\" to other, senior debt, meaning it is repaid only after senior debt holders are fully paid.</p><p>Still some way to go</p><p>Blended finance can help alleviate the concerns of private investors while also allowing different types of investors with different risk appetites to work together for a common goal.</p><p>That's not to say it isn't growing; the World Bank stated that private sector investment in blended finance for climate action grew by 200% in 2023. However, more needs to be done, and time's running out -- we need to address critical areas of climate adaptation before it's too late.</p><p>Currently, many promising climate adaptation projects in Thailand (such as sustainable water infrastructure, urban resilience, and sustainable agriculture) are conceived and carried out by government officials, civil society and philanthropic organisations, or even local communities.</p><p>Yet, the barriers to improving the projects' effectiveness and scaling them up include the lack of technical skills -- especially when creating and maintaining monitoring systems to measure and report outcomes. These groups also require better financial knowledge, namely when securing loans and managing climate adaptation finances. This is a gap that can be capably filled by Thailand's well-developed and sophisticated private sector and private financial institutions, yet their involvement has been close to non-existent.</p><p>Hence, adaptation finance should be viewed as not expenses, but as worthwhile investments, as its purpose is to help avoid or reduce climate change's social and economic impacts.</p><p>The effects of climate change do not discriminate.

But achieving both a just energy transition and ambitious global climate action depends on trade rules that foster equitable development. To facilitate the shift to low-carbon economies, developing countries must have reliable access to green technologies, investments, and international markets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Regrettably, many of today's trade policies constrain developing countries' green ambitions. In particular, the securitisation of international trade -- driven by the geopolitical interests of major powers and emerging blocs -- threatens to disrupt global supply chains, limit access to emerging technologies, and reinforce existing power imbalances. If left unchecked, this trend risks undermining multilateral cooperation and regional integration efforts across the Global South.</p><p>The European Union's Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism is a prime example. While the CBAM is intended to position the EU as a global leader on climate action, many developing countries -- particularly in Africa -- view it as a protectionist measure and question its alignment with the principles of the 2015 Paris climate agreement.</p><p>These concerns are well-founded. Research suggests that African countries could lose up to $25 billion (816 billion baht) annually as a direct result of the CBAM, and that the proposed amendments may not always stand to benefit African exporters. Moreover, despite the establishment of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), the EU continues to pursue fragmented bilateral deals that undermine Africa's integration agenda and weaken the coherence of regional trade strategies.</p><p>Another example is the International Maritime Organization's controversial plan to introduce a carbon emissions tax on shipping. Set to take effect in 2028, the tax falls far short of the more ambitious carbon levy developing economies had advocated, which could have supported low-carbon transitions, climate adaptation, and capacity-building in the world's most climate-vulnerable countries.</p><p>Investor-state dispute settlement mechanisms also present significant challenges to effective climate action. These provisions, embedded in international investment treaties, often limit African governments' ability to legislate in the public interest or implement trade and investment policies that support green industrialisation and sustainable development.</p><p>In recent years, international development practitioners have increasingly focused on the link between trade and climate policy. This signals a shift from a purely normative view of climate change to a more pragmatic approach that recognises climate policy as a driver of economic growth and investment. At the same time, global trade is undergoing a profound transformation as major trading powers prioritise geopolitical and economic self-interest over longstanding commitments to non-discrimination and multilateral cooperation, thereby weakening the World Trade Organization.</p><p>Against this backdrop, developed and developing economies alike are deploying fiscal stimulus packages, subsidies, and protectionist trade measures to align their climate goals with domestic green industrial strategies, aiming to reshape the global economic order in their favour. The race to gain a competitive edge in green industries is partly driven by the dominant position China has established over the past decade through a combination of fiscal expansion, strategic subsidies, and control over critical minerals and key supply chains.</p><p>Adding to these tensions is US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw from the Paris climate agreement, as he did during his first term. This move has further eroded global trust and undermined multilateral climate cooperation, casting doubt on the reliability of developed countries' commitments to the broader sustainable-development agenda.</p><p>Yet periods of geopolitical realignment can also create new opportunities. Even amid rising tensions and economic fragmentation, there are opportunities for African countries to advance fairer, climate-aligned trade rules. One of the most promising is increased regional integration.</p><p>Despite deep divisions within the G20, South Africa's presidency of the group this year could help advance trade policies that are better suited to managing climate risks and accelerating clean-energy transitions in the Global South. The upcoming Leaders' Summit in Johannesburg provides a platform to champion a more inclusive agenda that integrates risk management, economic diversification, and industrial development into a long-term vision of environmental justice.</p><p>Some low-income economies are particularly vulnerable to measures like the CBAM, which, in its current form, departs from the \"common but differentiated responsibilities\" principle that underpins the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. Without careful design and implementation, it could exacerbate inequalities within Africa and jeopardise the continent's energy transition.</p><p>To prevent such an outcome, the CBAM must be implemented through a transparent, multilateral framework that acknowledges differences in countries' historical responsibility and capacity to respond. Redirecting CBAM revenues toward supporting green transitions in low-income economies, for example, would be a step in the right direction.</p><p>It is equally important to help countries that rely heavily on fossil fuels diversify their economies. This raises a fundamental question: How can trade policy be leveraged to foster climate-resilient development? The answer lies in recognising that diversification is not only central to long-term growth but also crucial to building resilience to both climate disasters and external shocks.</p><p>While global consensus on climate policies remains out of reach, regional trade agreements and coalitions offer a viable path forward. The AfCFTA, for example, could help us reimagine trade as a catalyst for inclusive development. By strengthening intra-African trade and economic resilience, it could help unlock new pathways to food sovereignty, climate adaptation, and long-term stability across the continent.</p><p>The world needs fresh thinking and more equitable relationships between the Global North and South. Although today's geopolitical landscape, marked by self-interest and weak leadership, is fraught with uncertainty, it also creates space to promote green, climate-conscious solutions that are largely absent from existing trade frameworks.</p><p>When the current turbulent period gives way to renewed cooperation, we must be ready to introduce a new climate-trade framework.

The multi-faceted approach is aimed at addressing the potential impacts of climate change on the country's weather patterns, focusing on adaptation, mitigation, and climate resilience-building. Key initiatives include:</p><p>National Action Plan on Climate Change (NAPCC): Launched in 2008, it outlines eight national missions that focus on promoting sustainable development while addressing climate change. These include solar energy, energy efficiency, sustainable agriculture, and water conservation missions. The NAPCC, prepared under the guidance of the Prime Minister's Council on Climate Change, also includes measures to assess and manage the impact of sea level rise on coastal areas. The National Adaptation Fund for Climate Change (NAFCC) is aimed at climate adaptation, including coastal areas. The NAFCC finances the measures to protect vulnerable coastal communities and improve their resilience to sea level rise. Besides, the Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) notifications also aim to manage and regulate development in coastal areas. The CRZ regulations help protect coastal ecosystems and manage the impact of human activities, thus reducing vulnerability to rising sea levels.</p><p>State Action Plans: States have also developed their own climate action plan in line with the NAPCC, addressing region-specific vulnerabilities such as extreme weather events (floods, droughts), drainage reform, and shifting monsoon patterns.</p><p>Disaster Management and Early Warning Systems: India has strengthened disaster preparedness through its National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA), which works closely with the India Meteorological Department to minimize the impacts of extreme weather events (e.g., cyclones, heatwaves, floods).</p><p>Climate-Resilient Agriculture: The Government has promoted climate-resilient agricultural practices, such as drought-resistant crops, improved water management, and changes in cropping patterns to adapt to shifting rainfall and temperature patterns.</p><p>Renewable Energy Development: India is aggressively expanding renewable energy sources, particularly solar and wind, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and transition to a low-carbon economy. The country aims to achieve 500 GW of non-fossil fuel-based energy capacity by 2030.</p><p>Water Conservation: With increasing concerns over water scarcity, the Government has initiated various programs like the Jal Jeevan Mission and National Water Mission to improve water management and ensure sustainable water use, especially in drought-prone regions.</p><p>Policy and Financial Frameworks: The Government has also integrated climate change considerations into national policies and budgets, aligning with international climate agreements (e.g., the Paris Agreement). This includes setting emission reduction targets and focusing on climate financing for vulnerable sectors.</p><p>These efforts aim to reduce vulnerabilities and prepare the country to combat the diverse impacts of climate change, from altered monsoon patterns to more frequent extreme weather events and their cascading effects.</p><p>A systematic coordination is in place between IMD, CWC, State Disaster Management Authority (SDMA), and the State Irrigation Department. Regular monsoon preparedness meetings are held between these agencies for Odisha, which is highly vulnerable to heavy rainfall and floods in the season. IMD, CWC and other stakeholders have jointly implemented an interoperable environment for generating real-time forecast and warning information related to heavy rainfall-induced floods. The Flood Meteorological Office (FMO) located at Bhubneshwar provides all flood-related precipitation data and forecasts for all river catchments in the State. In this regard, IMD supports CWC, SDMA, and the State Irrigation Department by providing observed and forecasted rainfall data and warnings using state-of-the-art NWP-based forecasts and radar-based nowcast systems. Though floods are mainly managed by the CWC, but for all rain-induced Flash Floods-related warnings are currently provided by IMD using a Flash Floods Guidance System (FFGS) operational in IMD. The FFGS bulletins are issued for the flash floods operationally considering the observed and forecasted rainfall, soil moisture, and river conditions.

With governments having limited room to act due to fiscal constraints, the burden of climate adaptation will fall primarily on households and firms. Awareness of climate risks is high; more than three-quarters of households and firms expect a weather shock in the next 10 years. Climate adaptation is widespread, with 63 percent of firms and 80 percent of households having taken action. However, most rely on basic, low-cost solutions rather than leveraging advanced technologies and public infrastructure. </p><p>Market imperfections and income constraints limit access to information, finance, and technologies needed for more effective adaptation. If these obstacles were removed, private sector adaptation could offset about one-third of the potential damage from rising global temperatures on South Asian economies. The policy priority for governments is therefore to facilitate private sector adaptation through a comprehensive policy package. The package includes climate-specific measures such as improving weather information access, promoting resilient technologies and weather insurance, and investing in protective infrastructure in a targeted manner. Equally important are broader developmental initiatives with resilience co-benefits: in other words, policies that generate double dividends. These include strengthening core public goods like transportation, water systems, and healthcare; addressing barriers to accessing markets, inputs, and finance without causing unintended responses that increase vulnerabilities; and supporting vulnerable groups through shock-responsive social protection.</p><p>Chapter 2. Under the Weather: Household Climate Risk. South Asia is expected to face more frequent and more severe weather shocks over the coming decade. By 2030, 1.8 billion people (89 percent of the region's population) are projected to be exposed to extreme heat, while 462 million people (22 percent) are projected to be exposed to severe flooding. Poor and agricultural households in the region are more exposed to, and affected by, weather shocks. Weather shocks cause damage to human capital and assets, as well as income losses. However, when households receive early warnings, nearly 90 percent take preemptive action to reduce damages. Households' access to early warning systems is uneven: in vulnerable coastal and riverine areas, most households have access to early warnings for cyclones but fewer than half of them have access to early warnings for floods and other shocks. These findings call for better early warning systems, targeted programs to assist vulnerable households during shocks in a timely fashion, and policies to help households adapt to the growing risk of extreme weather shocks.</p><p>Chapter 3. Prepared for the Worst: Building Household Resilience. Rising exposure to climate risk in South Asia has increased pressure on households to adapt, but current adaptation strategies among rural households are inadequate for the scale of the problem. While 80 percent of surveyed households in South Asia have adapted to climate change in some way, 80 percent of these adapting households rely on accessible, low-technology methods, with limited use of more advanced tools such as weather insurance or climate- resilient agricultural inputs. Limited access to credit, land, and information all constrain household adaptation. Extreme weather events lead to short-lived adaptations whose longer-term effectiveness may be limited, while underestimation of future climate risk leads to inadequate investment in adaptation. Protective public infrastructure tends to substitute for private adaptation. This removes some of the burden on households but carries a risk of investing in places rather than people, generating lock-in, and forestalling necessary reallocations. Policies to alleviate financial and land market failures and information constraints can help households adapt in place, while faster job creation in non-agricultural sectors and urban areas would help them move to more productive sectors and locations.</p><p>Chapter 4. Shutters Down: Firm Climate Risk. Increasingly frequent and severe weather shocks reduce revenues, damage physical assets, and require costly shifts in products, markets, and labor practices for South Asian firms. Firm managers in the region expect that increasingly frequent and severe weather shocks will cause damages in 2025-2029 that are three times as great as those experienced from 2019-2024. More experienced and more highly skilled managers tend to have expectations about future weather shocks that are more aligned with consensus forecasts. They also expect lower damages, possibly because better managers tend to be better able to adapt to extreme weather.</p><p>Chapter 5. Back to Business: Building Firm Resilience. South Asian firms are acting to mitigate the impact of weather-related shocks on their business, with 63 percent of them having undertaken at least one such action in the past five years. But these firms have largely relied on low-cost upgrades to buildings and equipment for adapting to the growing risk of weather shocks rather than major upgrades to capital, technologies, or business practices. Firms that have experienced, or expect, more weather shocks have been more likely to undertake adaptations, while firms with less-advanced management practices, and firms facing greater financial and regulatory obstacles have adapted less. These results suggest that there is scope for policies to encourage adaptation by improving access to information about adaptation options, by helping firms to strengthen managerial capabilities, and by easing regulatory burdens and expanding access to finance.</p><p>Chapter 6. Returns to Resilience: Aggregate Impacts of Adaptation. Because of South Asia's already-high average temperature and reliance on rain-fed agriculture, rising global temperatures could lead to aggregate output and per capita income losses by 2050 that are larger than those in the average emerging market and developing economy (EMDE). Higher temperatures would cause significant damage in the most vulnerable sectors, such as agriculture, but more limited damage in the most resilient sectors, such as services. About one-third of the total climate damage could be reduced if the private sector could flexibly shift resources across activities and locations in response to these climate-induced changes in relative prices and incomes. Even South Asia's fiscally constrained governments have scope to facilitate these shifts, including by expanding access to finance, improving transport and digital connectivity, and providing well-targeted and flexible social benefit systems.</p><p>Spotlight. Who Bears the Burden of Climate Adaptation and How? A Systematic Review. South Asia's high vulnerability to rising global temperatures and increasingly common weather shocks, combined with constrained fiscal positions limiting public adaptation measures, means the burden of adaptation will fall disproportionately on firms and households-particularly poor households, which are more vulnerable to weather shocks. A comprehensive and systematic review of research identifies a variety of adaptation strategies used by households, firms, and farmers. These strategies have reduced the damage from weather shocks by 46 percent, on average, in the examples covered by the literature. Adaptations that involve new resilient technologies or public support- typically in the form of core public goods such as roads and health systems that help access jobs and protect human capital-tend to be the most effective in reducing the damage from weather shocks. Compared to households and farmers, firms have access to more effective adaptation strategies, typically technology-related. The analysis suggests that policy should be guided by three principles: (i) implementing a comprehensive package of policies; (ii) prioritizing policies that generate double dividends; and (iii) designing policies that target broader developmental goals in a manner that does not set back adaptation-related goals.</p><p>Deep dive 1. Climate Adaptation and Agriculture in South Asia. South Asian agriculture faces significant challenges from rising global temperatures, compounded by the sector's existing constraints, including the predominance of smallholder farming and low productivity. Rising temperatures, water scarcity, irregular rainfall patterns, and more frequent extreme weather events such as droughts and floods threaten to reduce South Asia's agricultural output by 7.5 percent by 2050, considerably more than in other EMDE regions. The key strategies needed to build agricultural resilience are the promotion of climate-smart farming practices, expansion of weather insurance markets, redirection of inefficient input subsidies, modernization of irrigation infrastructure, and leveraging of digital technologies to deliver weather information and advisory services to farmers.</p><p>Deep dive 2. Bridging the Adaptation Financing Gap in South Asia. Dedicated adaptation finance meets only a fraction of South Asia's needs for climate adaptation. This gap stems from limited fiscal space for public funding and financial market imperfections that limit private financing. To help finance public goods for adaptation, governments can mobilize resources by eliminating distortions like fossil fuel subsidies; scaling up innovative instruments like blended finance; and strengthening institutional capacity to access concessional sources of climate finance. Credit and insurance market failures that limit access to adaptation financing can be overcome through standardized metrics to improve lending decisions, strategic use of public finance for de-risking private credit, emergency credit guarantee schemes, and expanded markets for weather index insurance.</p><p>Deep Dive 3. Adaptive Social Protection in South Asia. Social protection systems can help strengthen resilience, before a shock strikes, by reducing poverty and, once a shock strikes, by supporting the most vulnerable. These programs can also help build resilience to climate change by encouraging adaptation, asset accumulation, and income diversification. However, while South Asia's social protection systems have good coverage at 77 percent of the population, they are underfunded, with expenditure at only 4 percent of GDP, less than half the EMDE average. These programs are also generally not well- targeted and not rapidly scalable, which could be addressed with investments in information systems and program design. Case studies from Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan show that well-targeted social assistance programs, combined with up-to-date information, can be rapidly scaled up to respond to shocks and provide support for the poor and vulnerable.</p><p>Deep Dive 4. Urban Policy for Climate Adaptation in South Asia. Just like South Asia's rural population, its urban population is also highly exposed to extreme weather shocks and this exposure is projected to grow. By 2030, 322 million (24 percent of the urban population) are projected to be exposed to flooding, while 1.2 billion (92 percent) are projected to be exposed to extreme heat. Large and growing concentrations of vulnerable population groups in cities add to the region's challenge of building urban resilience to extreme weather. South Asian cities can build climate resilience by better integrating climate risk data into urban planning and regulation, further investing in early warning systems and resilient infrastructure, supporting targeted interventions for vulnerable populations, and strengthening the technical capacity of city governments to implement resilience-related programs.</p><p>The full report is available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/09b2be7d-8a81-4201-8487-c682eb3f55c6/download\">https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/bitstreams/09b2be7d-8a81-4201-8487-c682eb3f55c6/download</url></p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["South Asia is the most climate-vulnerable region among emerging market and developing economies.

The timing aligns closely with global temperature increases and accelerated glacial melt driven by human activity, showing that the Indian Ocean has been highly responsive to climatic changes for over half a century.</p><p>The second is that sea levels in the Indian Ocean, which covers approximately 30% of the world's ocean area and supports around 30% of the global population, have risen significantly by 30cm since the middle of the 20th century.</p><p>What we're seeing is a clear fingerprint of human-driven climate change etched into the skeletons of corals. The early acceleration in sea-level rise is a warning sign that the ocean has been responding to global warming far earlier and more strongly than we thought, said Prof Kench.</p><p>Accelerating sea-level rise threatens millions living in coastal areas with increased flooding, erosion, saltwater intrusion, and damage to vital ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs.</p><p>The effects of sea-level changes in the Indian Ocean ripples beyond Asia to the rest of the world, underscoring the need for international cooperation to address global challenges such as water security, agriculture, and disaster preparedness.</p><p>For Singapore and its Southeast Asian neighbours, the uncovering of long-term patterns of sea-level changes can improve climate models and strengthen the region's ability to plan for future risks under continued global warming.</p><p>For example, the new coral-derived data from the study offers a historical baseline that can enhance the efforts that Singapore already has in place to guard against rising sea levels, such as the Coastal-Inland Flood Model and Climate Impact Science Research Programme, by improving the accuracy of sea-level projections and informing adaptive strategies.</p><p>Corals confirmed as trusted recorders of sea-level and climate history</p><p>This research sets a new standard for how scientists can use coral to look back in time and understand how our oceans have changed.</p><p>As corals grow, they build their skeletons layer by layer similar to how trees form rings. Each layer captures details about the ocean at that time, such as temperature, salt levels, and even sea level.</p><p>To make sure data from the coral samples from the Indian Ocean that were analysed was reliable, the team compared it with real sea-level measurements from tide stations and satellites, and found that they matched up closely.</p><p>The successful calibration of coral proxies against instrumental sea-level records means that we can trust corals to tell us about past sea-level changes, with their coral growth rates validated to be reliable indicators of relative sea-level changes, making them a powerful tool for climate research.</p><p>In addition to tracking long-term sea-level changes, the coral records also captured signs of extreme climate events such as unusual warming and cooling periods, as well as droughts. These signals closely match historical weather records, offering valuable insight into the frequency and severity of past climate extremes.</p><p>Prof Kench said, These findings have far-reaching implications for climate adaptation planning globally, especially for low-lying and densely populated coastal regions.

The rising global temperatures are triggering more frequent and severe weather events, from prolonged droughts to intense flooding. Thailand, with its low-lying coastal areas and reliance on agriculture, is particularly vulnerable to these changes. To safeguard its future, the country must prioritize sustainable practices, invest in resilient infrastructure, and foster community awareness about climate adaptation. Failure to act swiftly could lead to devastating impacts on livelihoods, ecosystems, and the economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Arctic is melting, seas are rising, and extreme weather is reshaping the planet. If we don't act to protect ourselves in time, we'll face catastrophic consequences.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are entering an entirely new world where once unimaginable things are becoming a reality. Take Japan's Mount Fuji. For the first time in 130 years, its summit was snow-free in October, a stark symbol of global warming. What ensues, however, is not only environmental but also economic and political challenges.</p><p>Around the world, permafrost is melting in Siberia, revealing ancient mammoth tusks with new ivory businesses. Greenland's melting ice and new mining opportunities are fuelling aspirations for political independence. The new Arctic shipping routes have also stirred geopolitical tensions over control.</p><p>Closer to home, Indonesia is planning to move its capital from sinking Jakarta, and the Pacific islands are struggling to survive rising seas.</p><p>Thailand, too, faces this inevitable future.</p><p>Ahead is a new world fraught with risks. Rising temperatures threaten agriculture, food security, health, and the economy. Farm production will plunge. Biodiversity will shrink from widespread species extinction.</p><p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), half the world will face extreme heat lasting more than 20 days at a 2\u00b0C temperature rise. At 3\u00b0C, this figure jumps to 74%. At 3\u00b0C, droughts may last more than 10 months a year. The melting permafrost in Siberia could release lethal methane, intensifying global heat and natural disasters. Beyond 3\u00b0C, the damage would be catastrophic, triggering global tipping points.</p><p>Thailand is highly vulnerable to rising seas, severe floods, prolonged droughts, and heatwaves. Extreme heat \u2014 days over 35\u00b0C will become common, and 40\u00b0C heatwaves could be regular.</p><p>High temperatures aren't just uncomfortable; they are deadly, particularly for outdoor workers in agriculture, construction, and delivery services who need to cut work hours. As economic hardship spreads, crime could rise, and birth rates could fall.</p><p>Natural disasters will intensify. The 2011 floods in central Thailand were one of the worst disasters, and this year's deadly floods in the North remind us of the ongoing threat.</p><p>Key to survival is timely climate change adaptation to protect the populace, particularly vulnerable groups who will be most affected by climate disasters.</p><p>Despite contributing less than 1% of global greenhouse gases, Thailand ranks 9th in the Climate Risk Index. Over the past 20 years, the country has experienced 146 extreme weather events, causing damages of approximately US$7.7 billion per year.</p><p>Coastal flooding poses a critical threat. Within 30 years, parts of Bangkok and the Central Plains close to the Gulf of Thailand could be underwater. It is already happening. In Samut Prakan, the Khun Samut Chin Temple, once inland, now sits on an island due to coastal erosion. Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian district shows utility poles standing in the water as the land sinks.</p><p>A study supported by the TDRI also suggests that areas like Phetchaburi could experience 487mm of rainfall over five consecutive days \u2014 truly catastrophic.</p><p>Droughts, too, are intensifying, threatening tourism, the country's cash cow. Certain areas, such as Mae Hong Son, could experience over 100 rain-free days a year, leading to extreme heat and water scarcity. The result? Dangerous heatwaves and dwindling water supplies.</p><p>Thailand already endures 50 days a year with temperatures over 35\u00b0C. That number is rising. Health issues will worsen, and productivity losses could drag down GDP.</p><p>So, what can Thailand do? There are three main strategies: prevention, preparation, and recovery.</p><p>Prevention and Risk Reduction: We must develop drought-resistant crops, update farming practices, and adapt our infrastructure to withstand storms and floods. Sustainable land use, especially in coastal areas, is vital. Building flood barriers with comprehensive feasibility studies and community input, as well as using mangroves to protect coastlines, are important steps. In some cases, relocation may be the only viable option.</p><p>Preparation and Response: Early warning systems and reliable weather forecasts are essential. For instance, the recent floods in the North caused unnecessary damage due to poor warnings. We need to support communities with relocation and essential recovery services where needed.</p><p>Recovery and Resilience: Post-disaster recovery should focus on resilience. Insurance and social safety nets help communities recover, and infrastructure should prioritise durability over quick fixes.</p><p>We should also avoid \"maladaptation\" \u2014 actions that worsen climate impacts.</p><p>Sea walls, often seen as essential against rising seas, need careful planning. Thailand's proposed sea wall to protect Bangkok must undergo thorough environmental studies, or it could backfire by shifting risks to vulnerable areas.</p><p>True adaptation requires addressing inequality since not everyone can adapt equally. Wealthier groups have more resources, while the poor face the greatest climate risks. Climate justice must be a priority to ensure everyone has the support they need.</p><p>A look abroad offers valuable lessons. The Netherlands has built a seawall system informed by environmental studies and community input. Japan uses \"Digital Twin\" technology to simulate flood scenarios and plan evacuations. Israel is a model for water management in drought conditions, and Singapore invests in green spaces to counteract heat waves.</p><p>To get the most from adaptation investments, measures should reduce losses, boost the economy, and benefits society and the environment. Key steps include establishing an advanced weather forecasting system, building resilient infrastructure, developing drought-resistant crops, protecting mangroves, and improving water management.</p><p>Thailand should levy a carbon tax to create a Green Transition and Adaptation Fund. This fund would support climate adaptation, help vulnerable groups, and improve infrastructure to transition to a low-carbon future. Additionally, the government should use insurance to support those affected by natural disasters instead of relying on one-off handouts.</p><p>To prepare for a hotter world, Thailand must create new jobs that don't rely on outdoor work, shift away from traditional farming, consider using biotech seeds, and start charging for water in agriculture. Planning for sea walls and even relocating cities should be on the agenda.</p><p>One significant challenge is decentralising power so local communities can manage risk effectively. Reforming uncontrolled land use is also necessary, as it exacerbates floods and other natural disasters.</p><p>While Thailand's adaptation plans are steps in the right direction, they still rely on outdated governance models and lack the proper budgeting needed for urgent change. We must take bold action, transforming crises into opportunities for survival through effective adaptation.</p><p>The climate crisis, tough as it is, could push Thailand to make overdue reforms for the common good. This includes decentralising state governance, developing robust climate protection systems, modernising agriculture, building climate-resilient cities, expanding eco-tourism, and creating climate insurance.</p><p>Thailand needs to act decisively. Our future depends on how we adapt now. This is our chance to turn a crisis into an opportunity for survival.

They were moved to a site called Khar Yalla, which Senegalese officials acknowledge is unfit for permanent habitation. Authorities have violated their economic, social, and cultural rights through inaction, and left them out of a climate-related, planned relocation benefitting others from their communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Khar Yalla's story shows that inadequate planning for climate-related relocations can lead to protracted displacement, instead of durable solutions, said Erica Bower, climate displacement researcher at Human Rights Watch. Senegal should urgently remedy the rights violations in Khar Yalla and develop policy to ensure that future climate-displaced communities receive adequate support, including through rights-respecting planned relocation.</p><p>Human Rights Watch interviewed more than 100 people, including displaced people, government officials, and experts, and analyzed satellite imagery, academic publications, and documents from the Senegalese government, World Bank, United Nations agencies, and nongovernmental groups.</p><p>The approximately 1,000 people who live in Khar Yalla, outside the Saint-Louis city center, come from centuries-old fisherfolk communities on the Langue de Barbarie, which is highly exposed to impacts of the climate crisis. After losing their houses to coastal floods and living for several months in tents, the families agreed to the local authorities' plan to move them to Khar Yalla in late 2016.</p><p>Authorities assured them that it would be short-term and gave them temporary permits to occupy houses constructed for another, failed planned relocation for other flood-prone households.</p><p>But the displaced families are still in Khar Yalla, with no essential services and living in conditions that violate their right to adequate housing. There is severe overcrowding, no electricity, and no waste disposal. The site is in a flood zone; during the rainy season, wastewater enters the houses and contaminates the water supply.</p><p>The government's failure to provide essential services in Khar Yalla or connect it to services elsewhere has violated people's rights to education and health. An estimated one third of children do not attend school; many people have had to forego health care.</p><p>Families there also face ongoing violations to their rights to an adequate standard of living and to take part in cultural life. Most households' incomes have been reduced to levels below the international poverty line for a lower-middle income country like Senegal, and people are having trouble feeding their families. The authorities have failed to respond to these gaps.</p><p>Community members are struggling to maintain their fishing livelihoods in the Langue de Barbarie, five kilometers away, given the distance and high costs of taxis and private buses. The loss of fishing livelihoods has negative cultural consequences, too. Fishing is our whole life, said one older man in Khar Yalla.</p><p>Authorities have also thwarted Khar Yalla leaders' attempts to retrain people for new professions. We have no support from the authorities, and when we tried to find our own solution, they stopped us, said one woman in Khar Yalla.</p><p>Moreover, the government failed to include the Khar Yalla families in a permanent, climate-related planned relocation of 15,000 fisherfolk from the Langue de Barbarie to an inland site called Djougop, being carried out through the World Bank-funded Saint-Louis Emergency Recovery &amp; Resilience Project.</p><p>Among beneficiaries are over 200 families who were also displaced from Langue de Barbarie by coastal floods, in 2017 and 2018, and then temporarily housed in tents in Khar Yalla. The World Bank and government relocated these families onto Djougop, after determining that Khar Yalla was not a suitable permanent relocation site. But the families displaced in 2015 and 2016 were left behind.</p><p>A planned relocation can facilitate a durable solution for those displaced by climate-related disasters but only if its scope includes those experiencing protracted displacement and the planning process respects human rights standards, including meaningful consultation with affected people. There was no such process for the families who moved to Khar Yalla in 2016.</p><p>We've asked sometimes if the authorities consider us as human, said Khady Gueye, a Khar Yalla community leader. Government officials interviewed showed a lack of awareness about Khar Yalla. Some even denied that the families had been displaced by floods.</p><p>The Senegalese government is obligated under national and international law to respect and fulfill people's economic, social, and cultural rights and protect them from reasonably foreseeable risks to rights, including climate change impacts such as risings seas.</p><p>Senegal has invested more than many countries to support climate-displaced communities but has unjustifiably left the families in Khar Yalla out of those efforts.

It should also develop a policy on climate-related planned relocation that includes mechanisms for climate-displaced communities to request support, prioritizes meaningful consultation, and establishes criteria for relocation site selection to ensure beneficiaries' rights are fulfilled through relocation.</p><p>The World Bank should reform its policies as well. Current policies were designed for resettlements carried out in development projects, which are fundamentally different from climate-related planned relocations. New policies should require grantees to identify beneficiaries displaced for the longest periods who need a durable solution.</p><p>Policy shifts from Senegal and the World Bank are urgent because planned relocations will only become more common as the climate crisis accelerates, Bower said.

Europe's capacity grew by 9 per cent - with Germany contributing more than one quarter of that growth. Africa's capacity grew by almost 7 per cent.</p><p>All of this is another reminder of a twenty-first century truth: Renewables are renewing economies. They are powering growth, creating jobs, lowering energy bills and cleaning our air. And every day, they become an even smarter investment.</p><p>Since 2010, the average cost of wind power has plunged 60 per cent. Solar is 90 per cent cheaper.

They must align with the 1.5\\xB0C limit, as agreed at COP28 [twenty-eighth Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]. And cover all emissions and the whole economy.</p><p>Together, they must reduce global emissions 60 per cent by 2035 compared to 2019 and contribute to the COP28 global energy transition goals.</p><p>All this must be achieved in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of national circumstances but everybody, everybody must do more. The Group of 20 (G20) - the largest emitters and economies - must lead.</p><p>Every country must step up and play their part. The United Nations is with you all. President Lula and I are working to secure the highest ambition from the largest economies.</p><p>The United Nations Climate Promise is supporting 100 countries to prepare their new climate plans. And we will convene a special event in September to take stock of the plans of all countries, push for action to keep 1.5\\xB0C within reach, and deliver climate justice.</p><p>Second, we must drive finance to developing countries. The COP29 finance agreement must be implemented in full. I count on the leadership of the COP29 and COP30 presidencies to deliver a credible road map to mobilize $1.3 trillion a year by 2035.</p><p>We need new and innovative sources of financing, and credible carbon pricing.

For the poorest countries, debt service costs have tripled, and interest payments have quadrupled over the past decade, reaching $36 billion. Many Least Developed Countries (LDCs) now spend almost 15% of total revenue on interest payments, compared to 9.5% for other developing economies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 56 developing countries, interest payments exceed 10% of government revenue, and in 17 of those, the figure surpasses 20%-a threshold closely linked to default risk. On average, low-income countries spend 2.3 times more on interest payments than on social assistance, undermining poverty reduction and human development goals. As UNDP has warned, we are witnessing a scenario where debt is crowding out the very investments needed to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p>In addition, protracted debt restructuring negotiations and lack of a formalized restructuring framework have led to inadequate and unpredictable relief, often worsening fiscal uncertainty.</p><p>But there is a way forward. Debt-for-development/nature swaps can offer a transformative solution-one that aligns fiscal relief with environmental stewardship. They allow countries to redirect debt payments toward protecting biodiversity, restoring ecosystems, and building climate resilience-while also strengthening national ownership and long-term sustainability. Let me mention only a couple of examples of debt-for-nature swaps that would be presented later today:</p><p>Belize's 2021 deal, reduced its external debt by 10% of GDP and secured long-term financing for marine conservation, including protection of the second-largest coral reef system in the world.</p><p>Ecuador's 2023 swap, one of the largest of its kind, restructured over $1.6 billion in debt, generating $450 million for conservation of the Gal\\xE1pagos Islands over 20 years.</p><p>UNDP has been proud to support pioneering efforts in discussing debt swap options in member states, through pre-feasibility, structuring and monitoring projects where these swaps have unlocked millions for marine conservation, sustainable livelihoods, and climate adaptation.</p><p>Forests, wetlands, coral reefs, and mangroves are natural capital that underpins food security, water supply, disaster risk reduction, and livelihoods for billions. According to the UNDP studies, over half of global GDP-$44 trillion-is moderately or highly dependent on nature. Yet, we continue to underinvest in it. The current biodiversity finance gap is estimated at $700 billion per year.</p><p>Investing in nature is a necessity. We must move from pilot to policy, from innovation to institution. That means building robust frameworks, ensuring transparency and equity, and forging partnerships across ministries, sectors, and borders.</p><p>Nevertheless, it is also important to mention the caveats. While these instruments can unlock climate and biodiversity finance and allocate important public resources towards strategic development areas, they may be viewed as 'credit negative' by credit rating agencies particularly if it involves a distressed exchange. It is important to balance innovation and risk.</p><p>For instance, focusing on how use-of-proceeds bonds are tied into debt-for-nature structures to ensure ringfencing of proceeds for nature and conversation. Or how to harmonize debt relief mechanisms with credit rating methodologies to avoid penalizing countries for pursuing sustainable finance solutions.</p><p>Lastly, enhanced monitoring of debt-for-development swap proceeds is critical for transparency. Monitoring and reporting frameworks must be embedded in all debt-for-nature and debt-for-development swap agreements. Without clear governance and third-party verification, there is a risk that proceeds may be diverted or fail to deliver measurable outcomes. UNDP can also support and advocates for standardized metrics, independent audits, and participatory oversight to ensure that swap proceeds are aligned with national development priorities, SDG and NDCs, with its impact management and measurement work.</p><p>Let me close these brief remarks by also congratulating the Government of Spain on the exciting launch of the Global Hub for Debt Swaps for Development.

The report answers three critical questions: what can Vietnam do to adapt to climate change, how to engender growth-friendly emissions reduction, and how to unlock the potential of the marine economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why taking adaptation measures matter?</p><p>Vietnam is one of the world's most vulnerable countries to climate change, ranked 13th globally for climate risk during 2000-19 by Germanwatch. The climate crisis is already threatening key economic sectors, such as agriculture and transport, along with major urban and industrial hubs.</p><p>The cost of inaction is high. Macroeconomic models suggest that climate impacts could reduce national output by 9.1 percent from the baseline by 2030 and 12.5 percent by 2050, while also increasing inequality and slowing poverty reduction. Without adaptation measures, inaction could lead to an average annual loss of 0.33 percentage points in real GDP growth during the 2025-2050, potentially preventing Vietnam from achieving its goal of becoming a high-income economy by 2045.</p><p>While costly, investing in adaptive measures can significantly reduce economic and social losses. An estimated U$233 billion-or 0.75 percent of GDP annually-is required for adaptation in agriculture, infrastructure, and to protect human capital between 2025 and 2050. Simulations show these measures could cut the projected loss from 12.5 to 6.7 percent. Beyond these macroeconomic gains, such investments also yield crucial co-benefits such as increased productivity, environmental sustainability, and social resilience, which help improve the cost-benefit ratio of these investments.</p><p>How to reconcile growth and emission reductions?</p><p>Vietnam's economy remains relatively carbon intensive. Vietnam's carbon intensity-measured as GHG emissions per unit of GDP-exceeds the middle-income country average by 45.6 percent. GHG emissions in Vietnam continue to grow rapidly, increasing at an annual rate of 6.2 percent over the last decade. The power sector, industry, and agriculture are the primary sources of these emissions.</p><p>Vietnam has made an ambitious pledge and adopted a range of policies to reduce carbon emissions. The government's five key mitigation policies-focused on energy transition, green transport, agriculture, energy efficiency, and carbon pricing-can help achieve Vietnam's Nationally Determined Contribution targets for 2030. Climate mitigation policies offers crucial co-benefits such as fostering innovation, birth of new industires, and improving public health. However, these measures alone are insufficient to put the country on track to meet the 2050 net zero target.</p><p>To bridge this gap, it is critical to accelerate the decarbonization of industrial and manufacturing sectors and efforts to create carbon sinks. These measures would significantly contribute to cutting GHG emissions by 74 percent by 2050 and, through energy efficiency and lower costs, boosting real GDP by up to 4.4 percent compared to the baseline scenario. Decarbonization also improves Vietnam's export competitiveness in a growing global green market.</p><p>How can Marine Economy - a crucial nexus for climate adaptation and Mitigation - contribute more to sustainable economic development?</p><p>Vietnam's marine economy offers a clear competitive advantage, with a 3,260km coastline and vast ocean resources supporting half its population. The country's top leadership recognizes this potential, and its Resolution 36-NQ/TW sets an ambitious vision: for marine sectors to contribute 10 percent of GDP by 2030, with coastal regions generating up to 70 percent of the national total.</p><p>While the marine sector's direct contribution to the economy is currently estimated 5-5.8 percent of GDP, it grew rapidly at nearly 9 percent annually over the last decade. Beyond direct activity, healthy ecosystems deliver essential services like storm protection and carbon storage, conservatively adding another 0.6 percent to GDP. However, this potential is severely threatened by overfishing, climate change, and pollution, with Vietnam being one of the world's top five ocean plastic polluters.</p><p>The marine economy's vulnerability to climate risks makes adaptation urgent and beneficial. At the same time, it offers significant opportunities for climate mitigation. Expanding renewable energy-especially offshore wind and wave power-can reduce fossil fuel dependence, while restoring mangroves and protecting seagrass beds and coral reefs will boost coastal resilience and enhance natural carbon sinks.</p><p>To mitigate risks and realize the marine economy's potential, Vietnam should establish marine protected areas, enforce sustainable fishing practices, and restore mangroves to strengthen coastal resilience and carbon sequestration. Engaging local communities through education and sustainable livelihoods will foster stewardship of marine resources. Integrating ecosystem health into economic planning is essential to balance growth with sustainability and preserve ocean resources for future generations.</p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["4 percent compared to the baseline scenario.

These guidelines provide for both erosion mitigation works and resettlement of displaced populations through the National Disaster Response Fund (NDRF), with a recommended outlay of 1500 crore for 2021-26. This ensures that even smaller cities affected by erosion and climate-related hazards receive financial and logistical support</p><p>- NCCR offers scientific and technical support to coastal states by developing Shoreline Management Plans (SMP). These SMPs not only focus on safeguarding the coast but also address challenges such as the unintended impacts of hard engineering structures and the escalating risks posed by climate change.</p><p>- NCCR, has undertaken the compilation of a report and atlas on coastal bio-shields across India's coastal states which provides detailed village-level data on existing bio-shields along the shoreline which act as nature based solutions.</p><p>The various steps to safeguard the critical coastal infrastructure, freshwater sources, and livelihoods from flooding and saltwater intrusion in coastal regions are planned &amp; executed by respective Maritime States/UT Governments.

Recognizing the absence of a dedicated coastal data repository, CMIS was developed to systematically collect and analyze key coastal parameters. The primary objective of CMIS is to support effective coastal protection planning, erosion mitigation, and climate adaptation by providing reliable, site-specific data.</p><p>- National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), an attached office of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, is mapping the shoreline changes along the Indian coast to enhance the country's preparedness to face coastal hazards like storm surges, tsunami, etc. and to guide towards sustainable coastal development. NCCR has prepared and published a status report on National Assessment of Shoreline changes along Indian Coasts in March 2022.This report provides the status of coastline of the Indian mainland by classifying them into Erosion, Accreting and Stable coasts.</p><p>The Government is integrating community participation and spatial planning as part of its approach to building effective and inclusive coastal resilience. This is reflected in the Integrated Coastal Risk Mitigation and Resilience Programme (ICRMRP), developed by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p><p>The ICRMRP adopts a seven-component framework that includes not only technical and infrastructural measures such as risk assessment, early warning systems, and ecosystem resilience, but also community capacity building and sustainable development planning. These components emphasize active involvement of local communities in resilience efforts and promote spatial planning that considers socio-economic vulnerability, environmental sensitivity, and long-term sustainability.</p><p>This information was given by Dr. Jitendra Singh, Union Minister of State (Independent Charge) for Science and Technology, Earth Sciences, MoS PMO, MoS Personnel, Public Grievances &amp; Pensions, Department of Atomic Energy and Department of Space, in a written reply in the Rajya Sabha today.</p><p>(Press Information Bureau, Government of India)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["However, few of the steps taken by the Central Government to address the issues of coastal erosion are as given below:- Implementation of Coastal Management Information System (CMIS): The CMIS was initiated during the 12th Five-Year Plan to address the challenges of coastal erosion through a scientific and data driven approach.

Now, Belize has access to around US$77 million (based on today's exchange rate) to advance its development agenda.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Previously only a recipient of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) funding, Belize now also has access to IDA's low-interest loans with longer repayment terms.</p><p>This reclassification comes after the World Bank's Board approved a proposal to extend the Small Island Economies Exception to eligible non-island small states, acknowledging Belize's unique vulnerabilities and development needs. Belize's IDA eligibility opens new opportunities for the country to strengthen its economic growth, enhance resilience, and tackle long-standing development challenges.</p><p>Here are five key ways Belize stands to benefit from its new IDA status and access to the IDA Crisis Response Window:</p><p>1. Access to Concessional Financing for Development Projects</p><p>One of the most significant advantages of IDA membership is access to concessional financing. IDA loans, known as credits, come with highly favorable terms such as low or zero interest rates, long repayment periods (up to 40 years), and extended grace periods - a set time during which no loan payments are required.</p><p>These terms are a stark contrast to more expensive, commercial borrowing options. The new funding will allow Belize to invest in critical infrastructure, health, and education projects without worsening its fiscal outlook.</p><p>2. Better Climate Resilience and Disaster Preparedness</p><p>Belize loses almost 4% of its GDP to natural disasters every year, making it one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. IDA membership will enable Belize to tap into specific funding windows that target climate resilience and disaster preparedness. With these resources, Belize can invest in climate resiliency and long-term strategies to mitigate climate risks, restore vital ecosystems like mangroves and coral reefs, and invest in critical development areas such as safe water supply and education. Given that climate change is one of the most pressing threats to Belize's economic stability, IDA funding will provide a lifeline for future-proofing its economy.</p><p>3. Bolstering Economic Growth and Job Creation</p><p>Belize's Medium-Term Development Strategy sets ambitious goals, including achieving 5% annual economic growth and creating 50,000 jobs over the next five years.

It supports environmental enforcement and raises awareness about the importance of EU environmental rules to ensure prosperity, competitiveness and environmental security in the European Union.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The costs of non-implementation of EU environmental laws through air and water pollution, nature degradation and waste are estimated at 180 billion per year for the EU. That is approximately 1% of the EU Gross Domestic Product (GDP). Environmental implementation can reduce these costs while ensuring a level playing field for companies across the EU single market.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This Review identifies common trends at EU level, based on the individual country reports of the 27 EU Member States. The review includes a wide range of information about how well the Member States are protecting the quality of the air citizens breathe, the water they drink and the nature they enjoy. Furthermore, the review spells out concrete priority actions for improvement in each Member State.</p><p>State of implementation</p><p>The report shows a pressing need to improve the implementation of EU environmental law implementation.</p><p>- Circular economy: while some Member States are making good progress in using resources as effectively as possible when producing goods and services, many are still at risk of missing the 2025 recycling targets. For example, the report finds that several Member States should improve waste prevention and rehabilitate substandard landfills.</p><p>- Water: urgent action is needed to meet EU goals on freshwater quality and quantity and to mitigate the growing risk of water scarcity and drought. Member States need to make better use of available EU funds to collect and treat urban wastewater.</p><p>- Biodiversity: loss of biodiversity continues to prevail over recovery. This is mainly due to the change of land use for agricultural purposes and agricultural intensification. Member States need to improve the mainstreaming of nature protection across other policies and speed up the implementation of nature legislation.</p><p>- Air pollution: despite considerable progress, the level of air pollutants is still too high in many Member States. This poses serious concern to citizens' health. Air quality can be improved by switching to sustainable mobility powered by renewables, improving energy efficiency, introducing low-emission agricultural techniques, including for livestock, manure and fertiliser management.</p><p>- Climate: adaptation efforts in each Member State need to be intensified to cope with the increasing climate change impacts. While the EU has managed to decouple emissions of greenhouse gases from economic growth, several Member States have difficulties with the implementation of emission trading system for buildings, road transport and small industry.</p><p>Investments, human capital and good governance</p><p>The Commission has made several EU funds available for Member States to cover their investment needs, amounting to roughly 122 billion per year, across environmental objectives and priorities. Most of the Member States need to make further use of these funds to reinforce Member States' capacity to deliver effective implementation. In terms of environmental governance, there is still room for most Member States to further improve the public's access to courts to challenge decisions, acts or omissions, particularly in the areas of planning relating to water, nature and/or air quality.</p><p>Background</p><p>The Commission has consistently pursued the monitoring and implementation of environmental legislation. The first Environmental Implementation Review was adopted in February 2017, and it was followed by the 2019 and the 2022 editions. These reviews work alongside the Commission's Better Regulation policy which focuses on improving implementation of existing legislation and policies. Since the outset, many Member States have organised national EIR dialogues on the priority themes identified in their reports.

The entire nation is bracing for scorching hot weather this month, with forecasters saying temperatures look set to reach 44.5 degrees Celsius in some parts of the country. For example, the mercury level in the Thoen district of the northern Lampang province reached 42C on Monday and yesterday, the hottest temperatures for this year's summer so far. Meanwhile, the TMD reported the temperature of Muang district was not far behind at 41.8C.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What is more worrying is that the rise in temperature is likely to be a new normal, not a cyclical climate issue. This week, leading climate expert Assoc Prof Seree Supratid - director of the Center for Climate Change and Disasters at Rangsit University - publicly warned that Thailand could see temperatures hit 50C in the next 60 years.</p><p>Such an unprecedented quick rise of mercury level is a display of climate change impact. Some of the effects currently felt in Thailand are the warming land and ocean temperatures. Back in January, many countries already experienced record-breaking temperatures, and February 2024 was the warmest February on record globally. The seasonal hot and dry weather this summer, combined with the effects of El Ni\u00f1o, is going to result in lower-than-usual rainfall by 30%.</p><p>To deal with drought, local farming communities have been warned to brace for water shortage, and government agencies responsible for water resource management are scrambling to secure water by digging underground water and digging up ponds in local areas. Yet, the effects of extra hot and dry weather are far more than just water scarcity. The solution for climate change is more than just finding more water to combat the heat.</p><p>Indeed, the impacts of climate change differ between social groups and sectors.</p><p>For example, members of low-income communities in both rural and urban areas are likely to experience greater socioeconomic and health impacts of the unusually hot weather. Outdoor workers, such as construction labourers, street vendors and farmers, must endure the heat during the day and without respite at night as they live in poorly ventilated shelters. A portion of their daily income will also be spent on buying water at higher prices.</p><p>Economic sectors also face different impacts, and the solution is not water security. For example, having a high heat index will drive demand for electricity, which leads to the consumption of fossil fuels. Competing for energy in different sectors, such as industry and tourism, means poorer areas will be left without electricity and running water as pumps will stop working. The urban poor will be most affected as they are faced with higher costs of electricity and water.</p><p>Rising global land and sea surface temperatures will also drive stronger storms and changes in sensitive ecosystems, such as coral reefs. Coastal communities, particularly traditional fishers, are faced with multiple effects of the heat. Unseasonal and stronger storms and more frequent storm surges will prevent locals from fishing, reducing their income while increasing expenses for repairing damages to their houses. When they can fish, reduced productivity means fewer catches and lower income.</p><p>That said, the most vulnerable groups are often poor and marginalised, and the country needs climate change adaptation plans that are responsive to different groups.</p><p>Climate adaptation involves changes in both individual practices and institutional approaches. Local communities need to rethink their livelihood strategies. Likewise, governments need to consider climate risks and impacts and integrate adaptation plans into development plans. Business-as-usual approaches will not work in the face of changing climate. While action plans might vary from sector to sector and community to community, the heart of climate adaptation lies in the real participation of all stakeholders, especially local communities.</p><p>The question is whether Thailand has a national adaptation plan. Indeed, Thailand has a National Adaptation Plan that focuses on six sectors: water resources management, agriculture and food security, tourism, public health, natural resources management and human settlement, and security. Yet, little has been done. There has been no planning, financing, or implementation of the adaptations.</p><p>The establishment of a new department for climate change under the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment is a good sign of climate commitment and efforts. Under the direction of the new department, all provinces across the country are developing plans for climate change for the first time. Yet, most of the plans involve emission reduction. Provincial climate plans primarily focus on greenhouse gas emission reduction efforts to fulfil the country's net zero pledge.</p><p>Reducing emissions is highly important. The goal of climate mitigation is to prevent the planet from warming, ensuring better climate futures. But climate is already changing now, and the impacts are inevitable. So, what the country needs is 'climate adaptation' solutions to reduce harmful impacts on humans.</p><p>Provincial climate adaptation plans need to guide local administrations and government agencies in addressing critical vulnerability issues of local communities. Socially vulnerable groups, such as the poor, disabled, elderly, women and children, will need additional support in building the adaptive capacity to deal with climate impacts. But the impacts of climate change are not restricted to these groups. Climate adaptation must begin with identifying climate-vulnerable groups and assessing why they are vulnerable.</p><p>The engagement of local communities and vulnerable groups is critical to developing locally-led adaptation options. Adaptation plans are context-specific. One size does not fit all. Local adaptation approaches need to involve the collaboration of multiple stakeholders.

While tourists sip cocktails in overwater bungalows, some neighboring islands are literally running out of fresh water.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Tourism accounts for more than 20 percent of Maldives' GDP and is likely to grow, with President Mohamed Muizzu recently visiting the United Kingdom to promote a new Visit Maldives campaign. But the boom in tourism belies the looming existential crisis facing this South Asian nation.</p><p>Scattered across 1,192 islands and 26 atolls, the Maldives is the world's lowest lying country. The majority of its islands are less than half a meter above sea-level and scientists warn that at the current rate of climate change, large swathes of the Maldives archipelago could become uninhabitable by 2050.</p><p>An even more immediate threat is the lack of access to clean, safe, and affordable water. Climate change impacts, such as saline intrusion, sea-level rise, and drought, are already placing a considerable strain on natural freshwater sources, like groundwater and rainwater.</p><p>While resort islands and urban centers - like the capital, Mal\\xE9 - benefit from desalination, imported bottled water, and more sophisticated water infrastructure, many remote islands face shortages as rainwater tanks are drying up and groundwater is becoming increasingly saline and contaminated.</p><p>The Maldives' tourism secret to success could well be its 1978 one island, one resort policy, offering a unique sense of exclusivity and privacy to its 130 resort islands. However, that image sold to tourists is world's away from the lived reality of many Maldivians. It has meant that the honeymooner or social media influencer can remain blissfully unaware of the water crisis that may be playing out on a neighboring non-resort island.</p><p>A recent Human Rights Watch report focusing on two islands affected by water shortages, Kanditheem and Nolhivaranfaru, found that despite government efforts to address water shortages, many marginalized communities still face significant barriers to accessing clean, safe, and affordable water.</p><p>On both islands, the Maldivian government recently initiated water projects, supported by climate funding, to introduce Integrated Water Resource Management systems, combining desalination, rainwater harvesting, and groundwater recharge to diversify the islands' water sources.</p><p>While they look good on paper, these projects have suffered from systemic faults that have exacerbated inequalities in accessing water in the Maldives. Issues include inadequate consultations with affected communities, poor government monitoring, and elevated water bills for users. Islanders on Nolhivaranfaru said that many of the houses that were meant to be covered by the project lacked water connections for over two years after the project was initiated.</p><p>This caused islanders to continue relying on groundwater, even though they said it was foul-smelling and believed it to be contaminated. In Kanditheem, the water system, which should have been completed over two and half years ago, still lacks a functioning water testing lab despite it being a regulatory requirement.</p><p>Having historically relied on rainwater and groundwater, which were largely free, islanders are now forced to incur an additional financial burden - in a context where they're already very stretched.</p><p>Agricultural workers are particularly affected. A farmer on Kanditheem said that if the groundwater becomes too saline, they won't be able to afford to pay for desalinated water for irrigation and would lose their livelihoods.</p><p>The remote outer islands in the Maldives have higher poverty rates than the more populated islands like Mal\\xE9 and Addu. In addition, communities living on these islands are often not adequately consulted about key decision-making processes, including surrounding development projects on their own islands.</p><p>The result is that infrastructure projects like these often suffer from chronic shortcomings and risk widening existing inequities within the country, instead of narrowing them.</p><p>The climate crisis is not a distant reality to island communities in the Maldives - it's an everyday struggle, which requires the support of the international community.

Including, for example, whether an apartment block has an elevator or air conditioning. Combined with demographic stats, it helps them to see where residents are most vulnerable during extreme heat.</p><p>Given Bilbao's vulnerability to river flooding, they have also mapped the city's sewage system and road network, including the number of vehicles and access to alternative routes if a flood strikes.</p><p>And with digital twins - virtual replicas of cities - they can test the efficacy of nature-based solutions, even down to which tree species will have the fastest growth rate under climate change.</p><p>Climate proofing, explains Efren Feliu Torres, head of the climate change adaptation programme, is a crucial concept within their modelling. It means taking into account the fact that the climate is dynamic and will alter the outcome of adaptation measures.</p><p>The intention is improving decision-making. That is the ultimate objective, he says.

The tallest is the Iberdrola Tower, the headquarters of the Spanish energy company, which dominates the skyline.</p><p>BAT's 200 members include corporate powerhouses like Iberdrola and Triodos Bank, the Basque region's main institutions, and dozens of start-ups. Global consulting firm PwC operates as a 'matchmaker' here, and says it has made 600 matches between entities big and small.</p><p>One such start-up is Woza Labs, which is developing deep-tech foundations to solve climate and sustainability challenges. The Bilbao-headquartered company has partnered with Iberdrola to smarten its grid management, identifying where power lines are most at risk in the short term, and where new ones should be built to maximise their resilience.</p><p>It does this by integrating disparate datasets - including geospatial intelligence and data from the energy company about its facilities and past incidents - into one predictive platform.</p><p>What we're seeing today is that companies, governments, public institutions, they are not ready for measuring climate [...] their systems are not ready to work in a more volatile environment, says CEO and co-founder Sebasti\\xE1n Priolo. With climate change causing fiercer storms, heatwaves and wildfires, that volatility needs to be input in the systems.</p><p>One of the things that wooed Woza's founders to Bilbao from London is what Priolo calls the asymmetry between digitalisation and industry. With a past rooted in heavy industry and an ongoing industrial presence, it's a seller's market for companies offering digital services.</p><p>The Bizkaian government has created a supportive environment for start-ups, he adds.</p><p>Exercising its tax autonomy, the Provincial Council of Bizkaia has incentives to encourage innovation and decarbonisation. The corporate tax deduction for investments in clean technologies has recently been increased to 35 per cent, for example.</p><p>We want to be there among the main European countries concerning innovation, Ainara Basurko Urkiri, deputy of economic promotion in the Bizkaia Government, tells Euronews Green. We need public and private partnerships, she emphasises. If we go hand-in-hand together, we will move forward faster.</p><p>Chasing greener horizons at Bilbao Port</p><p>Bilbao's changing narrative is nowhere better illustrated than at its port, Spain's fourth busiest.</p><p>This, says Andima Ormaetxe, director of operations, commercial, logistics and strategy, is the port of the Atlantic. It is a gateway for the rest of Europe and America, and its history is also that of Bilbao, which was granted city status and control of maritime traffic entering its estuary in 1300.</p><p>Iron ore had long been mined from the surrounding hills, furnishing the armouries of Spanish kings. But extraction became big business in the nineteenth century, spearheaded by British industrialists.</p><p>The meandering Nervi\\xF3n River was straightened en route to the Old Town docks (15 km upstream), which were eventually abandoned altogether as the superpuerto on the bay grew. The Guggenheim Museum was built on a derelict dock district.</p><p>Now, hemmed in by those hills, there is no more room for Bilbao Port to expand. So our generation is the generation in which we have to make the port more effective and efficient with the space that we've got, says Ormaetxe.</p><p>It's clear that decarbonisation is going to be a big opportunity, he adds. The port has invested millions in electrifying its docks; a bank of onshore wind turbines, wave farms and solar panels are part of its plan to be self-sufficient and create an Onshore Power Supply (OPS).</p><p>In the chicken and egg game of working with shipping companies - which say they cannot transition without the infrastructure - Bilbao Port is aiming to make green electricity the cheap option, and raise ambitions around Europe.</p><p>It is also collaborating with the industrial sites at its heels, affording them the space to develop green hydrogen, which is a major part of the region's plans.

These challenges not only jeopardize lives and ecosystems but also inflict substantial economic losses, as urban centers serve as the foundation of the nation's economy.</p><p>Globally, cities generate 80% of GDP while hosting over 56% of the population. Repeated extreme weather events can lead to economic disaster.</p><p>Thailand is no exception.</p><p>Heatwaves</p><p>Over half of Thailand's population now lives in cities, and this number is growing along with the risks of heatwaves, flooding, and coastal erosion.</p><p>In Bangkok, urban heat islands have caused city temperatures to rise by 5.26C over the past 25 years, according to a study by the Asian Institute of Technology and Khon Kaen University in 2020.</p><p>Chiang Mai, known for its cool climate, now experiences temperatures over 36C in many areas. Another study from Burapha University in 2019 also mentioned that rapid urbanisation and shrinking green spaces have made the eastern region 2.56C hotter over the last decade.</p><p>As a result, deaths from heat waves have surged. Vulnerable groups, such as outdoor workers, the elderly, and slum dwellers, are hit the hardest, exacerbating Thailand's already distressing inequality.</p><p>Flooding</p><p>Flooding is a major issue in Bangkok, with 737 flood hotspots, according to the data from the Bangkok Metropolitan Administration, worsened by more rainstorms. Floods disrupt daily life, cause traffic gridlock, and damage infrastructure, causing significant economic loss.</p><p>During rush hours, heavy rain can cause up to 2,000 hours of travel delays daily alone. This number might seem to be small, but the calculation is based on the traffic situation at only 16 major intersections in Bangkok.</p><p>As Bangkok sinks, rising seas will worsen the problem, while flash floods become more common. Chiang Mai, the largest city in the North, suffered unprecedented flooding this year, highlighting the need for better preparedness and action.</p><p>Despite the devastation year after year, current flood prevention measures like barriers and drainage systems are short-term fixes. Sustainable solutions require comprehensive river basin management, better water-retention areas, and long-term city planning, including active community involvement.</p><p>Coastal erosion</p><p>Rising sea levels and stronger storms have eroded 26% of Thailand's 3,151-kilometre coastline. Over the past 30 years, the country has lost around 100,000 rai of coastal land, with Bangkok's Bang Khun Thian losing 2,735 rai.</p><p>This erosion threatens cities, communities, ecosystems, and the economy, displacing villages and destroying vital ecosystems like mangroves. Urgent action is needed to protect the coastline.</p><p>Piecemeal solutions</p><p>Current efforts to address heatwaves, flooding, and coastal erosion are sadly fragmented and inadequate.</p><p>As cities grow hotter, the government has done little \u2014 if anything \u2014 to expand green spaces, promote eco-friendly buildings, or invest in long-term solutions.</p><p>Some measures, like taxing water retention areas as unproductive lands, have made things worse by reducing flood absorption areas. Concrete sea walls, built without comprehensive environmental studies or local input, have also worsened coastal erosion nearby, showing the flaws of relying solely on hard engineering solutions from a top-down policy.</p><p>Long-term flood prevention is also lacking. Flood walls and drainage upgrades, for example, address the symptoms, not the root causes.</p><p>Sustainable approaches require ecological planning, sufficient water retention, inclusive city planning and community involvement. Additionally, environmental and social assessments need to be fair, transparent, and participatory, which they are not at present.</p><p>Global examples</p><p>Piecemeal solutions do not work. The impacts of climate change are not just environmental \u2014 they are also economic and social crises. What Thailand needs is a cohesive, long-term strategy to make cities climate resilient, and there is much to learn from other countries.</p><p>After deadly heatwaves in 2022 that claimed 425 lives in Phoenix, US, mainly among the homeless and the elderly \u2014 the city set up a data system to track vulnerable groups and give them easy access to shelters and water stations. It has saved lives and improved emergency responses.</p><p>Meanwhile, London uses green, environmentally friendly buildings through collaboration between local government, the private sector, building owners, and climate experts to tackle rising temperatures.</p><p>Copenhagen, Denmark, after dealing with repeated heavy rain and flooding, has created dual-purpose parks that act as floodwater reservoirs during storms. The city has also built giant underground tunnels to separate rainwater from sewage, helping improve climate resilience and urban liveability.</p><p>In China, \"sponge cities\" are being developed to fight severe flooding. These cities use parks to absorb rainwater, temporary water-retention areas, and roads designed to soak up water and slow runoff.</p><p>After the 1953 North Sea flood that killed 1,800 people and flooded 9% of the Netherlands, the government used modern sea wall technology to prevent future floods. They also listened to local fishermen's input to adjust the project and improve its effectiveness.</p><p>Closer to home, Singapore is fighting city heat with better urban planning. This includes improving cooling systems, reducing car use, building eco-friendly structures, and adding more green, open spaces across the city.</p><p>In Indonesia, Jakarta's flooding problem is being tackled by planting mangroves, clearing garbage to improve water flow, and relocating people from flood-prone areas with community input. These areas are being turned into water-retention zones. Indonesia is also moving its capital from Jakarta to the island of Borneo.</p><p>International examples offer practical and effective strategies for making cities resilient to climate risks \u2014 valuable lessons for Thailand.</p><p>To fight heatwaves, cities can add more green spaces, reduce car use, and improve air conditioning systems. Green buildings, like those with rooftop gardens, can also help cool urban areas.</p><p>For flooding, adding green spaces, improving drainage, and building \"sponge cities\" that soak up water can reduce damage from heavy rains.</p><p>To protect coastlines, planting mangroves, restoring natural ecosystems, using innovative engineering, and relocating buildings from high-risk areas are essential steps.</p><p>These solutions combine nature, smart engineering, and community support to address climate challenges effectively. They can be grouped into four colour-coded strategies. Grey focuses on traditional engineering, green on eco-friendly, natural solutions, blue on water absorption, and white on relocation.</p><p>Importantly, all these strategies prioritise local knowledge and input, using a participatory process to help residents adapt their habits and behaviours.</p><p>The solution is simple: reduce car use and improve air conditioning to cut emissions, make buildings eco-friendly, and expand green spaces, water-retention areas, and mangroves. Focus on new ideas and involve local communities. If needed, relocate people from high-risk areas.</p><p>Adapting cities to climate change begins with understanding the risks, identifying vulnerable groups and dangerous areas, and checking if the city is ready to respond. This means reviewing city infrastructure, working together with all stakeholders, and creating long-term plans for sustainable growth.</p><p>Cities need strong plans, careful assessments, and smart investments in solutions that tackle multiple climate risks. For Thailand, this means adding more green spaces, turning unused urban land into parks or wetlands with tax incentives, updating old buildings to be eco-friendly, and relocating risky developments with fair compensation and community input.</p><p>These actions can help our cities prepare for climate change.
