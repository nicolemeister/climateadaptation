In response, the World Bank is helping client countries scale nature-based solutions (NBS), innovative and cost-effective measures that draw on natural systems to tackle these inter-related challenges. Since 2012, the World Bank has financed approximately 250 projects that have used NBS or combined natural and engineered approaches to reduce disaster risks (such as flooding and heat), restore ecosystems, improve biodiversity, and boost local economies. In 2020, the World Bank launched the Global Program on NBS for Climate Resilience (GPNBS), systematizing support for NBS through the creation and sharing of knowledge, deploying NBS in relevant World Bank projects, and partnering with other organizations to enhance impact. The World Bank will continue to strengthen its support for NBS operations and expand the knowledge base for successful NBS implementation to drive resilient, inclusive development with long-term economic and environmental benefits.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">- Between 2012 and 2024, the World Bank financed about 250 investment projects that harness nature to build climate resilience. This includes investment in urban resilience, coastal resilience, and landscape restoration. Among these projects, 66 have benefited 9.5 million people and restored 1.1 million hectares of ecosystems with climate resilience benefits.</p><p>- Active projects are expected to benefit 19.4 million people and restore 3.5 million hectares of nature and green space.</p><p>- NBS help strengthen climate resilience. The construction of a retention basin in 2020 reduced flood risks and minimized economic disruptions for more than 3 million people in Argentina. The creation of a 17-hectare urban park, also in 2020, protected 50,000 people in Mozambique from flooding.</p><p>- NBS deliver critical biodiversity benefits. The restoration of a Sri Lankan wetland in 2022 led to a country-wide effort to rehabilitate and protect these ecosystems, and ensured protection of endangered species. The rehabilitation of mangroves in Indonesia supports coastal ecosystem and boosts fishing incomes.</p><p>- NBS support jobs and livelihoods, such as by providing temporary employment that has benefited 745,000 households in Tanzania during lean seasons between 2017 and 2025.</p><p>- The development of new analytical tools such as the NBS Opportunity Scan has been critical to the expanded use of NBS, helping identify optimal investments in 100 cities and 5,000 kilometers of coastline, informing at least $1.8 billion in development financing for NBS activities to date.</p><p>\"Mangroves provide endless benefits for communities. They protect communities from the impact of climate change and generate income through ecotourism and its products, such as mangrove crabs, syrup and crackers. The carbon stored in mangroves can also be traded, and we ensure these benefits reach coastal communities to generate incentives for continued mangrove management.</p><p>Nani Hendiarti</p><p>Deputy Minister for Environment Coordination and Forestry,</p><p>Coordinating Ministry for Maritime Affairs and Investment (CMMAI) of Indonesia.</p><p>Challenge</p><p>Countries face increasing environmental challenges associated with compounding risks: natural disasters push over 26 million people into poverty each year, biodiversity loss is accelerating, and unplanned urbanization increases exposure to hazards. NBS use natural systems like forests and wetlands to enhance resilience, prevent erosion, stabilize slopes, protect roads from flooding, and support water management. When combined with traditional infrastructure, NBS can cut costs, extend asset lifespans, and boost economic, social, and environmental benefits. However, scaling NBS remains difficult, especially in low-income areas. Significant technical and financial support is needed to unlock their full potential and meet resilience and biodiversity goals.</p><p>Approach</p><p>The World Bank helps countries adopt NBS by sharing knowledge, providing technical assistance, mobilizing finance, and improving policies to support scalable, replicable results. While the World Bank Group has worked to advance the use of NBS for well over a decade, in 2020 it activated a new platform to advance NBS: the Global Program on NBS for Climate Resilience (GPNBS). Led by the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR), the GPNBS enables the World Bank to take a cross-sectoral approach to address technical challenges and promote the integration of NBS into development operations globally. The approach focuses on three key areas:</p><p>Awareness and knowledge: The World Bank is driving the knowledge agenda on NBS by developing essential knowledge products and supporting the integration of NBS priorities in global agreements, such as COP22, and country development strategies. Guidance notes like the Catalogue of NBS for Urban Resilience, Assessing the Benefits and Costs of NBS, and Integrating Gender and Social Inclusion in NBS have helped shape NBS investments across sectors and institutions. In partnership with the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the World Bank also advanced knowledge on private sector opportunities and applied it in operational dialogue.</p><p>Embedding NBS in our work with countries: Tools like the NBS Opportunity Scan have identified optimal NBS investments in over 100 cities and 5,000 kilometers of coastline, informing at least $1.8 billion in development financing for NBS. For instance, the Scan's recommended investments were integrated into the $200 million Secondary Cities Urban Mobility and Development Project in Burkina Faso, which will create and protect urban green spaces to reduce temperatures and limit flooding, benefiting 819,000 people.</p><p>Strategic partnerships: The World Bank works with technical partners, including United Nations (UN) agencies, the World Resources Institute, The Nature Conservancy, and the US Army Corps of Engineers, to develop joint knowledge and guidance products. It also works with development partners such as the government of the Netherlands and World Bank-administered trust funds to co-finance projects and shape the global narrative. Knowledge products like Scaling up Finance for Nature (presented at COP15) and the Climate and Development Brief: NBS for Climate Resilience and Adaptation (presented at COP 27) have helped elevate NBS in global climate discussions.</p><p>Results: 2012 - 2024</p><p>Between 2012 and 2024, the World Bank financed about 250 investment projects that harness nature to build climate resilience. This includes investment in urban resilience, coastal resilience, and landscape restoration. Of these 250 projects, 66 closed projects have benefited 9.5 million people and restored 1.1 million hectares of ecosystems with climate resilience benefits. Active projects are expected to benefit 19.4 million people and restore 3.5 million hectares of nature and green space.</p><p>NBS have been instrumental in strengthening climate resilience. In Mozambique, the Cities and Climate Change project created a 17-hectare urban park along the Chiveve river in Beira, while also restoring the river's retention function by rehabilitating degraded mangroves and native flora. These activities protected 50,000 people from flooding and expanded livelihood and recreational opportunities. Argentina integrated its first large-scale NBS in Buenos Aires through the construction of a retention basin in the Parque Indoamericano, reducing flood risks for more than 3 million people and minimizing economic disruptions. In Burkina Faso, the NBS Opportunity Scan helped identify green spaces for heat reduction and water absorption, with the aim of improving living conditions for 819,000 people. The World Bank's regional NBS approach in Central Asia and the Caucuses is supporting governments to restore landscapes, mitigate mudflows, and manage water resources in fragile, arid and mountainous areas, and is expected to bring 190,000 hectares under sustainable land management in the Kyrgyz Republic and Tajikistan alone.</p><p>NBS deliver important biodiversity benefits. In Indonesia, an integrated spatial and economic assessment informed the design of the Mangroves for Coastal Resilience Project, which aims to rehabilitate 45,000 hectares of mangrove and support sustainable livelihoods for almost 10,000 people. In Colombo, Sri Lanka, the restoration and protection of a 20 square kilometer urban wetland protected the ecosystem's 280 wildlife species and enhanced its role as a carbon sponge (the wetlands absorb up to 90 percent of the city's greenhouse gas emission). The success of the project led the government of Sri Lanka to approve nearly 50 additional development plans to conserve wetlands across the country.</p><p>These NBS related investments have created jobs and enhanced livelihoods. In Tanzania, more than 745,000 households were provided temporary employment for public works including tree planting, boosting incomes during lean seasons. In Brazil, the restoration of a major park in Fortaleza revitalized the local economy by creating a vibrant hub for food vendors and community gatherings, benefiting 70,000 people. More than 900 jobs were created in Sierra Leone by an initiative to grow, plant, and nurture close to a million trees that help address flooding, landslides, and urban heat.</p><p>The World Bank has also supported private sector engagement in NBS by helping countries like Costa Rica and Brazil develop Payments for Environmental Services (PES) programs and tapping carbon finance to engage private sector in ecosystem restoration.</p><p>Globally, World Bank-supported tools such as the NBS Opportunity Scan (NBSOS), and knowledge products have shaped policies and investments around the globe. The NBSOS has been delivered for 100 cities and across 5,000 kilometers of coastline to directly inform investment in NBS. Outcomes like the examples described above demonstrate how countries, with World Bank support, are turning nature into a powerful asset-protecting lives, supporting livelihoods, and delivering lasting development results.</p><p>Collaborating across the World Bank Group</p><p>The World Bank is working with IFC in Colombia, Panama, and Brazil to increase the uptake of NBS and help identify potential investments. The World Bank and IFC also jointly published a report Nature-Based Solutions in Cities: Solutions and Examples for Municipalities and the Private Sector, which has already supported dialogue with private sector and governments on NBS investments, including in Colombia, the Philippines, and South Africa.</p><p>IFC works with clients in water, energy, mining, and cities to promote NBS for resilience, while MIGA identifies NBS opportunities to enhance asset resilience and mobilize public sector funding through its guarantee products. IFC's draft Biodiversity Finance Guide also aligns NBS investments with Green Bond and Green Loan Principles.</p><p>World Bank Group Contribution</p><p>World Bank financing for NBS and green-gray activities is estimated at $12 billion from 2012 to 2024, including $7.5 billion from IDA, $3.7 billion from IBRD, and $800 million from Trust Funds.</p><p>Multi-donor trust funds from different sectors, including disaster resilience (GFDRR), environmental management (the Program for the Blue Economy, PROBLUE; the Global Partnership for Sustainable and Resilient Landscapes, PROGREEN; and the City Climate Finance Gap Fund), and water (the Global Water Security and Sanitation Partnership, GWSP), have also financed NBS across the globe, as well as contributing to \\xACthe creation of critical knowledge products. With close to $4 million, GFDRR is the initiator and main contributor to the GPNBS. But GPNBS is not the only initiative that helps drive investment in NBS. The NBS Invest Project, which is led by the World Bank's environment sector and collaborates closely with GPNBS, received $10 million in GEF financing to increase the utilization of NBS in climate mitigation projects in the world's least Developed Countries. And the Urban Nature Program, led by the World Bank's Global Platform for Sustainable Cities with support from the GEF, specifically helps cities integrate nature into urban planning.</p><p>Partnerships</p><p>The World Bank has cultivated partnerships on NBS with more than 30 external organizations. This includes the UN Environment Program-led Platform on Ecosystems for Disaster Risk Reduction and Adaptation (PEDRR), the International Union for the Conservation of Nature, and the G20 Working Group on NBS.</p><p>These relationships have led to new knowledge products, such as the recently-published Growing Resilience: Unlocking the Potential of NBS for Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa with the World Resource Institute and African Development Bank. Another is the International Guidelines on Natural and Nature-Based Features, developed under the International NBS Working Group that the World Bank participates in.</p><p>These strategic alliances enable the World Bank to leverage a shared pool of knowledge to identify gaps and best practices for the successful implementation of NBS, helping to support client countries to tackle the environmental impact of climate change and manage future risks. Moreover, these partnerships help amplify the World Bank's messaging around the power of harnessing nature for climate resilience and sustainable economic growth.</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>In the immediate term, the World Bank will continue to invest in NBS to enhance climate resilience in low- and middle-income countries by providing operational support, assisting with investment identification, and supporting successful implementation of NBS.</p><p>The World Bank will explore opportunities to further harness NBS to create jobs and attract private sector investment. Several successful approaches of job creation through NBS have been demonstrated globally, but further scaling up is needed by developing replicable models and supporting their operationalization.</p><p>To address existing financial and technical gaps in several client countries, the World Bank will strengthen its support for NBS projects, develop new guidance notes to build clients' technical understanding, and expand its training program for clients and staff.</p><p>To further scale up financing, the World Bank also works with the public and private sectors to expand innovative tools like green bonds, dedicated national funds and risk sharing mechanisms. This builds upon recent successful innovative partnerships spearheaded by the World Bank, IFC and MIGA, such as South Africa's 'Rhino Bond' and Colombia's biodiversity bond.</p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["SynopsisCountries around the globe are facing increasing risks from climate change, natural disasters, and biodiversity loss.

While the primary focus is on reducing flood risks, these solutions also help cool urban areas and create greener spaces for recreation and community gatherings.</p><p>The case of N'Djamena is not unique. Across Sub-Saharan Africa, communities are facing escalating environmental pressures while striving for economic growth. The region's population is expected to nearly double by 2050, increasing exposure to natural hazards and placing additional pressure on governments to provide basic services while managing land and water resources more effectively. With Africa facing an annual infrastructure financing gap of more than $100 billion, urgent investment and action are needed to secure a sustainable future.</p><p>A new report, Growing Resilience: Unlocking the Potential of Nature-Based Solutions for Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa, takes a deep dive into how nature-based solutions can help address these challenges. Published jointly by the World Resources Institute and the World Bank, in collaboration with the African Development Bank, the report evaluates nearly 300 nature-based solutions projects implemented over the past decade using the data, analytical expertise, and experiences of these organizations.

However, this remains only a fraction of what is needed to protect the region and its people.</p><p>But funding alone isn't enough. Governments, investors, and project developers also need to overcome policy, institutional, technical, social, and financial barriers to make nature-based solutions work. In Freetown, a tree-planting project required training local teams to ensure its success. In Ethiopia, raising awareness and demonstrating the benefits of wetland and floodplain restoration helped secure government support. In Ghana, where land rights can complicate projects, clear ownership and rights agreements were essential in preventing conflicts. These examples show that scaling up nature-based solutions takes more than investment; it requires smart planning, collaboration, and local knowledge.</p><p>To help bridge these gaps, the report outlines six key recommendations for increasing the use of nature-based solutions across the region:</p><p>- Integrate nature-based solutions into relevant national policies and planning. For example, the government of Rwanda's Green Growth and Climate Resilience Strategy allocates a share of the national government's budget for nature-based solutions initiatives.</p><p>- Build technical capacity to create investment-ready projects. The World Bank's Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) provides financial and technical support to help governments and organizations develop expertise in nature-based solutions project design. Through partnerships and collaboration in the region, the specific technical capacity for nature-based solutions can be further strengthened.</p><p>- Incorporate equity and community needs to ensure nature-based solutions projects deliver benefits beyond building climate resilience. This includes using existent guidance on gender and social considerations for nature-based solutions projects to make projects more inclusive and impactful.</p><p>- Diversify funders and funding sources to ensure long-term project sustainability. While grants play a key role, expanding financing options such as blended finance and private sector investment, can provide more stable, long-term support. Sustainable funding models should also account for operations and maintenance.</p><p>- Tailor strategies to each country's unique challenges, considering natural hazards, governance structures, and available resources. In fragile or conflict-affected areas, modular and small-scale nature-based solutions interventions with strong community engagement may have a higher chance of success than large-scale projects.</p><p>- Enhancing monitoring and evaluation to measure both direct and indirect benefits of nature-based solutions projects. Dedicated resources should be allocated to track how nature-based solutions interventions reduce risks such as flooding and land degradation, while also capturing broader impacts on biodiversity, livelihoods, and economic development. Using consistent measures and tracking results over time will be key to showing the impact of these solutions.</p><p>NBS offer a sustainable way forward for Sub-Saharan Africa, but greater investment and commitment are needed.

NBS can also complement traditional engineering in hybrid solutions to retrofit or enhance existing infrastructure. The advantages of NBS include hazard mitigation, biodiversity benefits, improved water quality, carbon sequestration, and their dual-use as recreational spaces. These benefits can reduce capital investments, lower maintenance costs, and yield multifaceted positive outcomes.</p><p>The guidance note identifies four key families of NBS opportunities for port resilience:</p><p>- Working with Coastal Systems: Strategies that integrate natural coastal processes, addressing challenges like sedimentation within ports and optimizing port location and design.</p><p>- Wave and Coastal Dynamics Attenuation: Solutions using living shorelines, reefs, vegetation, and landscape features to reduce wave impacts, manage the movement of sediments, and mitigate storm impacts.</p><p>- Beneficial Reuse of Dredged Sediment: Approaches that reduce capital and maintenance dredging costs by reusing sediments or coordinating dredging activities with NBS projects.</p><p>- Enhancement of Grey Structures: Retrofits such as micro-habitat creation and other solutions can increase the environmental value of traditional port infrastructure.</p><p>To demonstrate practical applications of these opportunities, the guidance note includes key case studies. For example, in Nigeria, the Lekki sandbar breakwater facilitates sediment transport and wave dynamics for the port, decreasing construction time, construction costs, and maintenance needs. In Indonesia, Jakarta's Batavia port, which was long hampered by outdated facilities, expanded its fishing port using local materials and mangroves to reinforce the breakwater-an approach well suited to areas facing subsidence and sea-level rise.</p><p>The guide also includes insights for navigating various phases of a NBS project cycle, providing information on evaluating technical and economic feasibility, securing financing, and developing detailed designs and implementation plans. Key phases for screening NBS opportunities include:</p><p>1. Identifying NBS opportunities within the spatial scope of the port and its hinterland to address governance, development challenges, and the license to operate.</p><p>2. Leveraging examples and case studies from similar settings.</p><p>3. Conceptualizing projects and crafting a compelling value proposition.</p><p>4. Exploring key enablers for successful implementation and maximizing value.</p><p>5. Assessing the full range of NBS benefits for ports and stakeholders.</p><p>6. Evaluating financing options and project bankability.</p><p>While the ports sector has long worked with coastal landscapes and ecosystems, recent innovations such as ecological breakwaters and strategic sediment management offer novel approaches that build on traditional practices through emerging nature-based engineering and green financing mechanisms. A growing number of examples are showing what is possible -from reusing sediment to build wetlands and improve navigation, to using concrete mixtures that support habitat creation, to rethinking breakwater design in Africa and Asia.

Growing Resilience: Unlocking the Potential of Nature-Based Solutions for Climate Resilience in Sub-Saharan Africa analyzes nearly 300 projects over the past decade to identify what works, key barriers, and strategies to scale up nature-based solutions (NBS) to promote green, resilient development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report shows a steady increase in the adoption of NBS projects, with the number of new projects initiated growing by an average of 15% annually between 2012 and 2021. These projects - which include protecting and restoring forests, wetlands, floodplains and coral reefs, often in combination with traditional gray infrastructure - are strengthening climate resilience while actively delivering co-benefits like job creation, biodiversity enhancement and social equity.</p><p>While interest in NBS is growing, the report finds that more investment is needed. Between 2012 and 2021, funding for NBS projects in Sub-Saharan Africa increased by 23% annually and raised more than $12 billion. While this is a positive step, the figure pales in comparison to Africa's $100 billion annual infrastructure financing gap.</p><p>Nature loss and climate risks are inherently linked, especially here in Africa, says Qimiao Fan, World Bank's Country Director for Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia and Uganda. We need to ensure that projects and policies comprehensively address the challenges and offer inclusive and effective solutions for the most vulnerable groups.</p><p>As climate risks like extreme heat, flooding and water scarcity intensify, Sub-Saharan Africa stands at the frontlines of the global climate crisis, with Kenya's floods and unprecedented heatwaves across the region a stark warning.</p><p>The report highlights several recommendations to increase adoption of NBS in the region. These include integrating nature into policies and plans, building technical capacity to develop project pipelines, and diversifying finance.</p><p>While NBS projects are growing, a critical gap remains: relatively few projects were implemented in cities, despite their potential to address urban challenges (though the World Bank and AfDB have recently been supporting more urban projects). Seventy percent of African cities face severe climate risks - including flooding, extreme heat and mudslides - while many already struggle with inadequate infrastructure. Additional investment in traditional solutions like dams and engineered drainage is needed, but integrating natural infrastructure, such as restoring and protecting forests in watersheds, can bolster resilience and reduce long-term costs.</p><p>Recognizing this, and to complement NBS investment preparation efforts of the World Bank and AfDB, WRI is launching the Green-Gray Infrastructure Accelerator, an initiative to support 11 cities across sub-Saharan Africa to integrate NBS with traditional gray infrastructure. The initiative will provide technical, policy and finance support, helping them lay the groundwork for their initial cohort of projects, while connecting others to financiers to scale existing efforts.</p><p>We often think of infrastructure in terms of roads, bridges and buildings - just concrete and steel structures, said Ani Dasgupta, President &amp; CEO, World Resources Institute. But nature - forests, trees, wetlands, coral reefs - is just as vital. It supplies clean water, protects communities from disasters, and strengthens resilience. Across Africa, cities and communities are proving that green and gray infrastructure can work together to maximize benefits for people, nature and climate - and the world should take note.</p><p>Note: This report was jointly prepared by the Cities4Forests initiative at World Resources Institute and the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) at the World Bank, with key contributions from the African Development Bank (AfDB), support from the Green Growth Knowledge Partnership (GGKP), and funding contributions from the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), the MAVA Foundation, GFDRR, the German Agency for International Cooperation (GIZ), the German Federal Ministry for Economic Cooperation and Development (BMZ), and the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).</p><p>About World Resources Institute</p><p>WRI is a trusted partner for change.

In fact, our pensions are the most powerful weapon we have to help protect the planet.</p><p>How can greening pensions help cut our carbon footprint?</p><p>Although we might like to think that our pension contributions are simply locked away for us to use once we retire, the reality is that this money is being invested. Despite many companies now choosing to divest and individuals being more aware of sustainable options, it's likely that some of that money is financing the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>More than half of adults in the UK now want their pensions to help tackle climate change, according to a study from earlier this year by Royal London.

Recognizing the absence of a dedicated coastal data repository, CMIS was developed to systematically collect and analyze key coastal parameters. The primary objective of CMIS is to support effective coastal protection planning, erosion mitigation, and climate adaptation by providing reliable, site-specific data.</p><p>- National Centre for Coastal Research (NCCR), an attached office of the Ministry of Earth Sciences, is mapping the shoreline changes along the Indian coast to enhance the country's preparedness to face coastal hazards like storm surges, tsunami, etc. and to guide towards sustainable coastal development. NCCR has prepared and published a status report on National Assessment of Shoreline changes along Indian Coasts in March 2022.This report provides the status of coastline of the Indian mainland by classifying them into Erosion, Accreting and Stable coasts.</p><p>The Government is integrating community participation and spatial planning as part of its approach to building effective and inclusive coastal resilience. This is reflected in the Integrated Coastal Risk Mitigation and Resilience Programme (ICRMRP), developed by the National Disaster Management Authority (NDMA).</p><p>The ICRMRP adopts a seven-component framework that includes not only technical and infrastructural measures such as risk assessment, early warning systems, and ecosystem resilience, but also community capacity building and sustainable development planning.

This is clearly reflected in the World Economic Forum's 2025 ranking of the top global economic risks over the next decade, which lists Extreme Weather Events first, followed by Biodiversity Loss and Ecosystem Collapse, Critical Changes to Earth Systems, and Shortages of Natural Resources. Similar work by central banks, commercial banks, and other finance institutions likewise shows significant climate- and nature-related risks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With this linkage becoming ever more evident, our response needs to similarly connect these key development issues. UNDP has made significant efforts to develop and deliver a nexus offer on the climate and nature agenda, focusing on the delivery of integrated national solutions that simultaneously achieve globally agreed goals on climate, biodiversity, and land degradation. This builds on UNDP's flagship initiatives-the Climate Promise and the Nature Pledge-which work across 150 developing countries to support concrete solutions through a $5 billion portfolio of nature and climate initiatives.</p><p>At the heart of this nexus is the need to align and accelerate finance to drive integrated action responding to the objectives of FfD4 outcome under the Sevilla Platform for Action, the Paris Agreement in the lead-up to COP-30 in Belem, as well as the Convention on Biological Diversity. There is a clear economic rationale for integrating climate, biodiversity, and development finance strategies within a joint framework:</p><p>$500 billion per year is the combined nature and climate finance target under the Paris Agreement and the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. In terms of reducing environmentally harmful subsidies.</p><p>55% of global GDP (US$58 trillion) is moderately or highly dependent on nature.</p><p>The new report by UNDP and OECD titled Investing in Climate for Growth and Development - The Case for Enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) provides evidence that accelerating climate action makes economic sense: enhanced NDCs could sustain 60% global GDP growth by 2040 compared to 2022 levels.</p><p>When bold nature-climate actions align with SDG-driven policies, 175 million people can be lifted from extreme poverty by 2050-improving the lives of one in three households currently in extreme poverty. Investing in biodiversity is one of the most cost-effective ways to advance sustainable economic development while closing the financing gap on both nature and climate.</p><p>The starting point for advancing this integration is a policy framework that recognizes the linkages. Increasingly, policy coherence across climate and biodiversity linked to the global conventions is gaining traction, in countries supported by UNDP:</p><p>67 countries are working on NBSAPs that reference climate targets from NDCs</p><p>43 countries are developing NDC 3.0 with prominent links to nature and NBSAPs.</p><p>40 countries are developing Biodiversity Finance Plans with climate aspects.</p><p>Furthermore, translating these policies forward into concrete action requires integrated financial planning. UNDP supports over 85 countries with Integrated National Financing Frameworks (INFFs)-positioned as a key mechanism for aligning finance with NDCs, NBSAPs, and SDGs to deliver them simultaneously. Across 20 countries, these processes have already explicitly incorporated NDCs, while influencing public finance reform, private capital mobilization, and SDG and/or climate budgeting across all regions with a green lens. For instance:</p><p>Egypt's INFF aligns its updated NDCs and Vision 2030 by prioritizing green public investment, climate-budget tagging, and private sector mobilization across key sectors such as energy, transport, and agriculture. The strategy includes developing a climate fiscal risk register by 2025 and applying a climate-tagging system to public budgets.</p><p>The Maldives is implementing gender-responsive climate financing reforms, phasing out fossil fuel subsidies, boosting energy transition investments, and enhancing sustainability reporting rules for the private sector.</p><p>Moreover, practical financing innovations for biodiversity which yield climate benefits are evident in</p><p>In Thailand (Koh Tao), a visitor fee to a national park of under $1 has generated over $300,000 to reinvest in the restoration of coral reefs and improvements in waste management, which supports climate resilience through nature conservation;</p><p>In Botswana revised protected area fees increased annual revenue by $7 million which went back to local communities to help build resilience and livelihoods; and</p><p>Ecuador's green microfinance has mobilised $804 million for small- medium entrepreneurs, particularly women, youth, and rural SMEs, working on the intersection of nature and climate change, such as renewable energy solutions.</p><p>To scale this momentum, UNDP has launched the Sevilla Platform for Action on Integrated Finance for Development, Climate and Nature.

Nature protection is seen as a cost, but we need to start thinking about nature protection as an investment. Our economies rely heavily on ecosystem services, 75% of our businesses depend on nature. Yet 80% of nature in Europe is in a poor state.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That's why we need to put nature on the balance sheet. This not about turning nature into a commodity, but about recognising and rewarding actions that restore and sustain nature. Nature credits are emerging as a promising tool to change how we value nature.</p><p>They are a way to channel finance to nature-positive actions. To restore wetlands, to create new habitats, to boost biodiversity.</p><p>They mean an additional source of income for farmers, foresters, land managers, fishers and many others.</p><p>They can offer businesses and investors a credible tool to help restoring nature in line with their corporate commitments.</p><p>With the roadmap we present today, we want to frame how we can develop those markets and those models.</p><p>Public funding will remain a cornerstone of nature protection and restoration. But this is not enough: we face a big annual gap in biodiversity financing across the EU. To close it, we must unlock private finance to complement public support.</p><p>Momentum is building. Financial institutions are starting to consider biodiversity loss as a material risk that needs to be mitigated. Insurers are investing in nature-based solutions to reduce damage from floods and fires.</p><p>But this growing interest needs structure and trust to scale up. That is the purpose of our roadmap. Let me highlight its core elements.</p><p>First, we will focus on standards and certification. Credibility is key. Because it's not so easy to measure nature. Nature is a local given, how do you fit that in markets that are globally driven? That is why we need very robust and science-based certification and reliable verification methods.</p><p>Second, we want to build the market infrastructure: transparent governance and reliable monitoring systems are the foundation. These is not a technical detail, these are the basics to create investor and public trust. And it is key to avoid greenwashing.</p><p>Third, we will test and scale up. The demand for nature credits is growing. The Commission is already supporting pilot projects and will continue to do so. Many local authorities and companies around the world are also supporting projects on the ground. I hope to see growing numbers of potential buyers seizing nature positive investments in the future.</p><p>Fourth, we are also linking up globally. We want to leverage insights from international work on nature credits. We will step up our engagement to shape and align with emerging global standards.</p><p>And finally, we need a simple framework that respects the local reality of nature and keeps administrative burden to the minimum. And we need shared governance to ensure fair access to all actors. Big and small, local and international.</p><p>Let me be clear: nature credits are not a silver bullet. They are part of a broader shift to value nature, to reward restoration and to build resilience.</p><p>Today's roadmap is only the beginning. That is why we are inviting everybody - experts, scientists, civil society, Member States and international partners - to contribute and turn nature credits into a success.</p><p>We will set up a dedicated expert group. We want front-running countries, companies and international stakeholders to be able to learn from each other. Together, we have to build the foundation for a trusted market that reflects the rich diversity of our nature, and our collective commitment to its future.</p><p>We have to work together to ensure that investing in nature becomes not the exception, but the norm - a driver of resilience, fairness and long-term prosperity.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(European Union News)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Momentum is building.

The nine-metre-tall spider sculpture stands in an exposed stretch of ground outside the Guggenheim Museum.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elsewhere, the city offers plenty of shelter for its residents and visitors during this late June heatwave. Plane trees make a cool tunnel of the Gran V\\xEDa, where screens announce the time and temperature; 25\\xB0C at 9pm stops me in my tracks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are 131 'climate shelters' - air-conditioned buildings and green spaces where people can keep cool - publicised this year by an outreach team holding white parasols in addition to the usual channels. Temporary fountains have been set up in the busiest areas of the city.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I'm here to find out what goes on behind the scenes to make Bilbao and the Biscay province of the Basque Country an innovator in climate adaptation; a place that does things a little differently from the rest of Spain and Europe.</p><p>From static to dynamic urban planning</p><p>Tecnalia, the largest applied research centre in Spain, resides in a leafy science park above 'el bocho' (the hole) as Bilbao is known, because of its position in the dip of the mountains.</p><p>Within this sleek R&amp;D hub, the Energy, Climate and Urban Transition unit is busy applying advanced technology to some of the knottiest nodes in climate action.</p><p>Patricia Molina oversees the City, Territory and Environment pillar within this unit. An urban planner by training, her practice has evolved with technological breakthroughs - bridging economic, social and other silos, and knitting together different scales to produce a dynamic analysis of the city.</p><p>If you can see almost life on one hand and on the other hand you can make scenarios and anticipate those scenarios and take the measures in advance, I think this is going to completely change the urban planning system, she says.</p><p>Her team can map cities in extraordinary detail. Including, for example, whether an apartment block has an elevator or air conditioning. Combined with demographic stats, it helps them to see where residents are most vulnerable during extreme heat.</p><p>Given Bilbao's vulnerability to river flooding, they have also mapped the city's sewage system and road network, including the number of vehicles and access to alternative routes if a flood strikes.</p><p>And with digital twins - virtual replicas of cities - they can test the efficacy of nature-based solutions, even down to which tree species will have the fastest growth rate under climate change.</p><p>Climate proofing, explains Efren Feliu Torres, head of the climate change adaptation programme, is a crucial concept within their modelling. It means taking into account the fact that the climate is dynamic and will alter the outcome of adaptation measures.</p><p>The intention is improving decision-making. That is the ultimate objective, he says. Tecnalia's analysis feeds into mid- to long-term planning for authorities, helping them to see where investment is most needed and impactful.</p><p>When we show the work we are doing to some municipalities in the south of Spain, they are just amazed because apparently we don't have such a huge problem with heat here, but we are already planning for it, says Molina.</p><p>A unique ecosystem of public and private partnerships</p><p>Tecnalia is roughly half-and-half supported by private and public funding - a collaborative effort fostered by the regional government.</p><p>Another embodiment of this approach is the B Accelerator Tower (BAT), a public-private centre for entrepreneurship housed in Bilbao's second-tallest building. The tallest is the Iberdrola Tower, the headquarters of the Spanish energy company, which dominates the skyline.</p><p>BAT's 200 members include corporate powerhouses like Iberdrola and Triodos Bank, the Basque region's main institutions, and dozens of start-ups. Global consulting firm PwC operates as a 'matchmaker' here, and says it has made 600 matches between entities big and small.</p><p>One such start-up is Woza Labs, which is developing deep-tech foundations to solve climate and sustainability challenges. The Bilbao-headquartered company has partnered with Iberdrola to smarten its grid management, identifying where power lines are most at risk in the short term, and where new ones should be built to maximise their resilience.</p><p>It does this by integrating disparate datasets - including geospatial intelligence and data from the energy company about its facilities and past incidents - into one predictive platform.</p><p>What we're seeing today is that companies, governments, public institutions, they are not ready for measuring climate [...] their systems are not ready to work in a more volatile environment, says CEO and co-founder Sebasti\\xE1n Priolo. With climate change causing fiercer storms, heatwaves and wildfires, that volatility needs to be input in the systems.</p><p>One of the things that wooed Woza's founders to Bilbao from London is what Priolo calls the asymmetry between digitalisation and industry. With a past rooted in heavy industry and an ongoing industrial presence, it's a seller's market for companies offering digital services.</p><p>The Bizkaian government has created a supportive environment for start-ups, he adds.</p><p>Exercising its tax autonomy, the Provincial Council of Bizkaia has incentives to encourage innovation and decarbonisation. The corporate tax deduction for investments in clean technologies has recently been increased to 35 per cent, for example.</p><p>We want to be there among the main European countries concerning innovation, Ainara Basurko Urkiri, deputy of economic promotion in the Bizkaia Government, tells Euronews Green. We need public and private partnerships, she emphasises. If we go hand-in-hand together, we will move forward faster.</p><p>Chasing greener horizons at Bilbao Port</p><p>Bilbao's changing narrative is nowhere better illustrated than at its port, Spain's fourth busiest.</p><p>This, says Andima Ormaetxe, director of operations, commercial, logistics and strategy, is the port of the Atlantic. It is a gateway for the rest of Europe and America, and its history is also that of Bilbao, which was granted city status and control of maritime traffic entering its estuary in 1300.</p><p>Iron ore had long been mined from the surrounding hills, furnishing the armouries of Spanish kings. But extraction became big business in the nineteenth century, spearheaded by British industrialists.</p><p>The meandering Nervi\\xF3n River was straightened en route to the Old Town docks (15 km upstream), which were eventually abandoned altogether as the superpuerto on the bay grew. The Guggenheim Museum was built on a derelict dock district.</p><p>Now, hemmed in by those hills, there is no more room for Bilbao Port to expand. So our generation is the generation in which we have to make the port more effective and efficient with the space that we've got, says Ormaetxe.</p><p>It's clear that decarbonisation is going to be a big opportunity, he adds. The port has invested millions in electrifying its docks; a bank of onshore wind turbines, wave farms and solar panels are part of its plan to be self-sufficient and create an Onshore Power Supply (OPS).</p><p>In the chicken and egg game of working with shipping companies - which say they cannot transition without the infrastructure - Bilbao Port is aiming to make green electricity the cheap option, and raise ambitions around Europe.</p><p>It is also collaborating with the industrial sites at its heels, affording them the space to develop green hydrogen, which is a major part of the region's plans. Precisely because Biscay was a major cog in the industrial revolution, it is now busy building a greener future - working with what it's got, to paraphrase Ormaetxe.</p><p>Source: Euronews</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Combined with demographic stats, it helps them to see where residents are most vulnerable during extreme heat.

More than 20 years prior, Tropical Storm Michelle brought devastating floods, battered the coastline, and damaged over 300 homes in Annotto Bay. This time, however, the outcome was different. Thanks to strategic investments in disaster preparedness, Jamaica's defenses held stronger, protecting lives, infrastructure, and livelihoods.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For years, Jamaica has been highly exposed to natural disasters, from hurricanes and floods to earthquakes and landslides. With 82 percent of the population living within five kilometers of the coast and the majority of industries and essential services concentrated in vulnerable low-lying areas, the risks have been immense. Recognizing the urgent need for resilience, the Government of Jamaica partnered with the World Bank to implement the Jamaica Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project, an initiative aimed at strengthening the country's ability to withstand climate and disaster risks.</p><p>Protecting Coastal Communities from Rising Waters</p><p>In Annotto Bay, a small coastal town long plagued by erosion and storm surges, the work of the project was put to the test as Beryl's waves pounded the shore. Historically, severe storms had stripped away the beach, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to the sea's encroachment. However, with the construction of three protective groynes - barriers built to prevent erosion - and a widening of the beach by 12 meters into the ocean, the town was no longer at the mercy of the waves. The project's nature-based solutions performed as designed-while minor sand displacement occurred, the coastline remained intact.</p><p>For the residents of Port Royal Street in Kingston, past hurricanes turned a critical transportation route into a hazard zone, with the road's structural integrity continually threatened by coastal erosion. Now, as part of the project, a newly reinforced seawall was constructed along Port Royal Street to counteract coastal erosion and protect critical infrastructure. This seawall was designed to withstand extreme weather conditions, reducing the impact of storm surges and preventing further degradation of the coastline. During Beryl, the newly reinforced seawall stood firm, protecting not only the roadway but also nearby homes and businesses. Beneficiaries observed tangible improvements, such as stronger coastal defenses and better infrastructure, which enhanced their ability to withstand extreme weather events and maintain safe passage even in the aftermath of storms.</p><p>Keeping Communities Dry: Urban Drainage Upgrades</p><p>Further inland, communities that once suffered from severe flooding saw dramatic improvements. Myton Gully and Church Pen, two areas notorious for rising floodwaters, had undergone crucial upgrades-891 meters of drainage enhancements and 336 meters of bridge rehabilitation. In the past, heavy rains transformed these neighborhoods into waterlogged disaster zones, with flood levels reaching up to two meters. This time, as Hurricane Beryl's downpour tested the system, the upgraded infrastructure functioned as intended. Roads remained accessible and homes were spared from inundation.</p><p>Enhancing Emergency Response with Modern Fire Stations</p><p>The project also addressed critical gaps in emergency response. Before the project, the Jamaica Fire Brigade in Port Maria operated from smaller locations, forcing firefighters to travel long distances from Ocho Rios-resulting in response times of up to 45 minutes during major emergencies. The construction of a new fire station transformed emergency services in the area. When Beryl struck, response times had been cut to under 10 minutes, allowing first responders to quickly manage flood-related emergencies. Similar improvements were seen in Montego Bay and Yallahs, where new and rehabilitated fire stations significantly reduced response times and expanded coverage to thousands more residents. Surveys revealed high levels of satisfaction among communities, with beneficiaries citing improved response times, enhanced firefighting capacity, and stronger community outreach efforts.</p><p>Science and Policy: Strengthening Jamaica's Disaster Preparedness</p><p>Beyond physical infrastructure, the project also strengthened Jamaica's ability to assess and mitigate disaster risks through improved data collection and analysis. One of the most significant achievements was the upgrade of the national seismic monitoring system. Prior to the project, the country's earthquake detection capabilities were limited, with outdated equipment and large data gaps. The installation of new seismic stations, powered by solar energy and integrated into a national network, improved detection accuracy and informed building regulations.</p><p>Additionally, seismic microzonation studies, which analyze how different soil types, rock formations, and topography influence ground shaking during an earthquake, provided unprecedented insights into Jamaica's earthquake vulnerability. By mapping these variations in detail, the studies helped authorities understand which areas are at higher risk and require stronger building regulations or retrofitting measures. Furthermore, a Rapid Visual Screening was conducted to assess structures for earthquake vulnerabilities, allowing authorities to identify high-risk buildings in need of intervention to minimize damage and loss of life. As part of the project, 3,861 residential and commercial structures were evaluated. While over 90 percent passed the assessment, significant structural vulnerabilities were found in critical facilities such as schools and police stations. This risk information was shared with government agencies, building owners, and administrators to guide decisions on further technical assessments, retrofitting, or reconstruction. These combined efforts have been essential for integrating risk-informed planning across government agencies, infrastructure projects, and urban development initiatives.</p><p>A key component of the project was also the development of the National Risk Information Platform (NRIP), a digital portal consolidating hazard and risk data. Designed to serve as a central resource for policymakers, urban planners, and emergency responders, the NRIP's full rollout is expected in 2025. This platform will support evidence-based decision-making, ensuring that future investments in infrastructure and disaster preparedness are informed by real-time risk assessments.</p><p>A Model for Resilience</p><p>As Jamaica continues to face the increasing threats of climate change and natural disasters, the Jamaica Disaster Vulnerability Reduction Project stands as a model of proactive disaster risk management. The project has benefited 1.6 million people, more than 50% of the population-well beyond its initial target-and has significantly strengthened the country's ability to withstand and recover from disasters.</p><p>When Hurricane Beryl struck, the results were clear: stronger infrastructure, better emergency response, and a more resilient nation. The lessons from this initiative will continue to shape Jamaica's approach to disaster risk reduction, ensuring that communities are better protected against the challenges that lie ahead.</p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Historically, severe storms had stripped away the beach, leaving homes and businesses vulnerable to the sea's encroachment.

Building on commitments made at COP28 and the One Water Summit, the report sets a baseline for tracking investments and collaboration across the water sector. In 2024 alone, MDBs approved USD 19.6 billion in water-related financing, with 14.4 billion focused on low- and middle-income countries. This first-of-its-kind report reflects the MDBs' shared ambition to improve access to safe water and sanitation, promote sustainable water resource management, and scale up support for climate-resilient irrigation systems.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The report highlights the urgent need for increased investment and reform in the water sector. Despite growing demand and climate pressures, many countries face significant financing gaps-particularly in Sub-Saharan Africa and fragile contexts-where spending must increase dramatically to meet Sustainable Development Goals. The MDBs are responding with a mix of sovereign and non-sovereign financing, technical assistance, and innovative instruments to crowd in private capital. They are also supporting policy and institutional reforms to improve service delivery, financial sustainability, and governance in the sector.</p><p>Collaboration is at the heart of this effort. The report showcases joint initiatives across regions-from urban sanitation in Egypt and flood management in the Philippines to climate-resilient infrastructure in Barbados and irrigation in Cambodia. These examples demonstrate how MDBs are working together to align strategies, co-finance projects, and share knowledge. Future editions of the report will track progress, deepen analysis, and spotlight the impact of these investments on people's lives and the planet.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The world's 10 multilateral development banks (MDBs) are committed to joint action to improve global water security by 2030. The Water Security Financing Report 2024 is the first annual report to monitor this joint commitment. The 2024 report provides a baseline for subsequent years as conditions evolve and the global focus on water security for human development, jobs and prosperity increases. This report focuses on water sector financing and actions underway to achieve joint action. Future reports will include the impact and effectiveness of this financing, as well as the necessary policies, institutions, and regulations needed to achieve lasting water security.</p><p>Introduction</p><p>On December 3, 2024, nine multilateral development banks (MDBs) issued a joint commitment to water security at the One Water Summit in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia (ADB et al. 2024). This commitment built on a previous statement at COP 28 (ADB et al. 2023).</p><p>COMMITMENT BY THE MULTILATERAL DEVELOPMENT BANKS TO WATER SECURITY</p><p>Joint Statement by the Multilateral Development Banks (African Development Bank Group, Asian Development Bank, Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Investment Bank, Inter-American Development Bank Group, Islamic Development Bank, New Development Bank, and World Bank Group)</p><p>Water is a key priority of the Multilateral Development Banks; in the last five years we jointly committed USD 50 billion of lending to the water sector, complemented by technical assistance, benefitting more than 400 million people globally.</p><p>At COP28 in December 2023, the Islamic Development Bank delivered a joint statement on behalf of the Multilateral Development Banks committing to increase the number of people benefiting from support for climate-resilient water systems, particularly in water-stressed regions. Building on that commitment and our on-going collaboration, we commit to work together to jointly significantly increase our support to the water sector in the five years between 2025 and 2030, both in terms of financing and technical assistance. In order to deliver on the Sustainable Development Goals, we aspire to accelerate universal access to safe drinking water and sanitation, scale up irrigation to increase food security and improve livelihoods, enhance flood management, and advance the sustainable management of water resources. We aim to provide hundreds of millions more people with water security through ambitious programs that take advantage of both deeper collaboration between us, and collaboration with other partners.</p><p>Together, we commit to scale up finance for climate-resilient water, using a range of financial instruments. We will explore new and innovative financing that crowds in private and philanthropic resources. We will engage with market-based mechanisms and assist clients to tap relevant climate finance. We will work together to preserve scarce public financing for where it is needed most, prioritizing and leveraging private sector participation and scaling up private-sector financing and to facilitate guarantees and risk-sharing instruments. We will endeavor to ensure no-one is left behind, prioritizing the most vulnerable populations.</p><p>In order to achieve sustainability and greater impact, we believe the water sector needs both technically and financially efficient service providers that can deliver quality services, and sound governance arrangements, including policy, institutional and regulatory regimes, that are implemented with integrity. Accordingly, at the request of our client countries, we will support water sector reforms and investments at country and regional level and will help build utilities that can face the future in a changing climate. We will seek to improve the efficiency and financial sustainability of service providers and affordability for users; to build effective policy, institutional, and regulatory environments; and to enhance governance and transparency in the sector. We will promote nature-based solutions and innovative technical solutions to enhance water security.</p><p>We will work to improve our collaboration and coordination, in line with our different mandates and business models, developing our network, consulting with each other and building our partnership at global, regional and country level. Responding to the needs of our client countries, we will seek out opportunities for co-financing. We will work within the existing coordination processes among MDBs to provide more efficient and coordinated support to our clients. We commit to streamline project execution and implementation and reduce complexity for borrowers. There are many opportunities for us to coordinate the assistance we provide and collaborate to bring clients an optimized package of support. We will seek out ways to scale up our technical assistance and to work together to ensure it is focused on the major obstacles we have jointly identified that impede progress in the water sector. We commit to sharing knowledge and tools.</p><p>We will monitor and report on our success. This will include both progress in reaching our commitments to scale up financing, and realization of our promise to work collaboratively.</p><p>In this statement, the MDBs committed to reporting on joint progress.1 This first annual Water Security Financing Report provides an overview of MDB investments in the water sector around the world, providing a baseline in 2024 against which future financing can be tracked. It highlights the collective effort of the 10 members of the MDB Water Sector Coordination Group-the African Development Bank Group (AfDB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB), Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), European Investment Bank (EIB), Inter-American Development Bank Group (IDB), Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), New Development Bank (NDB), and World Bank Group (WBG)-to foster collaboration, share knowledge, and catalyze innovative solutions.

And concrete targets are desperately needed to make sure Europe's urban centres stay on track.</p><p>Which European cities are adapting well?</p><p>Capital and larger cities are usually frontrunners as they have great financial and technical capacities to work on adaptation, and may even be more ambitious than the national level on climate action, says Ine Vandecasteele, an expert on urban adaptation at the EEA.</p><p>However, it is not only larger cities that are taking good initiatives.</p><p>She points to a few that stick out for their efforts. Ghent in Belgium, for example, has an ambitious greening strategy and is already limiting the construction of new buildings. Even if they are approved there is a 'net-zero' requirement that means an equal area of the city needs to be unpaved or converted back to green space.</p><p>Nantes in France is investing in becoming one of Europe's greenest cities while still trying to remain affordable for residents. Rethymno, a coastal town in Greece, is investing in bioclimatic design in its public spaces, using compressed soil, permeable pavers and paint to effectively reduce maximum air temperature during heatwaves.</p><p>On the flipside, smaller municipalities may need additional support from the regional and national level to be able to develop and implement effective adaptation strategies. In a good example of how to overcome these limitations from Piedmont, Italy, smaller municipalities are banding together to apply for funding.</p><p>Though adaption needs to be tailored to the specific impacts felt in each city, Vandecasteele says similar places can learn a lot from each other.</p><p>For example in tackling increasing heatwaves in southern European cities, or greater variability in rainfall and storms in western and northern Europe. There is a strong need for networking and peer-learning - best practices can and need to be shared.</p><p>Adaptation, she says, also needs the support of citizens who should be involved in every step of the process.</p><p>Why do Europe's cities need to adapt?</p><p>The EEA published the first-ever European climate risk assessment in March this year. It shows that current policies and adaptation actions aren't keeping pace with rapidly growing climate risks - and urban areas are at particular risk from heatwaves and heavy rain.</p><p>Europe is the fastest warming continent with temperatures rising at roughly twice the rate of the global average. Almost three-quarters of the continent's population is estimated to live in urban areas and cities can often be up to 10 to 15C hotter than the surrounding land.</p><p>With more to lose from the consequences of the world's changing climate and a large section of the population to protect, the report highlights the urgent need to adapt European cities to climate change.</p><p>Cities need specific targets for climate adaptation</p><p>If actions taken at a local level are to be properly upscaled then tangible goals and specific targets are needed to measure progress, the report adds. Right now, there are none at national or European levels.</p><p>Targets set by cities could be quite specific, for example ensuring that as much as possible of the population is covered by specific insurance where needed, that housing meets certain minimum energy efficiency standards, that rainwater is separated from greywater collection for all individual houses, or that all citizens have publicly accessible green spaces within a short walk of where they are living, Vandecasteele explains.</p><p>These are needed.

For Baudelaire, they were two forces drawn together by awe, fascination, and even conflict.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Today, that dynamic has taken on a new and troubling dimension. We rely on the ocean for climate stability and economic prosperity, yet we are fuelling a climate crisis that threatens to undermine the very system we depend on. We cannot let that happen.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Baudelaire described the sea as a mirror to the human soul. We now need to take a hard look in that mirror and ask ourselves: what can we do to stem the tide of this crisis, to safeguard our ocean and economy?</p><p>This morning's two panel discussions will go a long way towards answering that question. But I would like to take this opportunity to open the plenary session with a few thoughts - about what is at stake, and what stakeholders can do about it.</p><p>The ocean's importance for our climate and economy</p><p>The ocean is home to 95% of the planet's biosphere. It spans environments as varied as sunlit coral reefs and pitch-black abyssal plains. And it supports an immense range of life, from countless microscopic organisms to the world's largest animal, the blue whale.</p><p>Given the ocean's richness, it is worth preserving in its own right. But its value does not end there - the ocean also benefits humanity in two vital ways.</p><p>First, it is one of the planet's most powerful allies in the fight against climate change.</p><p>The ocean helps to regulate global temperatures by absorbing vast amounts of heat and redistributing it through major currents like the Gulf Stream. It is also the world's largest carbon sink, reducing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere and helping to slow global warming.</p><p>The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change finds that the ocean has absorbed over 90% of the excess heat trapped in the earth's system, as well as a third of the carbon dioxide that humans have emitted since the Industrial Revolution.</p><p>Second, a sustainable ocean serves as an important pillar supporting the global economy, providing for food security and economic opportunities.</p><p>Marine ecosystems support over three billion people who rely on fish for at least 20% of their animal protein intake. Indeed, this dependency is more pronounced in some of the least-developed countries, where seafood provides most of the animal protein consumed.</p><p>These ecosystems also help sustain employment opportunities. More than 150 million jobs depend on the production, trade and consumption of ocean-based goods and services, according to the United Nations. The ocean is also home to key natural resources, such as medicines and biofuels, which are vital for ongoing advances in healthcare and clean energy sectors.</p><p>So, there is a great deal at stake in preserving the ocean's health.</p><p>The threat of climate change</p><p>But today we are placing the sustainability of our ocean under extraordinary stress, with serious implications for both our climate and economy.</p><p>Without the ocean's capacity to absorb heat and carbon, we would have had to contend with a faster, even more dangerous pace of global warming. Yet there are now signs that this capacity is becoming strained.</p><p>The last ten years were the ocean's warmest on record. Warmer oceans are driving more frequent marine heatwaves, which damage ecosystems, and have been a major contributor to rising sea levels due to the thermal expansion of seawater. The rate at which the global mean sea level is rising has more than doubled over the past three decades.</p><p>On top of this, the ocean's absorption of carbon dioxide is driving acidification.</p><p>Combined with ocean warming, acidification is contributing to the bleaching and death of coral reefs, which are vital for supporting fisheries and protecting coastlines from storms. Since 2023 over 80% of the world's coral reefs have been affected by bleaching.</p><p>We find ourselves in dangerous waters. Together, these changes could have profound consequences for the global economy.</p><p>Food security may be undermined, potentially leading to more volatile prices, which is a concern for central banks tasked with safeguarding price stability. And if coastal areas become unliveable due to rising sea levels or frequent flooding, people may be forced to move. More than 600 million people around the world live in coastal areas that are less than ten metres above sea level.</p><p>Stemming the tide</p><p>So, what can we do to stem the tide of these troubling developments? We may not be able to fully reverse the damage done, but we can work towards slowing its momentum, potentially even stopping it, by acting on two important fronts.</p><p>First, we need to protect. That means cutting greenhouse gas emissions decisively and keeping the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.</p><p>If we succeed in doing so, we could limit sea level rise to around half a metre by the end of the century. That might not sound reassuring. But every tenth of a degree we avoid is a piece of coastline preserved, a reef protected or a storm surge weakened.</p><p>We also need to protect the natural systems that shield us from floods. Nature-based solutions - for instance, restoring mangroves, marshes and coral reefs - offer powerful, cost-effective defences against extreme weather. Coral reefs alone can reduce wave energy by an average of 97% while supporting fisheries, tourism and coastal livelihoods.</p><p>The second front is just as important: we need to prepare.</p><p>Whether we like it or not, climate-related risks are materialising. We need to adapt our infrastructure and economies to a more volatile world. That includes building sea walls and surge barriers and budgeting for resilience rather than reacting after disaster strikes.</p><p>Make no mistake: adaptation will be costly. According to UN assessments, costs could run into the hundreds of billions of dollars globally each year by mid-century. But the cost of inaction would be far higher. One study estimates that failing to keep global temperatures below two degrees above pre-industrial levels could lead to USD 14 trillion in global annual flood costs by 2100.</p><p>To meet this challenge, we need to catalyse finance for marine and coastal conservation - for instance, through innovative approaches that convert natural capital into financial capital.</p><p>This can be especially impactful for vulnerable countries with limited fiscal space. Above all, we must listen to the communities affected, treating their needs as a basis for our actions rather than an afterthought.</p><p>Let me conclude.</p><p>Baudelaire reminds us that the sea is a mirror of our own nature, which can either heal or harm.</p><p>So, let us choose to heal. That means nurturing the ocean's rich diversity and facilitating finance to support innovative adaptation measures that build more resilient communities and a stronger global economy.</p><p>Thank you.</p><p>(European Central Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["But every tenth of a degree we avoid is a piece of coastline preserved, a reef protected or a storm surge weakened.

The approval of this credit instrument is another innovative step for the country in its search for better conditions of access to international financing. It is equally important that it seeks to enhance Uruguay's positioning in agricultural export markets, which increasingly value sustainable production. The indicators included in this loan, and in the Environmental Bond issued in 2022, demonstrate Uruguay's determination and motivation to follow a development path that combines increased growth and productivity in the livestock sector -- an integral part of the country's economic structure -- with a commitment to non-deforestation of the native forest.</p><p>Azucena Arbeleche</p><p>Minister of Economy and Finance, Uruguay</p><p>The WCB [Wildlife Conservation Bond] model provides a new blueprint for the way conservation is financed and has the potential to be a key enabling tool for the delivery of the post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.

We are delighted to have been a part of the collaborative effort to bring this innovative transaction to life.</p><p>Oliver Withers</p><p>Biodiversity Lead within Global Sustainability, Credit Suisse</p><p>Challenge</p><p>Nature underpins economies in tangible, measurable ways, and its rapid loss carries huge costs for governments, economies, and communities. Biodiversity loss is now ranked among the top three most severe risks by the World Economic Forum's Global Risks Report, and is projected to cost the poorest countries 10 percent of their gross domestic product (GDP) annually by 2030. These trends are further exacerbated by the changing climate, which can trigger feedback effects and tipping points, which, if exceeded, can lead to significant and irreversible changes. Implementing the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework requires $700 billion annually, while current spending falls short, reaching $120-140 billion, much of it in the form of domestic public spending. The private sector will need to play a critical role in closing this large funding gap.</p><p>Approach</p><p>The World Bank Group takes a multi-pronged approach to generate knowledge, create tools, scale up investment, and mobilize private sector finance to help countries manage their natural resources in a sustainable manner. These aspects are interconnected: knowledge and tools drive innovation and investment, which in turn can help attract private capital and generate know-how and tools. This creates a virtuous cycle that can lead to sustainable economic and social development.</p><p>In the domain of analytical support, the World Bank provides knowledge, decision-support tools, and analytics to inform policy dialogues and investments. For example, the Changing Wealth of Nations (CWON) program provides the most comprehensive wealth database available. This database incorporates assets such as human capital and natural capital, covering 151 countries and providing insights on the sustainability of economic progress, allowing it to complement Global Domestic Product (GDP) as an economic measure. With the World Bank's support, the Central Bank in Malaysia is conducting the first nature-related financial risk assessment, deepening the understanding of the interactions between nature and financial institutions. The Geospatial Platforms and Sovereign ESG Data Portal make more data and analytics accessible to client countries and financial institutions and help improve the market recognition of nature-related financial risks.</p><p>In the realm of investing in and mobilizing finance for nature, the WBG is one of the leading financiers of nature globally. In FY24, the World Bank's active portfolio included $4 billion of direct investments in biodiversity and ecosystem services. This portfolio integrates nature considerations into economic policy, development programs, and strategic sectoral investments in nearly 60 countries, supporting the implementation of the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. To mobilize finance, particularly private capital, the WBG utilizes tailored financial instruments, such as thematic bonds, outcome bonds, sustainability-linked loans, and political/credit risk guarantees to unlock financing by tapping into capital markets, harnessing result-based financing tools, and de-risking private capital investments.</p><p>Results</p><p>As a leading multilateral financier of nature, the World Bank offers a range of knowledge products, direct financing, and tailored financial instruments to scale up public and private investment in nature. This combination of approaches used in the WBG active portfolio in 2024 has contributed to bringing about 45 million hectares of landscapes and seascapes under enhanced conservation and management.</p><p>- Foundational knowledge and analytics, such as the Changing Wealth of Nations and the Economic Case for Nature, support the economic rationale for investment in nature, integrating it into economic and financial decision-making. The global integrated Earth-economy model presented in the Economic Case for Nature report has influenced the incorporation of natural capital data and analytics into the World Bank's country-specific macroeconomic models that inform Country Climate and Development Reports (CCDRs), and country dialogues and operations in countries including Kenya, Ethiopia, India, Rwanda, Uganda, Brazil, and Malawi.</p><p>- Through the Global Program on Sustainability, the World Bank has helped 30 countries develop and apply natural capital accounts to date. In FY24, four countries (Ghana, Maldives, Nepal, and Bangladesh) used nature analytics to inform projects worth around $50 million, including landscape restoration efforts in Ghana and sustainable fisheries management in the Maldives. For example, in Ghana, analysis to map out ecosystems and produce datasets for natural services accounts has informed a landscape restoration project and is informing national policy documents. In the Maldives, the analysis of fisheries has helped support sustainable fishery management project. Assessments and recommendations for the sustainable use of fisheries resources have guided the implementation of the Transforming Fisheries Sector Management in South-West Indian Ocean Region and Maldives project.</p><p>- About $600 million of private capital is expected to be mobilized through the World Bank environment-related operations approved in FY22-24, including through the deployment of innovative financial instruments. For example, the World Bank supported Seychelles in issuing the world's first sovereign blue bond using guarantee and concessional funds. World Bank's technical assistance also facilitated the issuance of the first emerging market sovereign green bond in Fiji and the world's first green sukuk in Malaysia. In 2022, the World Bank launched a first-of-its-kind outcome-based bond (outcome bond) to support financing of black rhino conservation activities in South Africa. As of December 2024, after just two and a half years of implementation, the Rhino bond has achieved a rhino population growth rate of 8%, double its target of 4%, while improving the land management of over 154,000 hectares.</p><p>- Another example is the $350 million Uruguay Green and Resilient Growth Performance-Linked Development Policy Loan, the first-ever performance-linked loan by the World Bank with the loan pricing directly linked to reductions in methane emissions intensity. Under the loan term, Uruguay has committed to reducing methane emissions by at least 33 percent between 2025 and 2029 and by at least 36 percent between 2030 and 2034.</p><p>Collaborating across the World Bank Group</p><p>Working collaboratively, the World Bank, the International Finance Corporation (IFC), and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) developed the Nature Finance Tracking Methodology to systematically track and promote contributions to the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework. The Global Challenge Program on Forests for Climate, Development, and Biodiversity is being undertaken by the World Bank, IFC, and MIGA jointly to develop both public and private sector solutions in financing global forest-related investments by mobilizing financing at scale to meet future investment needs.</p><p>Partners</p><p>The WBG is strengthening its partnerships with technology organizations such as NASA, the European Space Agency, and the Group on Earth Observations, to integrate modern digital technologies, including artificial intelligence to better measure the nature impact of our work. Collaboration with the bond investors and the Global Environment Facility (GEF) enabled the Rhino Bond in South Africa; The bond investors' forgone coupon payment was provided to the project as upfront capital investment and the GEF funded a potential performance-based payment.</p><p>The WBG is also increasing its collaboration with other Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) on a range of subjects, from climate finance reporting to nature finance tracking, and, recently, to promoting circular economy approaches. Moreover, the WBG and the Inter-American Development Bank launched a groundbreaking partnership in August 2023, combining the WBG's global knowledge and experience with the IDB's strong engagements with Latin American and Caribbean counties to boost support for net-zero-deforestation efforts in the Amazon, strengthen the Caribbean's resilience to natural disasters, and bridge the digital-access gap across the region.</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>The World Bank Group will continue scaling up nature analytics and nature finance work for a clean, green, and blue planet. The Global Challenge Program on Forests for Development, Climate, and Biodiversity will enhance support for sustainable forest economies, focusing on critical ecosystems like the Amazon, Congo, and Asian forests. Emphasis will be placed on improving data quality and access through technologies and open data initiatives, such as the Livable Planet Observatory. Greater outreach activities are planned, including through hackathons, and the Landscape Knowledge Academy.

This includes working within the G20 to improve the implementation of the Common Framework.</p><p>Promoting innovation</p><p>We have rich public and private innovation ecosystems with untapped potential to address strategic technology and processing gaps essential to bringing critical minerals to market.</p><p>We will intensify our collaboration to fill targeted innovation gaps in critical minerals research and development, with a focus on processing, licensing, recycling, substitution and redesign, and circular economy. We will work with partner organizations to showcase new technologies and production processes.</p><p>We look forward to the upcoming Conference on Critical Materials and Minerals, to be chaired by the United States in Chicago, in September 2025, in order to advance this work.</p><p>We welcome the endorsement of the G7 Critical Minerals Action Plan by the Leaders of Australia,</p><p>India, and the Republic of Korea.</p><p>G7 LEADERS' STATEMENT ON TRANSNATIONAL REPRESSION</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, are deeply concerned by growing reports of transnational repression (TNR). TNR is an aggressive form of foreign interference whereby states or their proxies attempt to intimidate, harass, harm or coerce individuals or communities outside their borders.</p><p>TNR undermines national security, state sovereignty, the safety and human rights of victims, and principles of international law. It has a chilling effect in our countries. TNR often impacts dissidents, journalists, human rights defenders, religious minorities, and those identified as part of diaspora communities.</p><p>We condemn all acts of TNR including but not limited to those involving:</p><p>- Threats or acts of physical violence such as harassment, assault, abduction or assassination;</p><p>- Misuse of cooperation with other foreign states, international bodies and intergovernmental organizations, in order to detain, forcibly return, or repress targets, such as leveraging extraterritorial law application and counterterrorism and investigative tools;</p><p>- Forced return by confiscating passports, invalidating documents, or denying consular services;</p><p>- Digital transnational repression, such as doxing and sexualized smear campaigns particularly targeting women, to induce compliance, silence, threaten, discredit, or retaliate;</p><p>- Misuse of spyware and cyber tools to engage in surveillance, and to enable physical targeting and tracking, hacking, or cyber harassment; and</p><p>- Direct or implicit threats against family members.</p><p>We also remain seized of threats by foreign states and their proxies to our citizens outside our borders, such as arbitrary detention.</p><p>We recognize the important role played by all partners, including civil society, academia and the private sector, in countering this threat. We welcome the recommendations for action emanating from the G7 multistakeholder Dialogue on Transnational Repression, hosted in Ottawa in February 2025, to develop concrete strategies for protecting those who are targeted.</p><p>Building on the 2018 Charlevoix commitment on defending democracy from foreign threats, and these recommendations, we, the Leaders of the G7, commit to foster a common understanding of TNR, raise awareness, and promote accountability to increase the costs for those who engage in acts of TNR. As part of these efforts, we intend to:</p><p>- Build global understanding of the threat and its corrosive impact, including on human rights and democracy; this includes reporting on TNR as an important vector of foreign interference in G7 Rapid Response Mechanism (RRM) public reports, and strengthening engagement with likeminded partners and engaging more broadly in relevant multilateral fora.</p><p>- Develop a TNR Resilience and Response Framework that includes: measures to boost G7 cooperation to counter TNR; a compendium of operational, diplomatic, policy, legislative, and community engagement best practices; and information sharing around the latest techniques, trends and vectors of TNR observed globally, drawing on wider initiatives such as the Pall Mall process related to cyber intrusion capabilities.</p><p>- Launch a Digital TNR Detection Academy through the G7 RRM to build collective capacity to detect TNR online; the Academy will provide G7 and partners with the technical skills and tools for identifying and responding to the latest technology-enabled threats.</p><p>- Support those who may be targets of TNR as well as members of civil society who are actively working to counter the threat, including through initiatives like the Canada-UK Common Good Cyber Fund, and by acting in solidarity with other states affected by TNR.</p><p>We will redouble our efforts to keep our communities safe, to defend human rights, including the freedom of expression online and offline, and to safeguard our sovereignty.</p><p>G7 LEADERS' STATEMENT ON COUNTERING MIGRANT SMUGGLING</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, reaffirm our commitment to prevent and counter migrant smuggling through the G7 Coalition to Prevent and Counter the Smuggling of Migrants and the 2024 G7 Action Plan to Prevent and Counter the Smuggling of Migrants. We are determined to enhance border management and enforcement and dismantle the transnational organized crime groups profiting from both migrant smuggling and human trafficking.</p><p>Migrant smuggling often has links to other serious criminal offences, including money laundering, corruption and trafficking in persons and drugs, that threaten the safety of our communities. It can expose vulnerable smuggled persons to grave and life-threatening risks, including physical abuse, sexual and gender-based violence, extortion, labour exploitation, and forced labour and criminality.</p><p>Through the G7 Coalition, we have made concrete progress on strengthening the operational and investigative capacities of our law enforcement agencies in the fight against migrant smuggling; and enhancing international cooperation between police, judicial, prosecution and border services.</p><p>We task our Interior and Security Ministers to double down on the following areas of the G7 Action Plan this year:</p><p>- Adopt a follow the money approach, exploring innovative solutions that leverage financial intelligence and information-sharing to identify criminal actors; use administrative or judicial processes to hold these criminal actors accountable, seize their assets and strip them of their profits;</p><p>- Boost prevention with countries of origin and transit through strengthening border management capacities and by raising awareness of the risks;</p><p>- Collaborate with social media companies to agree on voluntary principles to prevent organized crime groups from exploiting online platforms to advertise, coordinate, and facilitate migrant smuggling operations;</p><p>- Engage with transport operators to prevent the facilitation of irregular migration, including the weaponization of migrants to undermine stability or as a hybrid warfare tactic.</p><p>We will explore, consistent with our legal systems, the potential use of sanctions to target criminals involved in migrant smuggling and human trafficking operations from countries where those activities emanate.</p><p>We will continue to leverage synergies with other global and regional initiatives aimed at fostering international cooperation.</p><p>We support the continuation of policies for legal migration that members assess to be in their respective national interests. As we work to prevent migrant smuggling and human trafficking, we remain committed to countering all forms of abuse and exploitation of migrants, ensuring protection of the most vulnerable, including refugees and forcibly displaced persons. In so doing, we will meet our respective international human rights commitments.</p><p>G7 LEADERS' STATEMENT ON AI FOR PROSPERITY</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, recognize the potential of a human-centric approach to artificial intelligence (AI) to grow prosperity, benefit societies and address pressing global challenges. To realize this potential, we must better drive innovation and adoption of secure, responsible, and trustworthy AI that benefits people, mitigates negative externalities, and promotes our national security. We will power AI now and into the future. And we will work with emerging market and developing country partners to close digital divides, in line with the United Nations Global Digital Compact.</p><p>We must seize the potential of AI in our public sectors to drive efficiency and better serve our publics. We also recognize that small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), including microenterprises, are the backbone of our economies, driving growth and creating jobs. In 2024, we committed to work together to help SMEs adopt and develop new technologies, including AI, to accelerate broad-based growth. We also committed to fully leverage the potential of AI to enable decent work while addressing challenges for our labour markets. We reiterate the importance of operationalizing Data Free Flow with Trust (DFFT) through trustworthy, cross-border data flows, and affirm its value in enabling trusted AI development and use. We recognized the transformative impact of AI for the cultural and creative sectors, including challenges to business models and job security, and opportunities to boost innovation.</p><p>We recognize that increased AI adoption will place growing pressure on our energy grids, produce negative externalities and have implications for energy security, resilience and affordability. At the same time, AI can be harnessed to promote energy innovation and bolster the resilience and reliability of our energy systems.</p><p>We hear the concerns of emerging market and developing country partners about the challenges they face in building resilient AI ecosystems, including the risks of disruption and exclusion from today's technological revolution.</p><p>To fully realize the potential of AI for our publics and our partners, we commit to:</p><p>Work together to accelerate adoption of AI in the public sector to enhance the quality of public services for both citizens and businesses and increase government efficiency while respecting human rights and privacy, as well as promoting transparency, fairness, and accountability.</p><p>- To this end, Canada as G7 presidency is launching the G7 GovAI Grand Challenge and will host a series of Rapid Solution Labs to develop innovative and scalable solutions to the barriers we face in adopting AI in the public sector.</p><p>- We will leverage our existing government AI expertise to establish a G7 AI Network (GAIN) to advance the Grand Challenge; develop a roadmap to scale successful AI projects; and create a catalogue of open-source and shareable AI solutions for members. GAIN will collaborate to ensure that AI solutions in government have measurable and real benefits for our communities.</p><p>- We task relevant Ministers to explore strategic investments for accelerating public sector AI adoption in transformative ways, including for large language models and digital infrastructure.</p><p>Promote economic prosperity by supporting SMEs to adopt and develop AI that respects personal data and intellectual property rights, and strengthen their readiness, efficiency, productivity and competitiveness.</p><p>- We launch the G7 AI Adoption Roadmap, which provides clear, actionable pathways for companies to adopt AI and scale their businesses. Through this Roadmap, we commit to: sustain investments in AI adoption programs for SMEs, including supporting access to compute and digital infrastructure; publish a common blueprint for AI adoption by SMEs underpinned by proven use-cases from G7 economies; deepen our cooperation on talent exchange to integrate AI skills within businesses looking to scale; and develop tools that grow business and consumer confidence and trust in AI adoption including by leveraging the outcomes of the Hiroshima AI Process. We will collaborate with international partners, like the Global Partnership on AI, to advance this work.</p><p>- We will build resilient future workforces by preparing workers for AI-driven transitions. To do so, we will advance implementation of the 2024 G7 Action Plan for a human-centered adoption of safe, secure and trustworthy AI in the world of work, including by developing a voluntary compendium of best practices.</p><p>- We will drive economic growth, address talent shortages, and ensure equal opportunity, by encouraging girls, as well as members of communities left behind by globalization, to pursue science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and increasing women's representation in the AI talent pool at all levels.</p><p>Meet the energy challenges of AI and harness its potential for advancements in energy efficiency and innovation.</p><p>- We will cooperate on innovative solutions to address energy challenges across our economies, including for AI and data centres, that support our respective national and international commitments. We will also support innovation that improves the energy and resource efficiency of AI models and optimizes data centre operations. We will advance AI solutions to unlock energy innovation and breakthrough discoveries, including optimization of energy use, and adopt AI to help build secure, resilient, and affordable energy systems and supply chains. We will strive to identify solutions that mitigate negative externalities and generate benefits for people and preserve our natural resources. We will cooperate on knowledge-building and sharing with trusted international partners and promote AI skills and talent development in the energy sector.</p><p>- We task relevant Ministers to advance these commitments by delivering a workplan on AI and energy, before the end of this year, including working with international and industry partners to provide ongoing data analysis.</p><p>Expand mutually beneficial partnerships with emerging markets and developing country partners to increase access to AI for everyone.</p><p>- We will harness trusted and secure AI technology to promote growth and enable partners to tackle the unique challenges they face. To do this, we will leverage our combined expertise, resources and networks to bridge gaps in AI infrastructure and capacity, invest in locally led AI-enabled innovations, and voluntarily collaborate with local universities to share knowledge and access to AI on mutually agreed terms.</p><p>- We will deliver this by aligning our efforts through initiatives including AI for Development, AI Hub for Sustainable Development, Current AI, FAIR Forward, Hiroshima AI Process Friends Group, AI for Public Good, and others. Interested G7 members plan to strengthen the AI for Development Funders Collaborative.</p><p>KANANASKIS COMMON VISION FOR THE FUTURE OF QUANTUM TECHNOLOGIES</p><p>We, the Leaders of the G7, recognize that quantum technologies - which include computing, sensing and communications - have the potential to bring significant and transformative benefits to societies worldwide. Significant R&amp;D breakthroughs over the past decade mean that these technologies are now poised to create economic and social benefits in sectors such as finance, communication, transport, energy, health and agriculture while addressing global challenges. They could also have far reaching implications for national and international security, as they enable new defence capabilities and threaten current data protection systems.</p><p>We acknowledge that achieving quantum technologies' full potential will require international collaboration between governments, researchers and industry to mobilize investments and optimize resources; advance research and commercialization; secure supply chains; facilitate access to infrastructure, talent and markets; align adoption with shared interests and values; and create a trusted ecosystem to manage risks and unleash innovation.</p><p>To this end, we commit to:</p><p>1. Promote public and private investment in quantum science and technology R&amp;D, responsible innovation and commercialization; and support partnerships between researchers, industry and other stakeholders to accelerate commercialization and attract private investment.</p><p>2. Promote the development and adoption of beneficial applications of quantum technologies in a variety of sectors, including those developed by small and medium sized enterprises.</p><p>3. Support opportunities for all stakeholders to meaningfully participate as creators, stakeholders, leaders and decision-makers at all stages of the research, development and implementation of quantum technologies.</p><p>4. Support initiatives, exchange best practices and promote workforce development policies for all, including women as well as communities left behind by globalization, to equip individuals with the skills needed for new jobs in the quantum sector. These include apprenticeships; science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) and computer science education; and mentorship.</p><p>5. Support an open and fair market environment and trusted ecosystem among like-minded partners through measures such as international exchanges between academia and industry, preventing the leakage of sensitive technologies, protecting intellectual property rights, and promoting greater interoperability.</p><p>6. Promote trust in quantum technologies through public and international dialogues, based on scientific expertise and aligned with democratic values, freedom and fundamental rights, recognizing that, at this early stage of innovation, a global regulatory framework is not yet appropriate.</p><p>7.

The ACP-EU Natural Disaster Risk Reduction Program, a joint initiative of the African, Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) Group of States, the European Union, the World Bank and GFDRR, provided additional support.</p><p>GFDRR, including through the City Resilience Program (CRP), has supported climate and disaster risk assessments in the Msimbazi Basin in Dar es Salaam. Taking a deep dive into the economic impacts of flooding, those assessments revealed, for example, that floods disproportionately affect areas with high employment densities.</p><p>Through the Japan Program, GFDRR has supported a comprehensive resilience assessment of urban transport networks in Dodoma and Arusha to inform planning and investments to better manage flood risk. By using flood hazard modeling, transport network analysis, and other methods, the assessment found that 10.5% of Dodoma's road network would likely be affected by an extreme flood event, and identified the five wards with the highest concentration of risk.</p><p>Recent GFDRR-supported analytical work has also included city resilience diagnostics and hazard risk assessments for 12 cities. In Dar es Salaam, GFDRR has also supported a water sector resilience and drought preparedness assessment and stocktaking of infrastructure design and construction designs and standards. At the national level, a comprehensive review of the government's disaster risk management and climate resilience policies was conducted.</p><p>These initiatives complemented work supported by TURP, including development of a probabilistic flood model for Dar es Salaam. That model, which has been used by at least five Tanzanian government agencies, has quantified flood hazards from pluvial, fluvial, and tidal sources and also helped estimate potential losses under varying climate change and urban development scenarios.</p><p>GFDRR supported the Ramani Huria initiative, a community-mapping project that trained university students and local community members to create open-source maps of Dar es Salaam's most flood-prone areas.</p><p>Using aerial and street-level imagery, GPS-enabled mobile apps, and drones, Ramani Huria mapped 29 wards (home to 1.3 million citizens) and 1,254 kilometers of waterways and 3,396 kilometers of roads. These maps generated provide valuable information about likely flood risk in vulnerable neighborhoods and reflect the knowledge of those most directly affected.</p><p>Building on this inclusive and participatory model to resilience-building, TURP supported the Resilience Academy, which was first launched in 2019, and has since enabled 1,400 young Tanzanians to develop skills in data collection, community engagement, and mapping.</p><p>Subsequently, a GFDRR-funded pilot supported Resilience Academy participants to produce detailed tree-cover maps of Dar es Salaam.

The Grand Junction Waterworks Company was actually formed in 1811, while the Napoleonic war was still raging, to supply clean drinking water from the junction of the grand union canal in Paddington to households for Londoners. In need of cleaner sources of water, the company moved its operation to Kew, then outside London in 1838, and built this magnificent pumping station with its huge steam engines to pump the water to London. As London grew and needed more water, the company grew and became more profitable until, in 1905, it was taken over by the Metropolitan Water Board along with several other private water suppliers to provide a unified public water supply system for London.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The reliable supply of water that is clean and safe to drink - or to give it the description the Victorians put into law and that we still use today, the supply of water that is wholesome, is a prerequisite of modern life and it is something that we have become used to and take for granted.</p><p>And the same is true of that other prerequisite of modern life, effective sanitation. 20 years after this pumping house opened, London experienced the 'Great Stink' of 1858. After years of suffering a cesspit and sewer system that could not cope with London's growth, with the Thames a pestiferous and reeking abomination to quote a newspaper of the time, a decision to close the cesspits followed by a hot dry summer brought matters to a head as the Thames became, to quote Disraeli, a Stygian pool reeking with ineffable and intolerable horrors. Parliament, literally disabled by the stench, woke up and finally acted. It gave clear direction to the newly formed London Board of Works which in turn adopted the plan of its chief engineer, Joseph Bazalgette. Over the next 15 years, he oversaw the construction of over 1,100 miles of sewers and massive pumping stations that transformed the health of London.</p><p>I have more than once thought of the 'Great Stink' when leading the Independent Commission on Water over the last 9 months. While today we enjoy safe water and clean sanitation to a level that would have been unimaginable 165 years ago, there are many parallels: a system under huge pressure from economic and population growth, years of discussion and competing plans as the problem grew, government that did not give clear direction, a level of pollution in our waterways that the public will not tolerate and a point at which it became apparent to all that a fundamental reset was needed. And actually, there is a parallel there - that a bonus for Bazalgette was blocked because it was deemed to too high.</p><p>Today the Commission publishes its report which I hope will contribute to that 'reset' that the Government has committed to and that we sorely need. The report is long and detailed - some 460 pages with 88 recommendations covering everything from strategic direction and planning to regulator reform to the water industry supply chain. In an earlier speech I paraphrased Tolstoy to observe that 'while all are unhappy with the current situation, everyone is unhappy in his own way'. Now, looking at the length and scope of the final report I wonder if we have written a Russian novel in response!</p><p>But I would defend that length and scope on two grounds. First, and most obviously, the Terms of Reference set asked the Commission to answer these questions, which we have tried to do. But second, and more importantly, if we are to achieve the water sector we need, we need to look at all the factors that have contributed to our 'Great Stink' moment and recognise that those factors, if not addressed, will hamper us going forward.</p><p>The water industry, of course, is at the heart of this. And the industry, as a whole, has not met public expectations or maintained public trust in recent years. Some companies have manifestly acted in their private interest but against the public interest. That must be prevented in future. But the industry does not exist in a vacuum. It sits within a framework of law and regulation that operates under the strategic direction of government. And it is not the only demand on our water systems, or the only contributor to the current state of our waterways.</p><p>The Commission's report is long and detailed with multiple recommendations because - as I have said - there is no one, single reform, no matter how radical, that will deliver what is needed: we need to act on all of the failures that have brought us to the present pass.</p><p>Now, you will be very relieved to hear that I do not intend here to go through all 460 pages and 88 recommendations. But I will highlight, if you permit me, the main themes of the report and pull out some of key recommendations.</p><p>First, we need truly strategic direction from government. Barely a week goes by without someone calling for 'a strategy' from you, so it is important to set out I mean by this and the challenges it will entail.</p><p>We need to guide the use and development of our water systems and the restoration of our water environment as a whole and over the longer term. We need to chart a path for the delivery of the environmental improvements that the public want to see: to restore ecosystems and sustain our precious waterways for decades to come. However, there are many competing demands on our water systems. Demands to abstract water, demands to discharge into water and demands to enjoy water for recreation.</p><p>Only government can set the overall objectives for water and the timescale for achieving them. Only government can set the broad priorities, balance demands when they compete and coordinate the different elements of the system. And only government can decide who should pay and how much the nation can afford. It is relatively easy to set down a list of objectives. Effective strategic governance and guidance is much, much harder. It requires striking difficult balances, making difficult choices, and taking a long-term view.</p><p>In the report we recommend government in England and government in Wales produce a National Water Strategy. We set out in detail what it should cover, how it should be produced, and how it should be enshrined in statute to ensure consistent direction can be maintained over the long term. I have no illusions that it will be easy to produce: to govern is to choose but to govern is hard. But, as with the 'Great Stink' in 1858, without such direction from the very top, we will not achieve the change we need.</p><p>To connect that high level strategy to action, we need to learn how to manage and plan for water as a system or rather, as a set of regional water systems. Our river basins, aquifers and coasts and the demands upon them constitute complex systems and they need to be managed as such. The water industry, agriculture, transport, local development and land use, and environmental regulation all affect the regional water system and the water catchments that it comprises.</p><p>As many respondents to the Commission observed, we are very poor at system planning for water. There are huge, confusing and overlapping planning processes for water industry processes - the industry produces at least nine plans in a process that costs hundreds of millions. These plans drive water industry investment. But there are no such processes driving action in the other sectors that have an impact on the water system. And some water industry plans are not connected to local government development plans or to local voices or those sectors that also have an impact.</p><p>Opportunities for local government, agriculture, and water companies and other actors to work together are missed. Opportunities, for example, to implement sustainable drainage schemes that avoid storm water overloading our sewers and causing sewage spills into rivers, or opportunities to balance the nutrient loads that cause such unsightly and destructive algae to bloom in water bodies. And heavy engineering - concrete - solutions to environmental problems are pursued despite local preference for more natural solutions.</p><p>Drawing on experience from other countries, the Commission is recommending that regional water system planning bodies are established in England and a national system planner is established in Wales. These would not be advisory bodies or 'talking shops'. Rather, they would take over the role played by the Environment Agency and Natural Resources Wales at present with real authority over water industry investment and real influence over other funding streams that can be directed achieving regional water system objectives, such as agricultural grants.</p><p>To be clear, this would not be the creation of a new level of bureaucracy. Rather it would bring existing functions together on a regional water system basis, in England, and a national basis in Wales. It would streamline existing planning processes (the current water industry processes will be streamlined into two plans - one for drinking water and one for wastewater) and most importantly, it would link local development to water system investment, avoiding the situations we see at present where housing and economic development projects are blocked because the regional water systems cannot cope with them.</p><p>Alongside strategic direction and regional water system planning, the legislative framework for water is key a part of determining the overall framework for the management of water in England and Wales. The current framework has driven great improvements in certain areas. Drinking water and sanitation standards are now world-leading. Bathing water quality has considerably improved. But the current framework is also complex, inconsistent and out of date and highly prescriptive. The Commission has therefore recommended that it be reviewed to bring the legislation up to date, particularly with regard to the Water Framework Directive which sets the high-level objectives for the environmental quality of water bodies.</p><p>The Water Framework Directive sets a target to be achieved by 2027 - at a minimum - and the review will need to consider what targets should be set for after that date. We recommend, however, that the government use the opportunity to consider the scope of the legislation. One area in which we see there is a strong case for broadening the scope of the legislation is to include public health, given the increase in the recreational use of water in recent years. We recommend in England and Wales the Chief Medical Officers are asked to chair task forces to consider how to effectively bring public health into the water quality legislation.</p><p>Over the last 9 months I have heard consistent criticism not of the ambition of the environmental legislation, which must be preserved in any review, but about the inflexibility that requires and drives regulators to focus on narrow, engineering solutions rather than being able to take a broader view of overall environmental and other benefits such as may be found in nature based solutions. We recommend also that the review should aim to make the legislation less prescriptive and provide for 'constrained discretion' to enable regulators and local system planning bodies to take decisions in the round on how best to meet environmental objectives.</p><p>Strategic guidance, systems planning and legislation - they can set the broad framework. But delivering the outcomes we want for water depends most importantly on having not just the right strategy, legislation and plans. It depends crucially on having the right regulators, regulators that command public confidence and industry respect, regulators that have the capacity and the capability to do their job effectively. And, most important in the Commission's view, in the same way as strategic guidance, system planning and legislation, a structure of regulation that can focus on the water system in the round.</p><p>Our assessment is that the current environmental and economic regulators have not achieved what is needed and will not achieve what is needed. There are many reasons for this. It is clear that the Environment Agency has not had the resources, the people, skills, technology to hold the water industry and other sectors that impact the water environment to account. And it is beginning to change I am pleased to say. We're calling for reform of Operator Self Monitoring - moving from water company sampling to digitalised, automated systems - ensuring real-time, accurate data. Crucially, this must sit alongside tightened enforcement of abstraction limits, sludge management, and drinking-water standards.</p><p>And on the economic side, for much of the last 20 years, Ofwat was encouraged to regulate with a lighter touch and to focus on keeping bills down. And it did not have the powers or the capability to supervise the financial structure of much of the industry, which allowed some companies and their owners to take decisions which reflected their private interests but badly damaged both their companies and in the longer term the public interest. We are seeing some of the consequences of that failure to defend the public interest in the news every day. I will return later to this question of how in an industry of private monopoly companies the private interest can be brought into alignment with the public interest and whether the regulator has sufficient powers to ensure that this happens.</p><p>When the water industry was privatised Ofwat was established to protect consumers from monopoly power by setting the prices that the water companies charge, to incentivise investment, and to create proxies for competition through financial incentives to drive efficiency. In line with other privatised utilities, Ofwat's approach to regulation was built around econometric modelling of the notionally efficient company to provide the benchmarks for setting prices and financial incentives and sanctions. And the decades immediately following privatisation, investment and efficiency grew. The quality of treated wastewater and bathing water have improved. There has been a 41% decrease in leakage in England since privatisation, driven particularly in the 1990s.</p><p>But in more recent decades performance of the industry has plateaued as the public goods demanded of the water industry have grown. In response Ofwat has developed and intensified its use of econometric tools and industry wide benchmarks. The Commission recognises the motivation behind this. But our assessment is that this has taken this approach beyond the limits of its effectiveness and, indeed, to a point where it may have become counterproductive in terms of the performance of the industry as a whole and its ability to attract investment.</p><p>In the Commission's view, it is important to have an objective framework for setting prices and incentives based on modelled outputs and based on comparability between companies, this approach alone, no matter how aggressively pursued, cannot drive the improvement of the sector to deliver the public goods that are necessary nor to attract the. There needs to be a fundamental rebalancing of the approach to economic regulation and oversight of water companies towards a closer, judgment-based, supervisory engagement with individual water companies. This will require an equally fundamental shift in capability and also in regulatory culture, which in the Commission's view has become too adversarial on both sides.</p><p>The Commission's report sets out how a new 'duty to supervise' should be enshrined in statute, how a judgement based supervisory approach might be implemented and the expert capability it would need in financing and engineering that would be necessary. We also make several important recommendations as to how the price review process - which should be retained alongside and informed by supervisory engagement - might be simplified and reformed. These include changes to the framework of delivery incentives, the allocation of bill revenues to infrastructure renewal, operational maintenance and enhancement expenditure, to the calculation of the return on capital and debt and to the appeals process.</p><p>While changes to economic regulation are necessary, however, they will not address the fragmented regulatory landscape for the water industry. Water companies' costs, investments, plans and performance are overseen by four regulators at present in England - Ofwat, the Environment Agency, Natural England and the Drinking Water Inspectorate. Each has a different focus, different objectives and different requirements that overlap and are often in tension. The Environment Agency determines much of the industry's investment needs but the industry's revenues are determined by Ofwat. Companies can be sanctioned by both Ofwat and the EA for the same pollution incidents. Funding of maintenance and infrastructure renewal are the responsibility of Ofwat but the environmental consequences of ageing infrastructure are the responsibility of the EA, as we saw from the report that was published last week.</p><p>The regulatory structure at privatisation was set up with separate regulators. As the overlaps have grown and the environmental and other standards have been raised, the need for coordination and resolution of different objectives has grown.</p><p>The Commission has not approached the option of major structural change lightly. It is never an easy option. I am all too aware, after many years in the public service, of the costs and risks of breaking up and reforming institutional structures. These costs and risks go beyond the financial: they include the human costs of organisational change, the deflection of management time and focus, the risk of dropping the ball on key objectives, and the breaking up of internal synergies and the need to create new interfaces between organisations.</p><p>The Commission has looked hard at potential for coordination mechanisms to address the tensions and overlaps we have identified. Our conclusion, however, is that if the primary objective is securing the reset and long-term change that we need in the water sector, we need an integrated regulator for water.</p><p>The Commission recommends, therefore, that in England, Ofwat, the water related environmental protection functions of the EA, the Drinking Water Inspectorate, and the water related function of Natural England, be brought together into a new integrated Regulator for Water. For Wales, which has a different institutional structure, we recommend that the economic regulatory functions now carried out for Wales by Ofwat be transferred to a Welsh economic regulation function located in Natural Resources Wales.</p><p>The new regulator for water will become responsible for Ofwat's current duties and roles to protect consumers. But, in line with its Terms of Reference, the Commission has also looked at the broader arrangements for vulnerable customers and those for consumer redress and consumer advocacy currently carried out by CCW.</p><p>We have to recognise that the cost of producing water and wastewater services is likely to increase over the medium and longer term as the industry has to replace ageing assets, respond to higher environmental and public health standards and continue to adapt to the challenges of rising population growth and climate change. Against that likely background of rising costs and rising bills, there is a need for a stronger safety net for the most vulnerable who are exposed to water poverty. Water companies already operate social tariffs, spreading the cost of supporting vulnerable customers across their customer base. But the effects of higher costs of water in different parts of the country have different impacts and there is already significant variation in bills that vulnerable customers pay, even taking into account local social tariffs.</p><p>It is for government to decide whether and how far to equalise support for the vulnerable in different parts of the country and it is for government to decide to what extent this should be done through water bills as part of a national social tariff, or through other means of support such as the social security system. It is of course for elected government rather than the Commission to decide between those options. The Government has now taken the powers to introduce a national social tariff, and in line with our assessment that stronger support will be needed for the most vulnerable, the Commission recommends that such a tariff be implemented. However, we make no recommendation on the design, the level of support and the degree to which there should be cross subsidy between customers of different water companies. These are highly distributional decisions, and such decisions are not for technocrats but for government to make.</p><p>We have also made a number of recommendations on consumer redress and consumer advocacy. On redress, unlike other regulated sectors, there is no mandatory dispute mechanism for customers. The Commission believes that water company customers should have the protection of a statutory ombudsman as exists, for example, in energy. And given the CCW's expertise in this area, the Commission recommends it be upgraded to become the Ombudsman for Water, with Citizens Advice, which has proved to be a powerful consumer advocate and advisory service for customers in other regulated sectors, taking over the role of consumer advocacy for water customers.</p><p>In addition, changes we have recommended to the water company Price Review process will also allow appeals against the price determination to be brought by consumers as well as by water companies - again as is possible in other regulated sectors.</p><p>Taken as a whole, the changes the Commission proposes should lead to more effective, joined-up regulation and stronger protections for consumers. In the Commission's judgement, if implemented effectively, they will address the shortcomings in regulation that lie at the heart of the poor performance, underinvestment and the failure to protect the public interest that we have seen over recent years.</p><p>Regulation must be a key line of defence to protect the public interest. A system of private regulated monopoly utilities - as I have said - will only work if private interests of water companies and their owners are aligned with the public interest in the production of public goods. That is the job of regulation, economic and environmental, to ensure that alignment so that companies are incentivised to produce public goods and avoid public harms.</p><p>But, taking the sector as a whole, water companies themselves and their owners must bear a large part of the responsibility for the failures we have seen. Water companies are private companies and their owners are entitled to a return on their investment. But those returns must not come at the expense of the public interest. Water companies operate under licence and the public purpose of their operations is inherent in those licences. Sadly, we have over recent decades seen examples in which companies have pursued their short term private interest at the expense of the public interest and of the long term resilience of the company.</p><p>A large number of the responses to the Commission's Call for Evidence expressed disquiet and concern at the inclusion of the profit motives in the provision of water. And I do understand the concerns raised by many about profit in the provision of water and wastewater given some of the experiences we've heard. Some proposed nationalisation or municipalisation or the transfer of for-profit water companies to not-for-profit or similar models. The Commission considered these in line with our Terms of Reference which focus on a privately owned regulated sector and rule out nationalisation or the purchase of companies with public funds for transfer to other ownership models.</p><p>But we also examined the performance of different ownership and operational models, public and private, in other jurisdictions. We published our initial analysis in the Call for Evidence, and we invited respondents to submit further analysis and evidence. We have refined our analysis and have published it in full in the final report. I have to say, on the data and comparable metrics available, the truth is that we did not see evidence of a causal link between ownership models and a range of environmental and other performance indicators.</p><p>We took from this work two conclusions. First, the regulatory model is key to performance and we need to address regulation. Second, where companies are privately owned it is the business model of the owners, the level of return they seek on their investment, their time horizon for that return, their preference for dividends or capital gain and their willingness to invest further in their company for a fair return. Those are the things that make the difference.</p><p>At privatisation it was envisaged that water companies would be owned by long-term investors looking for relatively low risk, low return investments as might be expected form a regulated monopoly utility. Investment vehicles have changed markedly since privatisation. Many investors, including institutional investors, now prefer private, whether listed or unlisted, it remains the case that the industry and the public interest is best served by long term, low risk, low return investors.</p><p>The changes to regulation, particularly to economic regulation, are intended in part to lower regulatory risk and to reduce the variability of returns that deter such investors. The Commission has also recommended that Government make the stability of the regulatory system an objective in the National Water Strategy and that maintaining the investability of the sector becomes one of the duties of new regulator for water.</p><p>But, just as we need to attract longer term investors to the sector with more predictable regulation, we will need to ensure that owners and managers do not act against the public interest and damage the financial resilience of companies.</p><p>So the Commission is recommending giving the new regulator the power where necessary to block changes of ownership, to set gearing levels and, in certain circumstances, to give direction to the ultimate controller of the company. These powers exist in other regulated sectors and they are necessary guardrails in water. We are also recommending making the public purpose of companies clear in the licence condition, bringing company governance in line with the governance code for listed companies and bringing in a statutory for the very senior management cadre, drawing on the experience of the senior managers regime in the financial sector.</p><p>I am, you will be pleased to hear, coming to the end. I hope it will not seem like a Russian novel of a report. The final area that all these changes have to address - from strategic guidance to planning to regulation to company performance - is the health of our water industry infrastructure and of the resilience of our water and wastewater systems.</p><p>We simply do not know the overall health of the system. Ofwat last oversaw a full assessment over 20 years ago. The asset health measures used in price reviews have been backward-looking, measuring past failure rates to determine and fund the amount and the rate of renewal and other capital maintenance necessary to keep the system operating. Much of water industry infrastructure is underground and very difficult to assess and different companies have different ways of assessing asset health. Not all water company assets are mapped.</p><p>We do not know whether enough replacement and renewal has been funded and carried out over the past. But there is strong evidence that we may be considerably behind the game.</p><p>When the Scottish regulator switched from using backward-looking indicators, similar to those Ofwat have used, to a forward-looking in-depth assessment, the conclusion was that there had been material underfunding of capital maintenance. Other countries replace and renew at much faster rates than we have maintained. And, as we heard last week from the Environment Agency, infrastructure failure is a major reason for the pollution incidents we are seeing.</p><p>So, the Commission is recommending that a forward-looking assessment of our infrastructure is carried out and that national resilience standards are developed for water.</p><p>The massive steam pumping engines that filled this engine house operated for over a hundred years and were retired only when steam gave way to diesel and electricity. A couple of weeks ago I visited a much more modern pumping engine hall, just over 50 years old filled with electric pumps that supply drinking water for one third of Londoners. It is a single point of failure for the water supply of all of Canary Wharf. And it is on its last legs. A \\xA3400m project to replace the entire facility has finally been approved and work is about to begin on the replacement. Given the limited space and need to keep the facility operating, it is a hugely complex project that will take at least 7 years.</p><p>I raise this example not merely to contrast the standard of Victorian engineering with its more modern successors, absolutely humbling though that is. It is also an example of the forethought, timescale, planning and funding necessary to ensure that our water infrastructure continues to serve us into the future, and of the dangers of a patch and mend approach.</p><p>I started this speech with the Great Stink of 1858 and the reset it triggered. Change did not happen overnight; it took Bazalgette over 15 years to complete his sewer network and for London's health to be transformed. I hope, following our own Great Stink moment, that the recommendations in the Commission's report will launch the reset that is required. Likewise, change will not happen overnight, and trust will take time to come back. But I very much hope we are now at the beginning of the road.</p><p>Finally, it has been a real privilege to lead this work, and as I conclude I would like to thank the Commission Advisory Group for their help, their insight and support and, most of all, the amazingly committed and hard-working Commission Secretariat team for all they've done.

We'd worked together on a previous project in Beira, which gave us a solid foundation - a shared sense of purpose and familiarity with the city's needs. That allowed us to focus on delivery rather than alignment.</p><p>Ingo Baum: I agree - what stood out was the level of continuity. Often with projects like these, the teams change and you lose momentum. Our team had worked on the first Beira project, and when we moved into the recovery phase, we were able to build on that. The relationships were already there - with each other, and with the government. And that meant we could focus on delivery rather than getting to know each other's systems from scratch.</p><p>Susana Gomes: We weren't locked into rigid roles. We were able to say: What needs to happen now, and who is best placed to do it? And that flexibility was essential. In a post-disaster context, you don't have time to coordinate every detail from headquarters. You need to empower the teams on the ground.</p><p>Q: Navigating institutional differences - from timelines to procedures to risk frameworks - is often a major hurdle in joint operations. How did you work through those differences in this case?</p><p>Ingo Baum: Alignment wasn't about eliminating differences, it was about managing them. The World Bank and KfW have different internal structures, different approval processes. But we didn't try to harmonize everything. Instead, we figured out where we could complement each other. For example, the Bank moved quickly to advance parts of the feasibility study. That allowed KfW to proceed with its own internal steps more efficiently. It was about sequencing, not duplication.</p><p>Susana Gomes: Exactly. It helped that both institutions are outcome-oriented. We didn't get stuck on whose procurement system would be used for which contract. We asked: what's the most effective way to deliver this? Sometimes that meant KfW taking the lead on certain components, sometimes the Bank. What mattered was that we agreed upfront on the big picture - one project, one roadmap, and a shared long-term vision for what we are trying to achieve - and then found practical solutions to get there.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: And we invested time early on to define that shared vision. There were months of technical preparation and design work before implementation began. We set up a single implementation unit, agreed on reporting lines, and held weekly meetings with the government to track progress and solve issues as they emerged. That kind of coordination is intense, but it's what makes co-financing more than just pooled money. It becomes a joint commitment.</p><p>Q: What were the advantages of co-financing this project? Did co-financing enable more ambitious, integrated solutions? How did that play out in the design and delivery of this project?</p><p>Xavier Chavana: In many cities, you see piecemeal solutions: one project addresses drainage, another focuses on green space or flood protection. In Beira, we had the opportunity to design a single, integrated approach. We combined conventional infrastructure like drainage canals and pumping stations with nature-based solutions - restoring mangroves, expanding retention basins, and rehabilitating the Chiveve River ecosystem. That dual approach not only reduced flood risk, it also created co-benefits for biodiversity and community use.</p><p>Susana Gomes: From KfW's side, this integration was very intentional. On behalf of the German government, we've supported green infrastructure in many countries, but the key in Beira was embedding it within a broader system. That required detailed technical coordination. For example, retention basins had to be placed strategically in relation to the urban drainage works. And those decisions couldn't be made in isolation - they depended on shared data, shared design timelines, and constant dialogue between our teams.</p><p>Ingo Baum: It also required a different mindset. You can't design green-grey infrastructure in silos. You have to start with the question: what combination of interventions will reduce risk and support long-term resilience in this specific place? German cooperation through KfW helped the city set up systems for long-term management. For example, we supported a park management unit to maintain new green infrastructure. This wasn't just about building; it was about making sure it could work - and last.</p><p>Q: A challenge we often hear about in development finance is fragmentation-too many uncoordinated efforts. How does co-financing help reduce that and support more coherent efforts, especially from the country's point of view?</p><p>Xavier Chavana: That's a real risk. If each partner runs its own process, the government ends up coordinating between institutions instead of focusing on delivery. From the outset, we made a conscious decision to avoid that. We agreed to work through a single implementation unit housed in the Ministry of Public Works, Housing and Water Resources, and to streamline our engagement with contractors and consultants. In some cases, we even had the same contractor delivering both Bank- and KfW-financed components. That's rare - and it made the project more coherent and efficient.</p><p>Susana Gomes: Many of the government counterparts had worked on earlier phases of the Chiveve project, so we weren't starting from scratch. That institutional memory really helped reduce friction. But more importantly, we were able to build on existing capacity rather than creating something new for the sake of it. That's often the most sustainable way forward.</p><p>Ingo Baum: One of the strengths of co-financing is that it brings more technical expertise to the table - different institutions contribute different skills, and that can really elevate the quality of a project. But it also introduces more complexity in terms of financing and delivery. That complexity only works if the teams - across institutions - can collaborate effectively. The day-to-day decisions, the sequencing, the problem solving - all of that depends on people who trust each other and can work through differences. In the end, coordination isn't just an institutional issue - it's a deeply human one.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: That shared structure also gave local actors more clarity. When different institutions coordinate behind one process, it's easier for implementing partners to engage, plan, and deliver. It reduces confusion and makes the whole project more manageable from the ground up.</p><p>Q: What do we need to get right to unlock more successful co-financing partnerships in the future?</p><p>Ingo Baum: You have to give people room to work. Institutions have their procedures, and that's important - but when the country is facing real challenges, the question isn't Is this a KfW-approved process or a World Bank one? It's: Can we deliver? And to do that, you need people on the ground who are empowered, who know each other, and who are trusted to make decisions. That's what made this work.</p><p>Susana Gomes: This experience showed what's possible when co-financing goes beyond alignment on paper to real collaboration in practice. We weren't just reacting to a crisis - we were helping lay foundations for long-term resilience. That meant thinking not only about what to build, but how to support local capacity to maintain and adapt those solutions in the future.</p><p>Xavier Chavana: Co-financing isn't just about bigger budgets - it's about better outcomes. When it works, it brings together complementary strengths and enables solutions that no one partner could deliver alone.</p><p>(World Bank)</p>", "publisher": "Thai News Service", "instances": ["Xavier Chavana: In many cities, you see piecemeal solutions: one project addresses drainage, another focuses on green space or flood protection.
