The topography helps. The region is surrounded by a horseshoe of hills, the Mount Lofty Ranges, and pierced by a valley, which runs to the Gulf St Vincent. Temperatures rarely hit extreme highs or lows, meaning yields tend to be excellent. <br/>I have come to McLaren Vale to visit some of its green wineries, meet the owners and find out how they are preparing for climate breakdown while acting as the designated driver for my wine-loving husband. <br/>We begin at d'Arenberg, a name familiar to many wine aficionados. The largest biodynamic certified grower of wine grapes in Australia, d'Arenberg is in the centre of McLaren Vale. It is also home to the d'Arenberg Cube, a five-storey multi-use building that rises above the mourv\u00e8dre vines and includes the Singapore Circus restaurant (head chef Jamie Steele grew up in the Lion City and found inspiration in its hawker centres for his dishes), a wine tasting room and the Alternate Realities Museum. <br/>\"McLaren Vale is one of the most sustainable wine regions in Australia,\" confirms d'Arenberg owner, Chester Osborn. \"At least 80 per cent sustainable - maybe not certified or registered, but certainly practising sustainability.\"  <br/>And what does biodynamic farming entail, exactly? I've read that lunar cycles and cow horns are somehow important. <br/>\"Biodynamic doesn't have to be moon related, but there are cow horns with poo involved,\" answers Osborn. \"It's all about microflora - it becomes a living breathing soil and breaks carbon down.\" <br/>Osborn also relies on sheep agistment (having livestock graze on the property), solar power and natural disease control to achieve a balance between environmental sustainability and cutting-edge production techniques.  <br/>Ten kilometres east of d'Arenberg is Gemtree Wines, which runs a \"Being Biodynamic\" tour that starts in its cellar door tasting room, where visitors swirl, smell, sip and spit award-winning wines from the small-batch range.  <br/>We are then guided through the farming, grape-growing and winemaking processes, which have earned Gemtree medals for sustainable practice at the Best of Wine Tourism Awards.  <br/>At the Biodynamic Hut, guests discover how the philosophy is applied in the fields: how sheep replace pesticides to keep weeds under control; how ground quartz prevents fungal infections,  negating the need for chemical fungicides; and how those cow horns, stuffed with manure, restore carbon to the soil.  <br/>At tour's end, our bellies full of cheese and hope for a better world, we leave with a case of first-release albari\u00f1o and head for Paxton Wines, which is just off the main Victor Harbor Road.  <br/>Paxton has pioneered organic grape growing and wine production since 2011. At a tasting in its solar-powered cellar door - a renovated sheep-shearing shed with a vaulted ceiling and seating around a cosy fireplace - we learn that the winery uses only grapes grown on its McLaren Vale estate, which is irrigated with recycled water.  <br/>Paxton is another producer that manages its grapes biodynamically, with a focus on promoting healthy, living soils through the use of natural compost preparation and the removal of synthetic fertilisers. Its bottles are now made of lightweight glass, reducing its carbon footprint in glass production and freight by up to 30 per cent. The bottle labels are made from paper produced from sugar-cane waste and recycled cardboard is used for wine cartons. <br/>A 10-minute drive south of Paxton Wines is the Hither &amp; Yon cellar door, housed in the whitewashed old butcher's shop on Willunga High Street. It is here I meet Malcolm Leask.  <br/>He and his brother, Richard, are producers of highly regarded, small-batch wines (Hither &amp; Yon's 2021 Aglianico won the McLaren Vale's Best Wine of Show 2022 award), often releasing innovative varieties. Hither &amp; Yon was the first wine brand to be certified carbon neutral in South Australia.  <br/>\"We care about our soil - so much so that we didn't want [to locate] the cellar door at our winery, [to avoid] cars driving around our vines and producing emissions,\" says Leask. \"We put our focus on improving our wine through the soil by using a regenerative agriculture model of farming, neither organic nor biodynamic, but following nature's rhythm.\" <br/>The brothers have partnered with nearby Gemtree, which produces their wine, thus entrusting their grapes to like-minded artisans who operate with the lightest of touches. <br/>\"Everything we do is within a small radius, which keeps us super-efficient,\" says Leask. \"Most of the region is [sustainability-minded]. It's what we all get out of bed for every day. We understand, more than anyone, that this region is a beautiful, rare part of the planet [...] and we must look after it.  <br/>\"It's our identity, and what we want for the future generations.\"  <br/>I remember Leask's words as we finish the day with a swim in the crisp waters off Aldinga beach, a 10-minute drive west of his cellar door. <br/>The following day we visit the small and nimble Battle of Bosworth, producer of organically grown and certified wines from family-owned vineyards since 1999 and the first to be certified organic in  the area.  <br/>According to the website, Joch Bosworth, who owns the winery with partner Louise Hemsley-Smith, both of whom live in the stone homestead next door, experiments but remains true to traditional vinification: minimal, natural processing combined with organic, sustainable viticulture. One of his wines is even named Puritan, to reflect the fact it's fresh, unoaked and preservative-free.  <br/>\"Times have certainly changed,\" says Bosworth. \"I remember when it was seen as a negative to have 'organic' written on your label, largely due to them being poorly made. It's different now, farmers are now viticulturalists and winemakers - they know how to make great-tasting organic wine and people are interested in natural products. As the organic wine and biodynamic producers become more serious, more people collaborate with real passion and skills.  <br/>\"Wine evolves.\"  <br/>As does beer. Bosworth also makes Battle of Bosworth Pale Ale, with barley grown in an organically certified paddock in front of the vineyard. He sells the malt-driven, lightly hopped beer to just three local outlets: Victory Hotel (in Sellicks Hill); The Salopian Inn (Main Road, McLaren Vale); and Star of Greece (Port Willunga). <br/>There are an estimated 160 vineyards and almost 100 cellar doors in McLaren Vale and we've just scratched the surface, but there is one more that I want to see before leaving the region. <br/>Angove Family Winemakers is among the leaders in organic and biodynamic viticulture. Minivans full of visitors arrive at its busy cellar door to partake in a variety of tasting options, from single vineyard wines to award-winning spirits, followed by a meal in the restaurant.  <br/>A proper tasting here takes more than an hour and there are plenty of tables and barrels repurposed as seating along the cellar door's veranda to relax at while doing so. The views are of Angove's organic, biodynamic Warboys Vineyard and the verdant hills that border it.  <br/>\"For us, organics is simply about treating the soil as best as we possibly can, no artificial herbicides, pesticides or fertilisers,\" says Richard Angove, who runs the fifth-generation family-owned business. \"If we treat the soil well, we grow grapes with the best flavour and so hopefully our wines taste pure and reflect the place they are grown. <br/>\"Weed control is the biggest challenge in organics but we have totally changed our mindset about weeds. We like them as they promote biodiversity within the vineyard and return vital nitrogen back to the soil for vine nutritional health.\" <br/>Angove's production facilities are in Renmark, a small town 300km east of McLaren Vale, and it is there that it also distils spirits, including Blind Tiger Organic Gin. The label's brandy is produced in old copper pot stills from a base of freshly made wine - including pressings that would otherwise go to waste - and by using the same double distillation techniques Angove's great-grandfather researched during a trip to Cognac, France, in 1925.  <br/>Everywhere you look, McLaren Vale's wine producers are second-guessing what a chaotic future has in store for them.  <br/>\"All wine regions are being affected by climate change, but McLaren Vale has been quick to pivot, and everyone here has started working on future proofing these vines,\" says Samantha Davidson, trade marketing manager at the McLaren Vale Grape Wine &amp; Tourism Association. <br/>\"Other regions haven't been able to do that because they might be so steeped in tradition or scared of change, but McLaren Vale is a hive of talented people who aren't afraid of pushing boundaries, with the vast majority being incredibly in touch with the environment.  <br/>\"We all know the wealth of what we have to work with here - amazing fruit, ancient soil, incredible aspects, proximity to the ocean plays a massive part, and the people - it's a winemaker's playground.\"</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-35cfb83310964b369e705a7d4a0f7986</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:688P-D0W1-DYRW-R199-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1567\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 South China Morning Post Ltd.All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>South China Morning Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"05\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>May 21, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"67\"><className>Business &amp;

Also present at the meeting were over 100 ABAC members, alternate members and staffers from 21 economies in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>On July 26, Frank Ning met with the ABAC Chair, and consulted on key issues with the host economy of APEC, Thailand, delivering positive results.</p><p>On the morning of July 27, Mr. Ning attended a meeting between Vietnamese President Nguyen Xuan Phuc and ABAC members, in which he shared China's economic development achievements and business development of Sinochem Holdings. Later, Ning attended ABAC's opening plenary and expressed views on global economic trends, climate change, renewable energy and food security. In the afternoon, he paid a visit to the Vietnam Economic and Technological Development Zone and had in-depth exchanges with ABAC Vietnam, entrepreneurs and government officials on economic and trade cooperation between the two sides.</p><p>On July 28, Frank Ning chaired the Sustainability Working Group meeting, discussing seven proposals raised. Ning noted that the theme of \"Embrace, Engage, Enable\" proposed by Thailand, the host economy of 2022, well reveals an amicable, interactive and empowering gesture of ABAC. Based on ABAC work program in 2022 and major trends in the Asia-Pacific region, the Sustainability Working Group will continue to work on the three priorities in 2022, namely climate change, renewable energy and food security, with focuses on three areas: \"Building Net-Zero Economy and Promoting Green Recovery in APEC, Advancing Realistic Energy Transition towards Low Carbon in APEC, and Fostering a Sustainable Food System that Ensures Food Security and Safety in APEC.\"</p><p>At the meeting, Frank Ning submitted a proposal on \"Accelerating Chemical Technology Innovation and the Global Low-carbon Transition.\" He stated that the chemical industry is an important part of the modern industrial system, accounting for about 17% of the value of global industrial output. Additionally, as a typical high energy-consuming industry, the chemical industry is also an important source of carbon emissions and faces greater difficulty in cutting emissions. As an important low-carbon solution provider, the chemical industry has launched a series of technological innovation initiatives that not only help the chemical industry save energy and reduce carbon emissions, but also facilitate the low-carbon transformation of other industrial chains through chemical solutions.</p><p>Presently, leading chemical companies such as BASF and Sinochem Holdings are continuously innovating and contributing to low-carbon solutions. Sinochem Holdings in particular is actively exploring and applying energy-saving and carbon-reducing technological measures that are focused on carbon capture, utilization and storage technology (CCUS), carbon dioxide-based chemicals and hydrogen energy. These measures have achieved certain results but require additional industrial and policy support to accelerate the application of advanced technologies.</p><p>Frank Ning raised five recommendations for the low-carbon transformation of the chemical industry. He pointed out that in the process of industrial transformation, APEC governments particularly need to provide financial and policy support. He also expressed that the financial industry should provide diversified support to the chemical industry to facilitate the financing for high capital expenditure (CAPEX) or high-risk projects.</p><p>Up to now, Frank Ning submitted three proposals, \"Advancing Sustainable Low-Carbon Transition for Energy-Intensive Enterprises\", \"Developing Regenerative Agriculture as Part of the Solution to Climate Change\" and \"Accelerating Chemical Technology Innovation and the Global Low-carbon Transition.\" These proposals well encompass the green and low-carbon transition of three major industries: energy, agriculture and chemicals. The proposals were all endorsed, with relevant policy recommendations incorporated into ABAC's Report to APEC Economic Leaders.</p><p>On 29 July, Frank Ning attended the closing plenary. He highlighted the outcomes of the Sustainability Working Group meeting and submitted a letter drafted by the Sustainability Working Group to the APEC Food Security Ministers. Both were endorsed by ABAC members, and contributed to the fulfillment of ABAC Work Program for 2022.</p><p>Source: Sinochem Holdings</p><p>[Category: Events, ESG]</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CNBNWS-0059195880</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CNBNWS2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:666F-YNY1-DXMP-K0R6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">389791</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"928\"/><timeReceived>6:30 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Contify.com All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>China Business News</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 10, 2022 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>CC0002L7Y</classCode><className>SINOCHEM CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS211130 NATURAL GAS EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>NAICS211120 CRUDE PETROLEUM EXTRACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><className>SIC1311 CRUDE PETROLEUM &amp;

We take a bite out of the controversy.</p></bodyText></highlight></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><p>The food on the plate in front of me - a chicken skewer resting on a bed of couscous salad - looks entirely everyday. But it is far from ordinary: this is one of the most cutting-edge meals on the planet.  <br/>At the bistro in Huber's Butchery in Singapore resides the answer to the age-old conundrum of which came first, the chicken or the egg: it no longer matters - neither chicken nor egg are required to produce meat.  <br/>The chicken on my skewer has been grown in a laboratory. Cells painlessly extracted from one living chicken can be divided over and over again, in theory for eternity. The process takes place in a bioreactor, which is similar to a fermentation tank, and which provides the warmth and energy needed for growth. The cells are immersed in nutrients similar to those an animal would eat naturally, including amino acids, fats and vitamins. <br/>For a moment, looking down at the plate, I wonder if I have strayed into Frankenstein territory and may become the monster, sprouting extra arms, or perhaps a beak in a surreal twist of chicken's revenge. <br/>Then I take a bite and it tastes, perhaps unsurprisingly, like chicken: somewhere between the bland flavour of the often freakishly large chicken breasts of factory-farmed birds in the West, and the richer, more umami taste of the corn-fed chickens usually preferred in Asia.  <br/>Singapore was, until June, the only country in the world to have approved the sale of cultivated meat. Good Meat, a subsidiary of California-based Eat Just, was given the green light for its cultivated chicken in December 2020. As of June 21, 2023, the United States has given clearance to Eat Just and Upside Foods, also headquartered in California, to sell their cultivated chicken.  <br/>To date, Singapore has led the way in cultivated meats, the government working to the \"30 by 30\" plan, a strategy designed to build up the island's self-sufficiency. The Covid-19 pandemic, and ongoing animal diseases such as African swine fever, exposed the fragility of the current food ecosystem, especially for a tiny island state such as Singapore that imports 90 per cent of its food.  <br/>The country now aims to sustainably produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030, a goal designed to fit the Singapore Green Plan 2030. <br/>That chefs in Singapore are finding themselves less able to source green produce from local farms since imple\u00admentation of the strategy seems counter-intuitive. But with only 1 per cent of Singapore's land available for farming, there is not enough room for traditional agricultural practices. The \"30 by 30\" plan calls for innovations in food technology such as cultivated meats and indoor, multistorey vertical farms with LED lighting and recirculating aquaculture systems.  <br/>Not everyone is impressed with these developments. <br/>\"Farms in Singapore are closing. I want the vegetables I use in my kitchen to be grown in the ground, in actual soil, so I'm now having to buy from farmers across the border in Malaysia,\" says chef Han Liguang, of one-Michelin-star Labyrinth, which serves classic Singaporean dishes transformed with modern, sometimes whimsical takes. <br/>Would he serve cultivated meat at Labyrinth? A resounding no. <br/>Opinions on laboratory-produced food, especially cultivated meat, are indeed divided. Italy's right-wing government in March backed a bill to ban cultivated meat and other synthetic foods. The proposed ban aims to protect Italian farming, food heritage and the health benefits of a traditional Mediterranean diet. <br/>Despite these detractors, the sector is expanding rapidly. Across the world there were 156 companies making a variety of cultivated meats by the end of 2022, according to non-profit think tank the Good Food Institute.  <br/>Hong Kong-based Avant Meats has completed prototypes of cultivated fish maw and fish fillets, and is building a manufacturing plant in Singapore; Wildtype in the US is working on salmon; and Shiok Meats in Singapore is growing shrimp. <br/>Mosa Meat from the Netherlands, which has partnered with Singapore's Esco Aster, and Aleph Farms in Israel are both specialising in beef. IntegriCulture in Japan is working on foie gras while Higher Steaks in Britain and CellX in mainland China are exploring pork.  <br/>Vow in Australia has even made a meatball from the resurrected flesh of the long-extinct woolly mammoth and expects to be able to serve Japanese quail to restaurants in Singapore this year. <br/>Each company creating cultivated meat has its own proprietary process. At Good Meat, the cells come out like blended chicken, a \"pinkish viscous slush\" as Aaron Yeo, the company's director of operations in Singapore, describes it. Plant proteins are added to provide bulk, but the texture is not quite the same, lacking the fibrous strands of meat. Other companies are working to develop scaffolds so that the cells take on a closer structural resemblance to animal muscle. <br/>But creating these scaffolds is expensive. In fact, the entire process is expensive. When Professor Mark Post of Maastricht University, in the Netherlands, made the first cultivated meat burger back in 2013, it cost US$330,000. At Huber's Butchery, every dish of cultivated chicken, which is priced the same as a dish of regular chicken (about S$18/HK$104), is subsidised by Good Meat.  <br/>The high cost is the main reason that two-and-a-half years after the Singaporean government gave the all-clear to Good Meat, the cultivated chicken is not more widely available.  <br/>\"The biggest challenges are the technical and scientific challenges of scaling up production and bringing down costs to make cultivated meat,\" says Andrew Noyes, vice-president at Eat Just.  <br/>The new factory parent company Good Meat has built in Singapore, with its 6,000-litre bioreactor that is the largest known vessel for avian and mammalian cell culture, should increase scalability and lower manufacturing costs, however.  <br/>Unlike Good Meat, whose Singapore strategy is to introduce the public to cultivated meats in an affordable way, some companies are targeting the high end. Hong Kong gourmet products, such as Avant Meats' fish maw, could turn a profit sooner than everyday meats such as chicken.  <br/>Upside Foods has partnered with chef Dominique Crenn, who is set to become the first in the US to serve their cultivated chicken at her restaurant Bar Crenn. The French-born chef took meat off the menu at all three of her restaurants in 2018, including three-Michelin-star Atelier Crenn in San Francisco.  <br/>\"I thought, 'Woah!', when I first heard about cultivated meat, but if lab-grown chicken helps to make a better world, then that's good. And it tastes great,\" she says. <br/>Partnerships with leading chefs will also help to assuage the public's fears over cultivated meats being \"unnatural\", worries that proponents counter with examples of factory farms, where animals are raised in cramped, unsanitary conditions and loaded with antibiotics and hormones. <br/>\"There's nothing unnatural about cells growing this way - it's actually purer and cleaner than conventional, factory-farmed chicken,\" says Yeo.  <br/>Crenn is not the only chef backing cultivated meats; Good Meats has partnered with Spanish-American chef and restaurateur Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s in the US. Andr\u00e9s is known for his work on sustainability and global food security.  <br/>By 2050, when the United Nations predicts the global population will reach 9.8 billion, global demand for meat is set to nearly double. Animal farming already accounts for 15 to 20 per cent of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions. Finding more environmentally friendly ways to feed the planet is therefore crucial. <br/>A study published in the The Inter\u00ad\u00adnational Journal of Life Cycle Assessment concludes that cultivated meat has the potential to have less environmental impact than conventional meat. It is almost three times more efficient in turning crops into meat than chicken, the most efficient animal. Agricultural land use is low, which also helps to preserve biodiversity, and it emits less nitrogen and other polluting gases. <br/>Cultivated meat production is energy-intensive, however. Bioreactors require a constant temperature and the biotechnological production of culture medium ingredients is energy-hungry. Were a plant to be powered by renewable energy sources, the carbon footprint would be lower than for beef and pork, and comparable to the ambitious benchmark of chicken, the study found.  <br/>Another cutting-edge food technology that has the potential to minimise the need for animal farming is precision fermentation, a process that has been used for the past 50 years to produce antibiotics, vitamins and insulin. In this technique, micro-organisms are programmed to make complex organic molecules, such as proteins.  <br/>A growing array of food is now being made using this process, in particular cow-free dairy products such as milk and ice cream. US-based Helaina is even using precision fermentation to \"brew\" human breast milk in microbes. <br/>Perfect Day, a California-based company that makes dairy products using precision fermentation, first launched animal-free ice creams in Hong Kong in 2021. Its brand, Ice Age!, was backed by Li Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures, and was Asia's first animal-free dairy ice cream.  <br/>It launched Asia's first cow-free milk, Very Dairy, in Singapore in November 2022, and in Hong Kong this summer. It is antibiotic-, hormone-, cholesterol- and lactose-free. <br/>\"As there are no animals used to make our whey protein, we don't have the same level of risk of animal-derived pathogens,\" says Alex Brittain, senior vice-president at Perfect Day.  <br/>It had previously launched in the US before coming East. While Asia, largely through Singapore, has been at the forefront of the development of the cultivated meat market, and many Asia-based companies are innovating with their own cultivated meat products, there are fewer companies here making products through precision fermentation. <br/>Michal Klar, founding partner of Better Bite Ventures, a fund investing in early-stage alternative protein start-ups in Asia-Pacific, says Asia's low-dairy diets may be the reason. <br/>\"In Asia, cultivated meat start-ups are more common and more developed compared with the ones working on precision fermentation. One of the reasons might be that precision fermentation technology is currently mostly used to develop dairy proteins, that is whey and casein. Dairy is generally a smaller category compared with meat in most Asian markets,\" he says. \"India is a notable exception.\"  <br/>Two prominent precision fermentation start-ups in India are Zero Cow Factory and Phyx44. Perfect Day has also set up local manufacturing in India.  <br/>While Asia lags behind in home-grown precision fermentation products, it is proving a leader when it comes to regulations. Finnish food-tech start-up Solar Foods received regulatory approval in Singapore to sell a powder called Solein in September 2022.  <br/>Solein is billed as the world's most sustainable protein, as it effectively makes protein from air rather than soil, bypassing the need for photosynthesis. <br/>To produce Solein, water is split using renewable electricity into hydrogen and oxygen.  <br/>Single-celled organisms (a type of soil bacteria) are fed carbon dioxide, hydrogen and mineral nutrients, to create a biomass. This biomass is dried to a powder, making Solein mainly the desiccated bodies of bacteria. <br/>The first-ever public tasting of Solein took place at Fico restaurant in Singapore in late May. Chef and sustainability advocate Oliver Truesdale-Jutras and chef Mirko Febbrile created a five-course tasting menu, including a Kansai-style ozoni (a miso-based soup enjoyed in the morning on New Year's Day in Japan), smoked pumpkin with Solein salted egg sauce, and Solein ice cream with figs and fig vincotto (a cooked fig liquid). <br/>Febbrile, previously with Michelin-starred Braci, has also launched a Solein chocolate gelato, available at Fico. <br/>Solar Foods CEO and partner Pasi Vainikka likened the tasting event to when the Spanish first encountered the potato in the 16th century in South America. <br/>\"This is the first time in history humankind can be provided with edible calories that at no point require photosynthesis. So far photosynthetic plants have been the only feasible way to receive energy from the sun to feed humankind,\" said Vainikka in a press statement. \"Now, this process can be bypassed in its entirety. That's an absolutely historic moment. A new era begins in the primary production of food and restoring biodiversity.\" <br/>Some environmentalists see technology as the key to protecting nature and improving human well-being. The more radical call for the end of animal farming entirely. Other environmentalists support a return to more traditional, regenerative forms of farming and are wary of technology, particularly when it comes to who controls it.  <br/>Others take a middle path.  <br/>\"We're not trying to replace milk from cows grazing regeneratively,\" says Brittain. \"Our part of the solution - precision fermentation for dairy - needs to come to the fore alongside other solutions, whether that's regenerative agriculture, plant-based options, which have been doing a good job of converting some consumers, or precision fermentation, which feels like it's next in terms of readiness to scale.  <br/>\"Cellular [cultivated meat], depending on which study you read, will likely get to scale and impact in the next eight to 10 years.  <br/>\"But at the heart of all these initiatives is the same driving force: sustainably produced protein. And this requires multiple solutions,\" he says.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-36fef0f599b74817b124fab95cdc0bbf</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68PM-S5P1-DYRW-R0M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-07-15</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2256\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 South China Morning Post Ltd.All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>South China Morning Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"07\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>July 16, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"50\"><className>Business &amp;

The State of Finance for Nature Report, compiled by UNEP, the World Economic Forum and the Economics of Land Degradation Initiative, says that increasing investments in habitat protection is key to hastening green growth and averting the spread of disease-causing pathogens. According to the report, an annual investment of 536 billion dollars is required between now and 2050 to help plug a 4.1 trillion dollars financing gap that could derail the realization of a low-carbon and sustainable future. </p><p>\"If we do not sufficiently finance nature-based solutions, we will impact the capacities of countries to make progress on other vital areas such as education, health and employment,\" said Inger Andersen, UNEP executive director, at a virtual meeting. Andersen said that biodiversity loss alone is costing the global economy 10 percent of its output annually, adding that governments and industry should invest in ecosystem restoration whose spin-off effects include improved human health, food security and shared prosperity. The report says that fiscal incentives are required to unlock capital flows towards nature-based interventions geared towards promoting climate resilience and creation of green jobs. It says that investments in reforestation, landscapes restoration and enhanced conservation of marine life will directly benefit communities through food and water security, disaster mitigation and improved health. The report says that more than half of total global GDP is dependent on nature, adding that increasing investments in regenerative agriculture and peatlands conservation is a prerequisite to sustain growth and combat pollution. It says that a radical transformation in production and consumption systems is urgent to halt the depletion of vital ecosystems that has exposed communities to climatic shocks, hunger, poverty and infectious diseases. \"In order to ensure that humanity does not breach the safety limits of the planetary boundaries, we need a fundamental shift in mindset, transforming our relationship with nature,\" says the report. It says that government policies related to trade, taxation combined with private sector investments should place a premium on nature protection in order to realize sustainability. The report recommends tax waivers in order to unlock public and private sector investments in nature-based solutions to the climate crisis, pollution and habitat loss.

The rising temperatures and frequency of floods and droughts is threatening agriculture and fishery around the world, with climate experts warning of \"heatflation\" - higher food prices driven by rising temperatures and smaller harvests. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Experts said that there are measures that countries across the world can adopt to mitigate the impact of climate change on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/food-and-agriculture\">food production</url>. </p><p>\"Even small changes in climatic conditions can result in large gains or losses in crop yields and production quantities,\" said Aurelia Britsch, director of climate risk at Sustainable Fitch, the sustainable finance research unit of Fitch Ratings, in written comments to the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Post</emphasis>. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge\">SCMP Knowledge</url>, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team. </p><p>Rising temperatures are already forcing rice farmers in southern China, one of the country's main rice-growing regions, to shift to higher latitudes, while the fast-warming oceans are affecting fish species diversity in the East and South China Sea. </p><p>As temperatures trend upwards in China, combined with increased frequency and intensification of droughts, it will have a detrimental effect on rice yields in southern and eastern China, by limiting photosynthesis and lowering pollen production, according to a report published last November by Fitch Solutions. </p><p>Higher temperatures and decreasing precipitation can also cause soil fertility to decline and lead to soil salinisation - accumulation of soluble salts of sodium, magnesium and calcium - which is detrimental to rice production, the report added. </p><p>The shift in rice production further north in China is expected to continue over the coming decades, said Britsch, adding that she expects the Chinese government to issue more support targeting food security. </p><p>The situation will be worsened by decreasing rainfall. Agriculture is the most water-intensive industrial sector in China, consuming around 60 per cent of national water withdrawal. </p><p>The United Nations' Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change estimated that China may face more groundwater depletion due to climate change. Less rain and hotter weather will increase the need for crop irrigation while the country might face more water scarcity, the panel noted. </p><p>The warming temperatures are also affecting other cash crops globally. Rising temperatures will reduce the land suitable for growing coffee by up to 50 per cent by 2050, according to a 2014 study published in the journal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Climatic Change</emphasis>. </p><p>By 2040, 40 per cent of global cotton-growing regions are projected to experience a decrease in growing seasons due to rising heat, according to a report produced by Cotton 2040, an initiative working for a more sustainable and climate-resilient cotton industry. </p><p>In fishery, scientists have called for immediate action over the next 10 years to prevent irreparable damage to Asia's key oceans due to rising ocean temperatures and overfishing. </p><p>If global temperature rises by 2 degrees Celsius by 2050, the South China Sea, one of the most important fishing areas in the west Pacific, in terms of productivity and economic value, is likely to experience significant declines in key commercial fish species, according to a research report commissioned by Hong Kong-based ADM Capital Foundation and published last year. In such a scenario, annual revenue losses are estimated in excess of US$10 billion. </p><p>\"Under certain climate change scenarios, seafood species that are mainstays of the Hong Kong seafood market, such as groupers and threadfin breams, could be reduced to a fraction of their present population by the end of the century - if not driven completely to extinction,\" said Rashid Sumaila, professor at the University of British Columbia that conducted the research. </p><p>\"This is especially the case in the tropical waters of the South China Sea, where many fish species are already facing the limits of their heat tolerance,\" he added. </p><p>Experts said measures like farm insurance schemes can help farmers become financially resilient and allow them to bounce back from extreme weather events. Diversifying production towards more drought-resistant staples could also soften supply shocks under difficult weather. </p><p>Farmers can also limit the negative impact of climate change on crop yields by adapting regenerative agriculture to reverse the ongoing soil degradation, said Britsch from Sustainable Fitch. This approach to farming involves practicing recycling farm waste, crop rotation as well as protecting water resources and biodiversity. </p><p>As agriculture and fishery are responsible for nearly 20 per cent of global emissions, it is also important that they reduce their carbon footprints, experts said. The main solutions for mitigating emissions include investing in halting deforestation, investing in innovation such as agritech, animal tech, alternative proteins and vertical farming. </p><p>\"Temperature increases cannot be limited simply by reducing energy-related emissions; cutting emissions from the global food sector will also be a key element of a journey to net zero,\" said Elizabeth Curmi, director and global thematic analyst at Citi Global Insights. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2022.

The cells are immersed in nutrients similar to those an animal would eat naturally, including amino acids, fats and vitamins. </p><p>For a moment, looking down at the plate, I wonder if I have strayed into Frankenstein territory and may become the monster, sprouting extra arms, or perhaps a beak in a surreal twist of chicken's revenge. </p><p>Then I take a bite and it tastes, perhaps unsurprisingly, like chicken: somewhere between the bland flavour of the often freakishly large chicken breasts of factory-farmed birds in the West, and the richer, more umami taste of the corn-fed chickens usually preferred in Asia. </p><p>Singapore was, until June, the only country in the world to have approved the sale of cultivated meat. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/commodities/article/3162328/lab-grown-meat-start-eat-just-backed-hong-kong-billionaire-li\">Good Meat, a subsidiary of California-based Eat Just</url>, was given the green light for its cultivated chicken in December 2020. </p><p>As of June 21, 2023, the United States<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/united-states-canada/article/3224943/us-approves-lab-grown-chicken-sale\">has given clearance to Eat Just and Upside Foods</url>, also headquartered in California, to sell their cultivated chicken. </p><p>To date, Singapore has led the way in cultivated meats, the government working to the \"30 by 30\" plan, a strategy designed to build up the island's self-sufficiency. </p><p>The Covid-19 pandemic, and ongoing animal diseases such as African swine fever, exposed the fragility of the current food ecosystem, especially for a tiny island state such as Singapore that imports 90 per cent of its food. </p><p>The country now aims to sustainably produce 30 per cent of its nutritional needs by 2030, a goal designed to fit the Singapore Green Plan 2030. </p><p>That chefs in Singapore are finding themselves less able to source green produce from local farms since imple\u00admentation of the strategy seems counter-intuitive. But with only 1 per cent of Singapore's land available for farming, there is not enough room for traditional agricultural practices. </p><p>The \"30 by 30\" plan calls for innovations in food technology such as cultivated meats and indoor, multistorey vertical farms with LED lighting and recirculating aquaculture systems. </p><p>Not everyone is impressed with these developments. </p><p>\"Farms in Singapore are closing. I want the vegetables I use in my kitchen to be grown in the ground, in actual soil, so I'm now having to buy from farmers across the border in Malaysia,\" says chef Han Liguang, of one-Michelin-star restaurant Labyrinth, which serves classic Singaporean dishes transformed with modern, sometimes whimsical takes. </p><p>Would he serve cultivated meat at Labyrinth? A resounding no. </p><p>Opinions on laboratory-produced food, especially cultivated meat, are indeed divided. Italy's right-wing government in March backed a bill to ban cultivated meat and other synthetic foods. </p><p>The proposed ban aims to protect Italian farming, food heritage and the health benefits of a <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3138690/how-mediterranean-diet-promotes-brain-health-and-lowers\">traditional Mediterranean diet</url>. </p><p>Despite these detractors, the sector is expanding rapidly. Across the world there were 156 companies making a variety of cultivated meats by the end of 2022, according to non-profit think tank the Good Food Institute. </p><p>Hong Kong-based <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/article/3097677/hong-kong-protein-alternatives-start-eyes-juicy-cut-sector-forecast-reach\">Avant Meats</url> has completed prototypes of cultivated fish maw and fish fillets, and is building a manufacturing plant in Singapore; Wildtype in the US is working on salmon; and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/3075109/how-singapore-start-ups-sustainable-seafood-grown-stem-cells\">Shiok Meats in Singapore is growing shrimp</url>. </p><p>Mosa Meat from the Netherlands, which has partnered with Singapore's Esco Aster, and Aleph Farms in Israel are both specialising in beef. IntegriCulture in Japan is working on foie gras, while Higher Steaks in Britain and CellX in mainland China are exploring pork. </p><p>Vow in Australia has even made <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/europe/article/3215180/massive-woolly-mammoth-meatball-unveiled-netherlands\">a meatball from the resurrected flesh of the long-extinct woolly mammoth</url> and expects to be able to serve Japanese quail to restaurants in Singapore this year. </p><p>Each company creating cultivated meat has its own proprietary process. At Good Meat, the cells come out like blended chicken, a \"pinkish viscous slush\" as Aaron Yeo, the company's director of operations in Singapore, describes it. </p><p>Plant proteins are added to provide bulk, but the texture is not quite the same, lacking the fibrous strands of meat. </p><p>Other companies are working to develop scaffolds so that the cells take on a closer structural resemblance to animal muscle. </p><p>But creating these scaffolds is expensive. In fact, the entire process is expensive. When <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/world/article/1294590/franken-meat-fails-taste-test-worlds-first-stem-cell-grown-burger\">Professor Mark Post of Maastricht University, in the Netherlands, made the first cultivated meat burger</url> back in 2013, it cost US$330,000. </p><p>At Huber's Butchery, every dish of cultivated chicken, which is priced the same as a dish of regular chicken (about S$18/US$13.60), is subsidised by Good Meat. </p><p>The high cost is the main reason that, two-and-a-half years after the Singaporean government gave the all-clear to Good Meat, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3212497/lab-grown-meat-slow-start-singapore-fish-maw-races-chicken-profitability\">the cultivated chicken is not more widely available</url>. </p><p>\"The biggest challenges are the technical and scientific challenges of scaling up production and bringing down costs to make cultivated meat,\" says Andrew Noyes, vice-president at Eat Just. </p><p>The new factory parent company Good Meat has built in Singapore, with its 6,000-litre bioreactor that is the largest known vessel for avian and mammalian cell culture, should increase scalability and lower manufacturing costs, however. </p><p>Unlike Good Meat, whose Singapore strategy is to introduce the public to cultivated meats in an affordable way, some companies are targeting the high end. </p><p>Hong Kong gourmet products, such as Avant Meats' fish maw, could turn a profit sooner than everyday meats such as chicken. </p><p>Upside Foods has partnered with chef <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/2175767/netflix-chefs-table-star-dominique-crenn-earns-three-michelin\">Dominique Crenn</url>, who is set to become the first in the US to serve their cultivated chicken at her restaurant Bar Crenn. </p><p>The French-born chef took meat off the menu at all three of her restaurants in 2018, including three-Michelin-star Atelier Crenn in San Francisco. </p><p>\"I thought, 'Woah!', when I first heard about cultivated meat, but if lab-grown chicken helps to make a better world, then that's good. And it tastes great,\" she says. </p><p>Partnerships with leading chefs will also help to assuage the public's fears over cultivated meats being \"unnatural\", worries that proponents counter with examples of factory farms, where animals are raised in cramped, unsanitary conditions and loaded with antibiotics and hormones. </p><p>\"There's nothing unnatural about cells growing this way - it's actually purer and cleaner than conventional, factory-farmed chicken,\" says Yeo. </p><p>Crenn is not the only chef backing cultivated meats; Good Meats has partnered with Spanish-American chef and restaurateur Jos\u00e9 Andr\u00e9s in the US. Andr\u00e9s is known for his work on sustainability and global food security. </p><p>By 2050, when the United Nations predicts the global population will reach 9.8 billion, global demand for meat is set to nearly double. Animal farming already accounts for 15 to 20 per cent of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p>Finding more environmentally friendly ways to feed the planet is therefore crucial. </p><p>A study published in the The Inter\u00ad\u00adnational Journal of Life Cycle Assessment concludes that cultivated meat has the potential to have less environmental impact than conventional meat. </p><p>It is almost three times more efficient in turning crops into meat than chicken, the most efficient animal. Agricultural land use is low, which also helps to preserve biodiversity, and it emits less nitrogen and other polluting gases. </p><p>Cultivated meat production is energy-intensive, however. Bioreactors require a constant temperature and the biotechnological production of culture medium ingredients is energy-hungry. </p><p>Were a plant to be powered by renewable energy sources, the carbon footprint would be lower than for beef and pork, and comparable to the ambitious benchmark of chicken, the study found. </p><p>Another cutting-edge food technology that has the potential to minimise the need for animal farming is precision fermentation, a process that has been used for the past 50 years to produce antibiotics, vitamins and insulin. </p><p>In this technique, micro-organisms are programmed to make complex organic molecules, such as proteins. </p><p>A growing array of food is now being made using this process, in particular cow-free dairy products such as milk and ice cream. US-based Helaina is even using precision fermentation to \"brew\" human breast milk in microbes. </p><p>Perfect Day, a California-based company that makes dairy products using precision fermentation, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3119324/li-ka-shing-backed-start-perfect-day-launches-asias-first-animal\">first launched animal-free ice creams in Hong Kong in 2021</url>. Its brand, Ice Age!, was backed by Li Ka-shing's Horizons Ventures, and was Asia's first animal-free dairy ice cream. </p><p>It launched Asia's first cow-free milk, Very Dairy, in Singapore in November 2022, and in Hong Kong this summer. It is antibiotic-, hormone-, cholesterol- and lactose-free. </p><p>\"As there are no animals used to make our whey protein, we don't have the same level of risk of animal-derived pathogens,\" says Alex Brittain, senior vice-president at Perfect Day. </p><p>It had previously launched in the US before coming East. While Asia, largely through Singapore, has been at the forefront of the development of the cultivated meat market, and many Asia-based companies are innovating with their own cultivated meat products, there are fewer companies in the region making products through precision fermentation. </p><p>Michal Klar, founding partner of Better Bite Ventures, a fund investing in early-stage alternative protein start-ups in Asia-Pacific, says Asia's low-dairy diets may be the reason. </p><p>\"In Asia, cultivated meat start-ups are more common and more developed compared with the ones working on precision fermentation. </p><p>\"One of the reasons might be that precision fermentation technology is currently mostly used to develop dairy proteins, that is whey and casein. Dairy is generally a smaller category compared with meat in most Asian markets,\" he says. \"India is a notable exception.\" </p><p>Two prominent precision fermentation start-ups in India are Zero Cow Factory and Phyx44. Perfect Day has also set up local manufacturing in India. </p><p>While Asia lags behind in home-grown precision fermentation products, it is proving a leader when it comes to regulations. Finnish food-tech start-up Solar Foods received regulatory approval in Singapore to sell a powder called Solein in September 2022. </p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/asia/southeast-asia/article/3210041/singapore-trial-protein-made-thin-air-could-solve-worlds-food-problem\">Solein is billed as the world's most sustainable protein, as it effectively makes protein from air</url> rather than soil, bypassing the need for photosynthesis. </p><p>To produce Solein, water is split using renewable electricity into hydrogen and oxygen. </p><p>Single-celled organisms (a type of soil bacteria) are fed carbon dioxide, hydrogen and mineral nutrients, to create a biomass. This biomass is dried to a powder, making Solein mainly the desiccated bodies of bacteria. </p><p>The first-ever public tasting of Solein took place at Fico restaurant in Singapore in late May. Chef and sustainability advocate Oliver Truesdale-Jutras and chef Mirko Febbrile created a five-course tasting menu, including a Kansai-style <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">ozoni</emphasis> (a miso-based soup enjoyed in the morning on New Year's Day in Japan), smoked pumpkin with Solein salted egg sauce, and Solein ice cream with figs and fig <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">vincotto</emphasis> (a cooked fig liquid). </p><p>Febbrile, previously with Michelin-starred Braci, has also launched a Solein chocolate gelato, available at Fico. </p><p>Solar Foods chief executive officer and partner Pasi Vainikka likened the tasting event to when the Spanish first encountered the potato in the 16th century in South America. </p><p>\"This is the first time in history humankind can be provided with edible calories that at no point require photosynthesis. So far photosynthetic plants have been the only feasible way to receive energy from the sun to feed humankind,\" said Vainikka in a press statement. \"Now, this process can be bypassed in its entirety. </p><p>\"That's an absolutely historic moment. A new era begins in the primary production of food and restoring biodiversity.\" </p><p>Some environmentalists see technology as the key to protecting nature and improving human well-being. The more radical call for the end of animal farming entirely. </p><p>Other environmentalists support a return to more traditional, regenerative forms of farming and are wary of technology, particularly when it comes to who controls it. </p><p>Others take a middle path. </p><p>\"We're not trying to replace milk from cows grazing regeneratively,\" says Brittain. \"Our part of the solution - precision fermentation for dairy - needs to come to the fore alongside other solutions, whether that's regenerative agriculture, plant-based options, which have been doing a good job of converting some consumers, or precision fermentation, which feels like it's next in terms of readiness to scale. </p><p>\"Cellular [cultivated meat], depending on which study you read, will likely get to scale and impact in the next eight to 10 years. </p><p>\"But at the heart of all these initiatives is the same driving force: sustainably produced protein. And this requires multiple solutions,\" he says. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2023. South China Morning Post Publishers Ltd.

With a global vision, they stand at the forefront of the times ready to fully commit. As a group with a strong sense of motivation, young Chinese people accept and respond the quickest and strongest to the world's trending schools of thought. Some of China's Generation Zers have begun to practice the tenets of their \"global citizen\" identity and use their thought processes and actions to influence the society.<br/><br/>The Global Times has therefore launched a series of introductory stories to China's Gen Zers who are concerned with different global topics, such as environmental protection, equality, and employment issues, and invites them to share their stories, sentiments, and ideas on social media platforms.<br/><br/>In this first installment, we met two vloggers who care about global environmental issues and use their own observations and examples to awaken people's awareness on the problem of food waste and how to live a more sustainable life.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Su Yige Photo: Courtesy of Su</p><p>Su Yige buried her broken phone case into the earth to observe if it could really be organically decomposed as advertised.\u00a0<br/><br/>The phone case, like many others things she owns and uses in her life, is what she hopes to leave little trace on the Earth, such as her bamboo toothbrush, clothing bag, or homemade washing powder.<br/><br/>The 24-year-old has adopted an eco-minimalist lifestyle for years. Since 2020, she has been sharing her ideas and tips online, which have received much positive feedback, with other people joining the sustainable living team.<br/><br/>\"What I am doing now is sharing environmental protection awareness tips as a hobby. Just like how everyone nowadays is talking about camping - I will start a discussion on sustainable living, which is not stressful and extreme, and I will take it as a pleasant thing,\" she told the Global Times.<br/><br/>\"In many cases loving yourself and loving the Earth are in line with each other, which doesn't require sacrifice,\" Su said.<br/><br/>Skillful, creative and funny<br/><br/>The online community \"Traceless Life\" created by Su has gathered 34,000 net users in the last two years, who would share tips or promote ideas on how to live sustainably.<br/><br/>In a recent post, the group members were discussing how to reuse excessive mooncake packaging after the just concluded Mid-Autumn Festival. \"It always makes me anxious seeing these boxes,\" one said. \"You could use it to keep socks,\" another suggested.<br/><br/>Su also has a vlogging channel, which has attracted around 59,000 subscribers on China's YouTube-like platform Bilibili. In a video posted in July, she explained how she managed to deal with \"eco-anxiety.\" She also talked about whole food and repurposing used clothes in some of her latest uploads.<br/><br/>She has received mixed feedback. Some people have confessed that Su's videos have somewhat changed their lifestyles.<br/><br/>But Su admitted she was not out to influence other people when she began to share about her lifestyle. \"Nowadays many people are living a stressful life and find themselves without a purpose. I just provide another way of life,\" she said.<br/><br/>Many of the items in her home in Shanghai are second-handed - from tables to cups, and even a small plant. \"I think environmental protection is a very personal and high-quality way of life,\" she said.<br/><br/>Many people would ask why environmentalists choose this way of life and how far they are willing to go. When reflecting on this question, Su found a small part of it stems from her reverence for nature, but mostly, it is because \"environmental protection is very interesting.\"<br/><br/>\"Moreover, it can help me save money, live healthier, and gain a better understanding of nature. So that is how I live, how I am happy about my lifestyle,\" she said. \"Environmental protection should be people-centered, instead of living as a slave to materials.\"<br/><br/>China has announced its aim to peak carbon dioxide emissions before 2030 and to achieve carbon neutrality before 2060, and has strived to meet the target by taking various measures. As the media and governments frequently mention phrases such as \"green development\" and \"low carbon,\"\u00a0 awareness on environmental issues is also rising among many people, especially the young generation.<br/><br/>According to the report by Vogue Business in early September, up to 54 percent of China's Gen Z consumers believe that they have a relatively clear and accurate understanding of the concept of \"sustainability.\" \"As a positive, optimistic, and responsible generation, Gen Z is the most individualistic and most concerned group about the planet and the environment,\" Vogue said.</p><p>Furnitures Su Yige found in second-hand market Photo: Courtesy of Su</p><p><br/>A habit and a hobby<br/><br/>Su learned about zero waste concepts when she was living and studying in Toronto. She would often visit local farmers' markets and pick up second-hand items.\u00a0<br/><br/>Because of her lifestyle, some local people would ask Su if she was Japanese. That was when Su realized there was a stereotype. She also began to wonder how far environmental protection was from most Chinese people's daily lives.\u00a0<br/><br/>Long before knowing about the term \"eco-minimalism,\" the lifestyle had been a part of her life while she was growing up.<br/><br/>Su's family from the small and clean costal city Weihai in East China's Shandong Province, has always been frugal.\u00a0<br/><br/>In high school, Su used to have a little secret: She would check all the faucets were turned off one by one before going to sleep.<br/><br/>These actions are tiny, but the concept behind them deeply ingrained in Su. \"No matter whether you are poor or rich, wastage is disgraceful,\" she learned.<br/><br/>\"My parents do not understand carbon neutrality, neither do they work in fields related to environmental protection and public welfare. They just made it a habit to not waste things in life.

The one-time travel journalist's art practice runs in tandem with her farming duties and is based on her close observation of the natural environment. Her works are exhibited widely and housed in the M+ Sigg Collection and the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. <br/>Laurent Gutierrez has a background in architecture and is a professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University's School of Design. In 1997, a year after moving to Hong Kong from France, he co-founded MAP Office with Val\u00e9rie Portefaix. A studio practice involved in projects incorporating both architecture and the visual arts, MAP Office has the distinction of being the only maker to have represented Hong Kong in both the art and the architecture Venice biennales. In 2021, MAP Office announced that it would set up a self-sustainable residency called MAP Ocean on the island of Ishigaki, in Japan. Portefaix moved there last year, and Gutierrez, who remains in Hong Kong, co-founded R-Farm, a regenerative farm about a 15-minute drive from Sangwoodgoon that is focused on growing vegetables for the local community. <br/>Earlier this year, during a brief lull in between harvesting and sowing, Lo and Gutierrez sat down to discuss the joys and tribulations of being artist-farmers in Hong Kong. The following is an excerpt of the discussion conducted at SangWood KidsClub, an educational farm affiliated with Sangwoodgoon at a beautifully converted Hakka-style farmhouse in Yuen Long. <br/>Natalie: \"I am glad to have a chance to find out what you are doing and to tell you what we are doing. I was surprised when I found out that you are also farming here. We probably have different reasons for doing it. Can you tell me yours?\" <br/>Laurent: \"I often associate it with age and consciousness. In the farm, we have three partners, I am the youngest, not that I am going to tell you my age [laughs]. My oldest friend in Hong Kong [Christophe Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my], who I have known for 27 years, has always been into these things. He is an architect and an entomologist. Two years ago, I was teaching a course on biodiversity and design and I contacted him about it. He said, 'I have no time for your project. Biodiversity doesn't need design anyway. And on top of that, I'm planning to do a regenerative farming project.' I went to see him and chatted to him about how we can contribute to the idea of regenerative agriculture - farming in a holistic way that returns nutrients to the soil. For him, as an architect, building didn't make sense any more. A third partner, John Tang, also an architect, joined the project. John, a bit older than us, was doing amazing buildings in Hong Kong and mainland China, but maybe he didn't feel it was meaningful enough in addressing the crises we are facing. So that's why I say it comes with age, because maybe you need to reach a certain maturity to want to reinvent yourself as something else and to act upon essential commitments for the planet.\" <br/>Natalie: \"For us, the social movement was the entry point. We were in the anti-high-speed-rail protest movement and we were hoping to reform society. Then after the movement was over, the longer journey turned out to be the reformation of ourselves. It sounds old-fashioned, but that's what it has been. We are in a collective and we have seen how each one has grown. And we have learned to work with each other. For example, if we're doing a task, we know we'll have different opinions, especially on how we engage with nature. We have a lot of fire ants in Hong Kong. In the beginning, some of us would say they were harmful to our practice and we had to get rid of them. Others would say they had lives, too, and we should keep them, and so on. Sometimes the conflicts would explode but it's not common because we are quite peaceful. And to me, maybe because of my background as a journalist, I feel I am also an observer. Two years ago, on the 10th anniversary of the farm, I made an hour-long video called The Days Before the Silent Spring and recorded how members of the team felt about farming and how it had changed them. Making a record is one way I see my artistic practice. But Mr Yuen, our sifu, who taught us how to farm, asked me this question at the time: 'Why do you think you are so important that this all needs recording?' Maybe it's not very significant to other people.\" <br/>Laurent: \"One importance is to record all this knowledge. Traditional knowledge of farming is disappearing globally. It is important to preserve it, to record it and to make sure that this is transmitted [partly because the old ways of farming were more ecological]. So that's why you and I both have educational activities on our farms. The goal of farming is obviously to grow vegetables, but also to grow better human beings.\" <br/>Natalie: \"We try to speak to the public about food ethics and sufficiency. But when we look at reality, I feel conflicted. The way we farm is privileged. For example, last year we had some bad harvests and didn't have enough produce for customers. In the past, we might have had 40 to 50 packages [of mixed vegetables] a week to sell to customers. It wasn't a lot but it covered our rent. But sometimes we would have only 20 packages a week even though we tried very hard. I'm not on the farm full time. I am doing exhibitions. I am starting a full-time, paid PhD partly to get some financial stability. It's embarrassing when farmers in places like India commit suicide due to being overwhelmed by debt. We know what farming could mean for us: to be independent, to say how you can live on your own terms. But as an individual I know I won't solve any problems. That's why in my artwork I am always debating with my own self. In Hong Kong, we try hard, but in reality bad things still happen. I feel hopeless sometimes.\" <br/>Laurent: \"I haven't found a way to translate the sensibility of farming into an artistic format yet, but it is a similar type of process. Farming is a form of engagement and the sharing of values. It is also an attempt to reorganise society. Among the most important needs for an individual is obviously how you sustain yourself, feed yourself and your family. Historically, the invention of the state matched the invention of agriculture. And when food supply is delocalised - like in Hong Kong - food sovereignty becomes important. If people start to have food sovereignty, society and relationships become less hierarchical. In Hong Kong, it is almost an impossible dream because the gap between imports and what we produce is so big, but nevertheless, you can start to engage and bring in the conversation. In fact, if politics is a way to engage and view society, I will say farming is a political act.\" <br/>Natalie: \"How we see it is getting back to basics: a less capitalistic way of how society operated in the old days, [one] based more on equal exchanges. We also consider how we cooperate with others - institutions, companies and our customers. Who are they and are they actually against our beliefs? Are we just greenwashing together?\" <br/>Laurent: \"I remember during the Occupy movement of 2014, there was a garden that Occupiers set up below a Lennon Wall. The new generation don't want to go back to a village type of life, but a big issue for young people in Hong Kong, Japan and elsewhere is whether they will live more miserably than their parents and their grandparents. Do I get myself a bulls**t job, live in the city and not be able to afford a decent life? So, 2014 was the tip of the iceberg. The garden, the Lennon Wall represented the same logic: a space for claiming something that you feel is right.\" <br/>Natalie: \"It's hard in Hong Kong for people to grow their own food, and farming is tough. When I first got into farming I was pretty fit because I had always exercised and always liked hiking. But I was exhausted. You may think of the perfect model of a farmer - like getting up early, having healthy food, having routine. Well, that's the projection. We try to achieve that.\" <br/>Post Mag: What are you growing? <br/>Natalie: \"We are planting cabbage, broccoli, carrots, lettuce, beetroots, gai lan and snow peas. We have tried two kinds of local [heirloom] rice varieties including one called lo su ngar [rat's teeth] but it is very hard to harvest because the stalks are very tall. It's like a messy hair day, especially after a storm. We will keep growing the Taiwanese and Indonesian strains though.\" <br/>Laurent: \"All sorts of local and non-local vegetables. Soon we will move to cucumbers and green beans. There are so many possibilities to make things wrong. The goal in farming is not to make things right; it is to remove what makes things wrong. Hong Kong is OK when it comes into season. We can almost do three seasons [of farming], though when you are in the field in the summer and it's 35 degrees you feel it!\" <br/>Natalie: \"Attitudes have changed. Friends who weren't interested in farming are now keen to understand more. To them, the [anti-high-speed-rail] movement had nothing to do with them. But after the last three years, how they see the institutional system, how cynical and ridiculous it is, they want to find their own path.\"  <br/>Laurent: \"I have many mainland students whose parents were in lengthy lockdowns in Chinese cities and they had no food. So there was a lot of interest in subsistence farming among those students. We always have the possibility of a food crisis here. We almost experienced it with panic buying during the pandemic.\"   <br/>For more information, visit @sangwoodgoon and @r_farmhk.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-c6f2b345399a492c9ab009f5c531ac0a</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:67T8-7BD1-JC8V-12GC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1629\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 South China Morning Post Ltd.All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>South China Morning Post</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"03\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>March 19, 2023 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Transportation Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RTYzRTk5RDVBQkQ2NDcwQzk2NTU3ODQ5OEE3NDlBNzk7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>Highspeed Rail</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6RDk1MzI4MDYxOEUwNEU5REIwMEQ2QkY2RDM3NkU0NzU7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NjVENDlFMjM1NURFNEQwREI3MkRDMDE0RjQxMDUxMDQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKTL</classCode><className>ARCHITECTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009VC0</classCode><className>ARTISTS &amp;

The Russian invasion of Ukraine has further disrupted supply chains and brought spikes in food and fuel prices.\u00a0</p><h>A region at risk</h><p>The devastation caused by efforts to control the spread of Covid-19 across the Asia-Pacific region is now well documented. At least 90 million people have likely fallen into extreme poverty, and more than 150 million and 170 million people are under the poverty lines of US$3.20 and $5.50 a day, respectively. </p><p/><p>The pandemic drove home the consequences of uneven progress on the SDGs and exposed glaring gaps in social protection and health-care systems. The dynamics of recovery in Asia and the Pacific have been shaped by access to vaccination and diagnostics, as well as by the structure and efficacy of national economies and public health systems. </p><p>Yet for all the economic contraction, greenhouse gas emissions in the Asia-Pacific region continued largely unabated, and the long-burning climate crisis continues to rage. </p><p>The positive effects of producing less waste and air pollution, for example, have been short-lived. Action lags, even as many countries in Asia and the Pacific have committed to scale up the ambition of their climate action and pursue a just energy transition. The political and economic drive to move away from fossil fuels remains weak, even with soaring prices of oil and gas across the region.</p><p>As the Ukraine conflict drives greater uncertainty and exacerbates food and fuel shortages, leading to surging prices, security is increasingly at the center of economic and political priorities. </p><p>This confluence of issues is adding to the shocks already dealt with by the pandemic and triggering crises of governance in some parts of our region. Again, the poorest and most vulnerable groups are the most affected. </p><p/><p>Price pressures on everyday necessities like food and fuel are straining household budgets, yet governments will find it\u00a0more\u00a0difficult to step in this time. Government responses to the previous succession of shocks have reduced fiscal space while leaving heightened national debt burdens in their wake.\u00a0</p><p>It has never been more important to ensure that the integrated aspects of economic, social, and environmental sustainability are built into our approaches to recovery. </p><p>As our joint ESCAP-ADB-UNDP 2022 report on <url normalizedValue=\"https://sdgasiapacific.net/knowledge-products/0000023\">Building Forward Together</url> for the SDGs highlighted, despite important pockets of good practice, countries of Asia and the Pacific need to act much more decisively \u2013 and faster and at scale \u2013 on this imperative. This redefines what progress means and how it is measured, as development that promotes the well-being of the whole \u2013 people and planet.\u00a0</p><h>Extraordinary agenda for extraordinary times\u00a0</h><p>All this is a sobering backdrop for achieving the ambitious agenda of the SDGs. But these interlocking shocks are also a result of a failure to advance on the SDGs as an integrated agenda. </p><p>We need unconventional responses and investments that fundamentally change what determines sustainable development outcomes. Rather than treating our current looming crises of energy, food and human security as distinct, we must address their interlinkages.\u00a0</p><p/><p>To illustrate, a determined focus on fiscal reforms that deliver environmental and social benefits can generate big wins. Asia and the Pacific can lead with action on long-standing commitments to eliminate costly environmentally harmful subsidies, including for fossil fuels. </p><p>Some countries took advantage of reduced fossil-fuel consumption during the Covid-19 lockdowns and mobility restrictions to increase taxes on fuel to raise funds for recovery programs and provide health insurance and social protection for those least protected.\u00a0 </p><p>There are also opportunities to repurpose the estimated US$540 billion spent each year on global agricultural subsidies to promote more inclusive agriculture, and healthier and more sustainable systems of food production. </p><p>Better targeting smallholder farmers and rewarding good practices such as promoting shifts to regenerative agriculture can help transform food systems, restore ecosystems, and protect biodiversity.\u00a0</p><h>Just transitions\u00a0</h><p>For our part, as UN agencies and multilateral organizations, we are committed to supporting countries to pursue just transitions to rapid decarbonization and climate resilience.

RE:FARM will run from September 2022 to June 2023 and consumers can personally see, touch, and taste the results of the Nespresso's sustainability efforts. The program is the result of a partnership between Nespresso, K11 and Common Farms, a local indoor agri-tech farm, and is aligned with the sustainability initiatives of parent group Nestl\u00e9 SA and its commitment to unlock the power of food to enhance quality of life for everyone, today and for generations to come. </p><p><br/><br/>Nespresso has always done things a certain way. Not the easiest way, not the quickest. But the right way. Since its inception over 30 years ago, Nespresso has remained steadfastly committed to making a difference in the world, and sustainability has become a crucial component of its business today. By embedding transformative actions throughout its value chain, such as regenerative agriculture, eco-design, recycling, and circularity, Nespresso strives to bring positive impact to all its stakeholders, from farmers and business partners to consumers. In 2022, Nespresso was certified as a B Corp and joined a global movement of companies doing business responsibly and transparently while maintaining high sustainability standards. <br/><br/>From Capsule to Cup to Table (and back!) \u2013 A Circular Journey <br/><br/>At RE:FARM, visitors have a unique opportunity to witness Nespresso's sustainable circular system in action. An on-site recycler separates coffee capsules from the coffee grounds and recycles the aluminum to make second life products. Meanwhile, Nespresso's composter turns spent coffee grounds into rich nutrients that will be used to bring life to new produce. Composted coffee grounds serve as an excellent fertilizer and offer numerous benefits in farming, such as improved soil drainage, water retention, and aeration. They also acidify the soil, acting as a natural repellent that deters pests from damaging crops. RE:FARM uses this compost to grow a variety of herbs, microgreens, and edible flowers within self-contained farming units, which are later harvested and sent to selected Nespresso partner restaurants in K11 MUSEA and Rosewood Hong Kong, including Asaya Kitchen, Chaat, Deng G, Yung's Bistro, and other dining establishments that will be joining the project over its nine-month run. As part of the RE:FARM experience, customers are invited to savor the products of Nespresso's circular journey through delicious microgreens and herbs harvested from RE:FARM in specially designed menus available at participating restaurants. <br/><br/>Through a journey that sees resources travel from farm to capsule to cup, and back to the farm, Nespresso's own circular economy aims to transform the \"take-make-waste\" model into a sustainable system that maintains value and minimizes waste.  <br/><br/>Nespresso hopes to leave visitors with a new understanding and appreciation for circularity through RE:FARM, where end-of-life materials are reimagined and reused as resources rather than waste. In promoting restoration and regeneration, Nespresso continues to hold fast to its commitment to create long-term, positive impact in the world. <br/><br/>Coffee as a Force for Good <br/><br/>Nespresso's sustainability journey continues to evolve in new and innovative ways. Through inspiring initiatives such as RE:FARM and an unwavering determination to continuously maximize its positive impact, the company remains committed to caring for communities, the climate, and circularity with the same dedication and passion that goes into every cup of Nespresso coffee. Because it is the right thing to do. <br/><br/>Located adjacent to Nespresso's existing K11 MUSEA store, RE:FARM will be open from September 2022 to June 2023. For further details and workshop reservations, please visit the RE:FARM website. <br/><br/>Visit Nespresso RE:FARM at Unit 30, B201, Taste Chamber, B2, K11 MUSEA <br/><br/>Hashtag: #NespressoHK #Bcorp #NespressoREFARM</p><p>About Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso SA</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso SA is the pioneer and reference for highest-quality portioned coffee. The company works with more than 120,000 farmers in 15 countries through its AAA Sustainable Quality\u2122 Program to embed sustainability practices on farms and the surrounding landscapes. Launched in 2003 in collaboration with the NGO Rainforest Alliance and later joined by Fairtrade International, the program helps to improve the yield and quality of harvests, ensuring a sustainable supply of high-quality coffee and improving livelihoods of farmers and their communities. Headquartered in Lausanne, Switzerland, Nespresso operates in 84 countries and has over 14,250 employees. In 2019, it operated a global retail network of 810 boutiques. For more information, visit the Nespresso corporate website:  <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.nestle-nespresso.com\">www.nestle-nespresso.com</url> . <br/><br/>About the Nespresso Recycling Programme <br/><br/>Nespresso capsules are made of aluminium which is the best material to protect the freshness and quality of our coffee. Importantly, aluminum is an infinitely recyclable material. We encourage our Members to participate in recycling their used capsules either by bringing them back to our Boutiques in Hong Kong, or through the Recycling@Home  initiative, give those used Nespresso capsules to your deliveryman. <br/><br/>Once collected, used Nespresso capsules are taken to a local plant where the aluminium is separated from the coffee residue. The shredded aluminium is sent to a scrap metal collector for further re-melting into recycled aluminium, while the Nespresso coffee grounds separated from the aluminium capsules are sent to a local farm in the New Territories for further processing into farm compost. <br/><br/>About B Corp<br/><br/>B Corp is a community of companies that commit to have a positive impact on the world \u2013 for the environment, the people who work for their businesses and in their supply chains, and for the communities where they operate. The B Corp certification process is incredibly rigorous, demanding the highest standards of verified social and environmental performance, public transparency, and legal accountability to balance purpose and profit. <br/><br/>About Common Farms <br/><br/>Common Farms is Hong Kong's first soil-based indoor farm, growing remarkable specialty chemical-free and nutrient-dense produce. The Common Farms team is driven by a passion to transform our local food system through clean, efficient and sustainable farming practices, whilst reducing Hong Kong's high dependency on food imports and unnecessary waste. <br/><br/>About K11 MUSEA <br/><br/>K11 reveals the interactive cycle of \u2013 Art, People, Nature, as the door to a way of living that future generations can enjoy as much quality of life as we do today - working together for a better tomorrow.

Her works are exhibited widely and housed in the M+ Sigg Collection in Hong Kong and the Asian Art Museum in San Francisco. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Laurent Gutierrez has a background in architecture and is a professor at Hong Kong Polytechnic University's School of Design. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

A studio practice involved in projects incorporating both architecture and the visual arts, MAP Office has the distinction of being the only maker to have represented Hong Kong in both the art and the architecture Venice biennales. </p><p>In 2021, MAP Office announced that it would set up a self-sustainable residency called MAP Ocean on the island of Ishigaki, in Japan. Portefaix moved there in 2022, and Gutierrez, who remains in Hong Kong, co-founded R-Farm, a regenerative farm about a 15-minute drive from Sangwoodgoon that is focused on growing vegetables for the local community. </p><p>Earlier this year, during a brief lull in between harvesting and sowing, Lo and Gutierrez sat down to discuss the joys and tribulations of being artist-farmers in Hong Kong. </p><p>The following is an excerpt of the discussion conducted at SangWood KidsClub, an educational farm affiliated with Sangwoodgoon at a beautifully converted Hakka-style farmhouse in Yuen Long. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"I am glad to have a chance to find out what you are doing and to tell you what we are doing. I was surprised when I found out that you are also farming here. We probably have different reasons for doing it. Can you tell me yours?\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"I often associate it with age and consciousness. In the farm, we have three partners, I am the youngest, not that I am going to tell you my age [laughs]. </p><p>\"My oldest friend in Hong Kong [Christophe Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my], who I have known for 27 years, has always been into these things. He is an architect and an entomologist. </p><p>\"Two years ago, I was teaching a course on biodiversity and design and I contacted him about it. He said, 'I have no time for your project. Biodiversity doesn't need design anyway. And on top of that, I'm planning to do a regenerative farming project.' </p><p>\"I went to see him and chatted to him about how we can contribute to the idea of regenerative agriculture - farming in a holistic way that returns nutrients to the soil. For him, as an architect, building didn't make sense any more. </p><p>\"A third partner, John Tang, also an architect, joined the project. John, a bit older than us, was doing amazing buildings in Hong Kong and mainland China, but maybe he didn't feel it was meaningful enough in addressing the crises we are facing. </p><p>\"So that's why I say it comes with age, because maybe you need to reach a certain maturity to want to reinvent yourself as something else and to act upon essential commitments for the planet.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"For us, the social movement was the entry point. We were in the anti-high-speed-rail protest movement and we were hoping to reform society. Then after the movement was over, the longer journey turned out to be the reformation of ourselves. </p><p>\"It sounds old-fashioned, but that's what it has been. We are in a collective and we have seen how each one has grown. And we have learned to work with each other. </p><p>\"For example, if we're doing a task, we know we'll have different opinions, especially on how we engage with nature. We have a lot of fire ants in Hong Kong. In the beginning, some of us would say they were harmful to our practice and we had to get rid of them. Others would say they had lives, too, and we should keep them, and so on. </p><p>\"Sometimes the conflicts would explode but it's not common because we are quite peaceful. And to me, maybe because of my background as a journalist, I feel I am also an observer. </p><p>\"Two years ago, on the 10th anniversary of the farm, I made an hour-long video called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Days Before the Silent Spring</emphasis> and recorded how members of the team felt about farming and how it had changed them. </p><p>\"Making a record is one way I see my artistic practice. But Mr Yuen, our <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">sifu</emphasis>, who taught us how to farm, asked me this question at the time: 'Why do you think you are so important that this all needs recording?' </p><p>\"Maybe it's not very significant to other people.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"One importance is to record all this knowledge. Traditional knowledge of farming is disappearing globally. It is important to preserve it, to record it and to make sure that this is transmitted [partly because the old ways of farming were more ecological]. So that's why you and I both have educational activities on our farms. </p><p>\"The goal of farming is obviously to grow vegetables, but also to grow better human beings.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"We try to speak to the public about food ethics and sufficiency. But when we look at reality, I feel conflicted. The way we farm is privileged. </p><p>\"For example, last year we had some bad harvests and didn't have enough produce for customers. In the past, we might have had 40 to 50 packages [of mixed vegetables] a week to sell to customers. It wasn't a lot but it covered our rent. But sometimes we would have only 20 packages a week even though we tried very hard. </p><p>\"I'm not on the farm full time. I am doing exhibitions. I am starting a full-time, paid PhD partly to get some financial stability. </p><p>\"It's embarrassing when farmers in places like India commit suicide due to being overwhelmed by debt. We know what farming could mean for us: to be independent, to say how you can live on your own terms. But as an individual I know I won't solve any problems. </p><p>\"That's why in my artwork I am always debating with my own self. In Hong Kong, we try hard, but in reality bad things still happen. I feel hopeless sometimes.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"I haven't found a way to translate the sensibility of farming into an artistic format yet, but it is a similar type of process. Farming is a form of engagement and the sharing of values. It is also an attempt to reorganise society. </p><p>\"Among the most important needs for an individual is obviously how you sustain yourself, feed yourself and your family. Historically, the invention of the state matched the invention of agriculture. And when food supply is delocalised - like in Hong Kong - food sovereignty becomes important. </p><p>\"If people start to have food sovereignty, society and relationships become less hierarchical. In Hong Kong, it is almost an impossible dream because the gap between imports and what we produce is so big, but nevertheless, you can start to engage and bring in the conversation. </p><p>\"In fact, if politics is a way to engage and view society, I will say farming is a political act.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"How we see it is getting back to basics: a less capitalistic way of how society operated in the old days, [one] based more on equal exchanges. </p><p>\"We also consider how we cooperate with others - institutions, companies and our customers. Who are they and are they actually against our beliefs? Are we just greenwashing together?\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"I remember during the Occupy movement of 2014, there was a garden that Occupiers set up below a Lennon Wall. The new generation don't want to go back to a village type of life, but a big issue for young people in Hong Kong, Japan and elsewhere is whether they will live more miserably than their parents and their grandparents. Do I get myself a bulls**t job, live in the city and not be able to afford a decent life? </p><p>\"So, 2014 was the tip of the iceberg. The garden, the Lennon Wall represented the same logic: a space for claiming something that you feel is right.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"It's hard in Hong Kong for people to grow their own food, and farming is tough. When I first got into farming I was pretty fit because I had always exercised and always liked hiking. But I was exhausted. </p><p>\"You may think of the perfect model of a farmer - like getting up early, having healthy food, having routine. Well, that's the projection. We try to achieve that.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Post Mag</emphasis>: What are you growing? </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"We are planting cabbage, broccoli, carrots, lettuce, beetroots, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">gai lan</emphasis> and snow peas. </p><p>\"We have tried two kinds of local [heirloom] rice varieties, including one called <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">lo su ngar</emphasis> [rat's teeth], but it is very hard to harvest because the stalks are very tall. It's like a messy hair day, especially after a storm. </p><p>\"We will keep growing the Taiwanese and Indonesian strains though.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"All sorts of local and non-local vegetables. Soon we will move to cucumbers and green beans. </p><p>\"There are so many possibilities to make things wrong. The goal in farming is not to make things right; it is to remove what makes things wrong. </p><p>\"Hong Kong is OK when it comes into season. We can almost do three seasons [of farming], though when you are in the field in the summer and it's 35 degrees [95 degrees Fahrenheit] you feel it!\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Natalie</emphasis>: \"Attitudes have changed. Friends who weren't interested in farming are now keen to understand more. To them, the [anti-high-speed-rail] movement had nothing to do with them. But after the last three years, how they see the institutional system, how cynical and ridiculous it is, they want to find their own path.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Laurent</emphasis>: \"I have many mainland students whose parents were in lengthy lockdowns in Chinese cities and they had no food. So there was a lot of interest in subsistence farming among those students. </p><p>\"We always have the possibility of a food crisis here. We almost experienced it with panic buying during the pandemic.\" </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">For more information, visit @sangwoodgoon and @r_farmhk.</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2023.

It was a revelation to see that the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe had opened up, albeit with outbreaks of Covid-19 which they appear to be managing. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

I took an expensive test at a London clinic which is approved by our local authorities. When I was cleared for the flight from London to Zurich I felt as though I had passed an exam. Only to have to queue during transit to be interrogated yet again. Airline staff apologised but felt they had repeat the process due to the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3176155/coronavirus-hong-kong-should-drop-flight\">draconian laws</url> concerning grounding, in the event that more than five per cent of passengers on the flight arrive with Covid-19. </p><p>But arriving in Hong Kong is a surreal experience. </p><p>The flight is parked so far from immigration and baggage claim so that we had to walk thousands of steps to arrive at an endless queue to be tested yet again and have our papers checked before we were finally released. These queues are supervised by employees clad in personal protective equipment whose primary job seems to be to wave their arms in the direction that one must circulate. There are mothers with little ones standing for hours after a 12-hour flight, not to mention the elderly. </p><p>Exhausted, I finally reached my quarantine hotel after five hours. </p><p>I cannot imagine any tourist or business person who would want to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/hong-kong-economy/article/3176090/too-hard-visit-hong-kong-pandemic-rules-eased\">come to Hong Kong</url> while we insist upon these restrictions. </p><p>Surely we can do better than this or I fear that this former Pearl of the Orient, Asia's World City, might be just a beautiful memory. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Marguerite Lee, Mid-Levels</emphasis></p><p>I am writing as a member of the Harbourfront Commission to draw the attention of the Hong Kong community to the praiseworthy contributions of our departing Chief Executive, Mrs Carrie Lam Cheng Yuet-ngor, to the tremendous improvements to Hong Kong's harbour environment during her years as secretary for development, chief secretary and chief executive. </p><p>We invite our fellow Hongkongers to come to the harbourfront to enjoy the community facilities and amenities provided by the government in recent years. These include promenades, parks and leisure areas all around the harbour. </p><p>Our community should be eternally grateful to Mrs Lam for all she has done to help protect and preserve the harbour for the enjoyment of present and future generations of Hongkongers. </p><p>The Society for Protection of the Harbour sincerely hopes that our incoming chief executive, Mr John Lee Ka-chiu, will continue to pursue this enlightened policy of protecting, preserving and enhancing the harbour as \"a special public asset and a natural heritage of Hong Kong people\", as enshrined in the Protection of the Harbour Ordinance. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winston K.S. Chu, vice-chairman, Society for Protection of the Harbour</emphasis></p><p>Many governments have committed themselves to tackling climate change with ambitious goals. The Hong Kong government <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/health-environment/article/3111355/hong-kong-will-be-carbon-neutral-2050-carrie-lam\">has pledged</url> to achieve carbon neutrality before 2050. </p><p>In fact, businesses have been playing a crucial role in addressing climate change. Profitability and sustainability are not mutually exclusive. Instead, businesses can create shared value for their shareholders and the environment. </p><p>The United Nations is calling on businesses to commit to science-based targets that will limit the global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees Celsius. Many companies around the globe have signed the UN Business Ambition for 1.5 degrees Celsius pledge, and rolled out their net-zero programmes accordingly. </p><p>Nevertheless, business sectors face different scenarios with regard to their share of carbon emissions According to global consulting firm McKinsey, the agriculture and food sector could reduce emissions if producers deploy greenhouse gas-efficient farming practices and some consumers shift their diets away from ruminant animals that generate significant quantities of methane. </p><p>Companies are taking decisive measures to address climate change by focusing on advancing regenerative agriculture and other actions along the value chain, and by following detailed, time-bound road maps. For example, Nestl\u00e9 strives to achieve deforestation-free primary supply chains by 2022 and has been investing in transforming the product portfolio - such as by creating new low-carbon products - was well as in packaging innovation and business models to help keep waste out of landfills. </p><p>Nestl\u00e9 is aiming to make 100 per cent of its packaging recyclable or reusable and to reduce the use of virgin plastics by one third by 2025. It is also using more renewable energy in both the manufacturing and logistics processes. </p><p>An article published by the World Economic Forum points out there is mounting evidence that it is possible for corporations to transition to net-zero business models profitably. </p><p>UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres remarked, \"Humanity is waging war on nature ... Nature always strikes back, and it is already doing so with growing force and fury.\" It's time for all of us to act, and surely that includes businesses. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">May Chung, general manager, Nestl\u00e9 Hong Kong Ltd</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2022.

During the 2019 CIIE, Kering exhibited its exceptional creations and know-how, as well as its vision and achievements in terms of sustainable development, Palus said, noting that the Kering pavilion allowed visitors to have a unique experience while interacting with the group's brands. </p><p>\"China is a crucial part of Kering's sustainable development strategy. It was in Shanghai in October 2019 that we held our 'K Generation Awards' to encourage sustainable innovation in the fashion and textile sector,\" he said. For the third CIIE, the managing director said Kering will present its vision on the evolution of the luxury sector, in particular the role and responsibility of luxury in contributing to a more sustainable future for the fashion and textile sectors as a whole. \"We believe that modern luxury is not only exceptional craftsmanship and the highest quality materials, but also creativity and responsibility,\" he said. \"For example, Kering published its strategy in July 2020 in terms of biodiversity, comprising a series of objectives to achieve a neutral or even positive impact on biodiversity by 2025. This plan notably includes the creation of a 'Kering for Nature Fund' to support the transition of the fashion and textile sector to regenerative agriculture, as well as a series of projects to develop awareness on environmental protection issues, \" he explained. This year at the CIIE, Kering will focus on its signature \"Empowering Imagination\", its vision of modern, sincere and sustainable luxury and its efforts in terms of biodiversity. \"The Kering pavilion is intended to be a creative and engaging space, which showcases collections from all our brands, recent products as well as artistic installations,\" said Palus. The \"Biodiversity Room\" in the Kering pavilion will illustrate the progress of biodiversity strategies that are implemented by the group around the world. Kering's partnership with The Explorers, a global media platform that aims to create an inventory of global biodiversity, will be an example of Kering's efforts to help raise awareness of biodiversity issues. In addition, Kering has developed a virtual pavilion on Chinese multi-purpose messaging and social media platform WeChat to allow the public to enjoy the content and visuals of its pavilion remotely. China is clearly a key country in the global luxury market, Palus said. \"Kering has been present in China for more than 40 years,\" he said. \"China's current economic development has been accompanied by rapid changes in the expectations of Chinese consumers in terms of luxury, and we are more than ever committed to meeting their expectations in the most qualitative way possible.\" Enditem</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">XINHUA-XxjidwE00705820201030CBTFN0simple</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">XINHUA2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:615X-KWH1-JBTY-T06Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">8078</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-10-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"504\"/><timeReceived>10:15 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Xinhua News Agency All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Xinhua General News Service</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 30, 2020 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

This extends to the entire brand, in the United States and Asia, and from coffee and ingredient sourcing to guest-use and end-of-life greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for product and packaging. Blue Bottle will attain carbon neutrality for its GHG emissions first by reducing as much as possible--including through work with coffee producers to sustain and expand regenerative agricultural practices--then by supporting carbon removal and high-quality offsetting projects for unabated GHG emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">p Today's announcement represents a significant next step towards the brand's long-term sustainability goals of leading the food service industry in the boldest, most comprehensive waste and GHG emissions reduction movement.This year, the company focused efforts to reduce GHG emissions across four key areas: coffee sourcing, electricity, dairy, and waste.</p><p> The company also committed to help scale regenerative agriculture as part of its 2024 carbon neutrality target. Blue Bottle made a multi-year commitment to purchase the first available high-quality, registry-certified agricultural carbon credits.</p><p> Produced by Carbon by Indigo, these credits support U.S.</p><p> farmers transitioning from conventional practices toward more beneficial agriculture.In 2022 the company will publish its accelerated roadmap to achieving carbon neutrality by 2024.\"Since our founding in 2002, sustainability has been a core value at Blue Bottle.</p><p> Sustainability for us means caring for people and planet,\" said Karl Strovink, CEO of Blue Bottle Coffee. \"We are steadfast in providing guests with the highest quality coffee and cafe experience without the need to compromise on our values.</p><p>\"In 2020, Blue Bottle held true to the commitment of compensating for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with its e-commerce business on orders shipped throughout the United States.This next major milestone of carbon neutrality by 2024 will involve fundamental changes to Blue Bottle's business operations and partnerships with suppliers.</p><p> During the past year, Blue Bottle has taken the following actions:ul type=\"discuCoffee Sourcing: Blue Bottle is completing its first round of sustainability audits across the majority of its coffee purchasing. Audit reports will assist Blue Bottle in integrating climate targets into its work with coffee suppliers.</p><p>uElectricity: Blue Bottle reduced GHG emissions associated with its electricity usage first in the United States and Japan by purchasing renewable energy certificates for a portion of cafes and one production site.uDairy: Blue Bottle led the change to introduce oat milk in its Asia markets, having long offered oat milk at no extra charge in U.</p><p>S. cafes.</p><p> In June 2021, test cafes in Northern and Southern California markets invoked oat milk as the default in milk-based drinks for in-cafe and mobile orders, resulting in 8% less cow's milk use in these cafes.uWaste: Blue Bottle is on track to achieve zero waste operations for half its U.</p><p>S. cafes by the end of 2021, with a goal of reaching all U.</p><p>S. cafes by 2023. This target requires cafes to divert 90% of their waste from landfill, incineration, or the environment.</p><p> Blue Bottle's Jackson Square cafe opened this spring with zero waste operations, reaching a 98% diversion rate in its first month. In 2022, Blue Bottle will scale zero waste operations to its U.</p><p>S. production sites and begin implementation in Asia.</p><p>p u\"We invite guests to join us in forging positive change--from wasting less and reusing more to adopting new product offerings with lower environmental footprints--we are committed to accelerating progress but cannot do this alone,\" said Strovink. \"We hope our guests will join us in taking bold steps on climate action, one cup of coffee and one day at a time.</p><p>\"For more information on Blue Bottle's sustainability efforts, please visit www.blog.</p><p>bluebottlecoffee.com/sustainability.</p><p> The full report on Blue Bottle's carbon neutrality commitment can be found here.

This extends to the entire brand, in the United States and Asia, and from coffee and ingredient sourcing to guest-use and end-of-life greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for product and packaging. Blue Bottle will attain carbon neutrality for its GHG emissions first by reducing as much as possible\u2014including through work with coffee producers to sustain and expand regenerative agricultural practices\u2014then by supporting carbon removal and high-quality offsetting projects for unabated GHG emissions.</p><p>;</p><p>Today's announcement represents a significant next step towards the brand's long-term sustainability goals of leading the food service industry in the boldest, most comprehensive waste and GHG emissions reduction movement. ;</p><p>;</p><p>This year, the company focused efforts to reduce GHG emissions across four key areas: coffee sourcing, electricity, dairy, and waste. The company also committed to help scale regenerative agriculture as part of its 2024 carbon neutrality target. Blue Bottle made a multi-year commitment to purchase the first available high-quality, registry-certified agricultural carbon credits. Produced by Carbon by Indigo, these credits support U.S. farmers transitioning from conventional practices toward more beneficial agriculture.</p><p>;</p><p>In 2022 the company will publish its accelerated roadmap to achieving carbon neutrality by 2024.</p><p>;</p><p>\"Since our founding in 2002, sustainability has been a core value at Blue Bottle. Sustainability for us means caring for people and planet,\" said Karl Strovink, CEO of Blue Bottle Coffee. \"We are steadfast in providing guests with the highest quality coffee and cafe experience without the need to compromise on our values.\"</p><p>;</p><p>In 2020, Blue Bottle held true to the commitment of compensating for the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with its e-commerce business on orders shipped throughout the United States. ; ;</p><p>;</p><p>This next major milestone of carbon neutrality by 2024 will involve fundamental changes to Blue Bottle's business operations and partnerships with suppliers. During the past year, Blue Bottle has taken the following actions:</p><p>Coffee Sourcing: Blue Bottle is completing its first round of sustainability audits across the majority of its coffee purchasing. Audit reports will assist Blue Bottle in integrating climate targets into its work with coffee suppliers.<br/>Electricity: Blue Bottle reduced GHG emissions associated with its electricity usage first in the United States and Japan by purchasing renewable energy certificates for a portion of cafes and one production site. ;<br/>Dairy: Blue Bottle led the change to introduce oat milk in its Asia markets, having long offered oat milk at no extra charge in U.S. cafes. In June 2021, test cafes in Northern and Southern California markets invoked oat milk as the default in milk-based drinks for in-cafe and mobile orders, resulting in 8% less cow's milk use in these cafes.<br/>Waste: Blue Bottle is on track to achieve zero waste operations for half its U.S. cafes by the end of 2021, with a goal of reaching all U.S. cafes by 2023. This target requires cafes to divert 90% of their waste from landfill, incineration, or the environment. Blue Bottle's Jackson Square cafe opened this spring with zero waste operations, reaching a 98% diversion rate in its first month. In 2022, Blue Bottle will scale zero waste operations to its U.S. production sites and begin implementation in Asia.</p><p>;</p><p>\"We invite guests to join us in forging positive change\u2014from wasting less and reusing more to adopting new product offerings with lower environmental footprints\u2014we are committed to accelerating progress but cannot do this alone,\" said Strovink. \"We hope our guests will join us in taking bold steps on climate action, one cup of coffee and one day at a time.\"</p><p>;</p><p>For more information on Blue Bottle's sustainability efforts, please visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.blog.bluebottlecoffee.com/sustainability\">www.blog.bluebottlecoffee.com/sustainability</url>.

The food price index of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in 2021 averaged 125.7 points, as much as 27.6 points above the previous year with all five sub-indices (i.e., cereal, vegetable, dairy, meat, and sugar) averaging sharply higher than in 2020. Among these sub-indices, cereal prices have experienced an even more considerable rise. The FAO cereal price index in 2021 was the highest annual average registered since 2012, which averaged 131.2 points, up 28.0 points from 2020.</p><p>Since the 20th century, there have been several global food price crises. During the 1970s oil price crisis, the prices of staple foods, especially rice, rose by more than 100 percent, causing a severe global food crisis. An oil embargo from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries caused a spike in oil prices by nearly 300 percent over several months. Although the food price spike closely followed oil prices, the drivers of the crisis can be considered a perfect storm of events, including conflict, trade restrictions, macroeconomic shocks and extreme weather events. During the 2007-08 food price crisis, the prices of staple foods surged, with the rice price doubling in the span of a few months. This food crisis was led by several factors such as demand for biofuels and grain export restrictions, combined with weather shocks and possible financial speculation.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the compounding effects from a coincidence of significant risks and threats, including emerging diseases, trade chokepoints and disruptions, macroeconomic shocks, conflicts, climate change, extreme weather events, and degradation and depletion of natural resources and the loss of biodiversity, are seriously disrupting the food system. It is estimated that 30 percent of the global population lacked access to adequate food in 2020\uff0da rise of 320 million in just one year. Sharply rising food prices offer few means of substitution, especially for net food buyers and the urban poor, increasing hunger, poverty and malnutrition. Food price spikes, reduced incomes and compounded risks (the perfect storm discussed above) will lead to severe and widespread increases in global food insecurity, affecting vulnerable households in almost every country.</p><p>The recent food price spikes come from both the supply side and the demand side. On the supply side, the continuous COVID-19 pandemic, frequent extreme weather events, and high input costs have tightened global food supply. Outbreaks of diseases lower crop production, disrupt food processing, distribution, transportation and trade substantially. In addition, weather shocks due to climate change and natural disasters are affecting crops worldwide. Driven by surging energy costs, supply curtailments and trade policies, fertilizer prices increased sharply since the third quarter of 2021, reaching their highest levels since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, which could exert inflationary pressures on food prices.</p><p>On the demand side, the energy price surge, and consequently strong demand for biofuels, has been a major factor in the recent price spikes. The global pattern of lagging production and limited investment helped push oil prices to nearly $85 per barrel in January 2022, a 50 percent increase compared with the previous year. As a result, a strong demand-side surge for biofuels exerted strong pressure on food prices, especially that of maize. Global demand for biofuels is set to grow by 41 billion liters, or 28 percent, over 2021-26. In addition, macroeconomic factors such as decreasing interest rates, relaxation of monetary policy, increasing investment in commodity funds (speculation) and the depreciation of the US dollar exacerbated the food price spike.</p><p>There is widespread concern that the recent food price spikes will cause a global hunger and nutrition crisis. Measures from a short-term perspective and a long-term perspective must be taken.</p><p>In the short term, green channels need to be established and maintained to ensure food supply. City lockdowns, road blocks and social distancing should not prevent foods from being transported and marketed while food chain workers must be protected against the pandemic. The government should also monitor and stabilize wholesale and retail food prices at the national and regional levels. Efficient and timely public communication and guidance is also essential to stabilize market expectations.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that the global food trade plays a crucial role during food supply shocks; food export bans and restrictions should be eliminated or subjected to stricter disciplines in their use to stabilize global food prices and ensure food security. Thus, global governance mechanisms and institutional coordination capacity must be further strengthened.

The food price index of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization in 2021 averaged 125.7 points, as much as 27.6 points above the previous year with all five sub-indices (i.e., cereal, vegetable, dairy, meat, and sugar) averaging sharply higher than in 2020. Among these sub-indices, cereal prices have experienced an even more considerable rise. The FAO cereal price index in 2021 was the highest annual average registered since 2012, which averaged 131.2 points, up 28.0 points from 2020.</p><p>Since the 20th century, there have been several global food price crises. During the 1970s oil price crisis, the prices of staple foods, especially rice, rose by more than 100 percent, causing a severe global food crisis. An oil embargo from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries caused a spike in oil prices by nearly 300 percent over several months. Although the food price spike closely followed oil prices, the drivers of the crisis can be considered a perfect storm of events, including conflict, trade restrictions, macroeconomic shocks and extreme weather events. During the 2007-08 food price crisis, the prices of staple foods surged, with the rice price doubling in the span of a few months. This food crisis was led by several factors such as demand for biofuels and grain export restrictions, combined with weather shocks and possible financial speculation.</p><p>During the COVID-19 pandemic, the compounding effects from a coincidence of significant risks and threats, including emerging diseases, trade chokepoints and disruptions, macroeconomic shocks, conflicts, climate change, extreme weather events, and degradation and depletion of natural resources and the loss of biodiversity, are seriously disrupting the food system. It is estimated that 30 percent of the global population lacked access to adequate food in 2020\uff0da rise of 320 million in just one year. Sharply rising food prices offer few means of substitution, especially for net food buyers and the urban poor, increasing hunger, poverty and malnutrition. Food price spikes, reduced incomes and compounded risks (the perfect storm discussed above) will lead to severe and widespread increases in global food insecurity, affecting vulnerable households in almost every country.</p><p>The recent food price spikes come from both the supply side and the demand side. On the supply side, the continuous COVID-19 pandemic, frequent extreme weather events, and high input costs have tightened global food supply. Outbreaks of diseases lower crop production, disrupt food processing, distribution, transportation and trade substantially. In addition, weather shocks due to climate change and natural disasters are affecting crops worldwide. Driven by surging energy costs, supply curtailments and trade policies, fertilizer prices increased sharply since the third quarter of 2021, reaching their highest levels since the 2008-09 global financial crisis, which could exert inflationary pressures on food prices.</p><p>On the demand side, the energy price surge, and consequently strong demand for biofuels, has been a major factor in the recent price spikes. The global pattern of lagging production and limited investment helped push oil prices to nearly $85 per barrel in January 2022, a 50 percent increase compared with the previous year. As a result, a strong demand-side surge for biofuels exerted strong pressure on food prices, especially that of maize. Global demand for biofuels is set to grow by 41 billion liters, or 28 percent, over 2021-26. In addition, macroeconomic factors such as decreasing interest rates, relaxation of monetary policy, increasing investment in commodity funds (speculation) and the depreciation of the US dollar exacerbated the food price spike.</p><p>There is widespread concern that the recent food price spikes will cause a global hunger and nutrition crisis. Measures from a short-term perspective and a long-term perspective must be taken.</p><p>In the short term, green channels need to be established and maintained to ensure food supply. City lockdowns, road blocks and social distancing should not prevent foods from being transported and marketed while food chain workers must be protected against the pandemic. The government should also monitor and stabilize wholesale and retail food prices at the national and regional levels. Efficient and timely public communication and guidance is also essential to stabilize market expectations.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that the global food trade plays a crucial role during food supply shocks; food export bans and restrictions should be eliminated or subjected to stricter disciplines in their use to stabilize global food prices and ensure food security. Thus, global governance mechanisms and institutional coordination capacity must be further strengthened. Other instruments include formulating policies to prevent food price rises caused by biofuels, offering temporary special support to smallholders, farmers and small traders, and providing social protection for vulnerable people, such as women, children and the elderly.</p><p>In the long term, investment in rural infrastructure and irrigation and drainage needs to be promoted. Measures include scaling up productive and regenerative agriculture, redirecting subsidy policies to climate-smart, eco-friendly, impactful public investments, and promoting multiple-win technologies such as yield-enhancing, nutrition improving and conservation technologies.</p><p>To cope with food price spikes and to mitigate their negative influence on global food security, it is crucial to transform toward more sustainable and resilient global food system. This requires promoting the sustainable intensification of agriculture to halt the expansion of food production to natural habitats of wild animals and plants; incorporating a One Health approach to encourage a collaborative effort across disciplines for the optimal health of people, animals and the environment; moving to other forms of green energy to address the risk of oil price shocks; stabilizing macroeconomic policies and building buffers between macroeconomic policy instability and food systems.</p><p>To match the increased scope of global action required to address and respond to risks and threats, a scientific platform for food systems comparable to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is needed to provide the basis for food systems transformation at a global level and provide independent, evidence-based advice for decision-making and actions.</p><p>Fan Shenggen is dean of the Academy of Global Food Economics and Policy and chair professor at China Agricultural University.

Collectively, the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) for National Economic and Social Development, and the Long-range Objectives Through the Year 2035, Healthy China 2030 Plan and Anti-Food Waste Law target awareness of public consumption, low-carbon rural development, healthy and balanced diets, food safety and environmental degradation related to livestock wastes, agricultural plastics and fertilizer use.</p><p>But policy is not enough on its own.

Slowing productivity growth, persistent micro-nutrient deficiencies, rapidly increasing obese and overweight populations, high health costs from diet-related non-communicable diseases, natural resource degradation, continued rural-urban and regional inequality, increased food imports and a recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic are challenging China's ability to provide access to safe, healthy and sustainable foods.</p><p>Climate change is also a very real threat, as the extreme weather events of this year illustrate.

There are four ways China can contribute. First, prioritize research and development of innovations that reduce the carbon footprint of agriculture, boost productivity, ensure soil health and enhance nutrition. Technology and innovation are powerful tools that can do more than increasing yields; improvements in crops and livestock could reduce agricultural greenhouse gas emissions by 7 to 16 and 9 to 23 percentage points respectively by 2060 and improve crop resilience.</p><p>Second, reform agricultural subsidies and strengthen global policy coordination.

This will be the largest carbon market in the world, covering initially over 2,000 companies in the power generation sector that emit over 4 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide a year.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Globally, only 21 percent of emissions are covered by carbon pricing systems. This needs to increase significantly if we want to reach our 1.5 C temperature goal. The new Chinese emissions trading system increases the emissions covered by carbon prices globally by 6 percent more than last year, demonstrating China's tremendous potential in tackling the global climate crisis.</p><p>Carbon markets are a critical tool to reduce carbon emissions by making emissions reductions available at the most efficient price. But for the carbon pricing system to be effective in incentivizing greener production, prices will need to be significantly higher. The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development estimates effective carbon prices to be at around 60 euros ($71) per ton. The global social costs incurred by carbon is even higher, at $100 per ton, according to research by Nicholas Stern and Joseph Stiglitz, two of the foremost economists of our time. If the international community does not step up to combat climate change, it is likely to do $1.7 trillion a year in damage by 2025, increasing to about $30 trillion a year by 2075, according to a report by the Institute for Policy Integrity.</p><p>Today, the majority of emissions remain unpriced, meaning that there is no regulatory pressure on companies to buy carbon credits to balance their carbon footprints or to reduce them. New, large-scale carbon pricing schemes such as the one in China will accelerate global carbon pricing coverage, thereby driving up prices.</p><p>In the climate space, all eyes are on China's new commitment to be carbon neutral before 2060. This ambitious goal will now need to be followed up with swift policy action and implementation. China is quickly developing from being one of the world's biggest emitters to being one of the world's most influential climate leaders.</p><p>The current Chinese emissions trading system covers only energy and a handful of industrial sectors\uff0dbut it does not put a price on emissions from land use sectors, such as agriculture and forestry. Land use accounts for up to 25 percent of global emissions, and China is a leading producer and consumer of agricultural and fishery commodities.</p><p>To tackle the global climate crisis and stay within safe temperature limits, it is crucial to address emissions from the land use sector. This would require a holistic transformation of the land use sectors\uff0dmuch like what we have seen in the energy transition in past decades\uff0dincluding halting deforestation, putting an end to land-use change and radically reducing emissions from agricultural production.</p><p>Globally, tropical deforestation causes about 5 billion tons of carbon emissions\uff0dmore than the entire European Union and five times more than aviation. This can be traced back to the production of a few critical goods. Creating a true land use transition is not only about how we produce food such as beef and soy, but also fibers, wood, textiles and building materials. The world needs to move toward productive and regenerative agriculture and forestry production. This would not only reduce emissions but also bring about many benefits for biodiversity, water quality and soil health, as well as the long-term productivity of farms and therefore food security.</p><p>Including land use emissions into the Chinese (or global) carbon pricing scheme would send a signal to agricultural producers to move to more sustainable models and invest in natural climate solutions. Over the last decade, China's political leadership has emphasized the need to protect the country's natural capital and tightened domestic environmental standards under the concept of realizing an ecological civilization. The country has introduced an agricultural redline to put a minimum floor on the amount of agricultural land. The Ecological Conservation Redline commits over one-fourth of China's territory to varying degrees of protection for biodiversity, disaster mitigation and providing critical ecosystem services. China's unique experience in integrated national spatial land-use planning for food, climate and ecological security holds important lessons for other countries.</p><p>China has begun to transform into a climate leader on the international stage. The Chinese government is hosting the biodiversity conference COP 15 in Kunming in October where finance for biodiversity will be one of the key topics, offering an opportunity for China to continue establishing itself as a champion in the environmental space. Carbon markets have the potential to unlock large scales of finance flowing into carbon and biodiversity at the same time.</p><p>Carbon markets will also be a key topic at the international climate conference COP 26 taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to be operationalized covers the international transfer of mitigation outcomes. This article regulates the international carbon market, following on from the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto protocol. As the Kyoto protocol has come to the end of its term, a new international agreement is urgently needed. Countries failed to reach a consensus at the last climate conference in Madrid and intersessional negotiations in June this year did not prove fruitful.</p><p>The answer might lie in coalitions of governments willing to trade carbon credits across borders to meet their national climate targets in the case of industrialized nations, or to finance the conservation of their natural heritage in the case of forest countries, or in bilateral deals: earlier this year Peru struck the first international transfer agreement with Switzerland, many may follow this example.</p><p>If China were to support the idea of such international carbon market clubs, it could prove a powerful tool to get us one step closer to solving the global climate crisis.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202108/02/610720cda3106abb555fd166.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p>SONG CHEN/CHINA DAILY</p><p>Teresa Hartmann is the lead of Climate and Nature at the World Economic Forum.

The Chinese government is hosting the biodiversity conference COP 15 in Kunming in October where finance for biodiversity will be one of the key topics, offering an opportunity for China to continue establishing itself as a champion in the environmental space. Carbon markets have the potential to unlock large scales of finance flowing into carbon and biodiversity at the same time.</p><p>Carbon markets will also be a key topic at the international climate conference COP 26 taking place in Glasgow, Scotland, later this year. Article 6 of the Paris Agreement to be operationalized covers the international transfer of mitigation outcomes. This article regulates the international carbon market, following on from the clean development mechanism under the Kyoto protocol. As the Kyoto protocol has come to the end of its term, a new international agreement is urgently needed. Countries failed to reach a consensus at the last climate conference in Madrid and intersessional negotiations in June this year did not prove fruitful.</p><p>The answer might lie in coalitions of governments willing to trade carbon credits across borders to meet their national climate targets in the case of industrialized nations, or to finance the conservation of their natural heritage in the case of forest countries, or in bilateral deals: earlier this year Peru struck the first international transfer agreement with Switzerland, many may follow this example.</p><p>If China were to support the idea of such international carbon market clubs, it could prove a powerful tool to get us one step closer to solving the global climate crisis.</p><p>Teresa Hartmann is the lead of Climate and Nature at the World Economic Forum.

It also sets the tone for improving the business environment for global firms, big and small, operating in the country. China Daily publishes a series of Q&amp;As with business executives from leading MNCs featuring their outlook for the Chinese economy as well as their hopes for the future prospects of their businesses in China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q1 Against the backdrop of a much-troubled global economy, how will China's economy likely perform going forward, given that it has already made immense contributions to the tasks of stabilizing both the global supply chain and the world economy?</p><p>MUKUND: We all know that Mother Earth has gone through many challenges over the past few years. As the world's second-largest economy, China has shown an amazing ability to actively face external disturbances and quickly adapt to the new normal. Its government organization is strong and orderly, its people united and optimistic, and its business environment vigorous and dynamic - this is the observation and experience of Benchmark ESG in its over 10 years of operation in China. In the future, China's economy will undoubtedly continue to maintain steady development and release more energy on the world stage.</p><p>WU: China remains one of the vital engines for global economic recovery. China's economic stability and sustainable growth are the biggest contributions to the stability of the world economy and global supply chain.</p><p>Despite challenges and pressures, the Chinese economy remains robust with strong resilience and ample potential. Economic performance will continue to improve along with a package of pro-growth policies put into practice.</p><p>DHL Express firmly supports trade liberalization and has been active in contributing to stabilizing supply chain logistics by making investments to expand service infrastructure and adding air capacity in China.</p><p>BURRAGE: China is the world's second-largest economy and plays a very important role in the global supply chain. China's economy has shown great resilience during and after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is expected to continue growing. For now and in the future, with China transitioning to a more innovative and sustainable development model, we expect to see many opportunities arise from the upgrading of the economy. That provides foreign investors and companies such as Hays with opportunities to develop together with China's economy. From our perspective as a global expert in recruitment, China is a massive market and there are a great number of jobs out there for us to locate and consult on.</p><p>DEPOUX: The Chinese production system has shown quite extraordinary resilience in the second half of 2020 and 2021. This has continued to 2022, even though it was disturbed by COVID-19 resurgences. The Chinese supply chain has modernized in 2021 thanks to accelerated investment in automation and digitalization, financed by the surge in demand. Yet, the situation going forward in 2023 is going to be different because the global economy is slowing down due to inflation, tightening monetary policies and the impact of high energy prices. International demand may weaken Chinese exports, but there is also a scenario by which energy shortages cause disruptions in industrial chains such as chemicals and commodities in Europe. China's production system may, again, be able to stabilize the global supply chain by picking up the demand that cannot be met in Europe.</p><p>BOZEC: We remain confident in China's economy, as China continues to be an important driving force for global development and prosperity. We have forged strong ties with our Chinese partners over our two decades in the market. We look forward to meeting and working with new partners as well as our existing network, and creating more value while contributing to China's economic growth.</p><p>Q2 China has been deepening its reform and opening-up policy, particularly at the institutional level, so as to ensure equal treatment and an optimized business environment for foreign companies operating in China, and to persuade more of them to invest in China and benefit from the country's thrust on tech and innovation. How do you view China's efforts? How can China intensify such efforts, particularly in the context of any potential external or internal barriers?</p><p>MUKUND: The achievements of China's 40 years of reform and opening-up have attracted worldwide attention. And Benchmark ESG is honored to be a part of this legendary development. As a leading provider of cloud-based ESG software solutions, we have been firmly optimistic about the market prospects since entering China in 2009. Benchmark ESG's investment in China has been growing alongside the country's growing emphasis on safety in production and ongoing digital transformation. At the beginning of a new stage, we hope China will continue to pursue greater opening-up at a higher level, to give MNCs more opportunities for development and achieve win-win results.</p><p>WU: We have greatly benefited from the continuously improving business environment in China. As an international logistics provider, the efficiency of Customs clearance is critically important for us. In recent years, Chinese Customs has introduced a series of measures and digitalized approaches to streamline and accelerate the Customs clearance process, which significantly improves efficiency. Going forward, China's continuous opening-up will ultimately lead to an improved business environment, and we are confident that the focus on sustainable development of the Chinese economy will greatly benefit international trade. DHL Express will continue the solid partnership with Sinotrans and invest to keep our business in China growing.</p><p>BURRAGE: Hays has benefited from China's opening-up from the perspective of equal market entrance. In the past decades, we have established offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Suzhou, providing our services to both multinational and domestic companies. The most recent China International Fair for Trade in Services, along with many other major trade events, such as the China International Import Expo, are very good examples of China's efforts to create opportunities. Its ongoing efforts to optimize the business environment and its drive for fair competition have been providing more convenience for the operations of foreign investors and companies. As China continues to provide more stability and certainty for businesses, it will attract more foreign investors with its huge market potential.</p><p>DEPOUX: China has been emphasizing fostering a new development paradigm through high-level opening-up, and foreign business will continue to play an important role in China's future economy. Senior decision-makers from headquarters overseas need to understand and engage more with the Chinese market, and entrust further investment into it. This will not go without human exchanges, with short business travel as well as expatriates, experts and decision-makers in the country.</p><p>BOZEC: The expansion of China's high-level opening-up and reform of the business environment further enhances the attractiveness and resilience of the Chinese economy, making the Chinese market one of the most dynamic and influential in the world. The optimized business environment has spurred the vitality of companies and brands like ours, while the increasingly open market has created an excellent business environment for investment and growth of foreign enterprises.</p><p>We strongly believe that the promotion of a series of favorable policies for enterprises has fueled great momentum in the market. This has provided us with more opportunities to participate in the market's development and enhance communication with partners.</p><p>Q3 Innovation has been the bedrock of China's modernization. What new opportunities can you foresee for the world in China's pursuit of innovation-powered high-quality development?</p><p>MUKUND: In the past, China was often dubbed a big manufacturing power, but in recent years, we have seen more and more innovative icons in China: aerospace, artificial intelligence, new energy vehicles and more, and in many subsectors it has achieved curve overtaking and become a leader. It is not hard to imagine that China's existing huge manufacturing base, with policies and guidelines for innovation-driven high-quality development, will stimulate more vigorous modern market demands and foster broad employment opportunities while promoting the connectivity of a globalized economy, culture and technology, and create more possibilities for the sustainable development of human society.</p><p>WU: Technological innovation is a major driving force for cross-border e-commerce to achieve high-level development in the future. Currently, the emerging sector as a new form of foreign trade has huge development potential that not only stabilizes foreign trade amid global economic uncertainties, but also drives consumption growth and provides marketing opportunities, which further brings an increased demand for international logistics. With its worldwide network and breadth of industries served, DHL Express is able to accommodate fast-changing trade flows and facilitate the surge in cross-border e-commerce.</p><p>BURRAGE: China is now leading in many high-tech innovations, from information technology, the internet and artificial intelligence to smart manufacturing and biotech. With the innovation-driven development strategy, China is striving to become more independent in scientific research and R&amp;D of cutting-edge technology. The core of innovation is talent. At Hays, we have seen a substantial increase in talent in China's high-tech sectors. From the perspective of talent, sectors such as IT, AI, biotech, sustainability and smart manufacturing will continue to maintain enormous growth potential. Both employers and candidates will benefit from these opportunities.</p><p>DEPOUX: Looking forward, many opportunities are revolving around modernization and decarbonization in the Chinese economy. Since 2021, an increasing emphasis has been put on China's industrial modernization. The effort to peak and neutralize greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 2060 is the key to maintaining competitiveness, and it will drive further acceleration of modernization. China has demonstrated its innovation capability and is leapfrogging and gaining leadership globally in areas such as the electric vehicle chain from batteries to charging infrastructure, solar photovoltaic cells, wind turbines and nuclear and telecommunications equipment. We anticipate that in the near future, global competitiveness will be more and more driven by Chinese technological innovation.</p><p>BOZEC: China has bred many cutting-edge innovations, and its innovation capability in the digital economy is world-leading. Especially in the new retail environment, digital transformation is accelerating at an unprecedented speed across the industry, and online and offline integrated development has been dedicated to satisfying the public need for an enhanced experience and a better lifestyle.</p><p>For Tapestry, China is not only a vital market but also a source of inspiration for brands to seek innovation. We have built a strong local team for digital innovation, which we will continue to strengthen while working closely with local digital partners here.</p><p>Q4 What's your take on China's dual carbon goals, which have received a thumbs-up globally? Do you see big business opportunities arising from the country's carbon goals?</p><p>MUKUND: China's carbon peaking and neutrality goals demonstrate the courage of a responsible country, and have brought about a series of gratifying changes in the past few years. Take Benchmark ESG's field as an example: potential investors and regulators have higher requirements for corporate ESG performance, corporate leadership and asset managers are moving faster toward ESG, while both upstream and downstream supply chains are actively seeking industry upgrades. Benchmark ESG is both a beneficiary of the dual carbon goals and a supporter of China to achieve it.</p><p>WU: In the logistics industry, DHL Express and its parent company Deutsche Post DHL Group have been pioneering green transition with a total of 7 billion euros ($6.88 billion) investment by 2030, dedicated to using clean energy, deploying technologies and building climate-neutral facilities to reduce carbon emissions. In China, we have followed the same path and have achieved some noticeable results. We're committed to achieving 60 percent electrification of pickup and delivery vehicles by 2030. The current rate has been over 20 percent. We've also been striving to greet 30 percent green fuel-using long-haul trucks. The test of the first pilot hydrogen fuel cell truck was launched this month in Shanghai.</p><p>BURRAGE: Hays recognizes and supports China's emissions goals. It is a difficult yet responsible action taken by the largest developing country to protect the planet and our future generations. The push to rapidly reduce carbon emissions is creating more business opportunities. On the one hand, peaking and net-zero goals are generating new sectors, for example, electric vehicles and the carbon trade mechanism. On the other hand, we see that the carbon emissions goals are creating more job opportunities in the market, and creating new types of jobs. At Hays, we are seeing companies across sectors either being proactive or required to establish sustainability departments.</p><p>DEPOUX: We believe that China's dual carbon goals are critical to the world, and innovation is key to meeting the objectives. It will push State-owned, private companies and multinationals to set more audacious objectives - not only abide by the zero-emissions target, but also claim leadership in emissions reduction technologies and services through innovation. Achieving this goal will take systematic efforts, such as accelerating the evolution of China's energy mix toward greener energy, electrification of industrial facilities, and massive energy savings through changes in behaviors and new technologies.</p><p>BOZEC: China has pledged low-carbon development to establish a sound economic and technological mechanism for green development. This is significant for all of the humanity and a sustainable future.</p><p>Chinese consumers are raising expectations and demand for green consumption, as well as sustainable development. In line with the expectations, we aspire to balance true fashion authority with meaningful, positive changes. Our efforts include reducing emissions, water usage and waste; increasing traceability; boosting efforts on regenerative agriculture and environmentally preferred materials; and preserving and restoring biodiversity in the ecosystem.</p><p>Q5 What's your view on modernization in China that has spawned common prosperity? What does this pursuit mean for foreign businesses?</p><p>MUKUND: The continuous improvement of the lives of ordinary people in China means higher spiritual and material pursuits, which is an incremental source of market space for foreign companies with advanced technologies and services, while a harmonious social order further helps ensure a stable business environment.</p><p>WU: DHL Express and its parent company Deutsche Post DHL Group share the same vision and commitment. Everything we do serves our corporate purpose: connecting people, improving lives. In recent decades, we have seen how increased trade and interaction have raised prosperity and choices, reduced poverty and cultivated diversity around the world. As a logistics provider, we are committed to bringing our purpose to life through global trade. Building those ties is our business and our mission. When more people have access to goods, services and information, the quality of their life improves.</p><p>BURRAGE: China has made remarkable progress in poverty alleviation, with the nation announcing the elimination of absolute poverty in 2021, which is an amazing feat. With the pursuit of common prosperity as the current goal, it will mean further positive changes in the lives of one-fifth of the global population living in China. It is based on China following a practical path that will see a great increase in the size of its middle-income population. This will naturally trigger greater demand in the market. That increased demand will undoubtedly lead to more opportunities for foreign businesses.</p><p>DEPOUX: Foreign businesses are and will remain important to the Chinese economy. According to the Hurun report, in 2021, the top 100 foreign companies in China generated $900 billion, accounting for 6 percent of China's GDP, and creating 2.5 million jobs domestically. The concept of common prosperity has become one of the most important guidelines and long-term goals leading China's development till 2050.Foreign businesses have to be more careful to seize opportunities in industries that are synergizing with the goal of common prosperity.</p><p>BOZEC: China is now heading into a new journey toward the realization of its second centenary goal, from high-quality economic and social development to people's wellbeing and the enhancement of people's sense of prosperity, happiness and security. Every step forward is encouraging foreign companies like Tapestry to strengthen our confidence and determination to deepen our roots in the Chinese market.</p><p>China's high-quality development in modernization is highly inclusive, bringing tangible benefits and providing incremental certainty and confidence to the market. The new development pattern encourages us to keep upholding the concept of innovation, enhance the localization potential of our brands, and create more value for Chinese consumers.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHIDHK-93437220</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHIDHK2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66PF-XCC1-JDJN-6453-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">412302</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2979\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 China Daily Information.

It also sets the tone for improving the business environment for global firms, big and small, operating in the country. China Daily publishes a series of Q&amp;As with business executives from leading MNCs featuring their outlook for the Chinese economy as well as their hopes for the future prospects of their businesses in China.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\u00a0</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q1 Against the backdrop of a much-troubled global economy, how will China's economy likely perform going forward, given that it has already made immense contributions to the tasks of stabilizing both the global supply chain and the world economy?</p><p>MUKUND: We all know that Mother Earth has gone through many challenges over the past few years. As the world's second-largest economy, China has shown an amazing ability to actively face external disturbances and quickly adapt to the new normal. Its government organization is strong and orderly, its people united and optimistic, and its business environment vigorous and dynamic \u2014 this is the observation and experience of Benchmark ESG in its over 10 years of operation in China. In the future, China's economy will undoubtedly continue to maintain steady development and release more energy on the world stage.</p><p>WU: China remains one of the vital engines for global economic recovery. China's economic stability and sustainable growth are the biggest contributions to the stability of the world economy and global supply chain.</p><p>Despite challenges and pressures, the Chinese economy remains robust with strong resilience and ample potential. Economic performance will continue to improve along with a package of pro-growth policies put into practice.</p><p>DHL Express firmly supports trade liberalization and has been active in contributing to stabilizing supply chain logistics by making investments to expand service infrastructure and adding air capacity in China.</p><p>BURRAGE: China is the world's second-largest economy and plays a very important role in the global supply chain. China's economy has shown great resilience during and after the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic and it is expected to continue growing. For now and in the future, with China transitioning to a more innovative and sustainable development model, we expect to see many opportunities arise from the upgrading of the economy. That provides foreign investors and companies such as Hays with opportunities to develop together with China's economy. From our perspective as a global expert in recruitment, China is a massive market and there are a great number of jobs out there for us to locate and consult on.</p><p>DEPOUX: The Chinese production system has shown quite extraordinary resilience in the second half of 2020 and 2021. This has continued to 2022, even though it was disturbed by COVID-19 resurgences. The Chinese supply chain has modernized in 2021 thanks to accelerated investment in automation and digitalization, financed by the surge in demand. Yet, the situation going forward in 2023 is going to be different because the global economy is slowing down due to inflation, tightening monetary policies and the impact of high energy prices. International demand may weaken Chinese exports, but there is also a scenario by which energy shortages cause disruptions in industrial chains such as chemicals and commodities in Europe. China's production system may, again, be able to stabilize the global supply chain by picking up the demand that cannot be met in Europe.</p><p>BOZEC: We remain confident in China's economy, as China continues to be an important driving force for global development and prosperity. We have forged strong ties with our Chinese partners over our two decades in the market. We look forward to meeting and working with new partners as well as our existing network, and creating more value while contributing to China's economic growth.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Q2 China has been deepening its reform and opening-up policy, particularly at the institutional level, so as to ensure equal treatment and an optimized business environment for foreign companies operating in China, and to persuade more of them to invest in China and benefit from the country's thrust on tech and innovation. How do you view China's efforts? How can China intensify such efforts, particularly in the context of any potential external or internal barriers?</p><p>MUKUND: The achievements of China's 40 years of reform and opening-up have attracted worldwide attention. And Benchmark ESG is honored to be a part of this legendary development. As a leading provider of cloud-based ESG software solutions, we have been firmly optimistic about the market prospects since entering China in 2009. Benchmark ESG's investment in China has been growing alongside the country's growing emphasis on safety in production and ongoing digital transformation. At the beginning of a new stage, we hope China will continue to pursue greater opening-up at a higher level, to give MNCs more opportunities for development and achieve win-win results.</p><p>WU: We have greatly benefited from the continuously improving business environment in China. As an international logistics provider, the efficiency of Customs clearance is critically important for us. In recent years, Chinese Customs has introduced a series of measures and digitalized approaches to streamline and accelerate the Customs clearance process, which significantly improves efficiency. Going forward, China's continuous opening-up will ultimately lead to an improved business environment, and we are confident that the focus on sustainable development of the Chinese economy will greatly benefit international trade. DHL Express will continue the solid partnership with Sinotrans and invest to keep our business in China growing.</p><p>BURRAGE: Hays has benefited from China's opening-up from the perspective of equal market entrance. In the past decades, we have established offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen and Suzhou, providing our services to both multinational and domestic companies. The most recent China International Fair for Trade in Services, along with many other major trade events, such as the China International Import Expo, are very good examples of China's efforts to create opportunities. Its ongoing efforts to optimize the business environment and its drive for fair competition have been providing more convenience for the operations of foreign investors and companies. As China continues to provide more stability and certainty for businesses, it will attract more foreign investors with its huge market potential.</p><p>DEPOUX: China has been emphasizing fostering a new development paradigm through high-level opening-up, and foreign business will continue to play an important role in China's future economy. Senior decision-makers from headquarters overseas need to understand and engage more with the Chinese market, and entrust further investment into it. This will not go without human exchanges, with short business travel as well as expatriates, experts and decision-makers in the country.</p><p>BOZEC: The expansion of China's high-level opening-up and reform of the business environment further enhances the attractiveness and resilience of the Chinese economy, making the Chinese market one of the most dynamic and influential in the world. The optimized business environment has spurred the vitality of companies and brands like ours, while the increasingly open market has created an excellent business environment for investment and growth of foreign enterprises.</p><p>We strongly believe that the promotion of a series of favorable policies for enterprises has fueled great momentum in the market. This has provided us with more opportunities to participate in the market's development and enhance communication with partners.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Q3 Innovation has been the bedrock of China's modernization. What new opportunities can you foresee for the world in China's pursuit of innovation-powered high-quality development?</p><p>MUKUND: In the past, China was often dubbed a big manufacturing power, but in recent years, we have seen more and more innovative icons in China: aerospace, artificial intelligence, new energy vehicles and more, and in many subsectors it has achieved curve overtaking and become a leader. It is not hard to imagine that China's existing huge manufacturing base, with policies and guidelines for innovation-driven high-quality development, will stimulate more vigorous modern market demands and foster broad employment opportunities while promoting the connectivity of a globalized economy, culture and technology, and create more possibilities for the sustainable development of human society.</p><p>WU: Technological innovation is a major driving force for cross-border e-commerce to achieve high-level development in the future. Currently, the emerging sector as a new form of foreign trade has huge development potential that not only stabilizes foreign trade amid global economic uncertainties, but also drives consumption growth and provides marketing opportunities, which further brings an increased demand for international logistics. With its worldwide network and breadth of industries served, DHL Express is able to accommodate fast-changing trade flows and facilitate the surge in cross-border e-commerce.</p><p>BURRAGE: China is now leading in many high-tech innovations, from information technology, the internet and artificial intelligence to smart manufacturing and biotech. With the innovation-driven development strategy, China is striving to become more independent in scientific research and R&amp;D of cutting-edge technology. The core of innovation is talent. At Hays, we have seen a substantial increase in talent in China's high-tech sectors. From the perspective of talent, sectors such as IT, AI, biotech, sustainability and smart manufacturing will continue to maintain enormous growth potential. Both employers and candidates will benefit from these opportunities.</p><p>DEPOUX: Looking forward, many opportunities are revolving around modernization and decarbonization in the Chinese economy. Since 2021, an increasing emphasis has been put on China's industrial modernization. The effort to peak and neutralize greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 and 2060 is the key to maintaining competitiveness, and it will drive further acceleration of modernization. China has demonstrated its innovation capability and is leapfrogging and gaining leadership globally in areas such as the electric vehicle chain from batteries to charging infrastructure, solar photovoltaic cells, wind turbines and nuclear and telecommunications equipment. We anticipate that in the near future, global competitiveness will be more and more driven by Chinese technological innovation.</p><p>BOZEC: China has bred many cutting-edge innovations, and its innovation capability in the digital economy is world-leading. Especially in the new retail environment, digital transformation is accelerating at an unprecedented speed across the industry, and online and offline integrated development has been dedicated to satisfying the public need for an enhanced experience and a better lifestyle.</p><p>For Tapestry, China is not only a vital market but also a source of inspiration for brands to seek innovation. We have built a strong local team for digital innovation, which we will continue to strengthen while working closely with local digital partners here.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Q4 What's your take on China's dual carbon goals, which have received a thumbs-up globally? Do you see big business opportunities arising from the country's carbon goals?</p><p>MUKUND: China's carbon peaking and neutrality goals demonstrate the courage of a responsible country, and have brought about a series of gratifying changes in the past few years. Take Benchmark ESG's field as an example: potential investors and regulators have higher requirements for corporate ESG performance, corporate leadership and asset managers are moving faster toward ESG, while both upstream and downstream supply chains are actively seeking industry upgrades. Benchmark ESG is both a beneficiary of the dual carbon goals and a supporter of China to achieve it.</p><p>WU: In the logistics industry, DHL Express and its parent company Deutsche Post DHL Group have been pioneering green transition with a total of 7 billion euros ($6.88 billion) investment by 2030, dedicated to using clean energy, deploying technologies and building climate-neutral facilities to reduce carbon emissions. In China, we have followed the same path and have achieved some noticeable results. We're committed to achieving 60 percent electrification of pickup and delivery vehicles by 2030. The current rate has been over 20 percent. We've also been striving to greet 30 percent green fuel-using long-haul trucks. The test of the first pilot hydrogen fuel cell truck was launched this month in Shanghai.</p><p>BURRAGE: Hays recognizes and supports China's emissions goals. It is a difficult yet responsible action taken by the largest developing country to protect the planet and our future generations. The push to rapidly reduce carbon emissions is creating more business opportunities. On the one hand, peaking and net-zero goals are generating new sectors, for example, electric vehicles and the carbon trade mechanism. On the other hand, we see that the carbon emissions goals are creating more job opportunities in the market, and creating new types of jobs. At Hays, we are seeing companies across sectors either being proactive or required to establish sustainability departments.</p><p>DEPOUX: We believe that China's dual carbon goals are critical to the world, and innovation is key to meeting the objectives. It will push State-owned, private companies and multinationals to set more audacious objectives \u2014 not only abide by the zero-emissions target, but also claim leadership in emissions reduction technologies and services through innovation. Achieving this goal will take systematic efforts, such as accelerating the evolution of China's energy mix toward greener energy, electrification of industrial facilities, and massive energy savings through changes in behaviors and new technologies.</p><p>BOZEC: China has pledged low-carbon development to establish a sound economic and technological mechanism for green development. This is significant for all of the humanity and a sustainable future.</p><p>Chinese consumers are raising expectations and demand for green consumption, as well as sustainable development. In line with the expectations, we aspire to balance true fashion authority with meaningful, positive changes. Our efforts include reducing emissions, water usage and waste; increasing traceability; boosting efforts on regenerative agriculture and environmentally preferred materials; and preserving and restoring biodiversity in the ecosystem.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>Q5 What's your view on modernization in China that has spawned common prosperity? What does this pursuit mean for foreign businesses?</p><p>MUKUND: The continuous improvement of the lives of ordinary people in China means higher spiritual and material pursuits, which is an incremental source of market space for foreign companies with advanced technologies and services, while a harmonious social order further helps ensure a stable business environment.</p><p>WU: DHL Express and its parent company Deutsche Post DHL Group share the same vision and commitment. Everything we do serves our corporate purpose: connecting people, improving lives. In recent decades, we have seen how increased trade and interaction have raised prosperity and choices, reduced poverty and cultivated diversity around the world. As a logistics provider, we are committed to bringing our purpose to life through global trade. Building those ties is our business and our mission. When more people have access to goods, services and information, the quality of their life improves.</p><p>BURRAGE: China has made remarkable progress in poverty alleviation, with the nation announcing the elimination of absolute poverty in 2021, which is an amazing feat. With the pursuit of common prosperity as the current goal, it will mean further positive changes in the lives of one-fifth of the global population living in China. It is based on China following a practical path that will see a great increase in the size of its middle-income population. This will naturally trigger greater demand in the market. That increased demand will undoubtedly lead to more opportunities for foreign businesses.</p><p>DEPOUX: Foreign businesses are and will remain important to the Chinese economy. According to the Hurun report, in 2021, the top 100 foreign companies in China generated $900 billion, accounting for 6 percent of China's GDP, and creating 2.5 million jobs domestically. The concept of common prosperity has become one of the most important guidelines and long-term goals leading China's development till 2050.Foreign businesses have to be more careful to seize opportunities in industries that are synergizing with the goal of common prosperity.</p><p>BOZEC: China is now heading into a new journey toward the realization of its second centenary goal, from high-quality economic and social development to people's wellbeing and the enhancement of people's sense of prosperity, happiness and security. Every step forward is encouraging foreign companies like Tapestry to strengthen our confidence and determination to deepen our roots in the Chinese market.</p><p>China's high-quality development in modernization is highly inclusive, bringing tangible benefits and providing incremental certainty and confidence to the market. The new development pattern encourages us to keep upholding the concept of innovation, enhance the localization potential of our brands, and create more value for Chinese consumers.</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e64.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">R Mukund</emphasis></p><p>founder and CEO of Benchmark Digital</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e66.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Wu Dongming</emphasis></p><p>CEO of DHL Express China</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e68.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Marc Burrage</emphasis></p><p>managing director of Hays Asia</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e6a.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Denis Depoux</emphasis></p><p>managing director of Roland Berger</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://epaper.chinadaily.com.cn/images/202210/25/63574a30a3109375854d1e6c.png\">Link to Image</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Yann Bozec</emphasis></p><p>president of Tapestry Asia-Pacific, president and CEO of Coach China</p><p>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHNDLY-WS63574a30a3109375516f01fe</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHNDLY2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66PH-J191-JB4B-V189-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401290</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"3033\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 China Daily Information Co All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>China Daily European Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4848\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 25, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><classCode>CC0009SVJ</classCode><className>DHL VERWALTUNGS GMBH</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS488510 FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION ARRANGEMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"64\"><className>NAICS483111 DEEP SEA FREIGHT TRANSPORTATION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Q&amp;A WITH CEO</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Business &amp;

Fashion today thrives on speed, but Bode's \"slow fashion\" approach is the antithesis of this, and features nostalgic yet modern garments created using antique textiles and historical crafting techniques. </p><p>Her Woolmark collection, for example, comprises six looks made using dead stock fabric sourced from mills and sustainable merino wool, which she pieced together using handwork techniques including quilting, mending and appliqu\u00e9. Overcoats and suits are crafted from reclaimed and remade equestrian show blankets, while merino felt jumpers are pieced together like patchwork. </p><p>\"Bode's practice goes back to regenerative agriculture, linking textile production with a complicated but lively ecosystem ... Her excellent skill of story telling meticulously and vividly documents all materials and processes, down to the details of each weaver and dyer's name,\" said <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/3040013/sustainable-fashion-how-chinese-brands-are-going-green\">Shaway Yeh</url>, one of the prize's judges and founder of fashion sustainability consultancy YehYehYeh. </p><p>Bode grew up in America's Deep South, but it was on her trips to New England, where her parents are from, that she fell in love with antiques and vintage fashion. She did a dual degree in philosophy and fashion at Parsons School of Design in New York. </p><p>\"So much of it had to do with history. I am really inspired by personal histories, narratives and everything that goes along with collecting,\" Bode says. </p><p>Her choice of menswear, she says, was serendipitous. At the time there was investment in men's <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/magazines/style/luxury/article/3065010/paris-fashion-week-coronavirus-kept-fashion-editors-away\">Fashion Week in New York</url> and she always had an interest in men's clothing. </p><p>\u00a0 </p><p>The real story for Bode, however, is in the materials she sources, which include repurposed antique textiles - such as domestic textiles and family heirlooms she finds at estate sales - and dead stock from defunct mills. Everything is manufactured in her atelier in New York, by a team of two who do everything, from cutting to sewing. This has meant that her business has been sustainable from day one, even though she rarely promotes or markets it as such. </p><p>\"Our pieces have something intangible within them that creates an emotive response with the wearer. For example, we work with a historical mill in Pennsylvania, reproducing American patterns from the 1800s, so when people wear them, they can connect back to their own history and understand their culture. </p><p>\"At the same time, the shapes are recognisable and classic. It's important that they don't look like they've been taken from a specific era so they can stand the test of time,\" she says. </p><p>Although she uses American and French textiles, Bode has recently started to explore India, where she sources textiles and embroideries. It was there that she discovered handwoven fabrics like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/2159659/indian-fashion-labels-use-homespun-cloth-mahatma-gandhi\">khadi</url>, which was popularised and worn by Mahatma Gandhi during his fight for Indian independence. </p><p>\"Almost half of our business is made in India and it's a culture I am connected to through my fianc\u00e9, who is Indian. We use fabrics that have a beautiful political narrative, like khadi which is made on hand looms, so it is also self-sufficient and has zero carbon footprint. The culture may not be my own, but there is still a story to tell which I love,\" she says. </p><p>Four years later and her story is even more global. In January she moved to men's fashion week in Paris to be closer to her buyers (she says half of her business is in Europe), and now has a growing list of international stockists that include Joyce in Hong Kong and, as of this season, Chinese retailers such as Dover Street Beijing, Labelhood and Juice. </p><p>She recently opened her first store in New York, in Soho's Hester Street, which also offers other categories such as home textiles and children's wear. Opening a larger network of stores is also on her list as the industry undergoes a revamp and the wholesale market continues to struggle in the US and Europe. </p><p>\"Initially most of our customers were around 30 to 40 years old, but now we're seeing a younger clientele walking in. These are guys who are interested in cultures that have shaped their life and family histories and enjoy shopping either vintage or pieces they know are not based on trend. </p><p>\"We also do a lot of bespoke from the store - especially weddings - and this is one aspect I'm in interested in growing in near future,\" she says. </p><p>Copyright (c) 2020.

These days Fortune magazine, famed for its list of the 500 biggest companies, also publishes a <url normalizedValue=\"https://sharedvalue.in/fortune-change-the-world-list/\">\u201cChange the World\u201d list</url> \u2013 the 50 companies doing the most to incorporate providing benefits for society into their business model.</p><p>There are implications for farmers and ranchers in the trend Fortune\u2019s new list epitomizes.</p><p>To understand the future of the trend, it helps to review the very different past trend that it\u2019s challenging, the essence of which was captured in the title of a 1970 Milton Friedman article, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1970/09/13/archives/article-15-no-title.html\">\u201cThe Social Responsibility of Business Is to Increase Profits.\u201d</url> Though it was hailed as revolutionary, Friedman was actually just making explicit a thought that had long been implicit.</p><p>As early as 1919, Michigan\u2019s Supreme Court decided <url normalizedValue=\"https://h2o.law.harvard.edu/cases/3965\">a precedent-setting lawsuit against Henry Ford,</url>who had suspended large special dividends to shareholders and was lowering the price of Fords to enable more people to buy them. </p><p>The court ordered Ford to pay the special dividends because \u201ca business corporation is organized and carried on primarily for the profit of the stockholders.\u201d</p><p/><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://i0.wp.com/asiatimes.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Ford.jpg?resize=780%2C610&amp;ssl=1\">Link to Image</url></p><p>There have always been those who deemed this view too narrow but, <url normalizedValue=\"https://corpgov.law.harvard.edu/2020/04/16/stop-blaming-milton-friedman/\">according to Brian Cheffins, an expert on corporate law at Cambridge University</url>, it was \u201cwidely presumed to be good law.\u201d</p><p>Indeed, in 2015 the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Delaware, where so many big US companies are incorporated, <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shareholderforum.com/access/Library/20150320_Strine.pdf\">argued that</url> \u201cdirectors must make stockholder welfare their sole end, and that other interests may be taken into consideration only as a means of promoting stockholder welfare.\u201d</p><p>Recent years, however, have seen the growth of something called the \u201cshared value\u201d movement, a new challenge to Friedman\u2019s position. The movement seeks business solutions to societal problems and urges companies to seek profit in doing good. The best way to generate profits, shared-value advocates say, is to care about more than profits.</p><p>Along those lines, Harvard Business School professors Michael Porter and Mark Kramer, the originators of the concept, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.forbes.com/sites/johnlechleiter/2014/12/09/rethinking-the-role-of-the-corporation-from-philanthropy-to-shared-value/#64fca8ac647f\">famously declared</url> that shared value isn\u2019t philanthropy or social responsibility but \u201ca new way to achieve economic success.\u201d</p><p>Two very profitable companies, Nestle and Walmart, are among those that have signed up as partners of the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sharedvalue.org\">Shared Value Initiative</url>.</p><p/><p>Endorsing the trends, the Business Roundtable, a group representing the CEOs of nearly 200 big companies, last year renounced the idea that the sole purpose of a corporation is to generate profits for its owners. </p><p>Instead, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.businessroundtable.org/business-roundtable-redefines-the-purpose-of-a-corporation-to-promote-an-economy-that-serves-all-americans\">the CEOs said</url>, \u201cwe share a fundamental commitment to all of our stakeholders\u201d \u2013 customers, employees, suppliers, communities and shareholders.</p><p>It\u2019s worth repeating that these companies aren\u2019t rejecting the claims of shareholders. They believe, with Porter and Kramer, that serving all their stakeholders will make them more profitable in the long run. <url normalizedValue=\"https://fortune.com/franchise-list-page/methodology-change-the-world-2019/\">Fortune\u2019s criteria for picking companies</url> include \u201cthe benefit the socially impactful work brings to the company\u201d in terms of profitability and shareholder value.</p><p>Critics have <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/stakeholder-capitalism-seems-mostly-for-show-11596755220?mod=searchresults&amp;page=1&amp;pos=8\">dismissed all this as mere public relations</url>, an attempt to fend off public pressure by pretending to agree with it. It\u2019s easy to see their point. How many companies, after all, base their CEOs\u2019 compensation on anything other than economic returns?</p><p>But even if, so far, companies only talk the talk, they clearly feel increasing public pressure to consider the interests of other stakeholders. The last time the pressure felt this strong was probably during the New Deal years of the 1930s.</p><p/><p>Moreover, some companies are already walking the walk. I was reminded of this a few weeks ago when I moderated a Farm Foundation dialogue. </p><p>One of the panelists was Rory McAlpine, vice president of government and industry relations for <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mapleleaffoods.com\">Maple Leaf Foods</url>, a packaged meats company based in Mississauga, Ontario, Canada, that has revenues of $3.9 billion, 13,000 employees and a determination \u201cto be the most sustainable protein company on earth.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWe see ourselves as a shared value company,\u201d McAlpine said. Among many steps Maple Leaf has taken to put its sustainability vision into action, last year the company <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k4mvLnwyCvQ\">declared it had become carbon neutral.</url> \u201cAnd that means immediately,\u201d McAlpine said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an aspirational goal. It\u2019s now.\u201d</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/blogs/an-urbans-rural-view/blog-post/2020/09/01/sharing-thoughts-shared-value#\"/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mapleleaffoods.com/news/maple-leaf-foods-becomes-first-major-food-company-in-the-world-to-be-carbon-neutral/\">Maple Leaf said</url> it achieved carbon neutrality through its own efforts \u2013 reducing water usage, for example \u2013 and by purchasing offsets to its remaining carbon emissions, investments in \u201ccredible and independently verified, high-impact environmental projects\u201d in the US and Canada.</p><p>The projects included wind energy and reforestation. In the future, McAlpine said, they could include carbon farming, \u201cthe monetization of regenerative agriculture.\u201d</p><p/><p>That would be good news for farmers and ranchers, giving them new opportunities to do well by doing good. There could be offsetting bad news, however. For this meat company agrees with critics that meat production and consumption have an environmental impact: \u201cWe literally adopted the view that, yes, it\u2019s appropriate to eat meat, but you should eat meat in moderation.\u201d Maple Leaf has waded into the plant-based meat-substitute business.</p><p>That there are risks to Maple Leaf\u2019s approach is obvious and McAlpine didn\u2019t shy away from addressing them. One big risk: its sustainability focus puts Maple Leaf at a cost disadvantage to competitors and, for now, it isn\u2019t trying to recuperate its increased costs by raising prices.</p><p>Over time, though, Maple Leaf believes that its stance will give it competitive advantage and increased profits. It believes that consumers will want sustainably produced products and will pay more for them; that retailers will increasingly want to sell such products \u2014 will indeed demand them; that good employees will only want to work for companies committed to sustainability.</p><p>Whether shared-value companies succeed or fail matters to farmers and ranchers.

At current rates, that will increase to 90 percent by 2050, the FAO forecasts, warning that pollution from human activity such as mining and manufacturing as well as erosion are to blame.<br/><br/>There are signs the world is beginning to wake up to the issue, which Crawford said it had only about 10 to 15 years to sort out.<br/><br/>Soil is \u201cone of the most important regulators of the global climate\u201d because it stores more carbon than the planet\u2019s atmosphere and vegetation combined, he said.<br/><br/>\u201cIf you fix soil, you mitigate a whole bunch of other risks,\u201d said Crawford, now professor of technology and strategy at the Adam Smith Business School in Glasgow.<br/><br/>Whole Foods, the upscale US retailer that made its name selling organic food, has put \u201cregenerative agriculture\u201d \u2014 farming that focuses on soil health \u2014 at the top of its trends for 2020.<br/><br/>From Iowa to the Ayeyarwady Delta Region of Myanmar \u2014 known as the country\u2019s rice bowl \u2014 farmers are trying to figure out how to make their soil healthier and more productive.<br/><br/>In a remote village in the Ayeyarwady Delta recently, a group of farmers sat cross-legged on a wooden floor and discussed why their once-thriving farms had become less productive.<br/><br/>The men had started testing their soil for the first time with the help of Proximity Designs, a business that designs low-cost farming products.<br/><br/>The company only began offering low-cost soil testing services in Myanmar in 2018 and by last October it had already sold more than 7,600 tests at US$17 each, highlighting farmer interest.<br/><br/>\u201cWe didn\u2019t have anyone to teach us (about soil). We followed suggestions from others, thinking they might work,\u201d said Win Zaw, 44, who grows rice twice a year on his 2.4-hectare farm.<br/><br/>\u201cWe knew something was wrong, but didn\u2019t know what to do,\u201d he said, looking down at neatly typed sheets of paper detailing the levels of nitrogen, phosphate, potassium, acidity and organic matter in the soil.<br/><br/>All the farms were showing very low organic matter, which is produced by decomposing plants and is key to good soil health.<br/><br/>Proximity Designs\u2019 agronomists said this was likely due partly to the warm climate, which degrades organic matter more quickly, and partly to local farming practices.<br/><br/>Their recommendations were relatively simple: Leave crop residues after the harvest to retain the moisture in the soil, or sow cover crops \u2014 those planted to protect the soil between rice plantings rather than for commercial reasons.<br/><br/>When it came to fertiliser use, the recommended amount was much lower than what the farmers were using.<br/><br/>\u201cApplying farming practices without knowing what\u2019s happening in the soil can lead to crop failures, soil degradation, environmental damage and ecosystem breakdown,\u201d said Proximity founder Debbie Aung Din.<br/><br/> In Iowa, a state in the US Midwest known for its cornfields, farmers are increasingly seeking to improve soil health, said Richard Cruse, a professor at Iowa State University\u2019s agronomy department.<br/><br/>\u201cWe see increasing numbers of cover crops that are being planted. We\u2019re increasing the rate of no-till adoption,\u201d he said, referring to a method of farming without tilling the soil that is said to reduce erosion. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to several (farmers) in my area who are saying, \u2018We have to do something different.\u2019\u201d<br/><br/>But many lack the expertise and skills, while farmers who rent say it is not worth investing in land that they do not own.<br/><br/>\u201cIn Iowa, more than half of the farmland is managed by farmers that don\u2019t own the land,\u201d said Cruse. \u201cI\u2019ve had multiple farmers tell me, \u2018conservation practices on land that I rent is a cost.\u2019\u201d<br/><br/>Ronald Vargas, land and water officer for the FAO and secretary of the Global Soils Partnership \u2014 a key player in pushing this issue \u2014 said farmers had to be given advice and incentives. \u201cSoil can be your ally or your enemy,\u201d he said. \u201cBut in many countries, farmers are left alone. There is nobody advising them.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SHADLY-8856793</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SHADLY2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5Y01-5G81-JC5R-22FG-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">383971</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-01-13</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"885\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Benchmark Information Limited<br/>All Rights Reserved</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2020 Shanghai Daily Publishing House</copyright><publicationName>Shanghai Daily (Benchmark)</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 14, 2020 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

When that lens is turned inward, that's when you start to see everything out there as different,' says sustainability advocate  Matthew Teague left restaurant job to found permaculture centre on Lamma Island that promotes composting, growing food at home, and regenerative agriculture</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Not long ago, Matthew Teague could be found in the heart of Hong Kong juggling several plates as the general manager of a popular restaurant group in Central. </p><p>Today he's spearheading a movement, called Bridge, and asking like-minded people to join him as he adopts a simpler life. </p><p>\"Bridge sort of happened organically, if you'll pardon the pun,\" says Teague of his new role as a regenerative entrepreneur and educator. \"My experience in the dining industry opened my eyes and shed light on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/food-drink/article/3043579/sustainability-rating-scheme-encourages-restaurants-source\">food sustainability</url> and choices, and the role good food plays in bringing together and healing communities. I felt a calling to really dig to the roots of where our food comes from, and how we're able to consume so much of it - despite there being not a farm in sight in the city.\" </p><p>Get the latest insights and analysis from our <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/newsletter/scmp-global-impact\">Global Impact newsletter</url> on the big stories originating in China. </p><p>But a farm he did find, on Hong Kong's Lamma Island. There, he's embraced permaculture, as in \"permanent agriculture\", trying to provide a framework for living in harmony with nature that gives back more than is consumed. Permaculture is a movement developed in the 1970s as a solution to an increasingly overburdened food system. </p><p>\"Globally, we're trying to squeeze infinite growth out of a finite system of resources - and if people don't wake up and change their consumption habits, then we're headed for a pretty serious system collapse,\" the 27-year-old says. </p><p>A colleague, Janaki Chengalath, pointed Teague to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/article/1007431/how-green-their-valley\">Ark Eden</url>, an organic permaculture farm that runs nature-based programmes, on nearby Lantau Island. Teague spent the first quarter of 2020 in South India, and took a permaculture design course on his return to develop Bridge. Chengalath and Teague's sister, Rebecca, have joined him in his movement. </p><p>The <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/coronavirus\">coronavirus pandemic</url> has shown the fragility of food systems, and Teague believes that Hong Kong must look into building a community and sourcing food locally if it wants to become more resilient. What really struck him was the use of unregulated chemicals in conventional agriculture, and how they seep not just into our food but the environment, too. </p><p>\"This is contributing to many of the chronic illnesses we are seeing today. We moved to Lamma, began growing our own food, discovered a community and are on a journey to live more in tandem with nature. Bridge is a platform we are using to share this journey with whomever feels a similar calling - to reconnect with nature and learn how they can heal themselves, and in turn, the planet.\" </p><p>The team runs workshops on topics such as composting to end food waste and produce high-quality soil, designing garden beds for a home space such as a balcony to grow your own produce, and on maintaining gut health. Bridge also offers a consulting service to people who want to design their lives or spaces to be more in line with or mimic natural, regenerative systems. </p><p>\"Our lives are basically an ongoing discussion of ideas that are developing and changing every day - sort of like an ecosystem. We've partnered with Able Charity [A Better Living Environment], also on Lamma, to develop a small piece of land into a forest garden - a permaculture concept of a garden that effectively mimics the function of a natural forest - except everything is edible,\" Teague says. </p><p>What Bridge is doing isn't new, he adds - it is a return to tradition. </p><p>\"Historically, there's been little empirical proof to support this paradigm of thought that returning to nature has ample benefits. It's only now that we're beginning to see the parallels between science and these ancient systems of medicine that have been around for thousands of years, like <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/traditional-chinese-medicine-tcm\">traditional Chinese medicine</url> and <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/2173202/how-ayurveda-improved-sceptical-singapore-mans-life-so\">Ayurveda</url>. </p><p>\"We're seeing real healing occur because people are discovering yoga and movement - a tangible ability to connect with our innermost nature and the world outside, through the body and breath.\" </p><p>Bridge has discussions online on tangible problems, too. Last week's topic was <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/health-wellness/article/3002891/microbiome-explained-how-army-gut-bacteria-regulates\">wisdom for a healthier gut</url>. </p><p>\"The most common illnesses we are seeing nowadays are to do with our gut. Under-regulated chemicals used in the agricultural industry, such as the herbicide glyphosate, or preservatives in our food, have been building up in our guts over decades, and have led to the killing of many of the beneficial microbes that our gut needs to defend against pathogens. </p><p>\"This creates what we call 'leaky gut', in which our gut effectively acts like a sieve where all the unwanted, nasty stuff is allowed to enter into the more sensitive parts of the digestive system - which can lead to chronic inflammation.\" </p><p>Those who knew Teague before Bridge might not recognise this New Age sage. He studied geography and planning at Cardiff University in Britain, before doing a Master of Science degree in <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1483122/chinas-eco-cities-struggle-traction\">eco-cities</url>, but he still felt he lacked real, practical information that could help heal himself and the world around him. </p><p>\"What really changed the way I saw things was when I began to work on myself. I began <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/meditation-and-how-find-balance\">meditation</url> and started looking into the truth behind who I often think I am. When that lens is turned inward, that's when you start to see everything out there as different.\" </p><p>There are plans to expand Bridge's reach. \"We're wanting to develop the site we are working on, to be a functioning example of a Hong Kong forest garden. It's only little, but we believe that the abundance of abandoned designated agricultural land in Hong Kong can be approached and developed regeneratively, using the principles and values we have learned,\" Teague says. </p><p>\"We're hoping that we can get more corporate involvement with what we and Able Charity are doing to help them have an impact on meaningful causes that will ensure healthier environments for generations.\" </p><p>For more information on Bridge programmes and workshops, or to volunteer, visit <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bridgehk.org/\">www.bridgehk.org</url></p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Like cooking?

The task force is a private sector initiative started by Mark Carney, the United Nations Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance. </p><p>Bill Kentrup, co-founder of Hong Kong start-up Allinfra, which provides digital tools that make carbon finance more efficient, expects some carbon trading platforms \"with global significance\" and carbon investment products to be launched in the city in the next three to six months. </p><p>\"There is quite a bit of activity going on,\" he said. </p><p>Hong Kong is not new to carbon trading, Kentrup noted. He co-founded Noble Carbon Credits - one of the earliest Asia-based carbon trading platforms, almost two decades ago, and led Macquarie Capital's Asia carbon credit and renewable energy financing business from Hong Kong. </p><p>\"Noble financed CDM projects in Asia Pacific, Latin America and Africa, and managed some of the largest carbon trading books globally ... so Hong Kong does have a history in being a leader in this space,\" he said. </p><p>The so-called Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) was a carbon credits trading scheme under the United Nations-led Kyoto Protocol for climate actions. </p><p>There are two broad kinds of carbon trading regimes. Some are established by governments to enforce mandatory emission reductions, while others are voluntary schemes driven by the private sector and non-government organisations (NGOs). Both use market forces to tackle <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url>. </p><p>Private-sector schemes mainly target companies and institutions seeking to meet their decarbonisation goals through \"carbon offsets\" by buying credits from project owners to make up for the shortfalls in their own carbon footprint reductions. </p><p>Different types of carbon credit markets have existed since 2005 when the Kyoto Protocol took effect, resulting in the establishment of the first international carbon trading system in the European Union. </p><p>Before expiring in 2020, the Kyoto treaty bound dozens of nations - mainly in Europe - to carbon cut targets which could be met by buying credits generated by verified greenhouse gases reduction projects in lower-cost developing nations. </p><p>Since the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/paris-climate-summit-2015\">2015 Paris agreement</url> was adopted, over 190 countries have negotiated to create a new regime for internationally tradeable carbon credits, each representing verified reduction or removal of one tonne of carbon dioxide or the equivalent of other greenhouse gases. </p><p>A deal was reached last weekend at the United Nations Climate Change summit (COP26) in Glasgow, allowing countries to use offset credits from other nations to partially meet their climate goals. The mutual recognition of globally tradeable credits was a breakthrough as it led to more active and larger transactions among many more nations, compared to the CDM. In a compromise that further sweetened the COP26 deal, old credits from the CDM since 2013 - involving 320 million tonnes of reductions - will be carried over to the new regime. </p><p>To avoid double counting and deter abuses, countries that generate carbon credits can decide whether to export them to other nations, or to count them towards their own targets. </p><p>That closes the loophole in the CDM system that was the source of much criticism, where Asian manufacturers were called out for setting up facilities to eliminate fluoroform - a refrigerant and greenhouse gas that was more potent than carbon dioxide - after producing them in excess in the first place. After the double-dipping was exposed by environmental advocates, the UN tightened the credit rules for this category, and the EU banned their sale from 2013. </p><p>The demand for carbon credits is projected to skyrocket in the coming decades, as thousands of companies announced ambitious targets to shrink their carbon footprints to align with global climate efforts. </p><p>Almost one in five of the world's 2,000 biggest listed companies - with US$14 trillion in combined annual sales - have made some form of commitment to net zero carbon emission, <url normalizedValue=\"https://eciu.net/media/press-releases/2021/report-fifth-of-worlds-largest-companies-now-have-net-zero-target\">according to a March report</url> by researchers of The Energy &amp; Climate Intelligence Unit and Oxford University. </p><p>Around 30 per cent are aiming to reach net zero by 2030, while just over half of them aspire to do so in 2041 or later. Around 40 per cent have indicated they will need some carbon offsets to reach the goals, while only 8 per cent ruled out using them. The rest have not specified their intentions. </p><p>Cutting 23 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide emissions - more than double China's entire footprint last year - by 2030 is needed to meet the 2015 Paris global climate agreement, which aimed to contain global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius by 2100 from pre-industrial levels. </p><p>Some 2 billion tonnes will have to come from projects that remove it from the atmosphere, according to a report published in January by Carney's task force. </p><p>This would require a 15-fold jump in voluntary offset volume by 2030 from 2019 levels if all of the removal projects are financed by carbon credits, the task force projected, creating a market worth up to US$50 billion. The market could quadruple to US$200 billion by 2050, according to a forecast by the German bank Berenberg. </p><p>Voluntary credit trades are currently mostly done through bilateral negotiations. Project details and certified credits are lodged at registries run by crediting programmes such as Washington-based Verra and Switzerland-based Gold Standard. </p><p>Some trading is done via platforms such as Singapore's AirCarbon Exchange launched in 2019. It deploys <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/blockchain\">blockchain technology</url> to increase trust, through immutable files of electronically stored data. Nascent Climate Impact X completed a pilot auction of carbon credits backed by a portfolio of forestry projects on November 1. The carbon exchange set up by DBS Bank, Singapore Stock Exchange (SGX), <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/standard-chartered-bank\">Standard Chartered Bank</url> and the city state's sovereign fund manager Temasek will host regular auctions from early 2022. </p><p>Further afield, the London Stock Exchange announced on November 5 that it is developing a capital markets solution to facilitate the public listing of carbon funds. </p><p>Trading of voluntary credits had grown in leaps and bounds, with 2020s transactions volume surging 80 per cent from a year earlier to 189 million tonnes. Since 2005, a total of US$1.74 billion of trades have been recorded. In the first eight months of this year, 293 million tonnes of voluntary credits were traded by 172 companies, at an average price of US$3.1 per tonne, according to Ecosystem Marketplace. </p><p>Prices are low due to a surplus of unused carbon offset credits, McNeil said. \"A two-tier system of low-cost, low-quality and high-cost, high-quality offsets is the most likely outcome in the absence of a global agreement on international emissions trading,\" he said. </p><p>Prices should rise to US$20 to US$30 a tonne by 2030 for the world's emissions reduction efforts to be credible, according to a report by Trove Research and University College London. </p><p>\"We are only at the beginning of the [growth] journey,\" said Matthew Townsend, a London-based partner at international law firm Allen &amp; Overy. \"There is a significant way to go to inject sufficient price transparency into the market and other aspects of governance.\" </p><p>\"We need a single set of rules which determine what projects will be eligible, and provide sufficient legal certainty and veracity to the credits,\" Townsend said. \"There is much more work to do to set up the framework for voluntary markets to function properly, whether on sectoral or regional basis.\" </p><p>A major milestone in the global regulation of sustainable finance was crossed on November 3, when various international standards setters agreed to consolidate and unify their rules. A prototype of disclosure requirements was published. </p><p>Ashley Alder, the chief executive of Hong Kong's Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) also chairs the International Organization of Securities Commissions (Iosco), and he expected the prototype standards to be endorsed by the end of this year. </p><p>He hoped Hong Kong's regulators will be able to finish incorporating them into companies' audit and listing rules by the end of next year or early 2023. </p><p>This would help build a strong foundation for growing green finance - including carbon credits-backed investment products - in Hong Kong, whose ambition to become a sustainable finance hub is \"seriously realistic,\" he said on November 5. </p><p>Still, investors need to be aware of transparency, liquidity and the technology risks of projects on which credits are earned and traded, as they often involve complicated measurement and governance issues. </p><p>In forestry, one of the more prominent industries where voluntary carbon credits have been traded, ascertaining that sellers have sound legal rights and land titles are part of the due diligence process that is key to ensuring the credits generated are worth what they were traded for, said Allen Overy's partner Scott Neilson in Tokyo. </p><p>\"It gets quite granular and complicated ... some trees grow faster and sequester more carbon dioxide, while regenerative agriculture practices that enhance crops' resilience to climate change give rise to different levels of carbon dioxide absorption and releases,\" he said. </p><p>The voluntary market is expected to see significant growth in the next 18 months with the launch of multiple sector-focused schemes, Townsend said. </p><p>\"The next two years will be critical,\" he said. \"Realistically it will take two to five years for the markets to settle down with robust transparency and rule books.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2021.

Meanwhile, hi-tech silver bullets are fanciful, abdicate responsibility and may even - paradoxically - increase consumption</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"It is unequivocal\": these are the first three words of the sixth Intergovernmental Panel on <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">Climate Change</url> (IPCC) report. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The experts have never been clearer in describing the existential threat facing humanity. In fact, the World Meteorological Organization recently reported that the number of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url>-induced disasters had increased 500 per cent in the last 50 years, resulting in US$3.64 trillion worth of damage and the loss of 2 million lives. </p><p>The unprecedented Australian and Californian bush fires, severe flooding in the <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/united-states\">United States</url>, China and extreme <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/india\">Indian</url> temperatures confirm that. </p><p>Do you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

It is simply not a viable global solution. </p><p>But before describing the failings of NZE2050, it is necessary to point out that there are partial solutions and that it is important to focus on those that will protect the most vulnerable. </p><p>It is thus critical to have a common understanding at the international level that the best way to achieve these objectives and channel money through a global effort is to invest in the rapid development of the well-being of the global majority over the next 30 years. </p><p>And this should be done primarily by increasing their access to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">sustainable</emphasis> food, energy, and income. This means the development of economies that are predominantly run on renewable energy, regenerative agriculture, and income from jobs with a low carbon footprint. </p><p>However, this approach conflicts with the NZE2050 \"solution\", which relies on a mixture of market-based mechanisms and technology quick-fixes. NZE2050 assumes that these methods, which have been developed for richer nations, will work for the global majority, too, both technically and politically. </p><p>Thus, the main components of NZE2050 concern conversions from fossil fuels to renewable energy, the use of carbon capture and sequestration, and carbon offsetting. </p><p>While these methods appear legitimate and appealing, they will not work for the world at large. These methods may work in part for a country or a region, but they cannot be part of a global solution. </p><p>NZE2050 advocates are in denial of the causes of human activity that lead to <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/knowledge/topics/china-and-climate-change\">climate change</url>, which betrays a poor understanding of the economics of <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/climate-change\">climate change</url> and the socioeconomic realities for the global majority. </p><p>Why? Because reaching NZE2050 with these methods is simply not possible for either rich countries (the global minority) or poor countries (the global majority) within the 30-year time frame needed. It would be far more effective to pool global funds to build renewable energy systems in global majority countries. </p><p>For global minority countries, no amount of offsetting or activation of renewables can overcome the intensely consumptive nature of their lifestyles and economies, or fix the nature of their political systems, which are arrested to inaction by their own partisan democratic values. Thus slogans replace the hard work of changing societies. </p><p>NZE2050 is also impossible for global majority countries because they need requisite energy to build their nations and to provide basic needs for their large populations. This cannot be circumvented by the technology-based methods inherent in NZE2050 - if global minority countries cannot implement CO2-reducing tech on a large scale, how could global majority countries? </p><p>The politicians in global minority countries know this. What is surprising is that the global scientific community has gone along with this fictitious approach too, presumably through a desire to offer solutions. </p><p>There are three main reasons for the NZE2050 myth. </p><p>First, it legitimises economic approaches to climate change that preserve the status quo of mass consumption, particularly in global minority countries. Why give up the privileges that come with being the richest nations in the world when it is possible to use market- and tech-based solutions to disguise business-as-usual activity and pass the buck? </p><p>Second, the market- and techno-centric approach of NZE2050 provides an easy alternative to addressing the flaws of political systems in global minority countries, which enable massive CO2 release. </p><p>The sacrosanct nature of individual freedoms must not be touched even while the world heads towards collapse. As a result, there is no real political will to change, because it would challenge this pillar of liberal societies. The inability to accept that individual lifestyles must change drives deceptive concepts such as NZE2050. </p><p>Lastly, NZE2050 is supported because being seen to back CO2 neutral initiatives frames leaders of minority countries as climate champions, granting them legitimacy in a world where the public is increasingly motivated by climate-positive action. </p><p>The assumption underlying markets is that profit-driven companies will with the right policy incentives somehow generate effective solutions to climate change with guidance from the \"invisible hand\". </p><p>Historically, unregulated business activity does not take into account environmental externalities and consequently is one of the key contributions to the world's present problems. </p><p>As a result, even if the free market encourages business activity to become more sustainable, it does not address root problems. Corporations do not do sustainability, they do \"more\" of things. </p><p>More renewable energy sources or more energy efficient vehicles do not equate to a global culture of decreasing consumption. Instead, markets disguise the failure to achieve actual reductions in externalities such as greenhouse gas emissions or energy consumption through carbon offsetting - by planting trees, for example. </p><p>The carbon offsetting market is an example of a market-based approach that is constructed around pseudoscience but is accepted to preserve \"business as usual\". </p><p>There is no economic equivalence between emitted CO2 and offset CO2. It is not possible to equate absorption of atmospheric CO2 by trees with the CO2 emitted from burning fossil fuels. Trees are part of the active carbon cycle, while fossil fuel reserves are inert. Trees take decades to absorb carbon, while fossil fuel use releases it instantly. There are not enough trees in the world to offset society's carbon, and nor will there ever be. </p><p>The second case of the NZE2050 fallacy is the obsession with silver-bullet technology. This is the belief that technology will save the day by minimising carbon emissions or better yet, draw them down and reverse the damage. </p><p>In effect, this enables minority countries to continue enjoying their CO2-heavy lifestyles. The truth is, many of these technologies do not even exist yet, and if they do exist, their uptake and impact has been unimpressive. </p><p>Take carbon capture and storage (CCS). The world's largest direct air capture plant came online in September, and it can collect about 4,000 tonnes of CO2 a year -about as much CO2 as is emitted globally every four seconds. </p><p>Although CCS and similar technologies can be used to reduce rich-world missions during their transitions, they are far too expensive for the global majority and cannot be replicated around the world at sufficient scale and speed to make a difference in the time frames needed. </p><p>Yet the lack of tangible tech solutions has not stopped the ever-rising push for large-scale hare-brained tech solutions, like geoengineering, despite their potential for unknown and damaging consequences. </p><p>The US National Academies of Sciences, for example, has recommended allocating up to US$200 million over the next five years to explore how light-reflecting particles could be injected into the upper atmosphere to prevent further global warming. The consequences of this are of course completely unknown. That this has received funding shows how desperate the need is to preserve the political status quo and consumption-driven lifestyles. </p><p>Even more commonplace tech, such as efficiency-improving mechanisms, can have economic complications. Here's why: tech that increases energy efficiency will result in a lower CO2 output per unit of energy. </p><p>This is good - there is a need to prepare for a low emissions future through accelerating energy efficiency. But the increased efficiency will also result in a price drop per outcome with the same unit of energy. With a price drop comes increased overall consumption as market forces kick-in, because energy is readily available and cheap. </p><p>This is a paradox: the ability to use an energy resource more efficiently makes it both cheaper and more valuable at the same time, increasing its overall use and deepening our reliance on it. </p><p>The perpetuation of the silver-bullet tech mythos helps to abdicate responsibility of climate change onto future generations because it is much easier for minority countries to hope for a panacea that preserves the status quo than resorting to state intervention in the free market or in curtailing individual freedoms. </p><p>Meanwhile, the realities of the challenges faced by developing nations means solutions devised in minority countries may not be appropriate. </p><p>Take the obsession with tech-based climate solutions. Are these replicable in rural regions? Is the tech culturally appropriate? Is it affordable? Is it even for sale? </p><p>It has been estimated that solutions like biofuels and bioenergy with carbon capture and storage would demand between 0.4 and 1.2 billion hectares of land, which equates to 25 per cent to 80 per cent of all the land currently under cultivation. </p><p>This is simply not possible when global demand for food in 2050 will be between 30 per cent to 50 per cent higher than at present - mostly from large developing countries like Nigeria, <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/topics/indonesia\">Indonesia</url> and India. The reality is that the governments of these countries will need to focus on feeding their people, not drawing down carbon. </p><p>Unfortunately, it is these countries that will be most affected by climate change. </p><p>The market-based approach of carbon offsetting is also blind to the needs of the global majority. Offsetting allows large companies in global minority countries to buy their way out of reducing emissions by investing in \"climate-friendly\" projects. Often these take place in the developing world, like planting trees in South Africa. </p><p>Plantations like these obviously present a host of land-rights and social justice issues. But it's also the premise of the model: that resources in global majority countries can be used to maintain the levels of privilege enjoyed by global minority countries. </p><p>The entire concept is built on inequity, and it speaks to the fundamental flaw of NZE2050: at best, it ignores the needs of the global majority; at worst it is carbon colonialism. </p><p>For example, China is often painted as the world's carbon enemy, as its largest CO2 emitter. Yet energy consumption (and therefore CO2 emission) is needed for economic development - and China has the world's largest population, so it is natural to assume it would produce the most CO2 in its efforts to lift 800 million people out of poverty. </p><p>Is the expectation that global majority countries should forgo development like this to keep emissions low? If so, this implies that blame for the climate crisis is homogenous across the world - but it most certainly is not. Attempts to assert the contrary instead show the eco-imperialism latent in NZE2050. </p><p>The global minority has released the vast majority of emissions as it progressed over the last 200 years and continues to emit many times more than the global majority. </p><p>The US has emitted far more CO2 than any other country: it accounts for a quarter of all emissions since 1751. Despite China's huge rise in emissions over the past decade, emissions per person still sit at less than half those of the US. Meanwhile the 1 billion people living in Sub-Saharan Africa each emit one-twentieth of the average person in the US. </p><p>The flaws of NZE2050 manifest as a smokescreen for business-as-usual economic practices and even act as a form of environmental imperialism, allowing the global minority to shunt their carbon debt to future generations and the global majority. </p><p>When this is recognised, it will be much more straightforward for politicians and leaders to espouse that the global minority needs to reduce their fossil fuel use and change their lifestyles. </p><p>This means growth in the rich world's footprint must stop. Developed countries must scale back their resource consumption and pollution output and give room for the rest of the world to grow to meet basic needs. </p><p>As many developing nations have pointed out - the world is <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">not</emphasis> united by NZE2050. There is very clearly an \"us\" and a \"them\". There can be no \"we\" when one party bears so much more responsibility for the climate challenges we face. </p><p>But it is all right to admit to us and them. This is a more useful narrative than NZE2050 because it will help motivate the right kind of change. </p><p>The truth is that each nation and region will have different trajectories to take in the coming decades: the developed world will struggle to placate its populations when the need for reduced resource use and lowered emissions comes to bear, while the developing world will continue to struggle to provide security and meet the basic needs for its populations as climate change worsens. </p><p>This will be the only course of action. The 20th century was for mitigation, and we failed - in the 21st century, we have no choice left but to pursue adaptation though decreased resource use and greenhouse gas emissions in the rich world. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Chandran Nair is founder and CEO of the Global Institute for Tomorrow, an Executive Committee Member of the Club of Rome, and author of 'Dismantling Global White Privilege: Equity for a Post-Western World'.</emphasis></p><p>Copyright (c) 2021.

[Photo/CHINA DAILY]</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I was introduced to the concepts of agribusiness and agro-industrial chains and systems exactly 30 years ago when I was studying to become an agronomist at the University of S\u00e3o Paulo in Brazil. Although these concepts appeared in the United States in 1957 and 1968, respectively, through the works of John Davis and Ray Goldberg, they only reached Brazil in 1990 when Ney Bittencourt de Ara\u00fajo and Decio Zylbersztajn disseminated this analytical form in the private sector and academia, respectively.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This dissemination has taken shape over the last three decades and today it is the prevailing way of thinking, namely that agriculture is a complex activity carried out by producers who need to be closely integrated downstream with suppliers of agricultural inputs and upstream with industry, distributors, retailers and service providers. These integrated chains are the forums for the elaboration of private strategies and public policies aimed at their development.</p><p>The growth of integrated thinking in food production chains has gone hand in hand with the strong growth of the agribusiness and food production in Brazil, whose exports in these 30 years have jumped from around $5-10 billion per year to $100.81 billion in 2020. This was the second-largest amount of exports, second only to 2018, and represented a growth rate of 4.1 percent compared to 2019. This sector contributed 48 percent of Brazil's total outward trade. Consolidated imports, on the other hand, amounted to $13.05 billion (down 5.2 percent), leaving the agribusiness balance of trade with a surplus of $87.76 billion, which made up for the deficit of other sectors in the region of $36.87 billion.</p><p>Consolidated data from the Ministry of Economy reveal that in the last 10 years, Brazilian agribusiness has accounted for about $1 trillion worth of exports, bringing in a surplus of $800 billion to the national balance of trade. In other words, food exports clearly guarantee income generation into Brazil.</p><p>The gross production value in that decade reached around $1.44 trillion, up 95 percent, in real value, than the previous decade. The GPV for 2020 reached about $170.3 billion, the highest amount and 17 percent higher than 2019, according to the Ministry of Agriculture, Livestock and Supply. The ministry projects that the GPV for 2021 will reach $195 billion, a growth of 10.1 percent compared to 2020.</p><p>Such food production, which today helps feed almost 1 billion people around the world, represents a great success of income generation, bringing development and opportunities to the Brazilian hinterland. Data provided by the Ministry of Agriculture show how these resources helped build up important social indicators. Currently, 94.4 percent of 5-year-olds attend school and 98.2 percent have access to drinking water. There are almost 15 million jobs in the agricultural sector alone and a large number of learning centers and technical schools preparing for work in agriculture.</p><p>The resources generated by agriculture and food production has led to the creation of thriving cities with the growth of trade, services and industry, thus generating jobs and bringing development inwards. This interesting process reduced the rural exodus towards the periphery of large urban centers, with the subsequent creation of shanty towns, and has brought about a better life in these smaller towns, with more social, cultural and leisure alternatives. Young people are no longer leaving, but rather building new lives in these \"agro-cities\".</p><p>There are many instances of such agro-cities in Brazil, but I would like to highlight one of them, since we have carried out sustainability studies there. The city is Quirin\u00f3polis in the state of Goi\u00e1s. Data from the past 10-year period show strong agricultural development and product industrialization. Between the year 2000 and 2010, the population grew from 35,000 to 45,000; jobs rose from 4,000 to 10,000; the average wage grew almost 4 times; per capita income from $1,160.00 to $2,170.00; tax revenues for the state and number of vehicles multiplied per 3; among others. But one of the most interesting indicators is the number of companies, which went from 650 to 3,100, revealing an enormous creation of opportunities for people in various sectors of the economy.</p><p>Another interesting trend, observed particularly over the past 10 years, is the fact that agriculture, because of its upward strength, has become rather fashionable among young Brazilians, who continue to innovate and develop start-ups for the sector. Many youths who had gone to bigger cities to study are now returning to help their families with the modern management tools that are available to the sector, such as aerial monitoring, remote sensing, big data, and the localized application of products that allow for the management of productive areas no longer per hectare, but per square meter, resulting in greater efficiency and reduction of waste.</p><p>The benefits that food and agribusiness has brought to Brazil in the last 30 years are well known, reaching 50 percent of the country's exports and generating about one-third of GDP, one-third of jobs and almost one-third of tax revenue, depending on which sectors were included in the definition of agribusiness.</p><p>If the prevailing mentality at the beginning of these 30 years was to promote development, it is remarkable how, toward the end of this period, the concept of sustainability has become paramount. Its evolution is also notorious, since at first it was associated with the environmental issue only, but with the arrival of the Triple Bottom Line model or PPP (people, planet and profit), there was a recognition of the importance of interaction and cooperation between different agents in these three dimensions. In line with this thinking, the UN set up the 2030 Agenda in 2015 as a plan of action for a more sustainable future. It consists of 17 Sustainable Development Goals, which call for bold transformative measures in order to achieve them, and agriculture has much to contribute in seeking to eradicate poverty, protect the planet and ensure peace and prosperity for the people.</p><p>More recently, the concept of ESG has emerged, a new set of environmental, social and governance scores, which give investment professionals, analysts and corporations an insight into company performance on these matters. We consider ESG to be an evolution of the 3P, two of them being virtually identical: the P in planet and environment, the P in people and the S in social. The evolution in terms of sophistication lies in the P in profit, which has evolved into a broader concept of G for governance, implying much more structural actions. Profit is indeed a result of good governance.</p><p>ESG reports have reached fever pitch in the food and agribusiness sector, and companies now disclose their activities with transparency within these criteria for the benefit of good governance, the environment and wider society, thus paving the way for possible investments. Such information helps mitigate risks, focusing on long-term results. The Brazilian Stock Exchange has issued the Carbon Efficient Index portfolio with funding in this direction. The results achieved in initial public offerings by companies in this sector are impressive, attracting many international investors within sophisticated ESG indicators. This creates a multi-billion-dollar opportunity.</p><p>In the environmental field, payment for environmental services is the law in Brazil, promoting sustainable development by means of remuneration for the asset being preserved. This payment can be made in different ways, such as payments in money, provision of services, compensation or through bonds. The so-called green bonds could earn Brazilian agriculture $135.9 billion in funding by 2030, according to a projection made by the Climate Bonds Initiative, a British NGO which certifies organizations to issue these bonds.</p><p>The signals on the part of the public sector, together with this private push towards sustainability, in these times of great transparency and engagement provided for by social media, further strengthen Brazil in its search for the role of sustainable global supplier of food, bioenergy (ethanol, biodiesel and bioelectricity) and other agricultural products (cotton, tobacco, timber and furniture, leather, paper and pulp, among others). Despite the ongoing rise of illegal deforestation in the Amazon, which is being combated and has a feasible solution, Brazil shows excellent indicators in the environmental area, often not recognized by the international community, namely:</p><p>a) being one of the countries with the largest number of protected areas, covered with natural vegetation (estimated at 66 percent of the country's total area) and with one of the strictest forest codes on the planet;</p><p>b) being one of the countries with the lowest CO2 emissions per capita on the planet;</p><p>c) being one of the countries with the highest uptake of renewable energy in its energy matrix (estimated at 47 percent of the total, against 10 percent in OECD countries);</p><p>d) being the country with the highest proportion of biofuel use in its fuel matrix (close to 50 percent for automobiles and 15 percent for lorries and buses) and with one of the most modern decarbonization programs in place (Renovabio);</p><p>e) having an agriculture with one of the highest levels of innovation in terms of resource-saving technologies, such as bio-inputs (bio-pesticides, bio-fertilizers and biogas, among others), crop-livestock-forest integration, per-square-meter management of agricultural activities, regenerative agriculture, circular agriculture and resource-sharing agriculture, with great development of collective activity via cooperatives and associations.</p><p>The sustainability challenge facing Brazil for the next 30 years is huge, but feasible with the arrival of international investments. In order to keep the growth of supply in balance with the world's growth of demand, Brazil will need to use, by 2030, an area about 15 to 20 million hectares larger than currently used (80 million hectares) for the production of grains and other crops (except livestock). The good news is that, as livestock production becomes more technically advanced and capable of producing more in a smaller area, these 20 million extra hectares can be captured from the 160 million hectares currently used for pasture. Even then, Brazil will be using less than 15 percent of its territory, just over 850 million hectares, for agriculture.</p><p>Incorporating those ESG principles into an already consolidated way of thinking about production chains was just the spur that was needed in the promotion of sustainable development. The challenge for Brazil is to keep moving forward at a fast pace and sustainably in the efficiency of its agribusiness in order to help supply the growing world population with increasingly urban habits and, with this productivity and efficiency, allow for greater control of the prices of the world's main food commodities with the consequent reduction in world hunger.</p><p>In conclusion, society's creativity will stand for the S in ESG. Where the growth of agribusiness and food production comes hand in hand with the generation of more inclusion, the creation of opportunities for people and social development, that is where new solutions will emerge, in our increasingly digital, home-office based, automated world.

Everlane advocates ethical manufacturing and radical transparency in production methods. They sent a crew to Sichuan [province] to film our silk production and launched a campaign on their website to introduce us. After our label launched, they were the first to stop using all their other silk suppliers and switch to us.\" </p><p>Hui explains that fashion is among the world's most polluting industries due to effluent discharge, wasteful purchases and other harmful practices. Materials such as linen and cotton come from the land, so how they are grown has a significant impact on the environment. </p><p>According to the non-profit Regeneration International, regenerative agriculture refers to \"farming and grazing practices that ... reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring degraded soil biodiversity\". </p><p>Bombyx is among a growing number of fashion brands that have embraced regenerative agriculture to help mitigate the damage wrought by the fashion industry. </p><p>Another such company is the sportswear retailer <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/2186798/north-face-and-patagonia-big-winners-new-urban-hiker-trend\">Patagonia</url>. According to Roger Zeng, founder of brand distributor Cora, which represents companies including Patagonia, regenerative agriculture is a theme adopted by the brand this year. </p><p>One of the initiatives pushed by Patagonia - which stopped using industrial cotton 25 years ago - is clothing made from hemp, which requires much less space and water to produce than similar crops. The company sources all its hemp from China, though it is now pushing for its cultivation in the US. </p><p>\"After 80 years of criminalisation in the US, hemp cultivation was made legal last year in America following the passing of the 2018 farm bill,\" Zeng says. </p><p>\"Hemp production is a kind of regenerative agriculture. Hemp is very durable. People can wear clothes made from it for years. Hemp fabric is also good for ventilation, making it a good choice for summer. Growing it is good for soil as it needs little in the way of pesticides. Given these properties, Patagonia has been pushing it since its cultivation was decriminalised in the US.\" </p><p>Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario said at the National Retail Federation conference in New York in January that agriculture represents the best chance humans have of lessening the climate crisis. </p><p>\"The science is saying that if we converted all industrialised agriculture to regenerative organic practices, we could sequester all the world's carbon,\" she said. </p><p>Zeng says that as part of Patagonia's push for regenerative agriculture, the company has a material science research department that is studying how to expand the use of hemp fabric beyond summer wear, for which it is currently mostly suited. In fact, earlier this year, Patagonia sent a film crew to hemp-producing regions in China to record its production to raise public awareness. </p><p>Clients, especially younger ones, want to buy brands with social values that align with theirs </p><p>Hilmond Hui, founder and president, Bombyx </p><p>Bombyx's Hui says the concept of regenerative agriculture takes organic farming to the next level. </p><p>\"On our farmland in Yilong County in Sichuan, the mulberry trees are grown on terraced hills to prevent nutrients in the soil leaching out during rain. We have protocols on regenerative agriculture principles for local farmers to follow. They have to adopt practices such as intercropping and crop rotation to preserve the soil. Chickens are kept on the farm to eat pests that might affect crops. Their droppings are used as natural fertiliser.\" </p><p>PFG, which both supplies fabric to clients and produces its own garments, has received certification for its environmentally friendly practices, such as the Swiss Bluesign accreditation for its dyeing procedures. However, Hui says Bombyx is the first company in the group that has gone the full distance in embracing green practices. </p><p>\"The 1-billion-yuan [US$140 million] project in Yilong County was built from scratch so we could make sure all the machinery and layout of the plant were designed in a way to conserve energy,\" he says. </p><p>He adds that managing the whole supply chain themselves ensures better quality control and cuts out middlemen which push up production costs. </p><p>\"Bombyx's high-end silk sells for a similar price or lower than silk produced in the traditional way. There's no point making high-end silk fabric that is out of reach of customers. Eighty per cent of the silk produced globally comes from China, but I believe we are the only silk producer in China that adopts such a 'through train' model.\" </p><p>Hui says that the fashion industry's embrace of regenerative farming not only helps the environment but also makes business sense, especially in China, where rising labour costs are forcing manufacturers to pursue more skilled, high-end production. </p><p>\"We had the idea to launch Bombyx and the silkworm breeding and processing base in Sichuan when faced with rising wages along [China's] coastline,\" he explains. \"As many of our workers in Zhuhai are from Sichuan province, it made sense for us to build a new facility there and bring the work to the workers instead of the other way around. The wages, as well as the cost of living inland, are [lower] compared to coastal areas.\" </p><p>He adds that to continue to thrive in the garment industry, companies have to go green. </p><p>\"Clients, especially younger ones, want to buy brands with social values that align with theirs. The long-practised China manufacturing model, where a large pool of low-cost workers power low-end mass manufacturing, no longer works, as China's labour costs are no longer competitive compared with those in countries like Cambodia and Vietnam.\" </p><p>Besides Patagonia and Bombyx, French luxury group <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.scmp.com/lifestyle/fashion-beauty/article/2161790/how-make-luxury-goods-sector-sustainable-kerings-mission\">Kering</url>, which owns brands including Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, has also jumped on regenerative agriculture. </p><p>Last December, Kering announced a partnership with the Savory Institute, which conducts research and helps farmers pursue regenerative farming. The partnership aims to develop a network of farms that Kering can use to source leather and fibres like cotton and cashmere. </p><p>For PFG, Bombyx is just the start of a long road ahead. </p><p>\"Based on our experience with Bombyx, we will strive to adopt similar practices for our other apparel businesses,\" Hui says. \"We want to bring agriculture back to its natural state, before industrialisation took over.\" </p><p>Copyright (c) 2019.

Materials such as linen and cotton come from the land, so how they are grown has a significant impact on the environment.</p><p/><p>The non-profit Regeneration International says \u00adregenerative agriculture refers to \"farming and grazing practices that ... reverse climate change by rebuilding soil organic matter and restoring \u00addegraded soil biodiversity\".</p><p/><p>Bombyx is among a growing number of brands that have embraced regenerative \u00adagriculture to help mitigate the damage wrought by the fashion industry.</p><p/><p>Another such company is the sportswear retailer Patagonia. \u00adAccording to Roger Zeng, founder of brand distributor Cora, which represents companies including Patagonia, regenerative agriculture is a theme adopted by the brand this year.</p><p/><p>One of the initiatives pushed by Patagonia - which stopped using industrial cotton 25 years ago - is clothing made from hemp, which requires much less space and water to produce than similar crops. The company sources all its hemp from the mainland, though it is now pushing for its cultivation in the US.</p><p/><p>\"After 80 years of criminalisation in the US, hemp cultivation was made legal last year in America following the passing of the 2018 farm bill,\" Zeng says.</p><p/><p>\"Hemp production is a kind of regenerative agriculture. Hemp is very durable. People can wear clothes made from it for years. Hemp fabric is also good for ventilation, making it a good choice for summer. Growing it is good for soil as it needs little in the way of pesticides. Given these properties, Patagonia has been pushing it since its cultivation was decriminalised in the US.\"</p><p/><p>Patagonia CEO Rose Marcario said at the National Retail Federation conference in New York in January agriculture represents the best chance humans have of lessening the climate crisis.</p><p/><p>\"The science is saying that if we converted all industrialised agriculture to regenerative organic practices, we could sequester all the world's carbon,\" she says.</p><p/><p>Zeng says that as part of \u00adPatagonia's push for regenerative agriculture, the company has a material science research department that is studying how to \u00adexpand the use of hemp fabric \u00adbeyond summer wear, for which it is currently mostly suited.</p><p/><p>PFG, which both supplies \u00adfabric to clients and produces its own garments, has received certification for its environmentally friendly practices, such as the Swiss Bluesign accreditation for its dyeing procedures. However, Hui says Bombyx is the first company in the group that has gone the full distance in embracing green practices.</p><p/><p>\"The 1 billion yuan [HK$1.1 billion] project in Yilong county was built from scratch so we could ensure all the machinery and layout of the plant were designed in a way to conserve energy,\" he says.</p><p/><p>He says managing the whole supply chain themselves ensures better quality control and cuts out middlemen which push up \u00adproduction costs.</p><p/><p>\"Bombyx's high-end silk sells for a similar price or lower than silk produced in the traditional way. There's no point making high-end silk fabric that is out of reach of customers. Eighty per cent of the silk produced globally comes from [the mainland], butI believe we are the only silk \u00adproducer in China that adopts such a 'through train' model.\"</p><p/><p>Hui says that the fashion industry's embrace of regenerative farming not only helps the environment but also makes business sense, especially in China, where rising labour costs are forcing manufacturers to pursue more skilled, high-end production.</p><p/><p>Besides Patagonia and \u00adBombyx, French luxury group \u00adKering, which owns brands \u00adincluding Gucci, Saint Laurent and Balenciaga, has also jumped on regenerative agriculture.</p><p/><p>Last December, Kering \u00adannounced a partnership with the Savory Institute, which conducts research and helps farmers \u00adpursue regenerative farming.</p><p/><p>The partnership aims to \u00addevelop a network of farms that Kering can use to source leather and fibres like cotton and \u00adcashmere.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SCHINA-d2ef3e86-db70-11e9-80eb-3aa57b6d2433</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SCHINA2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5X65-3F01-DYRW-R01M-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">11314</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-10-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"815\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 South China Morning Post Ltd.

China is a huge market, and the US is a huge producer of agricultural products and technologies,\" said Roger Royse, founder of the AgTech Innovation Network in Silicon Valley.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He said there is increasing demand in China for agricultural technologies, driven by a labor shortage and consolidation of farmland.</p><p>Rural residents in China are moving to the cities, which leaves fewer farmers. Most of the people who stay behind are under 16 or over 50, so automation has to step in and fill that gap, Royse said.</p><p>Another factor is China's growing middle class, whose changing tastes and demand for more nutritious food also drive the development and deployment of agriculture and food technologies.</p><p>\"There are more people moving into the middle class, and their taste changes. They start eating more protein or more meat. As 7 to 10 pounds of plant creates 1 pound of protein, that increases the demand for increased output,\" said Royse.</p><p>\"The only way you get increased output from the same or dwindling amount of land is by being more effective, and that's why precision agriculture is becoming so important in China now,\" he said.</p><p>Royse said that in the US, it's all about consumerism - that the consumers want is what drives products to the market.</p><p>\"Consumers in the United States want traceability; they want to know what chemicals are in their food, what kind of labor went into producing the food, and where it's from. Then suppliers respond to demand, and they have to adopt new technologies in order to do that,\" he explained.</p><p>The same is happening in China as more people move into the middle class and become much more concerned about what they consume, he added.</p><p>\"The technologies that are pretty commonplace in the US will probably become popular in China, there'll be natural demand for it and that will benefit US companies that are already used to deploying a certain technology,\" said Royse.</p><p>Earl Roemer, founder and president of Nu Life Market, a Scott City, Kansas-based sorghum producer, also sees the opportunity created by the rapidly growing Chinese middle class.</p><p>\"The middle class in China is growing extremely fast, and people are eating better and eating the foods that they desire,\" he said. \"China dominates because of demand, and the US dominates in terms of our ability to produce agriculture products. That's why we have these great synergies, and the synergies have worked fantastic.\"</p><p>Roemer's company is focused on specialty grain sorghum with specific characteristics demanded by consumers. Two years ago, his company was connected with some Chinese liquor producers to develop specialty sorghum for baijiu, a Chinese liquor distilled from fermented sorghum.</p><p>It's a higher-value application for the grain, so Romer has been working with his Chinese partners, including Luzhou Laojiao Co and some professors from China's Jiangnan University, to better understand the grain's nutritional characteristics for that application.</p><p>\"It's a very special, ancient grain. For a couple of thousand years, baijiu is being produced from that specific type of grain, but we have to understand what grain it was to be able to try to duplicate the same characteristics, so their products don't have variability,\" he said.</p><p>Another research aspect of Roemer's company is \"sustainability and regenerative agriculture practices\", which utilize fewer natural resources and reduce the amount of carbon released in grain production.</p><p>\"Climate change is also a large part of the technology that we work with in our company. One simple example is a special sensor that measures the amount of carbon dioxide released during the production cycle of the grain. We can reduce those that are being expelled into the atmosphere,\" he said.</p><p>The US and China are both leaders of the global efforts against climate change, which creates a natural synergy for companies from both sides to collaborate, he said.</p><p>Like Roemer's company, many farms deploying ag-tech depend heavily on sensors, which provide another area of cooperation, said Royse.</p><p>\"I have a lot of companies that want to manufacture, but the big challenge in agriculture is getting the cost of the sensors down to be cheap enough that they can be applied to every plant,\" he said.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:liazhu@chinadailyusa.com\">liazhu@chinadailyusa.com</email></p><p>(China Daily Global\u00a011/28/2019 page3)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">CHNDLY-37526158</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">CHNDLY2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XM0-HW11-DXKD-J4M3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">401290</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-06-29</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 China Daily Information Co All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>China Daily European Edition</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"4848\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"28\" month=\"11\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>November 28, 2019 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Top News</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST0008XKG</classCode><className>OUTPUT &amp;

The project, inspired by the IOC's Olympic Forest project set to plant around 590,000 native trees in Mali and Senegal, is an initiative driven by National Olympic Committees to create forest network in their own countries and regions. Beyond planting new trees, the project also includes protection or restoration of existing forests, wildlife corridors and coastal watersheds and ecosystems, as well as regenerative agriculture. \"As the Olympic Movement, we want to contribute to the fight against climate change within our area of influence. With the new initiative we are recognizing local Olympic Movement projects delivered according to best practices that contribute to this goal,\" said Marie Sallois, IOC Director for Corporate and Sustainable Development. The IOC announced its commitment to be climate positive in 2024 in alignment with the Paris Agreement on Climate Change in April 2021.
