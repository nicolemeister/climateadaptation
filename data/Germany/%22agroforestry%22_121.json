In past decades, the violence has often been devastating, and the humanitarian situation is quite bad. Food insecurity persists. In the lack of competent national coordination, various positive interventions from civil-society organisations remain insufficient.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">On top of civil strife, the escalating impacts of climate change and the dysfunctional economy are undermining food security. Agricultural production tends to be weak, and it is not supported by proper policies. Farmers further do not benefit from infrastructure, whether of the hard or soft kind, like financial services for example.</p><p>At the local level, too many people have given up hope. They do not think they can escape poverty. However, according to IJED, the research-oriented civil-society organisation which I lead, meaningful action is possible.</p><p>Failures of the past</p><p>It is crucial to correct failures of the past, and in particular the destruction of ecosystems. We must rise to environmental challenges by developing and adopting appropriate farming practices. They will have to be diversified and sustainable, and agroforestry will certainly be part of the solution. We believe that food systems that are based on agroecological principles will serve the people better, and they will also help to reduce conflicts.</p><p>These are the issues that deserve immediate attention:</p><p>Grassroots communities need seeds of fast-growing and climate-resilient crops. The sooner farmers harvest, the faster food security improves - but obviously, climate impacts must not cause too much harm.</p><p>Community gardens for the cultivation of vegetable and fruit are important. Polycultures will contribute to making them resilient, and so will the use of composted bio-fertiliser.</p><p>Much more must be done for the conservation of soils and water. Plantation patterns should prevent erosion. Moreover, practices that maintain soil moisture and support other aspects of soil fertility have to be promoted.</p><p>The DRC needs an integrated approach to pest control, prioritising biological methods. Natural organisms that keep pest populations in check are preferable to chemical pesticides, which are not only expensive, but also detrimental to soil health. To reduce damaging insect populations, eco-friendly traps should be used.</p><p>Agroforestry is of great urgency. Fast-growing trees can offer immediate benefits, including shade, more stable soils and edible produce.</p><p>In regard to livestock, small animals deserve more attention. As rather resilient species, goats and chicken are sources of protein-rich food, but do not require many resources.</p><p>The DRC needs an awareness raising campaign so that as many people as possible adopt the new practices fast. Networks in which local communities can share insights on what works well in a spirit of solidarity are essential.</p><p>Humanitarian aid won't do</p><p>In view of the DRC's serious humanitarian problems, conventional aid will never be enough. We need new approaches to farming. We need to find a new balance for humans to live in an equilibrium with nature. We must find it fast, and it will have to prove lasting. To achieve that, we must pay attention to the needs, knowledge and aspirations of local communities. Agricultural research must do so too.</p><p>The work has begun. At IJED, we are cooperating with others to reach out to village communities. We are in favour of an inclusive and coordinated approach but cannot launch it only with our partners. The DRC's policymakers must assume responsibility, and so must their development partners from both the established donor countries and emerging markets.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2211202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DGB-9KG1-F00C-63N8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"620\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 22, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In  2024, Eramet's  economic  contribution  will  amount  to  2.7bnEUR in  all the territories in which it operates. Local purchases account for two-thirds of this contribution,  and  salaries  for  around  one-sixth.  Taxes paid in the Group's various operating territories amounted to 441 MEUR in 2024. 16.2 MEUR of community investment and sponsorship, a historic figure Community  investment for the benefit of  local populations has doubled compared to  the previous  year, reaching  the historic  figure of  16.2 MEUR in 2024. This amount,  mainly driven by actions in  Gabon (where investment amounted to 9 MEUR), benefited  260,000 people in all territories where the Group operates. Women and young people are the priority target groups for Eramet's social initiatives This  amount  includes  all  contributory  and  corporate  philanthropy expenses incurred  by  companies  in  which  Eramet  is  a shareholder. In particular, it includes the 11 projects deployed over 2 years as part of the \"Eramet Beyond for Contributive  Impacts\"  sponsorship  program,  which  is  part  of  the \"Act for Positive  Mining\"  CSR  roadmap.  These  initiatives,  which  are  distinct from economic  contributions,  complement  and  amplify  the  Group's societal impact beyond its industrial activities, in the regions concerned. Eramet  is also publishing today its annual report on payments to governments in territories  where Group subsidiaries are active in the extractive industry(1) , drawn up in accordance with EITI (Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative) methods.  This  \"Report  on  the  Group's  financial  transparency  at  December 31, 2024\" is  available  on  the  Group's  website.

In  2024, we strengthened  this commitment through  high social impact  projects, designed in partnership  with  local  stakeholders,  to  better  meet  the  needs  of  local populations.  This commitment is a  pillar of our \"Act  for Positive Mining\" CSR roadmap.  It  reflects  our  determination  to  provide concrete support for the economic  and  social  dynamics  that  are  shaping  the future of the towns and countries where we operate.\"             Breakdown of economic contribution by area of operation Record economic and social contribution in Gabon Present  in Gabon through its subsidiaries  Comilog (manganese mining in Moanda) and  Setrag (rail  transport), Eramet  is the  world's leading producer of high- grade  manganese ore. In 2024, the Group's  economic contribution in the country will  amount to  753.3 MEUR, including  382.3 MEUR of  local purchases,  151.5 MEUR of payroll for 10,462 direct jobs(2) (98.9% of which in the local area), and 210.5 MEUR of taxes paid to the State. Community  investment and  sponsorship reached  an all-time  high of  over 9 MEUR, benefiting  more than 157,000 people. These resources  have been used to improve local  infrastructure, notably by rehabilitating 12 km of roads (more than 20 km since 2020), installing almost 1,900 streetlamps, equipping 2,200 schoolchildren with teaching materials, and extending the Moanda market. Two  structuring projects  have been  financed in  Moanda via  the CSR  Fund co- managed  with  the  Gabonese  government:  the  renovation  of  the departmental hospital,   which   will  benefit  the  population  of  Moanda  (around  70,000 inhabitants), and the construction of a high school of excellence. In  Gabon, the  \"Eramet Beyond  for Contributive  Impacts\" program  embodies the Group's  commitment to supporting the  region's economic and social development. In  2024, five  structuring  projects  were  deployed.  Among  them, the \"Femmes d'Avenir\"  program  supported  more  than  350 women  entrepreneurs, creating or consolidating  276 jobs, while  \"Lire pour  l'Avenir\" gave  more than 4,500 high school students access to digital educational resources. Senegal: Oasis du S\\xE9n\\xE9gal, a large-scale tourism development project In  2024, the total economic  contribution of the  Eramet Grande C\\xF4te subsidiary will amount to 185.4 MEUR, including 107.5 MEUR of local purchases, 42.4 MEUR of taxes paid,  34 MEUR of payroll and 2,526 direct (jobs2 ), 99.3% of which will come from the local area. Community  actions have benefited more than 20,000 people, thanks to programs in the  fields of health, market gardening and  training. They are in line with the Group's  strategy  of  contributing  to  the  emergence of self-sufficient local industries. Corporate philanthropy initiatives have benefited over 2,000 people. Community  investment and patronage totaled  1.5 MEUR, benefiting 22,610 people in all. Key initiatives included   * Support for local health posts, resulting in 13,000 medical consultations.   * Support for 1,500 market gardeners, through the distribution of 57 tonnes of     agricultural inputs and 882 batches of seeds.   * Support for 6,000 people, including 500 working women, through economic     interest groups (EIGs). Focus  on patronage  in Senegal:  two structuring  projects supported  by Eramet Beyond In  2024, as part of  its \"Eramet Beyond  for Contributive Impacts\" program, the Group launched two major initiatives in Senegal:   * Femmes d'Avenir S\\xE9n\\xE9gal, in partnership with Women in Africa Philanthropy,     has enabled 178 women entrepreneurs to strengthen their skills in the Dakar     and Thi\\xE8s regions, helping to support 1,749 indirect jobs.   * BUILD (Beyond Uniting Initiatives for Louga's Development), deployed in the     Louga region, supports the development of agricultural, fisheries and     livestock sectors. By 2024, 183 people had already benefited from targeted     training in three rural communes. Eramet  Grande C\\xF4te  has also  completed a  major tourism development project in Senegal,  with the  creation of  the \"Oasis  du S\\xE9n\\xE9gal\"  in the  Darou Khoudoss commune,  near  Diogo.  Driven  by  a  desire  for  territorial  enhancement and sustainable local development, this project has mobilized a voluntary investment of nearly 3 MEUR. Conceived  as an  ecological, tourist  and social  space, the  Oasis covers 544 hectares and includes a landscaped area of 2,000 m\\xB2, a plantation of over 1,000 palm  trees, relaxation facilities  and several water  points. The first tourist operator  to set up a  shop here opened its  doors in January 2025. In this way, L'Oasis du S\\xE9n\\xE9gal is helping to boost the region's economic and tourist appeal, while offering local communities a place to live and play In Argentina: supporting training and facilitating access to education In 2024 the completion of construction and start-up of production at the Group's Argentinian  subsidiary, which  specializes in  lithium production,  generated a total  economic contribution  of 256.4 MEUR.  It paid  9 MEUR in  taxes and injected 219.7 MEUR  into  the  local  economy  through  purchases  and subcontracting. The payroll  amounted to 27.5 MEUR  for 3,169 direct (jobs2  ), 99.1% of which were in the  local area,  confirming the  Centenario plant's  local roots right from the construction phase. Eramine  counts over 5,800 beneficiaries of community projects deployed in eight localities  between Salta and  the Centenario industrial  site. The economic and social  investment made  - including  sponsorship initiatives  - amounts to more than 223,000EUR In  terms  of  cultural  events  4,980 people  received  support. In the area of health,  a  program  was  launched  in  Santa  Rosa  de  los  Pastos  Grandes in partnership  with the provincial  Ministry of Health  and Fundaci\\xF3n Por Nuestros Ni\\xF1os.  The program offers consultations in  five medical specialties, with 641 consultations carried out. Children accounted for 51% of beneficiaries. In  Indonesia: a  local development  program focusing  on education,  health and economic diversification In Indonesia, the Eramet Group, via its minority stake in the PT Weda Bay Nickel joint  venture, generated a local economic contribution of almost 427.4 MEUR(3) in 2024. The  company paid 155.9 MEUR(3)  in taxes, mobilized  257 MEUR(3) in purchases and  subcontracting,  and  paid  10.8 MEUR(3)  in  payroll  PT  Weda  Bay Nickel's activities created 16,784 direct jobs(2). PT  Weda Bay Nickel'  infrastructure projects have  included the construction of roads  in rural areas, the renovation of places of worship and schools, drainage works,  and the  launch of  a drinking  water treatment  project for the town of Weda.  In  the  health  sector,  equipment  has been supplied to several medical facilities, including the Maba regional hospital. Beyond  this economic impact, Eramet Indonesia  has deployed a local development program  structured around four pillars  - infrastructure, education, health and economic   diversification  -  benefiting  more  than  61,000 people.  Community investment and sponsorship amounted to almostEUR 3 4 million over the year. As  part of its \"Eramet Beyond  for Contributive Impacts\" corporate philanthropy program,  the  Eramet  Group  is  developing  two  complementary  initiatives in Indonesia:   a   scholarship  program,  in  partnership  with  the  Kitong  Bisa Foundation,  which supports 42 students from  the country's eastern provinces in their  higher  education,  and  an  agroforestry project, currently under study, aimed  at structuring a  sustainable nutmeg production  chain for the benefit of 300 small-scale farmers by 2026. In  Norway,  Eramet  Norway  continues  its  commitment  to local communities by supporting  local cultural and sporting initiatives  in the Kvinesdal region. In 2024, this  community  investment  amounted  to  195,000EUR, benefiting  more than 10,000 people in the region. The  Group's economic contribution in the country amounts to almost 292 MEUR. This includes  228.9 MEUR in local purchases, 4.9 MEUR in taxes and duties, and a payroll of 58.1 MEUR for 738 direct jobs(2 ), most of which are filled locally. In  the United States, the subsidiary Eramet Marietta Inc (EMI) made an economic contribution  of  over  118 MEUR  in  2024. The  company  paid  523,000EUR in taxes, incurred  97.9 MEUR in purchases  and subcontracting, and  paid 19.5 MEUR in payroll for 195 direct jobs(2 ), 97.9% of which were in the local area. At  the same time, EMI  supported local health and  education initiatives to the tune  of 33,000EUR. This  support has  enabled 60 people  with reduced mobility to access  necessary  medical  care,  and  three  students  to  benefit from school scholarships. In France, Eramet's economic contribution amounted to more than 273 MEUR in 2024. The  Group paid 5.2 MEUR  in taxes, 138.6 MEUR  in purchases and subcontracting, and 128.4 MEUR in payroll for a total workforce of 781. As part of the Paris 2024 Olympic and Paralympic Games, Eramet also launched the Eramet  Olympic  Challenge,  a  solidarity  challenge that mobilized nearly 400 employees.  This  initiative  raised  10,000EUR for  the  \"Sport  dans  la  ville\" association, which supports young people in difficulty. In New Caledonia, Eramet was able to maintain an economic contribution of 369.6 MEUR,  in  a  complex  political  and  social context. These contributions include 221.2 MEUR in local purchases, 135.6 MEUR in payroll for 2,676 direct (jobs2 )(91.9% local)  and 12.6 MEUR in taxes paid. Community investment, amounting to 154,000EUR, has  focused on emergency health care,  access to water, educational support and integration  projects  benefiting  more  than  1,500 people.  In 2024, 168 young people benefited from the Eramet Beyond scholarship program. In Cameroon, after four years of field studies, the Group decided not to develop a  mining project,  due to  environmental and  economic considerations. However, Eramet  wanted to leave a positive contribution to the country, so it decided to invest  in a  different way,  in the  service of  local development. In 2024, in partnership  with ClassM,  the Group  launched a  project to  set up  a plantain banana  buying group to support the  agricultural sector and create new economic prospects for local producers. The  first  sales  were  made  in  2024. 145 plantain growers were trained in 9 villages,  and 61 of  them became  regular suppliers  to the  central purchasing office. The purchasing center, called Terre d'Ako, employs 5 full-time staff. ABOUT ERAMET Eramet  transforms  the  Earth's  mineral  resources  to provide sustainable and responsible solutions to the growth of the industry and to the challenges of the energy transition. Its  employees  are  committed  to  this  through  their  civic and contributory approach  in  all  the  countries  where  the  mining and metallurgical group is present. Manganese,  nickel,  mineral  sands  and  lithium:  Eramet recovers and develops metals that are essential to the construction of a more sustainable world.

These sacred forests are often the last remaining fragments of natural vegetation in regions that have otherwise been degraded by extensive land use. They serve as refuges for native plant and animal species and preserve a biodiversity that would be endangered without them.</p><p>Many local farmers remember that their landscapes were once forested in their childhood - a sign of the dramatic environmental changes of recent decades. The degradation of soils is largely due to rapid population growth and the expansion of agriculture to meet food needs in areas that are often characterised by food insecurity. In addition, there is little awareness of sustainable land and forest management.</p><p>The church forests have survived mainly because of the spiritual values that the EOTC and its followers attach to them. Believers regard all elements in a church forest - trees, shrubs, grass, water, animals - as sacred. This reverence has also fostered the way of life of the monastic communities that live in many of these forests and use sustainable practices rooted in religious teachings. Although these communities rely on the forest for their basic needs, they use its resources with restraint and respect, committing themselves to living in harmony with the environment.</p><p>This approach is a unique model for nature conservation and a complement to conventional forest management, interweaving ecological sustainability with spiritual and cultural practices.</p><p>Employment, timber, biodiversity</p><p>In cooperation with the Ethiopian Orthodox Church Development and Inter-Church Aid Commission (EOC-DICAC) and Bread for the World, a project has been developed to support communities in the restoration and conservation of such forest landscapes. The joint project is called the 'Sustainable Church Forest Management Program' (SCFMP).</p><p>The restored forests will provide employment, timber and firewood and improve biodiversity and soil fertility in the long term. The trees also bind carbon dioxide and reduce the effects of climate change. Due to EOC-DICAC's close relationships with local communities and their administrations at village and district level, the programme has already extended its approaches to the surrounding landscapes. EOC-DICAC also collaborates with research institutions and relevant government agencies.</p><p>However, some church forests are not clearly demarcated, which can lead to a conflict of interest between the monasteries and the surrounding communities over church resources. To mitigate this risk, the EOC-DICAC will continue the dialogue between the different stakeholders by involving church and community leaders from the beginning to achieve a common understanding of the importance of protecting church forests.</p><p>Reforestation measures</p><p>At the heart of the programme are reforestation measures, especially for those who depend on the natural resources extracted from the church forests. It takes two main approaches:</p><p>1. Green Corridors - connecting nature and people:</p><p>To protect church forests, EOC-\u00adDICAC's green corridors concept supports communities living outside the forests to establish a sustainable connection with monastic communities living in the forests. Isolated patches of forest or natural habitats are connected to extensions of land of different sizes and shapes to enable the migration and dispersal of plant and animal species. Green corridors can be planned in different sizes and lengths. They can be established at regional, sub-regional and local levels. The concept provides an evaluation system for planning the corridor structures that are most suitable in terms of conservation and connectivity. These corridors play a crucial role in the restoration and upscaling of landscapes.</p><p>2. Agroforestry - a key to sustainable food security:</p><p>Various combinations of trees, crops and vegetables can be grown in the tree plantations and on the farmland between the villages and the church forests. Within the plantations, the trees can add several positive ecosystem services to this integrated agricultural concept:</p><p>high food and nutrient diversity that is available longer into the year,</p><p>lower risks compared to monocultures in terms of negative effects of weather and pests,</p><p>raising the water table and reducing overland or surface runoff by creating drainage through roots,</p><p>providing shade and reducing the evaporation of groundwater,</p><p>fertilisation through nitrogen fixation and mulch formation through falling leaves,</p><p>reducing soil erosion.</p><p>With these approaches, the SCFMP aims to fundamentally improve food security in the respective regions. It has reduced the number of days of hunger, increased crop yields and improved dietary diversity through the cultivation of fruit and vegetables.</p><p>It also helps to increase income by promoting sustainable agricultural practices and teaching entrepreneurial skills. It has further promoted a culture of saving. The programme focuses on women and youth by involving local women's groups and young people who have no prospect of owning their own land in all economic activities and in the establishment of the green corridors.</p><p>In addition, the corridors and other activities are restoring and preserving ecosystems and degraded areas. They also increase the density and biodiversity of church forests. Other benefits include the reduction of water-borne diseases and the improvement of local communities' knowledge, awareness and skills in forestry and conservation.</p><p>Preserved through religious reverence</p><p>Ethiopia's church forests are an exceptional part of both Ethiopia's spiritual heritage and the national Green Legacy Initiative, which is part of the country's multi-layered response to the impacts of climate change. What makes these forests special is that they are protected not only by ecological intentions but also by a deep-rooted religious reverence, giving them a unique conservation status and framework rarely found in other conservation efforts.</p><p>Awareness and a sense of shared responsibility are crucial for the sustainable management and protection of these vital natural resources. The EOTC plays a critical role here, taking an eco-theological approach that combines traditional conservation knowledge with insights from ongoing ecological and sustainability programmes. To strengthen this stewardship, the programme partners are committed to ensuring that the EOTC obtains full ownership of the church forests so that it can effectively continue its sustainable management and conservation practices.</p><p>With the SCFMP, Bread for the World is also tapping into important indigenous knowledge about the use of natural resources. This is the basis for the programme's enormous potential to protect as many of Ethiopia's church forests as possible. Strong institutional partnerships with church organisations such as EOC-DICAC and local and international partners help to promote environmental protection throughout the country and beyond. This comprehensive approach not only improves environmental protection, but also promotes peaceful coexistence and a shared commitment to Ethiopia's natural heritage. The church forests are an example of how spiritual values and sustainability efforts can be aligned to protect ecosystems and provide a model for community-centred, eco-theological conservation efforts.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1812202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DNW-70D3-RS6N-W4G7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-12-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1279\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"18\" month=\"12\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>December 18, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

These were mainly popularised during the period of colonialism as the preferred 'cash crops.' Most common among these include coffee, cotton and cocoa.</p><p>According to 60-year-old farmer Fred Mbewe, the once lucrative tobacco cultivation has faced multiple shocks. These include the skyrocketing of prices of inputs like quality seeds, pesticides and fertilisers. The hardship has pushed farmers to adopt new crops such as maize, soybeans and cassava. For smallholders like Mbewe who has been farming tobacco for the past two decades, change was hard but inevitable.</p><p>'Things are now easier,' he says. 'For example, the fertilisers we are using are more affordable compared to what we used in farming tobacco. I was only farming 20 out of 100 hectares, because I could not afford to buy tobacco fertiliser for the whole land.'</p><p>Moreover, the tobacco is very labour intensive. 'It requires more labour force compared to crops like soybean and maize,' Mbewe says. He recalls times when he would need the help of his entire family, including his three school children, to assist on the tobacco farm.</p><p>Cultivating tobacco had slowly turned into a futile venture for Mbewe, who testifies: 'When the prices of tobacco dropped, I was facing some difficulties in my family including having a lot of debts to provide food and shelter.'</p><p>The shift from tobacco is lauded by agriculture experts and climate change activists. They argue for diversification of crops, instead of relying on the traditionally so-called cash crops.</p><p>Tamani Nkhono Mvula, Blantyre-based director of the Civil SocietyAgriculture Network (CISANET) says: 'Intensive crop diversification should be embraced in all areas of the country. It is time to use new ways of farming like agroforestry and conservative agriculture in all the districts.' Tamani says that the tobacco market has been affected globally as campaigns against smoking gain momentum. Moreover, changing weather patterns including irregularities in rainfall are a key factor.</p><p>Opportunity InternationalMalawi, a local NGO, is piloting a campaign to support farmers wishing to switch from tobacco farming to other crops. In the first three years, it has targeted farmers in Lilongwe and Mchinji districts. Rural farmers like Mbewe have accessed 'agriculture-centric loans' which fund farmer training and purchase of farm inputs. So far, over 39,000 farmers are benefiting from the programme.</p><p>Richard Chongo, the country director for Opportunity InternationalMalawi, says they are working with smallholder farmer's clubs where farmers are trained in financial literacy, business management, good agricultural practices and different agronomy practices. 'The aim is to help Malawi farmers shift away from tobacco production which has changed overnight,' Chongo adds.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1208202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CPM-40G1-JCH9-G24B-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"476\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 12, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Ethnic conflicts, financial constraints, logistical inefficiencies, political instability and security issues are also disrupting food production and distribution in the region.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To ensure food sovereignty, local farmers must be supported in preserving their indigenous plant varieties. This includes resisting the growing dependence on global agribusinesses for seed purchases. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The complex interplay between global agribusiness, national food sovereignty and local food production deserves to be examined in more detail in a separate analysis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The so-called triple nexus approach has become increasingly important in humanitarian aid and development cooperation in recent years. When implemented effectively, it also plays an important role in ensuring food security.</p><p>This framework aims to integrate humanitarian aid, development efforts and peacebuilding into a coherent strategy, recognising the interconnectedness and complexity of the three areas.</p><p>Given this intricacy, it is critical to form strategic collaborations. Such partnerships can bring together different expertise and resources to enable a more holistic response to issues such as food insecurity.</p><p>Action by Churches Together</p><p>The ACT Alliance (Action by Churches Together) is a global coalition of churches organised in national and regional forums. The alliance promotes a locally led and coordinated approach to advocacy, humanitarian and development issues.</p><p>Within the ACT Alliance network in Ethiopia, members have formed consortia to implement integrated triple nexus projects. A special feature of all ACT consortia is that their national and international members work together on an equal footing.</p><p>One such consortium is active in the state of Gambela in south-western Ethiopia and comprises four executing and two financing members, with one of the local members acting as the lead agency, which is rarely the case in other constellations. The project is scheduled to run for two years. The budget is co-financed to 75 % by donors and to 25 % by the members of the consortium.</p><p>The region is suitable for agriculture, livestock farming and fishing and has abundant water and forest resources. Nevertheless, the communities are chronically affected by food insecurity.</p><p>One of the main causes is subsistence monocultures with very low production. The lack of sustainable agricultural practices such as soil and water conservation, soil fertility management, moisture retention, agroforestry and crop diversification are further reasons for the low agricultural productivity.</p><p>Fishing is a major source of income, but little fish is produced each year as there is no access to fishing gear, markets and transportation. In addition, the catch is poorly processed and can only be sold for a low price.</p><p>Intercommunal conflict</p><p>Gambela is characterised by ethnic diversity and has a long history of inter-communal conflicts. Since the outbreak of the civil war in South Sudan in 2013, many South Sudanese refugees have also been living in Ethiopia. Gambela has a total population of 436,000 people. In addition, according to the UNHCR, 387,155 refugees currently reside in Gambela. The majority of these refugees are Nuer. </p><p>With their large numbers, they have changed the ethnic structure in the region. This has further fuelled ethnic conflicts, especially between the two largest groups, Anyuak and Nuer. There are also conflicts over resources between the host communities and the refugees. Plastic waste, especially in refugee camps and cities, is furthermore affecting natural resources such as water.</p><p>Women and girls are most affected by conflicts and poor living conditions. They face multiple burdens from food production, child and household care and are exposed to various forms of violence, especially gender-based violence (GBV). High unemployment is another challenge for the communities. </p><p>The unemployed youth are prone to risky migration and are an easy target for recruitment by armed groups.</p><p>Ethiopia has adopted a comprehensive refugee response framework to facilitate the implementation of policies for refugees outside camps, elementary school enrolment, work permits, provision of irrigable land and local integration. These measures need to strike a balance between the above mentioned framework and local, regional and national policies for the development of the entire region, which is even more difficult when resources are scarce. The main problem is that host communities feel excluded from the economic and social benefits that refugees receive.</p><p>The consortium's project combines peace with development and humanitarian aid by promoting dialogue between communities in order to achieve peaceful coexistence between different ethnic groups and with refugees. It also focuses on gender equality to improve the socio-economic conditions of women and men. In addition, disadvantaged population groups such as children, women, people with different abilities, older people and minorities are included in project activities wherever possible.</p><p>Peace and livelihoods</p><p>The project has two main components: peacebuilding and livelihoods interventions in host and refugee communities. Under the first component, a series of trainings are provided to improve the peace- and conflict-management skills of religious and community leaders of host and refugee communities and restore indigenous conflict resolution mechanisms. Members of academic institutions and government staff are trained in conflict-sensitive programming and Do-No-Harm. Local radio stations are used to spread peace messages in local languages. Peace clubs are organised in schools to promote the inclusion of peace education in the curriculum. Project staff are also trained in gender mainstreaming and Do-No-Harm. The formation of forums for local government employees and refugees as well as other support structures for the communities is being promoted.</p><p>Livelihood interventions include education on agricultural practices such as crop diversification, low external input agriculture, integrated pest management, backyard gardening as well as the provision of native seeds without hybrids. New fishing groups are formed among the youth and existing fishing cooperatives are strengthened through equipment as well as training in fishing practices, marketing and value chain development.</p><p>Another measure supports newly founded self-help groups with training, for example in entrepreneurial skills, rearing small ruminants, beekeeping, poultry farming or small-scale trade. Others are supported in setting up waste recycling companies and building latrines from plastic bottle waste in schools, for example.</p><p>Women are trained in the use of improved stoves and in food production to increase their income. Community agents are empowered to conduct community discussion forums on GBV, including the establishment of functional reporting structures.</p><p>The exchange of experience and the sharing of best practices in the areas of peacebuilding and livelihoods play an important role in all measures. In this way, the knowledge acquired is paired with the experience gained on the ground.</p><p>Ownership of the target community is ensured through the full participation of its representatives, religious leaders and elders from the beginning of planning to the selection of beneficiaries and implementation of project activities, in close collaboration with existing and new community-based institutions.</p><p>Ensuring food security plays an important role in building a society. Best practice models need to be reviewed for their contextual adaptability. This requires the cooperation of all stakeholders, academia, governments, civil society, the private sector and the UN. Such cooperation can be expanded. The key to food security lies in the peaceful resolution of conflicts and the sustainable management of resources. Only a peaceful society can thrive, withstand climate-related challenges and use the abundance of its resources for its progress.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2708202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CTT-61K1-F00C-64HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 27, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Across the region, farmers and local communities are working to alleviate the problem.Some days, I'm able to find something to eat. Other days, I go to bed with an empty stomach, said Gebremedhin Hagos, an Ethiopian farmer, as he showed his meager harvest.Hagos, like other farmers in the country, are hoping for rain, amid the country's worst drought in 40 years. Thousands of hectares of crops already lie withered in parched fields and tens of thousands of livestock have diedWe are starving. </p><p>I'm in crisis, the 70-year-old told DW in January. What can we do, where can we go?He and his family are among the 16 million people in Ethiopia who don't have enough to eat. Many, including children, are suffering from malnutrition and disease after years of armed conflict, economic crises and a prolonged drought made 100 times more likely by climate change.The northern state of Tigray, where most of the fighting took place during a two-year conflict between Tigrayan rebels and the federal government, is worst hit. UN officials are warning of an unfolding famine in the state. Hundreds have died of starvation there in the last six months.To deal with the immediate crisis, the UN is planning to provide 3 million Ethiopians with emergency aid, mostly in Tigray. But others are looking at how to ensure people living in the Horn of Africa can feed themselves in the future, as the planet heats up.It's fundamental that we help to build the resilience of people in Ethiopia, Claire Nevill, spokesperson for the UN's World Food Programme (WFP) in Ethiopia, told DW. And ensure that people have these solutions to become self-sustaining and food secure in the longer term and that they don't fall back into hunger.Going back to farming basics and getting climate smartAbyiot Teklu, assistant professor at Addis Ababa University's College of Development Studies, believes climate smart agriculture (CSA) could help Ethiopians and other countries in the Horn of Africa secure food production in the long term.Most farmers in Ethiopia practise subsistence farming and depend on rain for watering their crops, which makes them particularly vulnerable to climate change.CSA is essentially a new name for sustainable farming practices that have been around for a long time and is the focus of Teklu's research. It involves combining methods tailored to tackle the specific climate challenges faced by a community or region, like consecutive failed rainy seasons in the Horn of Africa.Agroforestry is one climate-smart technique that already has a rich tradition in Southern Ethiopia and can work well in highland areas and valleys, says Teklu. It involves planting trees and shrubs among crops, often with animals such as chickens living among it all.In contrast to monoculture crops, the method helps enrich the soil and prevent erosion. It also improves biodiversity and reduces the loss of water.Conservation agriculture and how it can helpOne study found smallholder farmers practising agroforestry in traditional Ethiopian home gardens were helping the region to stay green, while also making money and growing nutrious sources of food for themselves.It's like my savings in a bank, I can get edible items of different types whenever I need it, one elder told the study researchers. Conservation agriculture, which is all about protecting soil, is another CSA-method. This includes small fixes like leaving the non-edible bits of crop behind on the field after harvesting, which Teklu says, restores soil quality and conserves farmland. This crop residue, as it's called, is usually burned as fuel or fed to livestock in Ethiopia.Within two years of implementing climate smart agricultral techniques like crop residue management, the highland village of Debremawi had lush vegetiation growing on previously damaged soil and farmers were able to start using other CSA methods like small-scale water irrigation.Teklu acknowledges that the current crisis is dire and that conflict and overlapping crises make such plans difficult to implement in the short term. But he believes there is also an opportunity to help farmers if the country takes a long-term development approach and explores untapped resources like groundwater reserves. Early warning systems to help farmersThe UN's World Food Programme is increasingly prioritizing long-term sustainable solutions to the food crisis too.WFP is working to provide farmers with early warning systems for climate shocks like flooding and drought, so they can better plan for extreme weather and save their harvests. This is combined with cash transfers to cushion these shocks ahead of time by spending money on extra food and livestock protection.WFP is also investing in projects to help former subsistence farmers in the Gambela region of western Ethiopia produce food that can be harvested and sold to the WFP. Farmers can then buy machinery, and access better seeds and fertilizer, which make for improved harvests and ability to cope with unpredictabily.The farmers in Gambela were able to sell back their maize to WFP and we then could distribute it to refugees in Gambela from South Sudan, Claire Nevill said of the organization's project. But with global crises competing for funding, WFP said finance for long-term solutions in the region are falling short, and most aid money is used to relieve immediate crises, like supporting Ethiopians with emergency food aid.Instability hits farming hardThough the conflict between the federal goverrnment and Tigrayan rebels officially ended in 2022, Mikiale Muruts, communication director in the Bureau of Agriculture and Natural Resource in Tigray, said 2.2 millon people are displaced and out of agricultural activities.Before the war, the region was a leader in sustainable approaches, even winning a UN-backed prize for efforts to combat desertification and improve people's ability to grow food.But now even after the peace agreement, many of the region's fertile parts are overrun by combatants, making it impossible to farm, said Muruts. He added that the most pressing concern is resolving the security situation and and feeding starving people.In the absence of food aid this time, our food insecurity is expected to worsen in the region, said Muruts. Our people are dying.Edited by: Jennifer Collins</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/ethiopia-s-food-crisis-needs-long-term-solutions-in-warming-world/a-68308862?maca=en-vam_rssnewstex_dw-35593-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988170859514912525976100217</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BCX-M5J1-JCMN-Y3N9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1085\"/><timeReceived>9:42 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Newstex LLC</copyright><copyright>Copyright 2024 Deutsche Welle World</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 22, 2024 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Publication</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Climate</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEFJ</classCode><className>FOOD CRISES &amp;

This calls for increasing agricultural productivity which is traditionally defined as producing more output (harvest) with the same input (area, soil, capital, labour) or the same output with less input. Economists refer to this as 'total factor productivity' (TFP), a widely employed metric for comparing agricultural efficiency among nations and measuring progress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, TFP fails to consider the long-term effects of current agricultural practices on soil, biodiversity, health and people. This is a massive flaw, as increasing short-term productivity may jeopardise conditions for future productivity in many ways. For example, the current use of intensive tilling methods can harm the soil; fertilisers may cause health issues; and the humus layer may deteriorate due to insufficient regeneration periods. By neglecting these concerns, TFP presents an incomplete picture.</p><p>For example, in the 1960s, India initiated the 'green revolution' in response to two famines. Geneticist M. S. Swaminathan spearheaded this effort, introducing high-yielding wheat and rice varieties in the western region of Punjab. This aimed to boost productivity, resulting in record-high output. India's 'green revolution' is praised for successfully feeding the growing population and reducing rural poverty.</p><p>Negative consequences of India's green revolution Decades later, however, the adverse effects are increasingly evident. Punjab, once known as the 'land of five rivers' is projected to transform into a desert within 25 years due to the water-intensive cultivation of rice. Continued soil degradation, declining health and reduced seed variety pose persistent challenges. Moreover, the climate crisis is making wet and dry seasons less predictable.</p><p>Severe social consequences ensued too. Farmers are forced to buy expensive genetically modified seeds and fertilisers from major corporations to grow crops on depleted soil. As a result, many of them have incurred substantial debts, leading to tens of thousands of suicides every year. Additionally, Punjab has gained notoriety as India's 'cancer capital' due to the widespread use of hazardous agrochemicals.</p><p>Despite all this, metrics such as TFP suggest that India's productivity increased following the green revolution. They focus on short-term economic output rather than long-term net gain for the planet and people and fail to take into account potential long-term destruction. However, if agricultural practices undermine the sustained productivity of nature or people, hindering people's ability to lead fulfilled and healthy lives, they should not be labelled as productive.</p><p>Productivity versus reproductivity</p><p>There is a growing consensus that a shift in perspective on agricultural productivity is necessary. Instead of focusing solely on short-term surpluses, we should assess how agricultural practices can be reproduced in the future. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider the term 'reproductivity' rather than 'productivity'.</p><p>The conversation around agricultural productivity is shifting towards more sustainability. There is a growing interest in re-designing agricultural systems in the name of agroecology, permaculture, agroforestry and regenerative agriculture. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on involving local communities in decision-making processes.</p><p>Measuring ecological and social sustainability</p><p>The challenging question is how to measure agricultural (re)productivity, regenerativity or sustainability. Obviously, it requires a much broader time frame, but quantifying long-term consequences is difficult due to the inaccuracy of current climate models. The complexity increases when considering long-term ecological and socio-economic effects.</p><p>However, farmers adopting more sustainable methods need to monitor progress. Data providers use modern technology to quantify soil functional biodiversity and the potential to store water and carbon. While quantifying soil biodiversity is rather complex, measuring above-ground biodiversity effects is even more difficult. It requires various data points, such as satellite data, bio-acoustics and samples from environmental DNA (eDNA). Making assumptions about future developments is also necessary.</p><p>Financing is crucial</p><p>Quantifying sustainable agriculture is essential for attracting financial rewards from political schemes, customers and investors. This is crucial because agricultural (re)productivity needs to be sustainable regarding finance too. Simply telling a farmer that a change in practices will start paying out in ten years, but will decrease yields for the next five years, is not a compelling argument without schemes guaranteeing compensation in the meantime.</p><p>Recent developments in the debate on payments for ecosystem services provide hope for innovative rewards for farmers adopting reproductive practices. However, we are still at the very beginning of a new productivity regime, and there is much work ahead. We can start by redefining India's green revolution not merely as a period of productivity gain but as a lesson on how not to measure agricultural productivity in the future.</p><p>Literature</p><p>Schragmann, H., 2024: Produktivit\u00e4t neu denken.

The ambition is also to help support fund raising of an additional 20 million USD to support the coffee growing communities in Kivu. This initiative is part of the unique Nespresso Reviving Origins program, founded 10 years ago, aiming to restore coffee agriculture in regions where it is under threat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 1980, coffee was the second most important export for DRC and ranked among the world's finest but declined in the early 2000s due to years of instability that had a devastating impact on the industry.</p><p>Since the launch of the Nespresso Reviving Origins program in DRC in 2020 it has enabled the production of the exquisite coffees from the Lake Kivu region, where the once-thriving coffee farming community has been, and still is, devastated by decades of political and economic instability, that continue to rise today.</p><p>Guillaume Le Cunff, CEO Nespresso says, \"Kivu has the potential to be among the world's great coffee regions but has faced extremely challenging conditions in recent years. Through our Reviving Origins program, we work closely with Congolese farmers, and we have joined forces with partners including, Eastern Congo Initiative (ECI)/ASILI, TechnoServe, the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), The Global Environment Facility (GEF), Clarmondial, International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN), and Virunga Coffee to restore and revitalize Kivu as a leading source of high-quality, exceptional Arabica coffee. In the context of escalating violence in eastern DRC where access to water is becoming insufficient, water-borne illnesses have resurfaced, and daily life is under significant upheaval, it is even more critical to help build community resilience, access to health care and clean water as well as support farmer livelihoods by continuing to give them access to the global market and empowering them in their agricultural transition.\"</p><p>With the continued investment of 20 million USD in the region, as well as with the ambition to support to raise funds of another 20 million USD, Nespresso aims to continue the work to back the revival of the DRC coffee sector.</p><p>\"Nespresso's deep commitment to Kivu is creating lasting change in communities across the region. In our work together equipping farmers with the knowledge and market connections they need to thrive, we have seen the transformative impact that coffee can have in Kivu,\" said TechnoServe CEO William Warshauer. \"We believe this initiative will help inspire other companies to invest there.\"</p><p>Abraham Leno, Executive director of ECI says, \"Since we started working together, we have built a large health center and an entire water system in the farming community of Minova. Today, our medical team provides safe deliveries and gets hundreds of kids ready for school. More than 22,000 people from the local community have access to clean water, and as displacement soars, we are a primary source of water for thousands of families fleeing violence. With the continued support from Nespresso, we aim to continue this work, expanding dignified and sustainable access to clean water and healthcare.\"</p><p>Nespresso's unique sustainable green coffee sourcing program, the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality(TM) Program, provides the foundation for the work in the Reviving Origins program. For 20 years, the AAA Program has built strong relationships with coffee farmers across the world to protect the nature and life in landscapes where coffee is grown and to strengthen communities' resilience. When supporting to rebuilding and reviving the coffee sector in DRC, Nespresso will further deploy the AAA Program and support the farmers in implementing regenerative practices such as crop diversification, stumping, soil health improvement, agroforestry etc. Via the AAA Program Nespresso will also implement a biodiversity tracking tool using DRCs unique birdlife.</p><p>Other important projects within the AAA Program in DRC are gender equality trainings. By advancing gender equality this can have a significant impact on coffee quality and productivity and the livelihoods of coffee farming communities. To date concrete examples of actions to reduce gender disparities and increase women\u00b4s empowerment includes the increase of women agronomists, currently in DRC 42% of the agronomists are female, trainings for farmers that increase women's empowerment, such as financial literacy, household nutrition, \"Safe Spaces\" gender training and women's leadership.</p><p>Finally, since 2020 Nespresso have been collaborating with an impact digital start-up to verify and trace the coffee by harnessing the power technology. The platform will automatically verify that farmers receive the right payment (including the Nespresso AAA Sustainable Quality(TM) Program premium) for the high-quality coffee they produce.</p><p>About Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso SA</p><p>Nestl\u00e9 Nespresso SA is the pioneer and reference for highest-quality portioned coffee. The company works with more than 150,000 farmers in 18 countries through its AAA Sustainable Quality(TM) Program to embed sustainability practices on farms and the surrounding landscapes. Launched in 2003 in collaboration with the NGO Rainforest Alliance, the program helps to improve the yield and quality of harvests, ensuring a sustainable supply of high-quality coffee and improving livelihoods of farmers and their communities.</p><p>In 2022, Nespresso achieved B Corp(TM) certification - joining an international movement of over 7,900 purpose-led businesses that meet B Corp's high standards of social and environmental responsibility and transparency.</p><p>Headquartered in Vevey, Switzerland, Nespresso operates in 93 markets and has 14'000 employees.

They provide food for their families and do the work on the fields. They account for 67% of the labour force in small scale agriculture. At the same time, females are often excluded from land ownership. A non-governmental organisation (NGO) aims to empower women in Mexico and supports the females of a rural community to learn agroecological practices.</p><p>The town of Miguel Hidalgo is in a rural area in the south of Mexico and has 826 inhabitants. Here, women are not allowed to own land. Many residents cannot afford basic needs such as food, access to water, health and education, which have increased families' economic precariousness and food insecurity. An earthquake in 2017 and the Covid-19 pandemic have made life even harder.</p><p>The NGO Proyecto ConcentrArte has partnered with a community foundation to work with the community of Miguel Hidalgo to promote food sovereignty. The two organisations seek to use agroecology to provide food, increase household income, foster community cohesion, regenerate the soil and enhance ecosystem biodiversity.</p><p>In 2019, Proyecto ConcentrArte was able to bring together 35 women who named themselves 'Women of the Orchard' to start a garden that relies on regenerative agriculture and agroforestry systems to harvest various species of plants. In two years, they have managed to strengthen the community fabric by sharing the work and the harvest equally. The Women of the Orchard have also succeeded in generating their own seeds, which can be reused, consumed and used to build seed banks, allowing them to maintain seed diversification and traditional knowledge.</p><p>The community project has achieved a major mindset change in Miguel Hidalgo, also because the people realised that not only the women benefit, but also the husbands, children and family members of the women. According to Fernanda Cano from Proyecto ConcentrArte's, 'the community recognised the role of women in the wellbeing of their community and families, so the council of land holders met and decided to give them a plot of land on loan so they could continue planting for the next 15 years.'</p><p>Currently, the garden space has gone from being a plot of land with only three crops, corn, beans and squash, to an agroforestry garden with 36 species, each of which fulfils a function in the agroecosystem. Additionally, income from the sale of surplus harvest has inspired the women to consider the formation of a cooperative society through which they can have more sustainable income sources.</p><p>Pamela Cruz is the Special Projects Coordinator at Comunalia, a network of community foundations in Mexico and Strategic Advisor at MY World Mexico.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1212202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:672P-HWB1-JCH9-G1P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 12, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Over the decades, shifts in population, urbanization, and consumer preferences have spurred changes in animal production methods, leading to various systems with varying degrees of extensiveness. As consumers increasingly associate extensive production with higher quality, the mEATquality project aims to unravel the mysteries behind this perception. </p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT:</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Livestock systems have evolved over centuries depending on agricultural and ecological conditions and regions. Tradition, resources, economic situation, and lifestyle have been vital in generating livestock breeds and management methods, leading to extraordinary gastronomic diversity. This interconnection between humans, animals, and the environment has resulted in the predominantly biocultural and multifunctional European landscape, which brings together economic, social, cultural, and environmental processes. During the past half century, due to human population growth, urbanisation, economic progress, and changing consumer preferences, the intensification of animal production has involved a change in production methods. Systems emerged that generally kept animals in specialised indoor environments and used hardware and automation.  </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Nowadays, various production systems for chickens and pigs exist, ranging from conventional intensive systems to organic or dual purpose in the case of chicken production (meat and eggs). These systems vary in the degree of extensiveness. The extensive production provides more space, environmental enrichment and varied diet with foraging opportunities compared to intensive farming. Also,  local or slow-growing breeds (mainly for chicken farming) are often only used in extensive production. In addition to differences concerning sustainability aspect, meat quality may also be affected by the production system. </p><p> Meat quality refers to aspects such as safety and authenticity and the extrinsic value of the product. For example, slower-growing broiler breeds are often raised in extensive systems. Although these slower-growing broilers may have a lower breast meat yield, meat quality concerns typical for intensive production systems have been reported to be smaller. Diet composition is another important factor for meat quality, affecting, for example, the chicken meat's fatty acid profile, yield, and other quality aspects. Another example is the southwest Mediterranean; the Dehesas (in Spanish) and Montados (in Portuguese) are agroforestry systems. They have scattered oak trees with understory grazed by cattle, sheep, goats, and pigs. This farming system generally uses low animal densities. The Iberian pigs, a native breed raised extensively or semi-extensively, are mostly crossed with Duroc to improve their meat quality. The animals are raised here with a diet of acorns and pasture, giving their pork a unique fatty acid profile. -the seasonal fattening with acorns and pasture, resulting in pork's specific fatty acid profile. </p><p> Modern-day consumer perceptions of meat have expanded not only sensory and health attributes but also aspects of animal welfare and other social and ethical aspects. Generally, they believe that extensive production is synonymous with better production quality. However, the degree of the extensiveness of production systems, conventional, organic, and free-range, is often confounded with other aspects of the husbandry systems. </p><p> Investigating the link between extensive farming and meat quality </p><p> So, how does \"extensive husbandry\" promote the quality of meat? And how can consumers perceive it? The mEATquality project focuses on housing and managing two intensively kept livestock species: broiler chickens and pigs. It links extensive husbandry practices to the intrinsic quality of pork and broiler meat on conventional, organic farms and farms in niche chains. The project aims to provide consumers with quality pork and broiler meat by developing scientific knowledge and novel solutions with farmers and chain partners to address societal demand, environmental concerns, and economic needs on farms and in the chain. The project is proposed and co-designed collectively by a consortium of partners spanning the entire chain, from farm to fork. It will also develop innovative techniques for automated meat quality assessment at high line speeds and combat food fraud through authentication of the final product via 'fingerprinting techniques' and blockchain technology. </p><p> The 'extensiveness' of production is a key issue and will gradually develop throughout the duration of the project. The first step surveys extensive husbandry factors concerning intrinsic meat quality through data collection on conventional, free-range, and organic farms and includes consumer expectation studies. The second phase will include controlled on-farm experiments to investigate intrinsic meat quality characteristics concerning husbandry factors such as genetics, feed (commercial or locally produced products or forage as part of the diet), quantity and quality of the space allowance, and enrichment. The third step will check novel farming practices that support sustainability aspects on the farm, including animal welfare, environmental impact, and economic viability. </p><p> During the research phase, the credence attributes (which consumers cannot assess but need to be conveyed via product packaging) will be investigated, as they offer an additional means to achieve product differentiation in the market. For successful product differentiation, it is necessary to understand which animal welfare attributes consumers view as relevant when choosing between different meat products. </p><p> Evaluating consumer perception to assist in market differentiation </p><p> As consumers differ in terms of their preferences, it is essential to understand how consumer groups in the market assess these attributes. Semi-structured expert interviews were conducted with pork and broiler meat professionals in six countries (NL, DE, ES, DK, IT, PL) to understand this matter better. Based on these interviews, the researchers will identify the most relevant pork and broiler meat attributes across breed, forage/feed, space allocation and space quality. As mentioned earlier, this information feeds into the design of a discrete choice experiment with 250 consumers in each of the six countries. During this task, consumers make tradeoffs between different attributes displayed with pork and broiler meat packaging to choose their preferred product.  </p><p> The mEATquality project will study the acceptance of new products in the market and ways of communicating them to consumers. The fourth and final step will be communicating and disseminating the project results. Key outputs are an 'Extensive Practices' app, informational videos  and EIP Practice Abstracts for farmers, educational tutorials for consumers, retailers and restaurants, and an EU Meat Database for authentication purposes. </p><p> This project has received funding from the European Union's Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant Agreement No101000344.

But too much can have devastating impacts on wildlife and other biodiversity. So, what can be done to protect vulnerable ecosystems?As images of river markers swallowed by rivers and homes awash with water that had nowhere else to go, become a more common occurrence, it is hard to imagine there is anything potentially beneficial about flooding. </p><p>Indeed, of all climate-related weather extremes recorded in the European Union between 1980 and 2022, it accounted for the greatest economic loss. Yet, its consequences for the natural non-built environment are not always negative.James Dalton, Director of the Global Water Programme at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, says many ecosystems in fact rely on seasonal rising waters for the occurrence of normal ecological processes such as distributing soil nutrients.We use river systems for a steady supply of nutrient flow that enriches ecosystems further down the river system, but also flows into estuaries and deltas, which are the most biologically productive parts of the world, he said. We need floods because they flush down sediments and they flush down nutrients and they flush down certain species as well, which are critically important. Flood waters recede leaving behind sediment and nutrients, which provide a rich, natural fertilizer, improving soil quality and promoting plant growth. It is one of the reasons that many towns and cities have grown up around rivers. As well as providing much needed water and a means of transporting goods, the deposited nutrients serve as fertile ground for farming. Flooding is also useful in replenishing groundwater supplies. While the process happens naturally in some regions, in California, regulators are planning to divert and store excess floodwaters to help refill natural underground reservoirs to store water for periods of drought. When flooding becomes a problem for wildlife But beyond the natural order of things, in a world where global temperatures continue to rise, causing heavier and often unpredictable rain patterns in some regions of the world, the impacts are not so beneficial.We are seeing floods become more destructive and last for longer and be faster in terms of impact because of changes in rainfall, said Dalton. And that is having an impact on biodiversity.\"One of the most obvious impacts of flooding on wildlife is that some species cannot escape the rising waters fast enough. In 2012, for example, hundreds of animals, including the endangered one-horned rhino, were killed when the Kaziranga National Park in northeastern India was hit by severe floods. Even if animals manage to escape, flooding can destroy their habitats and breeding grounds. The more damaging floods scour riverbanks and floodplains, so can shift sediment and soil in a way that can affect migratory species because they can't get to where they need to be at a particular time for spawning and breeding. So you affect the natural reproduction cycles of species, said Dalton.Plants can also be impacted by flood waters containing agricultural pesticides, industrial chemicals or sewage. If animals eat contaminated plants, they are exposed to toxins and impurities, which also then make their way into the food chain.Eroding an essential food and environmental resource: soil While some soil benefits from flooding, faster-flowing waters leave a more destructive imprint, potentially wiping out the top five to 10 centimeters of the most nutrient-rich earth.Imagine when you have a flooding event, said Michael Berger, consultant for sustainable agriculture at WWF Germany, the soil can just be flooded away and there's nothing anymore. There's still soil but the most precious part is gone. It cannot be rebuilt by humans and it's the basis of producing food. As the most species-rich habitat in the world, soil is also essential for preserving biodiversity. According to a new report published by the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, linked to Germany's Green party, healthy earth can store more carbon dioxide than forests.Soil erosion destroys habitats and landscapes, but also prevents the earth from absorbing water when there are big flooding events, exacerbating the problem. We need healthy soils in order to adapt to the climate crisis. They can store up to 3,750 tons of water per hectare and release it again as required, said Imme Scholz, president of the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, in a press statement. What can we do to protect ecosystems from flooding? Dalton says there are ways to limit the impacts of flooding and that many reasons why floods are potentially worse than they should be is because we've built things in the way of floodwaters or we put things in the floodplains.\" A lack of affordable housing in cities all over the world has led to more and more developers being allowed to build on floodplains, which means homes and businesses are going up in potentially dangerous places. Reconstituting the way that rivers function and going back to how they should be meandering and connecting them together, connecting rivers to their floodplains, connecting groundwater to surface water is important because that's all effectively the network of letting water flow, said Dalton. Diversifying agriculture away from industrial methods to such practices as agroforestry, which intentionally integrates trees into farming, can also prevent against the impacts of flooding. When you have a flooding event, it can slow down the speed of the water. And the slower the water is running, the less erosion you have, said Berger. We as humans facing climate change with all its flooding events or drought events, we should definitely go for nature-based solutions instead of putting concrete everywhere and believing we can solve everything with our technology, he said.

They need to be empowered so they become more resilient. Better land tenure serves that purpose because it enables them to adapt to the changing climate in ways that suit their specific needs:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Secure tenure gives rural communities a long-term stake in the health of their land and thus creates incentives to invest in sustainable land-management practices. Land ownership also ensures they have resources for doing so.</p><p>Experience shows that rural communities with secure land tenure are indeed more likely to adopt practices that prevent soil erosion, promote agroforestry and conserve water resources. These measures serve resilience against climate change-induced disasters.</p><p>Land tenure enables communities to engage in efforts to conserve biodiversity. When communities have control over their land, they are more likely to establish protected areas, implement wildlife corridors and apply traditional ecological knowledge in ways that safeguard local biodiversity. Diverse ecosystems, in turn, are more resilient to climate disruptions.</p><p>Rural communities intimately understand the unique climate challenges they face. With secure land tenure, they will develop local adaptation strategies that suit their needs, including crop diversification, soil improvement and sustainable water management.</p><p>At the same time, secure land tenure serves climate-change mitigation too:</p><p>Trees take many years to grow, and rural families who know they will benefit from long-term investments are more likely to engage in afforestation and reforestation. Trees are carbon sinks, absorbing atmospheric carbon dioxide and mitigating greenhouse-gas emissions. To some extent, international funding is available for afforestation and reforestation. However, secure tenure rights are often a precondition for participating in projects related to REDD (Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation).</p><p>Tenure security allows communities to invest in agroecology and organic farming. These environment-friendly methods reduce the need for chemical inputs, ultimately lowering carbon emissions from the agricultural sector.</p><p>People with land-tenure rights can participate in generation of solar and wind power. By diversifying sources of revenue and contributing to clean energy generation, these initiatives help to reduce the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Advocacy matters</p><p>The empowerment of local rural communities through secure land-tenure rights requires concerted efforts on multiple fronts. Too many rural people have no rights - or only rather shaky rights - to the land they depend on. Women in particular are often denied what they should be entitled to.</p><p>Advocacy plays a pivotal role in ensuring that policymakers recognise the intrinsic links between land tenure on the one hand and climate adaptation and mitigation on the other. Advocacy groups will obviously benefit from solid data and scientific evidence. It is important to highlight success stories. Such examples can inspire others and encourage policymakers to promote change. On the other hand, case studies and evidence documenting disasters can help to avoid repeating mistakes.</p><p>A positive example is the promotion of mangrove co-management approaches in Bangladesh. A key component was the allocation of clear tenure rights to local communities. Land tenure allows them to use and manage mangroves in ways that increase their resilience to flooding resulting from sea-level rise.</p><p>It is important to push for reforms and policy initiatives to enhance local people's land tenure. It also makes sense to promote collective land use planning, involving rural communities in climate action. Relevant policy measures include:</p><p>the legal recognition of customary land rights,</p><p>streamlined land-registration processes and</p><p>protection against land grabbing.</p><p>Collective action</p><p>Advocacy is more effective when diverse stakeholders collaborate. Civil-society organisations, community-based initiatives, research institutions and government agencies should cooperate on amplifying the message. So far, however, there is a lack of grassroots involvement. All too often, local voices are not heard. Community-based organisations must be empowered, not least because they are essential for reaching out to rural people and convincing them of new approaches.</p><p>The Global Forum on Agricultural Research and Innovation is a multi-stakeholder membership-based platform. To emphasise inclusiveness, it will soon change its acronym from GFAR to GFAiR. Its mission includes focusing on small farmers' empowerment. Among other things, it engages in what it calls Collective Actions. One of them is called 'Mainstreaming land rights of the rural poor in the climate discourse'. In this context, a diverse set of stakeholders is exploring common interests and identifying priorities for addressing the extreme vulnerability of landless or almost landless poor in regard to the fast growing risks of climate-induced disasters. Core objectives are to:</p><p>raise awareness for the relevance of land tenure,</p><p>promote the involvement of local communities,</p><p>ensure open access to relevant data and</p><p>share best practices.</p><p>This Collective Action is coordinated by ANGOC (the Asian NGO Coalition for Agrarian Reform and Rural Development). This GFAR member also laid the foundations for the Collective Action. Other partners include the Netherlands-based Land Portal Foundation, the Association for Land Reform and Development (ALRD) in Bangladesh, the multisectoral and international Global Land Tool Network (GLTN) and the Asia-Pacific Association of Agricultural Research Institutions (APAARI).</p><p>The empowerment of local communities is necessary both for mitigating and adapting to climate change. Where people have secure land tenure, they become stewards of the environment. Their rights must be ensured accordingly.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP0811202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69K8-WMY1-F00C-61VJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-08</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"976\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"08\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 8, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

At the same time, food production contributes to climate change, causing about 30?% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. This multifaceted problem needs a multifaceted solution. The global community, and countries in their contexts, must modify food systems in ways that overcome current food insecurity and ensure food security long term. All issues must be addressed head on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Food security' is defined as access to sufficient quantities of food in appropriate quality. It obviously depends on an adequate and affordable supply of all ingredients required for a nutritious diet. Today, about 735 million people around the world do not get sufficient food and are undernourished as a result. About 3 billion, moreover, do not consume healthy diets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unless comprehensive action is taken, the climate crisis will make matters worse. A holistic agri-food system perspective must consider the entire range of actors involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products. It must also take account of agriculture (including livestock), forestry, fisheries and food industries, as well as the broader economy, social disparities and the natural environment.</p><p>A sustainable food system must achieve good nutrition for all in a way that preserves the foundations of future generations' food security. This challenge has economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions. It is crucial to preventing further loss of biodiversity and to stabilising the climate.</p><p>Mitigation, adaptation, transformation</p><p>Many national food systems, as well as the global food system, are losing resilience. 'Resilience' is the capability to cope with shocks without significant loss of livelihood, health and nutrition. Food-system resilience can be understood as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure to climate risks. It is therefore essential to limit the climate-related hazards that affect food supply, reduce food systems' vulnerability and lower people's exposure to risks. Three policy approaches serve this triple purpose:</p><p>Mitigation of climate change. Radically reducing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is indispensable for sustainable food security. Global heating is leading to extreme weather events, which affect production as well as farm workers' health. Moreover, recent science suggests that extreme heat curtails photosynthesis, with serious impacts on crops and forests. And this is not just a terrestrial agenda, because climate change affects oceans, which also have a bearing on food systems. Nature-based solutions such as agroforestry, coupled with sustainable land and soil management, serve mitigation. However, mitigation in itself is no longer enough to safeguard food security.</p><p>Adaptation to climate change. People can protect themselves by increasing their chances to cope. Important issues include affordable access to clean energy, water and healthcare. All of them have a bearing on good nutrition. Long-term adaptation, however, will be impossible unless mitigation puts an end to further heating.</p><p>Transformation. Socio-ecological systems, including the lifestyles of wealthy nations, must change to become sustainable. In particular, people in high-income countries must reduce their consumption and assume responsibility for their impact on the environment.</p><p>The climate crisis negatively affects food security in several ways. For example, access to safe drinking water is becoming more precarious. Climate events like floods often disrupt it. Diarrhoeal diseases, however, affect humans' intake of micronutrients. These illnesses have a strong correlation with rising temperatures. At the same time, heat waves make it more difficult to handle food safely.</p><p>The climate crisis also affects market dynamics and causes price volatility. Price hikes are happening more frequently. Several issues can exacerbate the impacts of weather-related shortfalls in food production. They include poor market transparency, financial speculation in commodity markets as well as export restrictions. The current grain-market disruptions resulting from Russia's attack on Ukraine show how important unrestricted exports are.</p><p>Crucial policy areas</p><p>Policymakers' action must not only boost food systems' resilience against known risks around the world, but also increase resilience to so-far unknown ones. Cross-cutting action is necessary. In particular, progress is needed in seven policy areas:</p><p>Sustainable land management (SLM): Relevant aspects include sustainable water management, ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, climate adaptation and mitigation as well as the protection of biodiversity. SLM incentives (such as payments for ecosystem services) are necessary. Crop cultivation and livestock production must be practiced in economically viable and environmentally sustainable ways. Social protection. Poverty often undermines families' food security. Nutrition interventions like school meal programmes are helpful. So are cash-transfer schemes or job creation. Countries with low and middle incomes deserve support for improving social protection. Access to healthcare and education are essential. Where related polices are not in place, they should be adopted. Food security hinges on the reduction of inequality. Diversification. Diversifying agriculture and supply chains strengthens food-system resilience. However, diversification has costs as it reduces opportunities for economies of scale and specialisation. Transaction costs tend to rise accordingly. Another challenge is that resilience is not just about withstanding current shocks, but also about maintaining the capacity for future development. If diversification hampers the latter, it is not fully conducive to resilience building.</p><p>International trade. Ensuring free and open global food trade will require a reinvigoration of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Panic-induced border closures lead to international price spikes. Transparent information on production, stocks and government interventions around the world is critical and must be made publicly available (e.g., through the Agricultural Market Information System - AMIS). Trade facilitation in terms of investments in infrastructure - including particularly the digitisation of customs systems - matters too.</p><p>Insurance is a promising tool to strengthen food-system resilience. It spreads both the risks and the costs of negative shocks among a large pool of people, enhancing resilience at the level of individuals. However, it does not prevent or reduce climate risks. Insurance may thus prove counterproductive if it motivates people to continue unsustainable activities. Though this kind of financial service is quite effective in terms of managing individual shocks, it is less useful when many people experience shock impacts at once, as is typically the case in extreme weather events. Migration. In response to the climate crisis, people are leaving their homes. In some cases, migration is basically a form of livelihood diversification. Remittances from migrant workers contribute to their families' resilience after all. However, entire areas are likely to become uninhabitable, for example, as the rising sea level inundates islands. Migration processes and policies need to be coordinated, and both sending and receiving countries must act in ways that make migration strengthen the resilience of individuals and systems. Climate refugees from countries that are becoming uninhabitable must get an internationally recognised climate refugee passport.</p><p>Science-based innovation. Science is facilitating key innovations in food systems, including efforts to reduce risks and to enhance productivity. Bioscience and digital technology are important. Scientific research also helps to find new ways to maintain and, if necessary, renew productive soils, water resources and even entire landscapes. Science is also needed to protect biodiversity, including agricultural genetic diversity. Research can help to reduce inequality too. More funding is needed for research on food systems.</p><p>We live in the Anthropocene, the age in which humanity is shaping the Earth's geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere. Action to enhance food security must be embedded in a broad strategic agenda of transformation. The global community must shift to a sustainable bioeconomy. It also needs a coherent governance structure to safeguard both food security and the global environment. The SDGs provide the concept, but not the policy framework for such joint action.</p><p>Long-term food security is intricately linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biodiversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Sustainable Development Goals. So far, appropriate funding has not been made available for any of the above-mentioned global agreements.

Such unique forms of land use have evolved over centuries, harmonising with nature. The wisdom passed down through generations has resulted in sustainable ecosystems, enabling local communities to feed themselves while also preserving natural resources.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) recognises such unique ecosystems by designating them Globally Important Agricultural Heritage Systems (GIAHS). China boasts 19 out of the 74 GIAHS worldwide as of June 2023. Qingtian county in Zhejiang Province is known for its traditional rice-fish culture, while other GIAHS in China include a mountainous region, also in Zhejiang, where mushroom cultivation coexists with sustainable agroforestry, and the city of Fuzhou with its jasmine and tea culture system.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">GIAHS are complex systems with interconnected components working together. They exhibit remarkable agrobiodiversity, which is defined by the FAO as the variety of animals, plants and microorganisms that are used directly or indirectly for food and agriculture, including crops, livestock, forestry and fisheries.</p><p>A key aspect of GIAHS is the presence of different types of diversity, namely:</p><p>agri-species diversity,</p><p>agroecosystem and landscape diversity and</p><p>agricultural diversity.</p><p>Biodiversity strengthens ecosystems</p><p>There are several ways to enhance agri-species diversity. One method is mixed cropping, where different crops are grown together in the same field. Another approach is intercropping, where a crop is planted immediately after another crop is harvested in the same field (Zhang et al., 2016). Introducing other species is an option too. For example, as mentioned above, rice fields can be enriched with fish and, in some cases, ducks as well.</p><p>Positive interactions can arise when different species utilise available resources in their unique ways. For example, rice plants provide both nourishment and shade to fish. In return, the fish consume pests, enhance the soil and fertilise the plants through their waste.</p><p>Increased biodiversity can therefore enhance ecosystem functions, productivity and stability. A study conducted in Zhejiang found that rice yields in rice-fish culture were significantly higher than in rice monoculture without fish. This improvement was achieved without the use of pesticides. Additionally, the presence of fish minimised weed and pest populations (Xie et al., 2011). Other studies have arrived at similar results.</p><p>Agroecosystem and landscape diversity</p><p>In various GIAHS locations, distinctive agricultural landscapes have developed as a result of the dynamic interplay between humans and nature. They can consist of forests, grasslands or farmlands and can also be influenced by rivers and lakes. Moreover, the homes of the local residents who have contributed to the formation of these areas over extended periods, are an integral part of these landscapes.</p><p>One example of resourceful land management can be found in northern China's mountainous region of Shexian. Throughout the centuries, residents constructed large-scale dryland terraces on steep hillsides. These structures allow them to optimise the use of limited water and soil resources. On these terraces, they grow a variety of crops such as Chinese prickly ash, walnuts, millet and corn. The resulting cultivated landscape is a mixture of stone terraces, forests, shrubs, waterways and communities in the valley. The individual components are closely interconnected and coexist harmoniously.</p><p>Agri-cultural diversity</p><p>Biodiversity is also closely connected to cultural diversity. In areas designated as GIAHS, local residents have adapted to their natural environment over long periods of time. The rich experiences of various ethnic groups are evident in their unique cultures, which form a significant aspect of GIAHS. In southern China, for example, the Dong people keep not only fish in their rice fields, but also ducks. This diversity in agriculture is tightly interwoven with their traditional culture, encompassing aspects such as diet, clothing, architecture and medicine. Additionally, immaterial aspects like religion, traditions and locally applied rules play a role in preserving agricultural diversity (Min et al., 2008, Zhang et al., 2016).</p><p>Protecting valuable agricultural landscapes</p><p>There are three main steps to protecting unique agroecosystems efficiently. First, it is important to understand why residents value and maintain the ecosystem. That requires conducting in-depth research on the subject and showing respect for the local communities.</p><p>Second, broad participation in protective measures is essential. China has introduced a five-step approach that involves governments, corporations, researchers, social organisations and farmers (Min et al., 2022). The latter play a particularly important role in protecting the biodiversity of GIAHS.</p><p>Third, it is crucial to promote multi-disciplinary research (Zhang et al., 2016). This involves providing assistance to researchers, farmers and other stakeholders so they can explore the various benefits that ecosystems offer to humanity. The focus should be on the relationship between economic development and the preservation of agrobiodiversity. That includes supporting agricultural practices which help maintain this diversity.</p><p>Protection and productivity</p><p>To preserve biodiversity, it is beneficial for GIAHS regions to be economically productive. The distinct ecological environments of GIAHS offer good conditions for producing high quality (organic) products. Considering the growing demand for healthier food in China, these products have strong market potential.</p><p>Brands have been successfully created in various places, for instance in the aforementioned Qingtian county, where rice cultivation is combined with fish farming. The GIAHS project significantly enhanced the recognition of both rice and fish. As a result, rice produced by that method commands notably higher prices than conventional rice. The price of fish has also risen sharply since the project's start (Zhang et al., 2016). Other GIAHS locations in China have achieved remarkable success in marketing their products as well (Zhang et al., 2016).</p><p>GIAHS combine traditional cultivation techniques with modern approaches to sustainability and resource efficiency. They offer a blueprint for living and doing business sustainably and in harmony with nature. We should follow their example when it comes to tackling major global challenges like the climate crisis, disaster preparedness, food security and biodiversity loss.</p><p>References</p><p>GIAHS at the FAO:</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.fao.org/giahs\">https://www.fao.org/giahs</url></p><p>Min, Q., Zhang, D., 2008: Ecological connotation of some Dong Minority's taboos.

This year, on 6 and 7 October, the focus was on the connection between climate and biodiversity protection. In the course of the DFF, KfW published a supplement in D+C/E+Z. We will publish every contributions separately on our website. This contribution explains why indigenous peoples and smallholders in Central America receive support if they farm in a traditional and sustainable way. Because it benefits biodiversity and helps against external shocks.</p><p>Many indigenous and smallholder communities in Central America feel that their livelihoods are threatened by predatory competition from industrial agriculture. Increasingly, priority must be placed on cultivating a few highly productive crops in place of their traditional varieties.</p><p>Other communities, on the other hand, live in such remote regions that they have no access to markets or financial capital. In order to support the rural population while simultaneously counteracting species loss, KfW has launched a regional programme on behalf of the German Federal Government with the aim of promoting agrobiodiversity in and through indigenous smallholder communities.</p><p>Example in Tacuba, El Salvador: The community is located on the edge of El Imposible National Park, the country's largest and species-rich national park. Around 400 tree species, almost 300 different bird species, numerous mammals and hundreds of species of butterflies are found there. The population is largely indigenous and thrives on agriculture.</p><p>Smallholder families receive support from the regional 'Agrobiodiversity in Central America' programme so that they can maintain their traditional production methods. 'It's about improving the nutritional situation while simultaneously preserving the diversity of their natural environment,' said Susanne Berghaus, Portfolio Manager. This preserves the gene pool, which is crucial for adapting to changing climatic conditions. This approach also increases balance within the ecosystem - which in turn contributes to climate change mitigation, as plants, forests and soil generate carbon sinks.</p><p>A total of 25,000 people in Belize, Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras and Panama benefit from the programme, which has three main objectives: to improve productivity on traditional farms, to further process and market their products and to disseminate knowledge about plants and traditional farming practices.</p><p>The Costa Rica-based non-governmental organisation ACICAFOC (Asociaci\u00f3n Coordinadora Ind\u00edgena y Campesina de Agroforester\u00eda Comunitaria Centroamericana) is implementing the programme for KfW. There is a lively exchange with the indigenous smallholders; the support ideas usually come from the local groups themselves.</p><p>A lot has happened in the community of Tacuba since the promotional activities began. Gardens for medicinal plants have been created as well as croplands for cassava, coffee and cocoa, and fruit trees with varieties such as papaya, loquat, avocado, guan\u00e1bana or pigeon peas. Local vegetables such as Creole cucumber or spinach also grow there. The fact that everything blooms and sprouts is also due to a good dozen reservoirs for rain water, which were built with the help of the programme. The special thing about it is that farming activities take place within an agroforestry system; in other words, they are combined with trees or shrubs - this is important for climate change mitigation.</p><p>Almost 70 small-scale projects and communities are now part of the programme. The measures look a little different everywhere, but they have the same goal: to secure the livelihoods of the predominantly poor population by using traditional and sustainable farming practices. 'This is good for people and for the environment - which means that people will ultimately benefit from it twice,' said Susanne Berghaus, describing the success of the programme.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1610202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66MS-3RG1-F00C-628V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"739\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"16\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 16, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The full updated announcement is set out below. The above change has been reflected in the Energy Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24) which is available on the Shell website and has been marked with a footnote in the ETS24 itself. An updated version of the ETS24 has also been filed with the NSM. ---   * Shell will continue its drive to halve emissions from its operations (Scope     1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2023,     Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net     carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with     2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.   * To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a     new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products     by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [A].   * Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of     2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in     the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. \"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer. \"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world- leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets:   * By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve     emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above     and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization     Charter agreed at COP28.   * We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were     one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane     emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity -     significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to     the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further     supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring.   * In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the     energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the     third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors   * For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and     performance please read the full report, online here:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>)   * Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at     Shell's 2024 AGM.   * Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales     volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and     reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.   * We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our     oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).     That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer     emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517     million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes     CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by     2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes,     impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.   * Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by     both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions).     While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we     cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments     and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in     demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions,     more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition     of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of     renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy,     one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our     determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to     our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up     low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of     Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the     largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.   * Find out more about Shell's 2023 Capital Markets Day online:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>) Enquiries UK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550 Shell plc - Energy Transition Strategy Chair's message This energy transition update marks an important moment for Shell. It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].  A. Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\\xEDzen  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low- carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one- third compared with the world's best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company     of Nigeria Limited (SPDC  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]  A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the     40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes     associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading     purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.

H. Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by     2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.  I. We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use     of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category     11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category     11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and     569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles.

Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this 10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Source: Shell analysis of IEA Extended Energy Balances (2023). Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low- carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. In non-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10% of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio- feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector.  A. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap     reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO(2) emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio- alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel                             Passenger road transport    Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25   million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil   production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles,  including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging           points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO(2) includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO(2) emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.  A. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low- carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:   * Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon     intensity.   * Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil     production stable.   * Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to     offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s. -------------------------------------------------   Estimated share of energy sales 2016-2030 [A] +------------------+------+------+--------------+ |                  | 2016 | 2023 | 2030         | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Oil products [B] | 57%  | 48%  | 39%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | LNG              | 14%  | 22%  | 26%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Pipeline gas     | 25%  | 21%  | 21%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Electricity      | 3%   | 7%   | 11%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Biofuels         | 1%   | 2%   | 3%           | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ [A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non- operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.  A. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities     (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where     hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.  A.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to:   * Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional     energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and     hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.   * Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil     products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in     areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.   * Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of     the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own     production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutions     for our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future   * Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and     lubricant offerings   * Building for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels   * Preparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storage   * Supported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low- carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low- carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today.   Scaling our network of public EV charging points   Thousands              2020   2021    2022    2023     2025   2030   Other      0.5    0.002   0.022   0.021    ~70    ~200   Asia       0.5    0.068   0.27    1.002   China      0      1.964   17.55   32.576   Europe     0      5.021   8.937   16.579   Americas   0      0.044   0.07    3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen- based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Ra\\xEDzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.   Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly               2025   2030   2035   2040   2045                            2050   Gas          2.1    2.2    2.4    2.6    2.9                             3.4   Hydrogen       0    0.1    0.3    0.5    0.7                               1   Batteries    0.2    0.4    0.5    0.8    1.1                             1.7   Other        0.4    0.3    0.3    0.4    0.4                             0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation. Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023. Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low- carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO(2) from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co(2) capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen- based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non- operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm(3)) Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in our Upstream business In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO(2)e in 2022.  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\\xEDzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Ra\\xEDzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia FerrariShell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half- times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to- hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO(2) since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year [A]. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The CO(2) will be shipped from two of \\xD8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO(2) equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The captured CO(2) will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO(2) emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. [A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first- ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO(2) captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:   * Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.     For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software     system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they     emit.   * Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our     CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's     largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.   * Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable     hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO(2) emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start- ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)  Sector                               Policy Positions           Advocacy Theme

activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low- carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross- border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments     and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of     Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership. Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)  A. On a net basis.  B. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.  C. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into     low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning     plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.

The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be     recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact     of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  B. Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell- operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve     near zero methane emissions by 2030  B. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as     the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total     volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.  C. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected)     defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of     oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.  D. Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control     including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy     Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.  B. Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and     higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than     those of oil products.  C. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and     increasing sales of renewable power.  D. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen,     which are low- and zero-carbon products.  E. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source.  F. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset     remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as     aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower- carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\\xB0C above pre- industrial levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\\xB0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\\xB0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5\\xB0C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\\xB0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.  A. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of     limiting warming to 1.5\\xB0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning     warming to 1.5\\xB0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much     the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5\\xB0C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under- represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:   * Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net     basis (2016 baseline);   * Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and   * Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero     methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:   * LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;   * Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in     support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission     by 2030, on a net basis; and   * Supporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-     out.      A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category         11) were 517 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO(2)e         in 2021. For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a \"significant best efforts basis\". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B]                     2020     2021     2022     2023 -----------------------------------------------------   MSCI               A        AA       AA       AA -----------------------------------------------------   Sustainalytics   36.8 H   35.1 H   34.7 H   33.7 H -----------------------------------------------------   ISS                C        C+       C+       C+ ----------------------------------------------------- ISS The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.  A. Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024  B. MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in     managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A     lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial     impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are rated on a 12-point scale from     A+ (best) to D-(worst). Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short- term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\\xB0C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three?high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023.   Disclosure framework             2022   2023 -----------------------------------------------   Yes, meets all criteria             5      2 -----------------------------------------------   Partial, meets some criteria        3      7 -----------------------------------------------   No, does not meet any criteria      1      1 ----------------------------------------------- We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.

There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec- filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2) compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2 )equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e( CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

By the end of 2023,     Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net     carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with     2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.   * To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a     new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products     by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). [A]   * Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of     2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in     the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. \"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer. \"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world- leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets:   * By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve     emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above     and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization     Charter agreed at COP28.   * We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were     one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane     emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity -     significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to     the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further     supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring.   * In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the     energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the     third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors   * For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and     performance please read the full report, online here:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>)   * Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at     Shell's 2024 AGM.   * Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales     volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and     reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.   * We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our     oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).     That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer     emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517     million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes     CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by     2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes,     impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.   * Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by     both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions).     While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we     cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments     and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in     demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions,     more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition     of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of     renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy,     one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our     determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to     our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up     low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of     Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the     largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.   * Find out more about Shell's 2023 Capital Markets Day online :     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> Enquiries UK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550 Shell plc - Energy Transition Strategy Chair's message This energy transition update marks an important moment for Shell. It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].  A. Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\\xEDzen  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low- carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one- third compared with the world's best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company     of Nigeria Limited (SPDC  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]  A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the     40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes     associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading     purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Our journey towards net zero 2023   * Invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions, of our total capital spending     of $24.4 billion in 2023.

H. Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by     2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.  I. We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use     of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category     11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category     11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and     569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles.

Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this 10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Source: Shell analysis of IEA Extended Energy Balances (2023). Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low- carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. In non-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10% of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio- feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector.  A. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap     reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO(2) emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio- alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel                             Passenger road transport    Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25   million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil   production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles,  including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging           points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO(2) includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO(2) emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.  A. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low- carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:   * Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon     intensity.   * Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil     production stable.   * Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to     offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s. -------------------------------------------------   Estimated share of energy sales 2016-2030 [A] +------------------+------+------+--------------+ |                  | 2016 | 2023 | 2030         | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Oil products [B] | 57%  | 48%  | 39%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | LNG              | 14%  | 22%  | 26%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Pipeline gas     | 25%  | 21%  | 21%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Electricity      | 3%   | 7%   | 11%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Biofuels         | 1%   | 2%   | 3%           | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ [A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non- operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.  A. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities     (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where     hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.  A.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to:   * Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional     energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and     hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.   * Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil     products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in     areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.   * Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of     the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own     production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutions     for our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future   * Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and     lubricant offerings   * Building for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels   * Preparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storage   * Supported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low- carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low- carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today.   Scaling our network of public EV charging points   Thousands              2020   2021    2022    2023     2025   2030   Other      0.5    0.002   0.022   0.021    ~70    ~200   Asia       0.5    0.068   0.27    1.002   China      0      1.964   17.55   32.576   Europe     0      5.021   8.937   16.579   Americas   0      0.044   0.07    3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen- based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Ra\\xEDzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.   Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly               2025   2030   2035   2040   2045                            2050   Gas          2.1    2.2    2.4    2.6    2.9                             3.4   Hydrogen       0    0.1    0.3    0.5    0.7                               1   Batteries    0.2    0.4    0.5    0.8    1.1                             1.7   Other        0.4    0.3    0.3    0.4    0.4                             0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation. Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023. Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low- carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO(2) from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co(2) capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen- based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non- operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm(3)) Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in our Upstream business In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO(2)e in 2022.  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\\xEDzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Ra\\xEDzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia FerrariShell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half- times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to- hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO(2) since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The CO(2) will be shipped from two of \\xD8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO(2) equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The captured CO(2) will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO(2) emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first- ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO(2) captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:   * Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.     For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software     system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they     emit.   * Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our     CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's     largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.   * Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable     hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO(2) emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start- ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)  Sector                               Policy Positions           Advocacy Theme

activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low- carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross- border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments     and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of     Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership. Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)  A. On a net basis.  B. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.  C. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into     low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning     plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.

The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be     recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact     of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  B. Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell- operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve     near zero methane emissions by 2030  B. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as     the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total     volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.  C. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected)     defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of     oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.  D. Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control     including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy     Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule.  B. Hydrocarbon sales reflect the effect of lower sales of oil products, and     higher sales of natural gas. Emissions associated with gas are lower than     those of oil products.  C. Power sales show the expected growth of our integrated power business and     increasing sales of renewable power.  D. Sales of low-carbon fuels reflect higher sales of biofuels and hydrogen,     which are low- and zero-carbon products.  E. CCS reduces carbon emissions by capturing them at source.  F. Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset     remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as     aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower- carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\\xB0C above pre- industrial levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\\xB0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\\xB0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5\\xB0C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\\xB0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.  A. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of     limiting warming to 1.5\\xB0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning     warming to 1.5\\xB0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much     the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5\\xB0C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under- represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:   * Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net     basis (2016 baseline);   * Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and   * Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero     methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:   * LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;   * Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in     support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission     by 2030, on a net basis; and   * Supporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-     out.      A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category         11) were 517 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO(2)e         in 2021. For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a \"significant best efforts basis\". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B]                     2020     2021     2022     2023 -----------------------------------------------------   MSCI               A        AA       AA       AA -----------------------------------------------------   Sustainalytics   36.8 H   35.1 H   34.7 H   33.7 H -----------------------------------------------------   ISS                C        C+       C+       C+ ----------------------------------------------------- ISS The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.  A. Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024  B. MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in     managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A     lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial     impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are rated on a 12-point scale from     A+ (best) to D-(worst). Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short- term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\\xB0C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three?high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023.   Disclosure framework             2022   2023 -----------------------------------------------   Yes, meets all criteria             5      2 -----------------------------------------------   Partial, meets some criteria        3      7 -----------------------------------------------   No, does not meet any criteria      1      1 ----------------------------------------------- We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report.

Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec- filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2) compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2 )equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e( CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

Environmental concerns cast a shadow over the crop in other parts of the world. What will African farmers do differently?</p><p>Baker Ssengendo's vision for the future of Uganda starts with an avocado seedling. \"The avocado tree has a lifespan of about 50 years. The life expectancy of an average Ugandan is about 60 years. A tree can benefit them their entire life,\" he told DW.Ssengendo works on the 1,000 hectares of Musubi Farm in Nansana, central Uganda \u2014 the largest Hass avocado farm in the country. \"By working in avocado farming, I am fulfilling my life dream. We want to lift our communities out of poverty.\"Due to high global demand, avocado has become a lucrative export product. Its consumption per capita increased by 406% between 1990 and 2017 in the US alone.The so-called green gold is rapidly gaining popularity on the African continent. Both Nigeria and Uganda aim to drastically increase their avocado production and become top exporters in the next ten years. Kenya is already amongst the global top ten. Export revenues in the East African country surged by a third between 2019 and 2020. Farmers are hailing the crop as an antidote to poverty in rural areas.But the sought-after fruit has been making negative headlines around the world. Water shortages and the destruction of biodiversity have been linked to its production. The environmental issues have cast a dark shadow over the commercial farming of avocados in Latin America's top exporting countries, such as Mexico and Chile.On the other hand, African avocado farming is promising a brighter future, according to both farmers and scientists. Due to an emphasis on smallholders and beneficial rain patterns, the crop's production is expected to be less environmentally harmful than on the American continent.Avocados the new oil?\"Avocado is actually a godsend because farmers can use it as an alternative to coffee farming,\" Sammy Carsan, agroforestry scientist at the World Agroforestry Center in Nairobi, told DW.In recent years, fierce competition between large retailers has driven down coffee prices. In 2019, coffee farmers' earnings dropped to their lowest in 13 years. Now, hopes are high for avocado to fill the income gap.According to The Guardian Nigeria, former Nigerian President Olusegun Obasanjo called the fruit \"the new oil of Nigeria\" during a meeting with members of the Avocado Society of Nigeria (ASN) late last year. The politician-turned-avocado-enthusiast is the largest stakeholder in the society and owns 20 hectares of Hass avocado farming land himself \u2014 the avocado variety most commonly used for exports.\"He gave us the mandate of making the country Africa's largest avocado exporter by 2030,\" Adeniyi Sola Bunmi, Executive Director of ASN, told DW. Currently, there are only 120 Hass avocado farmers in Nigeria. ASN is training smallholders wishing to switch to the crop and provides them with Hass seedlings.In Uganda, the Ministry of Agriculture recently partnered with Musubi Farm, hoping to start commercial export next year. Musubi is already employing 1,000 people from the local community. \"We are also financially supporting a local school and are providing land for a local police force in order to deal with crime in the community. Avocados can transform our community,\" director of communications, Ssengendo, said. The promise of smallholder farmingLarge-scale commercial avocado farming is at the core of environmental issues, such as soil degradation, in Latin America. However, in East Africa and Nigeria, smallholders are at the center of a more sustainable avocado farming approach.\"Our plan is to have 75% of avocados produced by smallholder farmers and 25 percent by our farm,\" Ssengendo said of his vision for Uganda. In neighboring Kenya, smallholders are already spearheading avocado production, with most avocado farmers only owning about two hectares of land, according to Carsan.Small farms mean less strain on the environment, Ruben Sommaruga, Professor of Limnology of the University of Innsbruck, told DW. \"Large industrial production always implies a large use of pesticides. That is usually not the case with smallholder farmers, who can control their small number of trees more easily.\"In smallholder settings, the crop is often complemented with other farming enterprises, such as maize and bean crops, planted for subsistence. According to Samson Ogbole, a sustainable farmer in Nigeria, mixing avocado trees with agroforestry systems can curtail negative environmental effects. \"Planting crops like legumes around the tree crops helps replenish the soil.\"Avocados for rainy daysAccording to the Water Footprint Network, it takes 2,000 liters of water (528 gallons), or 10 full bathtubs, to grow just one kilo of avocados. Planting the fruit has been linked to water shortages in Chile, for example, where farming has affected water availability for human consumption.But the water consumption of the crop shouldn't be removed from its local context, according to Sommaruga. \"It's always a matter of how much and what kind of water you have in the countries where you grow the trees.\"In Uganda and Nigeria, avocado farms are mainly located in areas with beneficial rain patterns, according to Sommaruga.\"The central and southern part of Nigeria receives relatively high precipitation. The south of Uganda does as well. In Kenya, much of the avocado farming is done north of Nairobi, where mountains retain most of the rain.\"Frequent rainfall means farmers do not have to rely on irrigation systems, which artificially apply water to the soil. \"In smallholder settings, avocado is produced on a rain-fed basis with few irrigation systems,\" Carsan said about avocado farmers in Kenya.For now, avocado production has not been linked to water shortages across African farmlands. But, as Sommaruga points out, the rain patterns that avocado farmers in sub-Saharan Africa are benefitting from today are expected to decrease in the future due to climate change.Bunmi from the Avocado Society of Nigeria has also been farming avocados on his land, hoping to export to Ukraine and the United Kingdom in five years. \"Regarding water, I don't see any problem in the next 20 years. But maybe as time goes on,\" Bunmi said. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL1099881619875247493258793000163</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62K0-5GR1-F03R-N0PR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1072\"/><timeReceived>1:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"01\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 1, 2021 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000679</classCode><className>EXPORT TRADE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX001940</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENT &amp;

The Agriculture and Fisheries Council, a body of the relevant ministers, agreed to push for greener policies through measures including so-called mandatory 'eco-schemes.'  As part of the suggested reforms, farmers must adopt certain environmental practices in exchange for direct payments from the EU. But under the eco-schemes those who go beyond the basic requirements would get additional funding.  There will be an initial two-year pilot phase of the eco-schemes, according to a press release.  The council has to negotiate with the European Parliament before it can be adopted.   The targeted climate-friendly practices include precision farming, agroforestry, and organic farming, according to a council press release.  The EU states agreed to reserve at least 20 per cent of direct payments for such schemes.  Many farmers are dependent on direct payments from Brussels, while also fearing the impact of expanded environmental regulations.  The European Commission put forward a comprehensive agricultural reform proposal in 2018 for 2021 to 2027. But a two-year transitional phase has been put in place, meaning new rules won't come into force until 2023.  EU states have earmarked some 387 billion euros (459 billion dollars) for agriculture until 2027 - the largest allocation in the EU budget.

That is a key question that the Centre for Rural Development (SLE) at Humboldt University Berlin asks itself on the occasion of its sixtieth anniversary. The majority of the SLE leadership and graduates agrees that a new kind of cooperation is needed in order to address all of these crises.</p><p>The SLE employees agree that development cooperation (DC) has to change. The staff have gathered their ideas in a transformation agenda and decided that a new mindset towards DC is needed that includes the following:</p><p>DC must be aware of its responsibility: 'In our opinion, the most important aspect of a transformative DC mindset would be freedom from paternalism.' That means that the funding that is provided would not be understood as 'aid', but rather as 'reparations' for the overuse of human and natural resources with which the global North built up its wealth.</p><p>Practice 'real cooperation' on equal footing: this means that cooperation should not be based on conditionalities. Instead, partners should agree on joint outcomes - which already often happens in practice.</p><p>Acquisition and transmission of transformation knowledge: in order to achieve transformative development, we must depart from our usual technologies and ways of thinking. We have to draft approaches and measures that will bring about the successful transformation to ecological and sustainable development. These measures should function as win-win strategies, meaning that one crisis is not weighed against another, but instead multiple goals can be achieved at the same time. In the process, the global North and global South should constantly be learning from each other.</p><p>The SLE has revised its post-graduate study programme 'International cooperation for sustainable development' and identified three transformation areas it wants to pursue: (1.) Ecosystems and nutrition, (2.) Socio-ecological business and (3.) Governance and participation. In the first area, ecosystems and nutrition, SLE researchers believe that the increasing competition for resources will have to be overcome.</p><p>With regard to land use, moreover, diverse goals such as the preservation of biodiversity, climate protection and food security will have to be integrated. Multifunctional systems should be implemented in agriculture; examples include agroforestry and agrophotovoltaic systems. In order to replace chemicals, these systems could be ecologically intensified, meaning that the ecosystem services of nature are systematically increased (for instance through self-regulation processes, beneficial organisms or a protein plant strategy). 'Closing nutrient cycles' is another strategy, which would prevent the production of excess nitrate while still keeping enough nutrients in the soil. Ecological agriculture must also be improved. The SLE plans to research the corresponding agroecological concepts.</p><p>With regard to the second transformation goal, socio-ecological business, the SLE is striving towards an equitable distribution of resources particularly between richer and poorer countries, but also within societies, along with the systematic inclusion of disadvantaged groups. Economic activity that only is oriented toward growth is also under investigation. The SLE wants to develop new concepts in this area and is asking whether green growth is possible and how green innovations can be achieved.</p><p>With regard to the transformation of governance and participation, SLE researchers are concentrating above all on rural areas. Such regions often only have weak political systems, structures and institutions and are therefore in need of 'good rural governance'.</p><p>The latter should facilitate participation and equal opportunities for people in the countryside and promote cooperation and networking among rural people and with urban areas. The goal is also to achieve a new balance between the country and the city, which would allow rural areas to develop and contribute significantly to the cities' food supply.</p><p>These considerations were expanded on in multiple workshops on a variety of subtopics, to which SLE alumni and other DC professionals contributed ideas. The SLE lecturer for development policy and anti-racism, Boniface Mabanza Bambu, pointed out that DC is still based on colonial narratives. He argued that conceiving of African or Latin American people and societies as 'other', and characterising them as 'underdeveloped' and 'undemocratic', can lead to negative stereotypes.</p><p>He also criticised the fact that DC is dominated by 'western concepts' and 'development expertise', claiming that they often deprecate other knowledge as 'marginal' or 'utopian'. He advocated for a critical (self-)deconstruction of DC, which would involve finding opportunities for marginalised groups to speak for themselves instead of having someone else do it for them. He believes the poor should be the main architects of their fate.</p><p>The SLE wants to take up all of these ideas and incorporate them into its education programmes and research. Doing so will require a lot of effort. SLE director Susanne Neubert summed it up best: 'We all have to develop.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1408202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6659-C6M1-JCH9-G0B3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-08-14</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"08\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>August 14, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Her farming methods emphasise moisture retention, crop rotation, agroforestry and organic fertilisers.</p><p>Daka grows groundnuts (also called peanuts), soybeans, maize, sunflower, cowpeas (black-eyed peas) and vegetables - all without chemical fertilisers. Her yields are comparable to those obtained with conventional farming, she says. She was inspired to use conservation farming by her cooperation with Community Markets for Conservation (COMACO), a social enterprise (see main article).</p><p>Yet her rain-fed farm faces major weather risks. Droughts and delayed rainfall can destroy crops, particularly groundnuts and soybeans. 'Last year we did not get good profits from groundnuts because the crop was attacked by the rosette virus,' she says. The groundnut rosette virus is spread by sap-sucking insects called aphids. Plants that are infected early cannot be saved and will produce no yield.</p><p>The most effective prevention measure is to plant crops as soon as there is enough moisture in the soil. Farmers use a variety of signs to determine the onset of the rainy season: a proliferation of centipedes, the sprouting of specific trees or the appearance of spider webs moistened with dew. In addition, farmers receive weather forecasts via radio broadcasts and telephone apps. COMACO also provides weather updates.</p><p>These forecasts help, but do not go far enough. 'The forecasts are sporadic,' Daka says. She would prefer them to be regular, and even daily and at the beginning of each rainy season.</p><p>In addition, she needs more specific, weather-related farming advice: 'When they give advice, they should not only inform me about the rainfall but also tell me that I should plant late-maturing varieties if the rains are good. If it will not rain a lot, then they should tell me to plant early varieties - rather than just send a message that it will rain a lot or it will not rain a lot.'</p><p>Daka says this information would best be sent via text message, as this would create a direct link with the providers and ensure that she receives the message. Relying on extension services to send information is less reliable; sometimes the message does not get through.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1405202100001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:62P9-WCR1-JCH9-G10V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-05-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"387\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"05\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>May 14, 2021 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"87\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00095A1</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N924120CC</classCode><className>CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000D5IA</classCode><className>INSECTS &amp; ARACHNIDS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DS59</classCode><className>SOIL CONSERVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX001826</classCode><className>WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000047</classCode><className>AGRICULTURAL TECHNOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00095A1</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE &amp; ENVIRONMENT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009FAV</classCode><className>FERTILIZERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST00097GY</classCode><className>FRUITS &amp; VEGETABLES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSFS</classCode><className>SOIL HEALTH</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N111992MM</classCode><className>PEANUT FARMING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>N113000CC</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp; LOGGING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><classCode>ST000A075</classCode><className>TEXT MESSAGING</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC395</classCode><className>ZAMBIA</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

They are indispensable for global food security. Data from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) revealed that farms with fewer than five hectares produced more than 70 % of humanity's food in 2014. As the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) cannot be achieved without smallholders, the future of human civilisation hinges on them.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Traditional family farming</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">provides highly diversified food products, which contribute to healthy diets,</p><p>offers livelihoods in rural areas where unemployment is a major problem,</p><p>utilises and conserves agrobiodiversity and</p><p>is well adapted to local ecosystems and thus helps to protect invaluable ecosystem services.</p><p>It also matters that traditional farming is based on ancestral knowledge. Though not appreciated by all scientists, it is the basis for agricultural innovations and technologies. For example, breeders of high-yielding varieties typically use genetic information from age-old landraces.</p><p>The farmers concerned are mostly very poor. They often belong to indigenous and other marginalised communities. It is ironic that some of the world's poorest and most neglected communities are in charge of vitally important agriculture systems. These rural communities deserve to be rewarded for the work they are doing, and their culture must not be suppressed or displaced. It must be allowed to evolve in ways that improve their quality of life.</p><p>Distorted idea of modernisation</p><p>Agricultural policies, so far, have been mostly guided by a distorted idea of modernisation. The focus on industrial-scale farming to maximise yields has led to</p><p>unsustainable practices,</p><p>over-exploitation of resources,</p><p>genetic erosion,</p><p>loss of fertile soils,</p><p>imports of exotic domesticated species,</p><p>loss of local knowledge systems and rural values,</p><p>socio-economic instability and</p><p>displacement of marginalised people.</p><p>This kind of high-tech agriculture is not the answer to the multiple problems that haunt humankind. A different approach is needed (see Susanne Neubert in <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). Smallholders, family farms and indigenous groups should not be looked down upon. Their production systems should be carefully intensified. It makes sense to use new methods that</p><p>lower environmental impacts,</p><p>can be applied more precisely and</p><p>reduce waste in processing, transport and marketing.</p><p>In many parts of the world, traditional agriculture systems have collapsed or disappeared. That is especially so in supposedly 'advanced' nations. Nonetheless, millions of hectares are still under traditional farm management, with raised fields, terraces, polycultures (with different crops growing in the same field), agroforestry systems et cetera. The stubborn persistence of these practices is evidence of smallholders' creativity and resilience. They have stuck to local strategies and kept developing them in ways that serve their needs and are tailored to their local resources and environment.</p><p>History of marginalisation</p><p>Unfortunately, these local communities have a long history of being neglected. What was prioritised instead was to increase farm production with price subsidies, intensive practices, specialisation and new technologies. As argued above, the price was very high in both socio-economic and environmental terms. Rural poverty has indeed worsened, and migration to urban slums is occurring in many places.</p><p>By contrast, diversified, eco-friendly farming with multi-cropping and various forms of animal husbandry was only rarely promoted. There is a general lack of support for smallholders and especially indigenous farming communities. Precious little research is done to improve their lot. As a result, the foundations of their agricultural 'culture' are being eroded. The biodiversity they have been guarding is disappearing as well.</p><p>Surviving in harsh environments</p><p>The basis for developing sustainable agricultural systems should therefore be the very systems that traditional family farmers have inherited and incrementally modified over centuries. These systems are complex and well adapted to the local conditions. Indeed, smallholders have managed to cope with very harsh environments. Most of their production systems do not depend on external inputs and technologies, but have nonetheless safeguarded communities' basic food security and covered their subsistence needs in the course of history.</p><p>Humanity needs models of agriculture that allow us to eradicate poverty (SDG1) and end hunger (SDG2). Other SDGs, such as climate action (SDG13) or the protection and restoration of ecosystems on land (SDG15), matter too, of course. We need agriculture that is productive, environment-friendly, bio\u00addiverse and socially just. The community-based systems which have fed humankind throughout history meet these criteria. And they still feed masses of people in disadvantaged world regions.</p><p>In appreciation of their relevance, the author, as the Task Manager of the Agenda 21 on behalf of the FAO, launched a programme called GIAHS 20 years ago. The letters stand for Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (see box).</p><p>Focus on Smallholders' needs</p><p>Sustainability must be first ensured at the local level. The logical consequence is that agriculture systems should fit the existing socioeconomic and natural environment. Time-tested community-based systems must not be uprooted or displaced. They must be carefully adopted and enhanced. This is a delicate challenge because there is no blueprint that would fit every situation. Every local system is special. To boost its productivity, one must understand the local ecosystem, relevant science and the local traditional knowledge. The new science of agroecology has its roots in these principals.</p><p>Prospects for the young generation</p><p>Since the early 1980s, hundreds of agroecology projects have been undertaken. They were driven by farmers organisations, visionary scientists and non-governmental organisations. To a minor extent, state agencies were involved too. Experience shows that it is possible to blend traditional knowledge with new scientific insights. This approach serves to increase productivity and improve food security without harming the natural environment. There is an important socio-cultural angle too. The future sustainability of agriculture depends on young people staying in rural areas, implementing farming innovations and creating sustainable livelihoods. If they do not see a future for themselves in the villages, they will leave.</p><p>Agricultural research should focus on smallholders' needs</p><p>Local food sovereignty, moreover, matters very much. It is based on local \u00adautonomy in regard to production, processing, marketing and consumption. Important preconditions are that farmers have appropriate access to land, seeds, water, technology and energy. Farmer-to-farmer networks tend to be very useful in this context.</p><p>Local food sovereignty also means that farming communities must not depend on imported inputs from large multinational corporations. The background is that private-sector giants have a pattern of forcing clients to relying on innovations that enhance corporate profits along with the yields, but do not necessarily improve farming communities' welfare. Around the world, scientific agricultural researchers should therefore focus much more on the needs of smallholders and family farmers (see Hildegard Lingnau on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Historical evidence shows that smallholder farms can play their vital part in</p><p>poverty alleviation,</p><p>economic growth,</p><p>job creation and</p><p>community empowerment.</p><p>To do so, they need to be supported by public policy and government-funded investments. Rural infrastructure is essential. Policymakers must not forget that smallholder provide food to local markets in a potentially resilient way, and their farms serve as social-safety nets.</p><p>The importance of dietary diversity must be recognised too. The combination of various crops and animals in traditional agroecosystems allows farmers to make good use of ecological niches; thus increasing the variety of locally available nutritious food (see Rabson Kondowe on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). </p><p>Indeed, opting for one variety of a crop instead of another can make the difference between micronutrient deficiency or micronutrient adequacy. The traditional landraces, which local communities have bred of millennia, have further vitally important qualities. Their diversity offers varieties that suit many different environmental circumstances, which is precisely why they are needed to create high-yielding varieties of rice, wheat and maize (see Melaku Worede on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Global food security cannot be sustainably achieved without the local plant-genetic resources and the traditional knowledge of marginalised farming communities in many world regions. Their own food security, moreover, will benefit from incremental change geared to higher productivity.</p><p>The plain truth is that some of the world's poorest people are the best custodians of genetic resources and other natural resources, environmental services as well as cultural inheritance. Improving their lot is the appropriate approach to ending hunger.</p><p>Parviz Koohafkan is the founder and president of the World Agricultural Heritage Foundation.

Named Burj Zanzibar - \"burj\" meaning tower in Arabic - the spectacular high-rise is designed to reach 96 metres in height. Dubbed \"vertical green village\", it would represent an iconic landmark not only for the island but for the whole of Africa and a global environmental milestone, being the first timber structure worldwide of such proportions. The design of the mixed-use apartment and commercial building, in a playful beehive style with breathtaking ocean views, was unveiled to the public in Muscat, Oman on 1 October. Dutch-born architect Leander Moons, responsible for the concept, said: \"Burj Zanzibar is not just an outstanding building but a new ecosystem for the future of living\".  The residential tower with 266 residences is to be located in Fumba Town, East Africa's pioneering eco-town developed by German-led engineering firm CPS. Categorised as a strategic investment and fully supported by the Zanzibar government, the growing city near the capital, where foreigners are allowed to buy, stretches along a 1.5-kilometre seashore on the southwest coast. \"Burj Zanzibar will be the highlight and natural continuation of our efforts to provide sustainable housing in Africa, thereby empowering local employment and businesses\", elaborated CPS CEO Sebastian Dietzold in Muscat.  With turquoise seas, white sandy beaches and a UNESCO-protected historic Stone Town, Zanzibar recorded 15% annual growth in tourism in recent years and 6.8% economic growth. Earlier this year, the semi-autonomous archipelago, 35 kilometres off the coast of Tanzania, stretched its wings also into another direction, launching an initiative to attract African tech companies with a total worth of six billion dollars.  Benefits of timber  Timber is the oldest building material in the world. As timber technology, it currently enjoys a renaissance because of its environmental benefits and longevity. New timber products such as cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam are considered the building material of the future. One cubic metre of wood binds half a ton of carbon dioxide, whereas conventional concrete construction is responsible for 25% of CO2 emissions.  Once realised, Burj Zanzibar would be the highest timber building in the world and Africa's first high-rise ever in this innovative technology. A few weeks ago the 86.6-metre Ascent Tower in Milwaukee, US, was certified as the world's tallest timber hybrid building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). Africa's highest conventional skyscraper is a 385-metre office tower named \"Iconic Tower\" in Egypt, still under construction.  Tanzania's top skyscraper is the 157-metre Ports Authority building in Dar es Salaam. The world's tallest conventional building is Burj Khalifa in Dubai with 828 metres.  Consortium of specialists from New York to Switzerland  Burj Zanzibar is planned as a hybrid timber tower. A steel-reinforced concrete core is designed to meet all required fire and life safety standards. The project is to be executed by a consortium of leading specialists from Switzerland, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Tanzania and the US. Green roof gardens and planted balconies further reduce the carbon footprint of the building. \"Burj Zanzibar will be a widely visible new landmark for Zanzibar and beyond, not only because of its appearance but because of its construction method\", said architect Leander Moons during the launch event.  Set to promote locally available wood as a building material, Tanzania and its vast land resources for agroforestry would also benefit from the ambitious green mega tower. A large forest development in central Tanzania near Iringa already covers twice the size of New York; \"an enlarged forest industry could create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the East African country\", said CPS Director Dietzold.  Playful, elegant style fitting any culture  The playful architectural style - reminiscent of a beehive with honeycombs - combines modern urban trends with local culture. \"Panorama windows, closed-in green loggias and a modular layout will enhance the green nature of the tower and allow for flexible apartment floor plans, tailor-made for any cultural preferences\", explained lead architect Moons. Residents can have their outdoor garden even on the top floor.  Representing a young, vibrant and most of all sustainable lifestyle, the building allocates a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments and deluxe penthouses. The elegant tower stands on a terraced podium with shared and private gardens , shops and a common pool.

Named Burj Zanzibar - ?burj? meaning tower in Arabic - the spectacular high-rise is designed to reach 96 metres in height. Dubbed ?vertical green village?, it would represent an iconic landmark not only for the island but for the whole of Africa and a global environmental milestone, being the first timber structure worldwide of such proportions. The design of the mixed-use apartment and commercial building, in a playful beehive style with breathtaking ocean views, was unveiled to the public in Muscat, Oman on 1 October. Dutch-born architect Leander Moons, responsible for the concept, said: ?Burj Zanzibar is not just an outstanding building but a new ecosystem for the future of living?. The residential tower with 266 residences is to be located in Fumba Town, East Africa?s pioneering eco-town developed by German-led engineering firm CPS. Categorised as a strategic investment and fully supported by the Zanzibar government, the growing city near the capital, where foreigners are allowed to buy, stretches along a 1.5-kilometre seashore on the southwest coast. ?Burj Zanzibar will be the highlight and natural continuation of our efforts to provide sustainable housing in Africa, thereby empowering local employment and businesses?, elaborated CPS CEO Sebastian Dietzold in Muscat. With turquoise seas, white sandy beaches and a UNESCO-protected historic Stone Town, Zanzibar recorded 15% annual growth in tourism in recent years and 6.8% economic growth. Earlier this year, the semi-autonomous archipelago, 35 kilometres off the coast of Tanzania, stretched its wings also into another direction, launching an initiative to attract African tech companies with a total worth of six billion dollars. Benefits of timber Timber is the oldest building material in the world. As timber technology, it currently enjoys a renaissance because of its environmental benefits and longevity. New timber products such as cross-laminated timber (CLT) and glulam are considered the building material of the future. One cubic metre of wood binds half a ton of carbon dioxide, whereas conventional concrete construction is responsible for 25% of CO2 emissions. Once realised, Burj Zanzibar would be the highest timber building in the world and Africa?s first high-rise ever in this innovative technology. A few weeks ago the 86.6-metre Ascent Tower in Milwaukee, US, was certified as the world's tallest timber hybrid building by the Council on Tall Buildings and Urban Habitat (CTBUH). \u00a0Africa?s highest conventional skyscraper is a 385-metre office tower named ?Iconic Tower? in Egypt, still under construction. Tanzania?s top skyscraper is the 157-metre Ports Authority building in Dar es Salaam. The world?s tallest conventional building is Burj Khalifa in Dubai with 828 metres. Consortium of specialists from New York to Switzerland Burj Zanzibar is planned as a hybrid timber tower.\u00a0 A steel-reinforced concrete core is designed to meet all required fire and life safety standards. The project is to be executed by a consortium of leading specialists from Switzerland, Austria, Germany, South Africa, Tanzania and the US. Green roof gardens and planted balconies further reduce the carbon footprint of the building. ?Burj Zanzibar will be a widely visible new landmark for Zanzibar and beyond, not only because of its appearance but because of its construction method?, said architect Leander Moons during the launch event. Set to promote locally available wood as a building material, Tanzania and its vast land resources for agroforestry would also benefit from the ambitious green mega tower. A large forest development in central Tanzania near Iringa already covers twice the size of New York; ?an enlarged forest industry could create hundreds of thousands of jobs in the East African country?, said CPS Director Dietzold. Playful, elegant style fitting any culture The playful architectural style ? reminiscent of a beehive with honeycombs ? combines modern urban trends with local culture. ?Panorama windows, closed-in green loggias and a modular layout will enhance the green nature of the tower and allow for flexible apartment floor plans, tailor-made for any cultural preferences?, explained lead architect Moons. Residents can have their outdoor garden even on the top floor. Representing a young, vibrant and most of all sustainable lifestyle, the building allocates a mix of studio, one- and two-bedroom apartments and deluxe penthouses. The elegant tower stands on a terraced podium with shared and private gardens , shops and a common pool. Sizes of units range from studios starting at $79,900 to a vast penthouse with a private pool on the 26th\u00a0 floor at $950,880. ?As a global architectural highlight the Burj Zanzibar will be setting a new benchmark of building in the 21st century?, CPS director Sebastian Dietzold concluded.

They told DW that taking control is better than protesting government policy.Krishna Narode, 26, from Gangapur village in India's western Maharashtra state, is visibly excited as he surveys his four-acre farm where he cultivates an array of crops and fruits, including papaya, sugar cane, wheat and ginger. In a few months, it will be time for harvesting and Narode knows that his efforts will pay dividends as he has relied on natural farming practices.\"I hope to earn at least 600,000 Indian rupees ( 6,765, $8,190) this year from my harvest. </p><p>In 2016, I earned such a small sum that I wanted to give up. But thanks to new farming methods we have learnt, it is helping our community,\" Narode told DW.A few kilometers away, 51-year-old Mangala Maruti Waghmare, a woman farmer, is hoping to reap a windfall this year from her drumsticks, custard apple and mango produce.\"My fruits are delicious and will sell for twice the general market price. Multi-cropping as a technique is benefitting a lot of farmers here who are willing to change,\" Waghmare told DW.Latur, one of the larger districts in the Marathawada, has been a perennial drought-prone area, notorious for its water scarcity and, at one point, farmer suicides.Five years back, authorities had to deploy special trains to supply water to the region and police had to stand guard outside water tankers, reservoirs and distribution points.Dramatic transformationBut an initiative led by agriculturalist Mahadev Gomare, with the help of a committed band of villagers, helped change the sad state of affairs. A few years ago, they rejuvenated the 143-kilometer-long (89-mile) Manjara river and its tributaries, which are a key source of water for around 500,000 people in 900 villages. Over 900,000 cubic meters of silt was removed from the river, giving it a new life. The silt, in turn, was used in the fields to help level adjoining farms where sharecropping was taken up.A river's ability to recharge groundwater is significantly reduced as silt accumulates at its bottom.\"Once the rivers were revived, it increased the availability of water, and other initiatives to improve the biodiversity and ecology of the area were started,\" Gomare told DW.With technical help from the Art of Living foundation, which has expertise in river rejuvenation, desilting drains, gabion structures and arresting rainwater in rivers and rivulets were taken up. Since then, there has been no looking back for a large section of the farmers living here.The farming community has since gradually moved to natural farming, afforestation, agroforestry, social forestry and climate-resilient farming and seeding practices to green the area and help increase their farm produce.Entire village ecosystems were positively impacted because of the greater water availability, resulting in significant socioeconomic benefits. The changes led to a dramatic transformation in the lives of farmers. \"It has taken time, but our labor has paid off and now we see a smile on many farmers' faces,\" Kaka Sehab Sindi, a farmer, told DW.Other Indian farmers protest\"We know farmers outside Delhi are agitating for a law guaranteeing a minimum support price for their produce, but we decided to change our own fates,\" Ambalesh Kashinath, a cereal crop farmer, told DW.On the outskirts of Delhi, thousands of farmers from the northern states of Punjab and Haryana have been protesting resolutely for weeks against the three farm laws pushed through by Prime Minister Narendra Modi's Bharatiya Janata Party-led government.They fear that these laws will destroy their livelihoods by offering big multinational corporations greater power over farming, and by undermining the main forms of state support to the cultivators, including minimum support prices (MSP) and government market committees.Much of the farming practices in the Marathwada region now rely on utilizing the natural processes of the soil and seed system, thus saving on input costs without compromising on the yield. This has become valuable for small farmers who are already financially overstretched.Smart agricultureAccording to government figures, small and marginal farmers with less than two hectares of land account for as much as 86% of the 146 million total agricultural holdings in India.Bringing new technologies and practices to such a large number of smallholders scattered over a vast countryside and integrating them with the modern markets still remain a huge challenge.\"Farmers across the country are not happy with what has happened to their incomes and this is increasingly getting reflected in their protests,\" Pandu Gangadar, a farmer, told DW. \"We understand why Punjab farmers are angry over doing away with state-run wholesale buyers and markets that guaranteed a minimum support price,\" he added.But instead of relying on the government for help, farmers in Marathwada have brought in changes to crop management, leading to better crop yields, improved food security and increased resilience to adverse effects of climate change. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988161115992571975776100115</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61TF-8J51-F03R-N28V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"878\"/><timeReceived>4:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 20, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"88\"><className>Relations With Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NDYwNzQwQkYzMTI5NEFCMTkyMDM3QzFCNzE2MUE4MUM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QURCRDNBRjBGRTE0NEFBRUEzNUU1MzFGQjg3MTM4MDI</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"61\"><className>Initiative &amp;

We use it for different purposes, of which three matter in particular in the debate regarding sustainability. They are:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">food security based on agriculture, the conservation of biodiversity and natural ecosystems in protected areas and climate mitigation through the afforestation of deforested places.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">All three purposes are vitally important, but they compete for land, a rather limited resource. We are therefore facing a trilemma: choosing one of the three options means we risk neglecting the other two.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The problem becomes particularly obvious when we consider agricultural biodiversity. The conventional approaches of high-yield farming typically deplete fields' biological diversity. One reason is the application of pesticides. To a large extent, the dramatic erosion of global biodiversity is thus a consequence of the land-use trilemma.</p><p>The good news is that the goals of high yields and safeguarded biodiversity do not rule each other out entirely. Indeed, they can become mutually reinforcing if and when land is used in an eco-friendly way. The trick is to make best use of - and even maximise - the ecosystem services which are provided, for example, by pollinators and other species. This is feasible, provided farmers pay more attention to biodiversity.</p><p>There are at least three relevant dimensions to biodiversity:</p><p>the biodiversity of natural ecosystems and landscapes ('natural biodiversity'), the agricultural biodiversity ('agrobiodiversity') of fields with typical flora and fauna and the biodiversity of plant and animal races that farmers breed ('genetic resources').</p><p>As we are witnessing a mass extinction in regard to each and every one of these dimensions, experts are sounding the alarm. To tackle the dilemma of land-use, it is helpful to focus on the first two dimensions because they compete for land with one another.</p><p>Destroying natural biodiversity Agriculture is indispensable because it provides humanity with food. It has always led to land-use changes. As in earlier times, these changes still go along with carbon emissions and a reduction of biodiversity.</p><p>Large-scale deforestation with the goal of clearing arable land typically occurs in countries with low yields per acre and fast population growth. Both trends are evident in the vast majority of sub-Saharan countries. In most cases, cleared land is used to produce plants to feed the people. National food security is supposed to be achieved that way. However, this approach generally degrades land quality. Soils become less fertile because smallholder farmers are usually too poor to invest in restoring nutrients. Insufficient fertilisation results in low productivity - and then causes further deforestation as people need to clear additional fields.</p><p>On the other hand, large-scale deforestation also occurs in countries that export agricultural commodities. Brazil is a prominent example. It is well known that rainforests are burned down so the cultivation of soy and other kinds of animal feed can be expanded. These commodities are grown for exports to Europe and other advanced economies where farmers need them.</p><p>In this way, global trade is allowing an increasing number of people to rely on diets based on meat and other animal products. The trend started in advanced nations and has spread to urban areas everywhere. One result is that about 2 billion people are now overweight.</p><p>In Germany, the world's leading pork exporter, more than 60?% of agricultural land is currently used for growing animal feed and live-stock farming. If Germans based their diets on cereals and soy instead, large areas could serve the conservation of natural biodiversity.</p><p>Destroying agrobiodiversity</p><p>Current agricultural methods are not only destroying natural biodiversity however. The biodiversity of fields is being depleted as well. A multitude of herbs and grasses is affected, and so are insects including bees and other pollinators. Tiny animals and microorganisms in the soil are being harmed as well.</p><p>In prosperous nations, industrial-scale agriculture has caused massive damage. It depends on intensive application of chemicals. It does not do much crop rotation, but relies on huge amounts of fertiliser, liquid manure and pesticides like Glyphosate to ensure that only the high-yield cultivar will thrive.</p><p>Chemical residues and excessive use of fertiliser, moreover, do not only affect the field and its soil. They contaminate surrounding areas. Impacts are evident kilometres away. For example, groundwater is polluted with nitrate, with biodiversity-\u00addiminishing impacts on rivers, lakes and even the sea.</p><p>Industrial-scale agriculture is marked by considerable inefficiencies and leakages. Animal husbandry, extravagant fertilisation and excessive use of pesticides thus threaten both natural biodiversity and agrobiodiversity.</p><p>It would be wrong, however, to believe that low-input agriculture automatically leads to greater agrobiodiversity. Unless farmers restore nutrients to the soil by applying biomass, manure or mineral fertilisers, they degrade the fields. The biodiversity of the soil suffers, and eventually only particularly resilient, but largely useless weeds remain. Diminished soils, moreover, are especially exposed to erosion, with organic matter being blown away or washed away. When that happens, farming communities typically respond by clearing additional arable land, and the vicious circle keeps spinning.</p><p>Stopping the erosion of species</p><p>If we want to rise to the challenges, we do well to remember that abundant biodiversity is not just a goal in itself. It is actually a blessing to human beings thanks to a broad variety of ecosystem services. Pollination and metabolism are prominent examples. Others are the balance of predators and prey, top-soil development and water bodies' capacity for self-purification. Every one of these ecosystem services is indispensable for farming (see Sundus Saleemi on on our D+C/E+Z platform). Replacing them technologically would be impossible - or at least prohibitively expensive.</p><p>Nonetheless, we have mostly neglected the ecosystem services that result from the diversity of species. The reason is probably that we benefit from those services without payment or effort. Humans are used to taking ecosystem services for granted without any input of our own. Typically, we do not even notice them. However, awareness is slowly growing for how ecosystem services are being diminished.</p><p>The first step to protecting -and eventually expanding - those services, is take their value into account (see Katja Dombrowski onour D+C/E+Z platform). We must rise to this challenge.</p><p>Mass extinction is currently affecting both natural biodiversity and agrobiodiversity. To improve matters, we need radical change at the global level. We must not only safeguard natural ecosystems, but also diversify what is happening in agriculture. Multi-cropping is the indispensable alternative to monocultures. While we keep maximising yields at any cost, we must still strive for high yields. Otherwise, the clearing of additional arable land will continue. That land, however, must be reserved for natural ecosystems.</p><p>The global transition to sustainable land-use will thus hinge on multipurpose strategies in agriculture as well as other sectors. Agroforestry approaches, for example, link agriculture and forestry. It is possible to expand conservation areas while still permitting specific forms of farming. Even in restored peatlands, paludiculture is feasible, so farmers can indeed grow some crops. Multipurpose strategies offer the key to a sustainable future.</p><p>Ending inefficiencies around the world</p><p>At the same time, we must put an end to insufficiencies. An option in low-yield areas such as sub-Saharan countries is to systematically combine mineral fertilisation and organic manure to ensure soil nutrients are restored appropriately. Such an approach will not only lead to higher yields, but will also facilitate more biodiversity both on fields and in wildlife. Further clearance of land will be avoided, and field vegetation will become more diverse and abundant. Prosperous economies, on the other hand, must end inefficiencies by reducing the application of chemicals (see graph).</p><p>Last but not least, we must question current patterns of land-use in countries where industrial-scale agriculture is common. It is high time that famers focused on immediate human needs rather than live-stock farming, such as the production of pigs in Germany, for example. Such a policy shift will solve several problems. Less land will be needed to produce animal feed. The degradation of land through the application of liquid manure will be reduced. People's diets would become healthier, with meat prices rising. As a pleasant side-effect, more space will become available for conserving biodiversity and mitigating the climate crisis.</p><p>From agricultural policy to ecosystem policy</p><p>To rebalance global land-use in ways that facilitate sustainability, we need an appropriate policy environment. One option is to reform the existing policies such as the \u00adEuropean Union's CAP (common agricultural policy) or African countries input subsidy programmes (ISPs) in ways that establish something like a 'Shared Ecosystem Policy' (SEP). To tap the full potential, policymakers must take a comprehensive approach, not only reconsidering agriculture, but reconciling it with all other forms of land-use. The best possible results will be achieved if policymakers emphasise the benefits of eco-system services.</p><p>To tackle the land-use trilemma, we thus must focus on synergies in a holistic perspective. Doing so will require a shared policy framework.</p><p>At regional levels, it is possible to take what is called an 'integrated landscape approach' by involving various stakeholders. This term stands for negotiating land-use compromises within specific, locally and culturally defined regions in ways that reconcile economic, social and environmental requirements.</p><p>We must also consider long-distance interactions, of course. After all, rainforests are burned down in the global south to enable livestock farming in the global north. Distributive justice is important too, so we will need a new sense of solidarity spanning urban and rural communities internationally. Nothing less is needed than a new mindset everywhere. We have no time to lose. Let's go!</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP3011202100001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:646G-Y5S1-F00C-6276-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-11-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1733\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"11\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>November 30, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Verma, V.P.Singh, Pavan Kumar, Nitin Mehta and Devendra Kumar  Consumer awareness, health consciousness, nutrient-freakiness along with adulteration scandals has driven the growth of the organic food sector. This sector is globally escalating due to  positive health benefits and animal and an environment-friendly production approach. Organic meat production is also an alternative as it potentially reduces GHG emission. </p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT:</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Organic products have made an important place in today's food market. Most of the countries have set their legal standards and have defined organic food, organic agriculture and produce accordingly but the basic concept remains same i.e. sustainable production without use of harmful chemicals with an environmentally and socially responsible approach. The essence of organic production is to let the process of production be as natural as possible without human intervention. But such a process might not be feasible for ever growing population thus a balanced approach is required that promotes cycling of resources, environmental well-being, conserves biodiversity and is sustainable. </p><p> Organic meat production relies on principles of organic agriculture which aims to produce high quality nutritious food without affecting the ecological balance and the ecosystem and that promotes health and well being of all (individual, society, plants, animals, soil, environment). It emphasises on eliminating chemical use such as in the form of fertilisers, pesticides, drugs, additives as well as genetically modified organisms and feeds. Such measures will ensure sustainable production, soil fertility, biodiversity, food security, well-being of current and future generations along with environment protection. It insists on providing animals with conditions that promote their natural, physiological behaviour and well being and provide them with opportunities of life. IFOAM, the International Federation of Organic Agriculture Movements (IFOAM - Organics International) is an international agency working for promoting organic practice. It works on four basic principles encompassing all aspects of sustainable development and growth (Fig. 1). </p><p> Potential of the production method </p><p> The organic food market has been growing steadily in past few years. The retail sale of organic food and beverages showed a CAGR of 10.4% over 2000 to 2016 which is expected to become 16% during 2017 to 2020. The value of which has increased from $ 17.9 bn. in 2000 to $ 90 bn. in 2016 (FiBL survey). In 2016, the top five countries for organic retail sales were US (46%), followed by Germany (11%), France (8%), China (7%) and Canada (4%). US (47%) is the largest market of organic products followed by European Union (37%) and China (22%). </p><p> Although US is the largest market for organic products, highest growth rate (22%) has been observed in France and Ireland markets followed by Denmark and Norway (20%). As the demand for organic products is increasing, the land under organic production is also increasing. According to a report by FIBL-IFOAM organically managed land area has increased from 11 mill. ha in 1999 to 57.8 mill. ha in 2016 including conserved areas. Australia is the leading country in organic cultivation with 27.1 mill. ha under organic cultivation followed by Argentina (3 mill. ha) and China (2.7 mill. ha). But in terms of organic producers globally India has the highest share with about 835,000 farmers following organic farming followed by Uganda (210,352 farmers) and Mexico (210,000 farmers). </p><p> Requirements for the livestock </p><p> All animals intended for organic production must be born or raised on an organic farm. Organically raised animals can be purchased from certified organic farms or else conventional young ones can be brought to the farm and raised under organic scheme. These animals can also be utilised for production of organic breeding stock. The breed or strain of animal or bird to be raised must be locally adapted, free from genetic disorders (such as PSE, reproductive failures etc) and disease resistant with good growth rate. In a study on poultry strains most suitable for organic system Castellini and Dal Bosco (2017) concluded that slow growing strains performed better in organic production system. In terms of breeding it must be natural. Hormonal treatments, embryo transfers and use of genetically modified organisms is prohibited for organic production and certification. Gestating non-organic animal can be brought to an organic farm not later than third trimester such that the offspring is born in organic farm and is maintained under organic livestock farming regime. </p><p> The age limit for various livestock procurement from conventional farms is as follows: Beef production four weeks weaned calves (fed only on colostrum and milk); Pork production six weeks weaned piglets; Poultry production two day old chicks; Egg production 18 weeks hens. Feeding of young ones should be strictly on maternal milk or natural milk till the age of 90 days for calves, 45 days for sheep and goats and 40 days for pigs (EC889/2008, Article 20). Animal must have free access to pastures during grazing season. Ruminant livestock must be fed on diet containing at least 60% green forage on dry matter basis and the concentrate must not exceed 40% of the ration. For ecological balance and adaptability to local conditions it is necessary to provide more than 50% of feed stuff from same farm or from organically produced farms in local areas. </p><p> The fodder production must comply the norms of organic farming which includes crop rotation, intercropping and green manuring. Crop rotation must be done among fertility building crops and exploitative crops. Measures must be adopted for increasing fixed nitrogen content of soil and mobilisation of phosphorus and potassium reserves. Farmyard manure can be utilised along with fertilisers like lime, rock phosphate etc but highly soluble mineral fertilisers are not recommended. </p><p> The health policy should be preventive. In connection with the breeding, the animals must must be locally adapted and disease resistant. Feeding regime must fulfil nutritional requirement of animals. Occurrence and spread of disease and parasites must be controlled by following proper hygienic and sanitary measures. Sufficient space must be provided to assure freedom of movement and promote physical exercise along with stress free environment which would strengthen immune system preventing sickness or illness and would reduce rick of parasitic infections. Vaccines can be administered for controlling diseases. Under conditions where preventive measures are insufficient to cure animal disease and suffering synthetic drugs approved by regulatory bodies can be administered. </p><p> Processing of organic meat </p><p> Slaughtering, evisceration, quartering, grading packaging and freezing or chilling should be done separately from non-organic products. Sides and quarters intended for organic sale must be marked only with approved markers such as E 155 Brown HT, E 133 Brilliant Blue FCF or E 129 Allura Red AC or by appropriate mixture of E 133 Brillaint Blue FCF and E 129 Allura Red AC (Directive 91/497/EEC). The other operations for production of organic meat products such comminution, grinding, emulsification, curing, heating, drying, mixing, fermenting, preserving, dehydrating, freezing, chilling and canning can be done in regular manner with organic ingredients or approved ingredients for proper labeling of final product. Some of the approved food additives for meat products are sodium nitrite (E250), potassium nitrite (E252) with maximum permissible residual limit of 50mg/kg for bot nitrite and nitrate form; lactic acid (E270); ascorbic acid (E300), sodium ascorbate (E301); sodium lactate (E325), agar (E406) and talc (E553b). </p><p> Packaging and labeling </p><p> Labeling plays a very important role in marketing a products especially food items that have high credence attributes such as organic meat and meat products. According to National Research Council, 2010, labels indicating organic nature of product or production process such as ,,free-range\", ,,grass fed\" etc played vital role in purchasing attitude of consumers. Information regarding animal welfare affected consumers' quality perception of lamb and beef (Napolitano et al. 2010). In this  study the information on organic farming affected the actual liking of beef as these satisfied consumer concerns regarding animal welfare, environment sustainability and product safety. Such information nowadays has more effect on pricing than sensory characteristics (Dransfield et al., 2005). According to a recent on line survey (Nielsen, 2005), health reasons are the major driving force for purchase of organic products. </p><p> The organically produced meat and meat products can be labeled according to the percentage of organic product or ingredients used. There are four categories of organic labeling as follows: </p><p> - 100% organic: raw or processed meat product that contains all organically produced ingredients. </p><p> - Organic: raw or processed meat product containing minimum 95% of organically produced ingredients. </p><p> - Made with organic: these are products that contain 70-95% organic ingredients. The organic ingredients may be displayed on labels indicating amount and their organic origin but the product as such cannot be labeled as organic product. </p><p> - Products with less than 70% organic ingredients. Such products can display the organic ingredient with its beneficial effects. </p><p> The various certifying agencies (national and international organisation) have developed their own seal or logos for indicating organic origin of their products (Fig. 1). Such logos are helpful for consumers and processors to distinguish organic products from non-organic products. These are USDA Organic, Australian Certified Organic, INDOCERT in India, Organic Farming in Europe, JAS in Japan, Bio Gro Organic Certified in New Zealand, BIO in Germany, Bord Bia Quality Assurance logo in Ireland, and Organic in China, IFOAM seal.   </p><p> These logos are indicator of credence attributes that empower consumers with information (Verbeke et al., 2013). In a comparative study on different organic labels, Loo, (2011) found that consumers trusted and valued USDA certification more than general organic label. Whereas, Gao and Schroeder (2009) reported that ,,Certified US Product\" labeled beef steak was rated higher than ,,guaranteed tender\", ,,guaranteed lean\", and ,,enhanced nutrition\" labels in US markets. In China, consumers from Hebei and Tianjin showed willingness to pay 40% higher prices for meat labeled with ,,Green Food\" logo (Yu et al. (2014). Consumers are nowadays willing to pay premium prices for labels such as ,,USDA organic\" logo, environmentally-friendly label, i.e., carbon trust label and on labels promising health benefits such as low in cholesterol, salt or fat content (De Marchi et al. 2016). </p><p> The relationship between producers and consumers should be more transparent for promoting products with high credence values such as organic meat and meat products. There should be proper exchange of information through labeling and certification to boost consumer confidence and trust. Animal welfare standards, standards processing operation, and nutritional claims must be specified and certified. Such information attract consumer attention and positively affect the expected liking of the item. Therefore, labeling can be utilized as an important tool for increasing consumer awareness and confidence in environment and animal friendly organic products. </p><p> Consumer perception </p><p> Credence characteristics of a food commodity is the quality characteristics that cannot be perceived by consumption but are required to be communicated such as healthiness, naturalness or ethical accepts of food. Terms ,,organic\" is another credence factor floating in today's market especially food sector. Consumers are increasingly moving towards organic products and this positiveness, regarding organic products is more than ever before. Consumer preferences have shifted towards more local and sustainable products (Adams and Salois, 2010).  </p><p> The farm gate prices are comparatively higher than conventional prices. According to van Wegenberg et al., (2017) these can be 25% higher than conventional farm gate prices for beef cattle and up to 107% higher for broilers. But consumers today, are willing to pay higher prices for organic products. Spanish consumers showed willingness to pay 12% higher price for organically labelled pork (Gil et al., 2000). Similarly Dransfield et al., (2005) reported that people were willing to pay 5% extra for organic pork while one-fifth of the respondents even preferred to pay up to 20% higher prices. Among consumers Loo (2011), evaluated the willingness to pay (WTP) premium on organic products varied among non-buyers, occasional buyers and habitual buyers; of which habitual buyers were willing to pay a premium of 244.3%, occasional buyer intended for 97.3% and non-buyers preferred only 26.2% for USDA certified organic chicken breast. </p><p> Organic meat and meat products are widely preferred due to their extensive rearing practices which impart characteristic flavour and taste to the meat. For such outdoor raised pigs, consumers in France and Netherland were willing to pay 20% higher prices (Carpentier &amp; Latouche, 2005). Regan et al. (2018) have reported that organic farming, animal welfare, free range and natural management are important factors that affect consumer's perception of high quality meat. Some consumers prefer organic meat because they perceive them to be superior in quality (De la Lama et al., 2017; Realini et al., 2013) while others prefer them as animal welfare and environment friendly. </p><p> Napolitano et al., (2010) have suggested that willingness to pay higher premium for organic beef is more dependent on information than the sensory properties. Similarly Lu et al., (2010) have reported that more than 50% of European consumers considered animal welfare and thus intended to pay higher prices for such meat. </p><p> Sustainable production </p><p> Livestock especially ruminants occupy the second step in the food chain. They consume primary producers and become secondary producers for higher level consumers. These livestock are an important component of balanced ecosystem which can play a vital role in future food security as they can consume and utilise various items that would otherwise be inedible to humans. They are converters that provide us with high quality food (van Wangenberg et al., 2017). The problem arises when limited arable land which can be utilised for feeding humans is used for production of fodder and which is intensified by growing human population. </p><p> Agroforestry is a land management system that integrates forest land with crops and livestock or the crop fields are planted with trees shrubs and combined with livestock rearing, such that the biological interactions produces ecological and economic benefits (Fig. 3). According to FAO ,,Agroforestry can be defined as a dynamic, ecologically based, natural resource management system that, through the integration of trees on farms and in the agricultural landscape, diversifies and sustains production for increased social, economic and environmental benefits for land users at all levels.\" Livestock production in a sustainable production system can be integrated as either in silvopastoral system or as agrosylvopastoral system.  </p><p> Silvopastoral system is an intensified cattle production system that integrates livestock and agriculture for sustainable land use. These systems have lower green house gases emission than conventional systems. Such farms sequester more carbon producing C-neutral products which can be harnessed for value addition of farm by certification (Ibrahim et al., 2010). Thornton and Herrero, (2010) have reported that methane emission from steers raised in an intensive silvopastoral system is 33% less than those reared on grass only pastures which can be attributed to the better quality fodder. Feeding improved nutritional fodder results in reduction of methane (CH4) production during rumen fermentation. </p><p> Horrillo et al. (2016) in their study on conversion from extensive cattle rearing to organic farms have revealed that in high ecological value systems such as Dehesas, organic production would prevent degradation and loss of soil fertility, reduce exploitation of non-renewable resources, increase water retention, improve drought resistance and thus conserve the ecological system. Similarly rearing poultry in pastures along with other livestock improves the soil quality, control insects, pests and weeds while birds get shelter, food, and protection from pastures and trees (Castellini and Dal Bosco, 2017). Free range or pasture poultry have better welfare and higher quality meat. In a study on environment enrichment with trees and tall grasses on performance of free-range chicken Dal Bosco et al. (2014) observed lower mortality. In a life cycle assessment analysis environmental impact of free-range poultry in a orchard reduced land use impact of poultry by 18% and overall impact by12% (Paolotti et al., 2016). Thus, combining trees with livestock in organic production system is a promising approach towards sustainable livestock production. </p><p> Conclusion </p><p> Organic meat is futuristic sustainable meat production system as with limited water and land resources, with depleting soil fertility, water quality and changing environment, agricultural produce alone would be insufficient to feed the increasing human population. In a organic meat production livestock are reared on outdoor pastures with access to fresh green forage and are provided with organic feed inputs only. The use of antibiotics, hormones or growth promoters is restricted. Prophylactic measures are adopted to prevent and control disease. Weeds in farm are controlled by natural methods such as hand weeding munching, tilting etc. while insects are control by traps, birds and good insects. It has higher income per animal and provides full time employment. </p><p> Van Wagenberg et al. (2017) compared organic system to conventional system and reported that organic system had lower AP and EP per unit land and showed lower impact on biodiversity our unit product, lower or equal antibiotic resistance in bacteria. Although organic meat production requires higher initial capital investment but with proper certification the farm outputs can be profitably sold at premium prices. Organic food products are ,,need of the hour\". Modernization has to be coupled with sustainability and urbanization has to be clubbed with nature's requirement. Organic meat production is a promising approach for keeping an environmental balance. </p><p> References </p><p> Literature references can be requested from the corresponding author or the editorial office, respectively. </p><p> Author's adress  </p><p> Pramila Umaraw (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:pramila1303@gmail.com\">pramila1303@gmail.com</email>, corresponding author), Akhilesh K.

By then, the Philippines had already lost 60 percent of its total forest cover, with approximately only 6.84 million hectares of the 16.90 million hectares in 1934 remaining.</p><p>The Forest Management Bureau of the Department of Environment and Natural Resources (DENR) had previously said the country loses about 47,000 hectares a year due to deforestation.</p><p>The culprits?</p><p>Illegal logging, slash-and-burn farming and mining.</p><p>Enter NGP, which aimed to regain 1.50 million hectares of forest lands by planting 1.50 billion trees within six years, or from 2011 to 2016. It was later extended into a long-term program to try to recover the entire Philippine forest cover.</p><p>The DENR was given a total budget of P47.22 billion from 2011 to 2019 to implement the program. However, after eight years of implementation, the forest cover yielded a marginal increase of only 177,441 hectares \u2014 or 88.17 percent below the target of 1.50 million hectares.</p><p>Even more interesting, said COA, most of the forest gains were attributed to \u201cnatural growth\u201d that could have been due to the government\u2019s moratorium order on logging, and not to deliberate reforestation efforts.</p><p>The DENR appeared to have resorted to shortcuts that only sabotaged the program. In 2016, the Philippine Institute for Development Studies already advised the national government to review the NGP, particularly with regard to the mix of tree species being planted, as many were not always appropriate to the site.</p><p>Per the COA report, many NGP sites, while registering an increase in forest cover, were in fact planted to timber species like Falcata trees that would be harvested eventually.</p><p>Other species and perennial crops that were planted \u2014 like coffee, cacao or other agroforestry types \u2014 do not contribute to forest cover. In some cases, the seedlings barely survived due to natural calamities such as typhoons \u201cOmpong\u201d and \u201cRosita,\u201d both in 2018.</p><p>Among other missteps the DENR committed in its rush to meet its target, COA said, were imposing \u201ctoo ambitious\u201d targets on field officers; proceeding with the program without adequate survey, mapping and planning; and including remote, untenured areas without first identifying people\u2019s organizations (POs) that could manage and maintain them.</p><p>It\u2019s that old adage: Haste makes waste. \u201cInstead of accelerating reforestation, fast-tracking only opened the program to waste,\u201d noted COA, adding that the DENR \u201cforced itself\u201d to meet the 1.50 million-hectare target \u201cwithout adequate preparation and support by and among stakeholders.\u201d</p><p>The recovery of the country\u2019s forest cover cannot, of course, be overstated given the country\u2019s vulnerability to climate change.</p><p>\u201cWe depend on forests for our survival, from the air we breathe to the wood we use,\u201d said international conservation organization World Wide Fund for Nature. \u201cBesides providing habitats for animals and livelihoods for humans, forests also offer watershed protection, prevent soil erosion and mitigate climate change. Yet, despite our dependence on forests, we are still allowing them to disappear.\u201d</p><p>Reforestation remains an urgent concern for the country. However, reminded COA, \u201cthis does not mean that the government has to hurry implementing the program\u201d and in the process fritter away efforts and resources through a badly designed game plan.</p><p>The DENR also needs to change its strategy to make it more community-centered than target-driven; this means training field officers and POs and adjusting targets to their capacity, among others.</p><p>\u201cWith only about 40 percent remaining forest cover in the Philippines, it is understandable that there is a need to take big steps to regain the forest cover losses,\u201d noted the report. \u201cHowever, if the key stakeholders lack capacity, the program is bound to miss its objectives.\u201d</p><p>Last year, legislators skeptical over the impact of the program slashed NGP\u2019s budget by half from P5.15 billion in 2018 to P2.60 billion in 2019. The people behind the program are tasked with an important, time-bound job critical to the country\u2019s well-being; they need to show the public that they are well up to it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Philippine Daily Inquirer (Philippines)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-111736</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5XY1-SDC1-F17J-S4FJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"765\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"09\" month=\"01\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>January 9, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Philippines</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><classCode>STX000556</classCode><className>EDITORIALS &amp;

It's one of the bloc's most contentious issues, with member states, lobby groups and environmentalist all trying to sway the debate. Here's an overview.The European Union's common agricultural policy (CAP) accounts for about a third of the EU budget, with some \u20ac54 billion ($64 billion) in farming subsidies going to the bloc's 27 member states each year. Such a significant line item is guaranteed to be a source of much disagreement.As the EU sorts out its common budget for the 2021-2027 period, known as the multiannual financial framework, the CAP is set to undergo a major reform. </p><p>Though the amount of farming subsidies is expected to remain similar \u2014 about \u20ac390 billion until 2027 \u2014 it remains to be seen how the funds will be distributed, and whether funds will be linked to mandatory environmental policies. Read more: Opinion: EU fails to introduce real agricultural reformWhat is the CAP? The EU's common agricultural policy was launched in 1962 to ensure that postwar Europe would have enough food. It had five main goals:  improve agricultural productivity in Europe ensure a stable supply of affordable food stabilize European markets ensure that farmers could make a \"reasonable\" living ensure fair consumer prices As is the case for the rest of the budget, the European Commission, the European Parliament and the EU Council of Ministers \u2014 in this case, the agricultural ministers of all 27 member states \u2014 must decide on the future of the CAP together.Read more: 'Eat less meat to help the climate' doesn't apply to everyone - here's whyHow does the EU currently distribute farming subsidies? The first pillar of the CAP comprises direct payments, which are calculated by hectare. Simply put: the larger the farm, the larger the subsidy.\u202fAccording to the German Environment Agency (UBA), direct payments account for, on average, about 40% of a farm's yearly income.But these direct payments have been criticized for contributing to the decline of smallholdings; farmers with smaller properties benefit considerably less from the EU's subsidies than industrial factory farms. According to the German Ministry of Food and Agriculture, Germany receives \u20ac6.2 billion in agricultural subsidies each year. Of this, \u20ac5 billion is direct payments. The remaining \u20ac1.2 billion \u2014 the CAP's second pillar \u2014 is put aside for rural development plans and measures relating to the climate and environment.The problem is that this second pillar is co-financed by member states. A country, region or municipality has to match any EU subsidy from the second pillar with the same amount from its own resources \u2014 which is why member states often don't apply for these funds.Read more:In Europe, climate change brings new crops, new ideas What's been the criticism of these subsidies?Large-scale industrial agriculture has often been blamed for contributing to biodiversity loss and growing CO2 emissions, and for polluting soil and water through the use of pesticides and fertilizers. Environment groups, climate activists and green political parties have criticized the CAP's direct payment-per-hectare system, accusing it of overwhelmingly promoting such practices.These payments generally aren't linked to schemes that benefit the environment. As it stands today, to receive subsidies farmers simply have to confirm the \"good agricultural and environmental conditions\" of their land, as well as fulfill the \"statutory management requirements,\" according to the European Commission.However, a new regulation was introduced in 2013 to ensure that a third of direct payments would only be released if certain \"greening\" measures had been put in place \u2014 that is, if farms meet certain environmental requirements. But Friends of the Earth Germany and other environmental groups have said this requirement doesn't go far enough. The German Environment Agency admitted in September that \"greening measures had not led to many operational changes and had hardly any positive effects from an environmental point of view.\"Read more:Could high-tech Netherlands-style farming feed the world? What reforms are necessary? The EU's agricultural policy must become more ecological and sustainable, and farmers should be rewarded for introducing measures that protect the environment \u2014 that's idea, anyway. However, there's been a long-running debate within the EU as to what percentage of direct payments should be linked to ecological measures in the years ahead.The European Commission has suggested that member states themselves should control the environmental measures, monitoring and sanctions \u2014 currently, these are stipulated by the EU. It also wants member states to send their policy plans to be approved by the European Commission. However, this proposal \u2014 backed on Wednesday by the bloc's 27 agriculture ministers \u2014 has been rejected by environmentalists, who think that member states would set the environmental bar too low, and agricultural lobby groups, who think the plan would unfairly distort competition between member states. The commission's proposed \"eco-schemes,\" which will be linked to first pillar payments and are expected to be much stricter than any previous measures, have also been contentious. Under the eco-schemes, 20% of the payments to farmers would be earmarked for green initiatives such as organic farming and agroforestry. A farm would only receive the full direct payment once it proves that it has fulfilled all the new environmental regulations, and wouldn't be able use the money for other purposes. The European Parliament, however, has backed a plan that would see this upped to 30% of payments.Read more: Vegan meat: The future of planet-saving plant-based eating What's been the reaction to the new plan?Environmentalists want the EU to go even further. Angelika Lischka, an agriculture expert with NABU, Germany's largest nature conservation NGO, told DW that organizations such as hers \"are calling for at least half of the direct payments in the first pillar to be linked with eco-schemes.\" But Joachim Rukwied, the head of the German Farmers' Association, has warned against maximizing the requirements \"linked exclusively to the environment.\" He said the EU needed to provide support for the agriculture sector to guarantee that all of the CAP's goals are met, including ensuring that farmers are able to earn a reasonable living. Environmental groups and the German Environment Agency (UBA) agree that the coming funding period should be used to completely overhaul the EU's agricultural policy, considering that the environmental damage caused by the sector is already a major problem. Lea K\u00f6der from the UBA told DW that Germany had already breached EU law by exceeding the limits set out in the bloc's Nitrates Directive, which aims to reduce water pollution from agricultural sources. \"We have to start reforming the system now, or it will only be possible to reach environmental goals with very expensive and drastic measures,\" she said.Read more: Farmers in Germany feel the heat of climate change </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988160331554430725876100215</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6145-2WP1-JCMN-Y1KB-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1201\"/><timeReceived>9:25 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"21\" month=\"10\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>October 21, 2020 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"57\"><classCode>ST000D73F</classCode><className>EUROPEAN UNION</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>World</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"76\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST00095A9</classCode><className>AGRICULTURE REGULATION &amp;

America, specifically, North America (market size, $ 212.05 bn., 2019, Fortune Business Insight) and Europe are the major markets of processed meat products, but in recent times the meat product consumption is sharply rising in China and the East Asian countries. As far as the quality of meat is concerned, it is a nutrient-dense food and an ideal source for the growth of microorganism, thus susceptible to spoilage. Further, the moisture content in meat is also high, that makes it highly perishable (Zhou et al., 2010). Growth of microorganism and numerous biochemical responses further declines the meat quality (Falowo et al., 2018). The proliferation of microorganism and release of various metabolites causes a detectable change in the sensory perception of meat (Ellis and Goodacre, 2001), while lipid oxidation chemically deteriorates the muscle characteristics (Contini et al., 2014). Both microbial and chemical deterioration, resulting in a change in colour, development of objectionable flavours, loses of nutrients, decrease in shelf stability and development of toxic chemicals which resulted in the occurrence of food-borne illnesses (Faustman et al., 2010). </p><p> Further, the production of free radicals adversely affects the sensory, functional, and nutritive quality of meat and meat foods (Bou et al., 2004) that poses human health at various risks. Some the additives, binders and chemical preservatives were added to improve the quality and functionality of meat product. These are starch, artificial flavour, acidity regulators, colouring agents, preservatives etc. Meat lipid can be oxidative stable only when there is a balance between the reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants (Pouzo et al., 2016). Synthetic antioxidants, like butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ) have frequently been used not only to improve the shelf stability, but it also provides colour and flavour stability to meat products (Hygreeva et al., 2014). </p><p> Issues associated with synthetic additives </p><p> Some of additives or preservatives added in meat products are produced by chemical synthesis which poses risks to life. As an example, sodium nitrite is used in the meat and meat products which impart intense bacteriostatic and bactericidal activities. It also imparts characteristic flavour, stabilize the color of meat and protects from lipid oxidation in cured meat products. Studies showed that nitrites form carcinogenic compounds which pose profound health implications. Recently, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) looked into the safety aspects of consuming red and processed meat and concluded that various additives and processes such as smoking, curing, and high-temperature cooking (pan-frying, grilling, barbequing) produces carcinogenic compounds (Bouvard et al., 2015) like nitrates. The ingested nitrates or nitrites are probable carcinogen to humans under conditions favouring the endogenous nitrosation. Nitrites are transformed into nitric oxide by gastric acid-catalyzed formation, which acts as a nitrosating agent of amines and amides, as a consequence generation of N-nitroso-compounds (NOC) occurs (Tricker and Preussmann, 1991). Legal limits for the addition of nitrates and nitrites have been set by several countries and EU (Govari and Pexara, 2018) but still, it creates doubts in the mind of the consumer because of the generated awareness on the consequences of these additives. Therefore, there has been growing interest to use potential antioxidants from natural sources in health food or functional food which is environmentally friendly and need no additives of synthetic origin (Falowo et al., 2014). </p><p> Moringa oleifera - a potential substitute for synthetic additives </p><p> Moringa oleifera belongs to the Moringaceae family and one among approximately 13 different Moringa tree species (Mbikay, 2012). The plant is commonly found in Asia, Africa, Europe, America, and Oceania regions (Fahey, 2005; Oliveira et al., 1999). It is also called as 'drumstick tree' (Anwar and Bhanger, 2003), and 'Shagara al Rauwaq' (Von Maydell, 1990). Practically, its branches and leaves, seeds, fruits and bark contain protein, minerals and vitamins and the like nutrients. The plant is high in protein (approx. 30%), [alpha]-linoleic acid and essential amino acid (Moyo et al., 2011). Moringa leaves also considered a rich source of flavonoids (Lako et al., 2007; Siddhuraju and Becker, 2003), vitamins, minerals (Gupta et al., 1989), polyphenols (Bennett et al., 2003), alkaloids, and proteins (Sarwatt et al., 2002; Soliva et al., 2005). Moringa oleifera leaves possess immense nutritional value (Moyo et al., 2011; Oliveira et al., 1999) polyphenolic content, antioxidant potential (Chumark et al., 2008; Siddhuraju and Becker, 2003) as well as antimicrobial activity (Bukar and Oyeyi, 2010). It promotes metabolism, increased body mass, increasing the immunity of the human body, has a medical effect and perform health care functions (Fuglie, 1999). Due to its nutritional and functional characteristics, the plant is widely used for food and medicinal purpose (L\u00fcrling and Beekman, 2010). Various food product containing Moringa were development and focus being made on a conventional type of food, such as Moringa biscuits, Moringa soup, Moringa candy and the like, and functional foods, health drinks such as Moringa teas and Moringa protein powder. Due to the presence of numerous phytochemicals, the Moringa oleifera plant may improve the physicochemical, functional and sensory characteristics of meat and find numerous application in livestock industry (Abd El Baky and El-Baroty, 2013; Nkukwana et al., 2014; Nkukwana et al., 2016a, b; Qwele et al., 2013b). The present paper focus to review the work carried out by different researches and the market potential of patented technology of Moringa oleifera incorporated meat product. One such patented product has been shown in the Figure.  </p><p> Improving meat product quality and functionality using Moringa oleifera </p><p> Being rich in protein and various phytochemicals Moringa oleifera has also been appropriate for both animal and human consumption. As a livestock feed and demonstrated significant improvement in growth performance and milk quality. Incorporation of Moringa in meat products promotes oxidative stability and simultaneously enhancing the organoleptic quality. It further reduces the microbial load in meat products after processing and cold storage. Recent patented meat product incorporated with Moringa oleifera are discussed in Table 1a-c.  </p><p> Jayawardana et al. (2015) evaluated antioxidative capacity of Moringa oleifera leaves (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1%) at four different levels by incorporation is chicken sausages. Moringa leaves incorporated at higher concentration exhibited significantly low lipid peroxidation compared to the lower concentration used. Sensorily, no difference was observed in the sensory scores at 0.25% and 0.5% MOL compared to the control. The study further identifies the significant antioxidant and antimicrobial potential of drumstick leaves in chicken sausages (Jayawardana et al., 2015). In a study reported by (Qwele et al., 2013a) wherein the Moringa oleifera leaves (MOL) were supplemented in meat obtained from goats and evaluated for fatty acid (FA) content and antioxidant capacity. A significantly higher concentration of total phenolic content (10.62\u00a0mg/g) and radical scavenging activity (ABTS, 93.51% and DPPH, 58.95%) was observed for Moringa oleifera supplemented meats. Further, the meat showed high antioxidative effect using MOL as observed from catalase (CAT), reduced glutathione (GSH), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and lipid oxidation (LO) tests. The present study indicated that the antioxidative potential of MOL that might play a role in improving meat quality (chemical composition, colour and lipid stability). Similarly, cooked goat meat patties added with Moringa oleifera leaves extract (MOLE) were studied for antioxidant capacity and for retarding lipid peroxidation during refrigerated storage. High phenolic content (48.36\u00a0mg/g) and flavonoid (31.42\u00a0mg/g) in the extract exhibited excellent antioxidant activity.  </p><p> The IC50 value of MOLE patties 379.45 was significantly (P &lt; 0.05) increased from 285.56 to in control, determined by radical-scavenging activity (DPPH). MOL extract (0.1%) retard lipid peroxidation of cooked goat meat patties and remained lowest (0.53\u00a0mg malonaldehyde per kg sample) up to 15 days. The antioxidant activity of MOL extract was found to be comparable to BHT. MOLE incorporated Patties have similar sensory scores to that of control, and it was suggested that the MOL extract at  100\u00a0mg/100\u00a0g meat could protect the patties from oxidative rancidity, and it was observed to be more effective than the synthetic antioxidants like BHT (Das et al., 2012). In another study, cooked ground buffalo meat (GBM), treated with, 1, 1.5 and 2% levels of the aqueous solution of crude extract of drumstick (Moringa oleifera) leaves were evaluated for physico-chemical, microbial and organoleptic qualities. There was a significant improvement in meat pH and water holding capacity (WHC) when the GBM samples were treated with 1.5% crude extract of drumstick leaves. It further lowered cooking loss, thiobarbituric acid (TBA) value and microbial load (significant, P &lt; 0.05) and other treated samples as compared to control. Organoleptic parameters like juiciness, tenderness and overall acceptability were similar to untreated samples (Hazra et al., 2012). The antimicrobial activities of Moringa oleifera leaf extract ML (1\u00a0g/kg), in terms of microbial count of ground beef, was studied during 6-day cold storage. ML extract had higher phenolic, and flavonoid contents (p &gt; 0.05) compared to the other extract studied. Addition of ML leaf extract to ground beef sample lowered total viable and lactic acid bacteria (p &lt; 0.05) counts than control and BHT treated samples at day three of storage. These results suggest that ML leaf extract could be used as potential sources of the natural antimicrobial agent in meat products (Falowo et al., 2016). Moringa oleifera Lam. seed flour (SF) is added in the chicken mortadella (a large Italian sausage) as a partial fat replacer and studied for physicochemical characteristics, chemical composition, and lipid oxidation. Moringa seed flour was incorporated at 1%, 3%, and 5% and compared with the control mortadella. SF added at 5% level had the lowest lipid content (p &lt; 0.05) and reduction in lipid oxidation and the control samples had the highest (p &lt; 0.05). Further, there was an increase in the instrumental color parameter L*, a*, and b* values with the addition of Moringa seed flour. This changes in colour parameter were less prominent during 90-day refrigerated storage 4\u00a0\u00b0C. The study concluded that due to the antioxidant activity of the Moringa seeds, it can be exploited as a natural functional ingredients in meat and meat product and the Moringa SF can be successfully added at 3% in chicken mortadella without altering the sensory property (color change) and the product have high lipid stability, reduced lipid content (Auriema et al., 2019). In a study by (Madane et al., 2019), the efficacy of Moringa flower (MF) extract was investigated to develop the functional chicken product. MF at  1% and 2% were added in cooked chicken nuggets and compared with the control. The product was studied for their nutritional, physicochemical, organoleptic attributes and storage stability at 4\u00a0\u00b0C. MF reported high protein (17.87%), dietary fibre (36.14%) and total phenolics (18.34 to 19.49%) content on a dry matter basis. MF addition significantly enhanced the emulsion stability, cooking yield, protein, total phenolics, dietary fibre and ash content compared to control. MF extract addition at 2% level significantly increased the lightness but lowered the textural characteristic (hardness, gumminess and chewiness) of the product, compared to control. Further, significantly reduced lipid oxidation, improved oxidative stability, and odour scores were observed during storage for MF extract added chicken product. The nuggets remained stable for 15 days without affecting the sensory attributes by the addition of MF extract. The results concluded that the effectiveness of MF extract for consideration as a natural functional ingredient for quality enhancement and lowering lipid oxidation in cooked chicken nuggets. In another study, raw and cooked pork patties added with different levels of Moringa oleifera leaves extract (MLE), and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT) were evaluated for radical scavenging effect during refrigerated storage. MLE at a concentration of 300\u00a0ppm, 450\u00a0ppm and 500\u00a0ppm (the added extract were equivalent Moringa oleifera leaves phenolics) and BHT at 200\u00a0ppm were compared with control. Total phenolic content in the MLE varied from 60.78 to 70.27\u00a0mg/g. MLE and BHT treated pork patties showed high DPPH activity, and it is concentration-dependent. MLE600 and BHT 200 showed significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) a* value and lower thiobarbituric acid reactive substances compared to control. The extract MLE did not affect the sensory attributes or microbial quality. These results showed that Moringa oleifera leaves could be used as a potential source of natural antioxidants to inhibit lipid oxidation in ground pork patties (Muthukumar et al., 2014). </p><p> These various studies suggested the Moringa oleifera can be successfully incorporated in the meat product to improve the quality and functionality by reducing the production of ROS or improving nutritive quality. In other cases, Moringa enhances the microbial stability and organoleptic characteristics of the meat products. Recently, many patents have been filed to utilize the nutritional, sensory, functional and health-promoting properties of Moringa oleifera in meat product, as summarized in Table 1a-c. These patenting activities revealed the potential of Moringa oleifera plant as a natural additive. The increasing number of patent filing on meat product incorporated with Moringa oleifera indicates a possible commercial potential of these functional meat products. </p><p> Conclusion </p><p> The present and ongoing researches are mainly focused upon the minimum uses of synthetic additives and replacing them with the natural one. To increase the nutritional and techno-functional characteristics of meat product, utilizing plant parts of Moringa oleifera could be a promising approach. The multi-functional application of Moringa oleifera can provide consumers with a healthy and functional alternative of meat products. </p><p> References </p><p> 1. Abd El Baky, H.

We should utilise the barren land through agroforestry,\u201d said GC, expressing hope that the new policy would address the concerns of poor farmers and benefit them greatly.</p><p>Nepal started its work to support agroforestry practices nearly three years ago when in 2015, the then government endorsed the \u201cKathmandu Declaration on Agroforestry\u201d.</p><p>The declaration had pointed out the need of a more focused and coordinated strategy and approach to promote agroforestry among various stakeholders through National Agroforestry Policy for Nepal. \u00a0</p><p>According to the declaration, the proposed policy would encourage easing of regulatory constraints and facilitate the development of feed and fodder resources, income generation, food, nutritional and energy security, controlling land degradation and development of various agroforestry models for different agro-ecological zones.</p><p>Since then four ministries of the government--Ministry of Forest and Soil Conservation (MoFSC), Ministry of Agricultural Development (MoAD), Ministry of Population and Environment (MoPE) and Ministry of Livestock Development (MoLD)--with technical support from the World Agroforestry Centre (WAC), also called the International Centre for Research in Agroforestry (ICRAF), have been working on promulgating an agroforestry policy for Nepal.</p><p>The Inter-ministerial Coordination Committee has been collecting feedback on agroforestry policy from different sectors that include policy makers, farmers and forest promoters, and civil society.</p><p>Dr Javed Rizvi, regional director, South Asia programme of WAC, said Nepali farmers had been practising agroforestry since the time immemorial which would make it more feasible for Nepal.</p><p>\u201cFarmers have been cultivating trees on farmland for a long time, which is now called agroforestry. This is not a new concept for Nepal,\u201d said Rizvi. \u201cLocal knowledge and science-based intervention are needed for sustainable development of forest in Nepal.\u201d</p><p>Sharing Indian experience of agroforestry since its adoption of a policy, Rizvi said local farmers have been supplying more than 60 per cent of timber required for the Indian market that accounts for $24billion annually.</p><p>\u201cAgroforestry has the potential to protect farming communities by providing alternative resources, diversify their income opportunities and also mitigate the impact of climate change through absorbing atmospheric carbon,\u201d added Rizvi.</p><p>Nepali stakeholders, however, raised concerns about various legal constraints that might hinder agroforestry practices in the country.</p><p>There are 32 national polices that talk about agroforestry, but all of them lack clarity, according to participants.</p><p>Murari Raj Joshi, a consultant for the IMCC for designing the policy, said there are various policies that talk about agroforestry but they lack clarity when it comes to institutional framework.</p><p>\u201cBesides clearly drawing the roles and responsibilities of different agencies, the new policy should declare an agroforestry super zone for the areas where the forest coverage is poor,\u201d said Joshi.</p><p>Stakeholders said that promotion of agroforestry would merely remain an idea on papers if the government refused to loosen the legal restraints.</p><p>\u201cThere are already many provisions that contradict each other and restrict hassle-free trade of timber and forest products.

Planting these trees will also support raw materials for its proposed facility. It also needs local people and authorities to cooperate to take care of the trees as they will also benefit.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chief Executive Officer of the company Martin Forsen recently told Vientiane Times that \u201cToday we have currently planted only 3,000 hectares of eucalyptus, teak and acacia on the allocated plantation. We also plan to further extend to reach our next step where we require 60,000 hectares of land for industrial tree plantations.\u201d</p><p>\u201cWhen we have 60,000 hectares of land, then we will be able to start to build a pulp mill which will have a large investment of US$800 million. This pulp mill will be the largest mill and is more profitable than other sectors like mining, tourism, and hydro power and it will provide benefits to our farmers,\u201d he said.</p><p>He explained that one mill could create over 40,000 direct and indirect jobs mainly in rural areas, while the government would also receive US$30million from exports each year.</p><p>He believed it was one of the best projects of its kind in the world, which had the least impact on the environment, while planting trees could capture carbon.</p><p>\u201cWe have good technology and can make products cheaper.\u201d</p><p>\u201cI worked for over ten years in Sweden where I had experience in plywood mills. So, we have money to build a pulp mill, and the knowledge to receive support from the government and people. We just need to get the land now to plant our trees,\u201d he stressed.</p><p>He said that agro forestry has a land-use system in which timber plantations were integrated with farm crops on the same land and it offered significant environmental, social and economic benefits. Seven-year rotation plantation operations were conducted in cooperation with participating villages, with the space between tree rows provided for community agricultural activities.</p><p>Rice and other crops were grown during the first years of plantation establishment and then livestock could graze until harvesting the trees after seven years and then the cycle restarts.\u00a0 Proven agro forestry systems in combination with funds for rural development strongly supported the government goal to eradicate poverty in remote areas.</p><p>Martin noted \u201cLaos has high rainfall, good climate and good soil, which is good for our trees to grow up faster.\u201d</p><p>The company\u2019s Deputy Managing Director Souphayvanh Thiengchanhxay said that \u201cArbor Day is an important date to plant our trees in cooperation with authorities and local people.\u201d</p><p>This year they would create activities for districts in the capital and two provinces with primary school students planting mostly eucalyptus, teak and acacia seedlings, she said.</p><p>\u201cOur company is providing seedlings to state organisations and we hope they will have measures to take care of them.\u201d</p><p>\u201cLast year, we planted over 1,000 hectares mostly on the land of local people. If they have good land we can pay them 40 million kip for ten hectares over 30 years. For one hectare we pay 3 to 4 million kip with the trees belonging to our company, while local people can plant their rice between our trees,\u201d she added.</p><p>She explained that on one hectare they were able to plant 1,100 eucalyptus trees. After they grow for seven years they can be cut and later cut again 3 times every three years before replanting.</p><p>For the first to second year local people could plant rice and then from the third to seventh year local people could raise their cattle, she added.</p><p>Burapha was established in 1993 in Laos and is one of the oldest private companies in the country being the first to establish commercial plantations in Laos and today considers itself a world leader in agro forestry.</p><p>The company\u2019s objective is to build timber plantation assets that are large enough to supply major forest industry operations producing biofuels, green electricity, green chemicals, plywood, sawn timber and kraft and or dissolving pulp using the plantations as a renewable resource.</p><p>The company exports its products to Sweden, France, Germany, Switzerland, Italy, Norway, Denmark, Iceland, Poland, Russia, America, New Zealand, Republic of Korea and Thailand, while some are also sold in Laos.</p><p>Most of the company\u2019s plantations are in the capital as well as Vientiane and Xayaboury provinces.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Vientiane Times (Laos)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Local people prepare eucalyptus seedlings before distributing them for planting.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-47072</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-VM51-F17J-S520-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"779\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"05\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>May 30, 2017 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Laos</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009SI7</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTALISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000072</classCode><className>ALLIANCES &amp;

The Jury praised the outstanding effort in  creating a portfolio of profitable and sustainable land restoration  projects in the very short time of two years. 12Tree group has more  than 12,000 ha of agroforestry projects under management. The award  follows an ambitious 2-year implementation cycle of institutional  ag-investment in Central- and South America. Fifteen ministers and  vice-ministers of Latin American and Caribbean countries,  representatives of 12 impact funds, and 100 technical experts were  present in Buenos Aires.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Since its inception in 2017, 12Tree already has established  projects in Costa Rica, Colombia, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador,  Guatemala, Morocco, and Panama. Strong focus is on reforestation and  transformative large-scale cocoa production in agroforestry systems  with particular attention to sustainability and value-sharing with  local communities. 12Tree has also launched the first sustainable  cacao fund in Luxemburg, and currently a total fund commitment of  more than 200 million US$ to invest in sustainable land use projects.</p><p>Richard Focken, CEO 12Tree Finance: \"We are honoured to receive  this prestigious award from the Initiative 20x20. It proves to us  that solid funding from institutional investors can and needs to be  combined with a strong ability to operate the farms and forestry  projects. This leads to accelerated efficient deployment in land  restauration, carbon sequestration and sustainable rural development. We continue to support the efforts of Initiative 20x20 and its  partners to help countries achieve their goals.</p><p>Walter Vergara, Coordinator of the 20x20 Initiative Secretariat:  \"12Tree has created an impressive portfolio of sustainable forestry  and agroforestry projects in a very short time frame, rivalled by  none in our space. The ability to deploy and implement was impressive to our jury. We agree with 12Tree that our efforts need real-life  business cases and the countries in Latin America and the Caribbean  need visionary capital to reach their sustainable development and  carbon goals and to transform agriculture into truly sustainable and  resilient businesses.\" More on the projects: <url normalizedValue=\"http://ots.de/ZVd9yJ\">http://ots.de/ZVd9yJ</url>)</p><p>About 12Tree</p><p>12Tree Finance is a pioneer in making sustainable forestry and  agroforestry projects investable for institutional investors. As an  asset manager, 12Tree specializes in identifying, structuring,  financing and managing agroforestry projects. With strong operational experience and capabilities, the long-term objective is to create new forest areas with a focus on Central and South America. All  plantations are operated commercially to generate sustainable  profitability and provide ecological and social benefits for local  communities. In 2018 12Tree launched the Luxemburg SAF Fund, with a  focus of modernizing cocoa farming. All projects have subscribed to  the UN Sustainability goals and 12Tree is winner of the Portfolio  price of the 20x20 Global Restoration Initiative: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.12tree.de\">www.12tree.de</url></p><p>About Initiative 20x20:</p><p>Initiative 20x20 is a country-led effort to change the dynamics of land degradation in Latin America and the Caribbean. Governments,  regional programs, impact investors, and technical partners launched  Initiative 20x20 in 2014 at COP20 in Lima, to contribute to restoring 20 million hectares of degraded land by 2020. Now that the goal has  been reached and US$2.4 billion has been earmarked to finance  projects on the ground, partners are working for the region to  achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 using restoration as a key approach to benefit economies, people and landscapes.

They should also have a market for their products and good logistics system. And, most importantly, the local community should benefit from the project.</p><p>Ms Souphayvanh explained why the Burapha Agro-Forestry Company was successful in winning the Asean Agrow Golden Award.</p><p>Burapha was the first company to establish commercial agroforestry plantations in Laos and is today one of the world leaders in the concept of agroforestry, with the first development work being done in 1993.</p><p>Agroforestry is a land-use system in which timber plantations are integrated with farm crops on the same land and offers significant environmental, social and economic benefits.</p><p>Seven-year rotation plantation operations are conducted in cooperation with participating villages, with the space between tree rows provided for community agricultural activities.\u00a0</p><p>Rice and other crops are grown during the first years of plantation establishment and then livestock can graze until the trees are harvested after seven years and then the cycle restarts. Proven agroforestry systems in combination with funds for rural development strongly support the government\u2019s goal to eradicate poverty in remote rural areas.</p><p>Today Burapha has a modern sawmill outside Vientiane and will start the construction of a high technology plywood mill at the end of this year to produce plywood for domestic and international markets.</p><p>Ms Souphayvanh said Laos has the potential to utilise the land in a more sustainable way and produce value-added products for international markets.</p><p>According to the company\u2019s research, Laos is the best country in the world for agroforestry taking into consideration biological growth rates, population density, stability of government, low risk of natural disasters, high availability of land, and closeness to markets.</p><p>\u201cThe company is committed to managing and developing the business in a sustainable manner. Burapha is the first company in Laos with Forest Stewardship Certification, which acknowledges the company\u2019s high environmental, social and economic standards,\u201d she said.</p><p>Burapha\u2019s objective is to build an agroforestry plantation in Laos large enough to supply a major industry operation producing agricultural crops, biofuels, green electricity, green chemicals, plywood, sawn timber and Kraft and/or dissolving pulp using the plantations as a renewable resource.</p><p>Since Burapha is only utilising degraded land the biomass on the land, in steady state as an average over the rotation, Burapha has as of now captured 380,000 tons of CO2 and will in the coming years capture an additional 5.32 million tons CO2.\u00a0 The products Burapha produce and plan to produce are sustainable and biodegradable and can replace oil-based products such as building materials, packaging and textiles.</p><p>\u201cBy establishing agroforestry plantations Burapha creates a sustainable source of wood that decreases pressure on the remaining natural forest. Agroforestry plantations also create alternative income streams to illegal logging and slash and burn agriculture,\u201d she explains.</p><p>In addition, Burapha\u2019s follow-up shows that the villagers the company engages with increase their income three times compared to the shifting cultivation practices that were previously predominant on the land. The farmers get more rice per hectare, as well as a cash income from the labour opportunities created.</p><p>Salary levels are well above minimum wage in Laos and are based on a third-party estimate of minimum sustainable living wage on which the company on top adds an additional 10 percent. Today, Burapha\u2019s internal minimum wage is 18 percent higher than the Lao minimum wage.</p><p>Since the company\u2019s agroforestry methods can be highly mechanised, there is strong potential for transition from low skilled jobs to high skilled jobs. As an example, today harvesting operations are mainly manual, to create job opportunities in rural areas.</p><p>\u201cAs Laos is a fast-growing economy and has a low population density, we foresee a labour shortage and will then move to more mechanised harvesting and thus create higher skilled jobs without our operational cost increasing,\u201d said Ms Souphayvanh.</p><p>The project will give significant benefits to the government and people of Laos through tax income, job creation, poverty alleviation and food sustainability. The company\u2019s model incorporates the poorest and most vulnerable people, delivering benefits where they are most needed.</p><p>Burapha normally leases land from the farmer for a period over 30 years. To ensure that farmers understand the project and that there are no land use conflicts, Burapha has a bottom-up driven land acquisition where they always ask for the farmers\u2019 consent through a thorough free, prior and informed consent (FPIC) procedure.</p><p>Burapha also arranges study tours for villagers in new areas to visit farmers the company already cooperates with and ask questions and get information without the company\u2019s interference.</p><p>Through the work in the agroforestry plantations the farmers learn how to establish their own plantations and since they now have an additional income they can invest, they are encouraged to invest in their own agro-forestry plantations.</p><p>The company is, together with involved organisations, donating seedlings and fertiliser to farmers that want to establish their own plantations.</p><p>\u201cThis is one of the best ways of capacity building - first learning by doing and then lowering the investment threshold by eliminating the capital input (seedlings and fertiliser),\u201d said Ms Souphavanh.</p><p>Burapha has a policy to employ local staff and many middle management employees started in the company as seasonal workers and now have high skilled jobs. Today 24 percent of the employees are female and the company has set a target to reach 30 percent female employees within three years.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Vientiane Times (Laos)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Ms Souphayvanh Thiengchanhxay holds the Asean Agrow Golden Award after being presented with the plaque in the Philippines.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-84492</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5TK6-F051-F17J-S36W-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1179\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"10\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>October 26, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"58\"><className>CHAMBER OF COMMERCE &amp;

Cinnamon is also not very profitable as it takes a long time to grow,\u201d he added.</p><p>Nghia said agroforestry produce must be diversified to bring more value to farmers, and essential oil from these two sources could be used as a base material for various useable products.</p><p>The 20-year-old said consumers now preferred chemical-free washing up liquid and organic perfumes.

We offer a 10ml bottle of cinnamon oil for VND80,000 ($3.5),\u201d Van said.</p><p>She said these \u2018green\u2019 products help promote the village and attract more visitors to the area.</p><p>Van said 70 per cent of co-operative\u2019s products are sold online and through distribution agents. Some are even available at shops in the central region.</p><p>\u201cMy garden now gains a double income. All members of the co-operative supply citronella and cinnamon for oil extraction\u201d said Vo Hong Hung, a farmer in Tien Ha Commune.</p><p>He said each kilo of citronella costs VND5,000 ($0.2) as a seasoning, but the lemongrass collected for essential oil costs VND13,000 ($0.6) per kilo.</p><p>He said his cinnamon plantation earned him VND80 million (US$3,500) from 400 tonnes of leaves alone each year, excluding the bark and branches used for oil production.</p><p>The co-operative purchases 100 tonnes of cinnamon material from local farmers each year, and 200kg of citronella from local farmers each crop.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Eco-tourism </emphasis></p><p>The Tien Phuoc authorities have planned a community-based tourism service in combination with boosting diversified farm produce.</p><p>\u201cWe are building 32 OCOP products as part of an eco-tour service in rural mountainous areas, including cinnamon, citronella and fruit,\u201d said vice chairman of the district\u2019s people\u2019s committee Phung Van Huy.</p><p>\u201cThe district plans 25ha of aromatic herb farms to make essential oils, and 6,000ha of protected forest,\u201d he said.</p><p>The district wants to create a high-value product by developing production chains between villages with strict quality standards.</p><p>The vice chairman said the value of garden and agroforestry products (log farm, herbs, vegetables) in the district was estimated at VND300 billion ($13.3 million), but it had yet to be exploited.</p><p>\u201cCinnamon and citronella oils are two key OCOP products as part of the eco-tourism strategy. The district has also been promoting itself as a \u2018clean and green\u2019 destination for other products, including jackfruit, banana\u00a0and pepper,\u201d Huy said.</p><p>Huy said the district had called for investment from travel agencies in connection with tour services in the village and destinations in neighbouring provinces.</p><p>Tourism could help local people preserve their traditional gardens and agroforestry products as well as traditional culture, he said.</p><p>The vice chairman said 90 per cent of the population made a living on rice farming and gardening, so community-based tourism development would help boost locals\u2019 income.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Challenges</emphasis></p><p>Despite the debut of a saleable product, essential oils from Tien Phuoc\u2019s \u2018green\u2019 herb co-operative still have a long way to go, according to farmer Nghia.</p><p>\u201cWe need more investment in technology instead of manual production of essential oil. Our products are still not eye-catching, while only a few items are available for sale. Oils are regularly used in cosmetics, but these products require a significant amount of investment.\u201d he said.</p><p>Nghia said farmers had raised funds of VND2 billion ($88,000) \u2013 too little for the development of cosmetic production.</p><p>He said Tien Phuoc\u2019s \u2018green\u2019 herb product was just a starting point, and it would need time to grow into other areas.</p><p>\u201cWe successfully found a way for local farmers to increase the value of their produce, and set up a business model for them in the near future.\u201d</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Viet Nam News (Vietnam)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Essential oil of citronella is produced by farmers in Tien Phuoc district.</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p>A farmer in Tien Ha commune grows citronella at home</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-91654</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VFH-8HR1-F17J-S35K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"918\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"02\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>February 17, 2019 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Vietnam</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Business</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"93\"><classCode>ST000DLHC</classCode><className>ESSENTIAL OILS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>N325998MQ</classCode><className>ESSENTIAL OILS MFG</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000553</classCode><className>ECOTOURISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000773</classCode><className>GARDENING</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSBV</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE TOURISM</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N712120GM</classCode><className>HISTORIC DISTRICTS &amp;

Experts on the region from outside the church will also take part.</p><p>Female members of the church will attend, but do not have voting rights.</p><p>A working document for the synod, published in June, suggested that older, respected members of Amazon communities should be allowed to be ordained \"even if they have an existing and stable family.\"</p><p>Conservative clerics at the Vatican have expressed outrage at the possibility that centuries of Catholic tradition of a celibate priesthood might be overturned. Francis has said he is open to considering the change, which would apply only to the Amazon region.</p><p>Some isolated Catholic communities deep in the Amazon forest can hardly ever go to Mass because they have no resident priest. Ordaining married men is seen as one possible solution.</p><p>Environmental and economic exploitation are also key topics for the synod, which comes in the wake of devastating Amazon fires in Brazil, allegedly to clear land for illegal logging, mining and crops. The situation of indigenous peoples in the region will also be discussed.</p><p>The bishops' working document calls on the Church to \"join grassroots social movements, to prophetically announce an agenda of social justice ... organic agriculture and agroforestry.\"</p><p>It says that \"Mother Earth\" must be defended from an \"economic model of predatory and ecocidal development ... which kills and plunders, destroys and devastates, expels and discards.\"</p><p>The first-ever Latin American pope has made climate change and social justice key issues of his papacy. Francis insists that his concern for the environment and socio-economic imbalances are fully in line with the Catholic Church's teachings.</p><p>None of the decisions made at the synod are binding. Francis will ultimately decide what, if any, changes to make based on the recommendations that emerge from the synod.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>Editorial contactsEditing by: Stephen LowmanTel: +49 30 2852 31472;

No fire means no haze from South Sumatra province this year, and next year, and next year,\" said Noerdin. South Sumatra was where most of the fires that contributed to the 2015 haze burned.</p><p>The Indonesian official was speaking to the media on the sidelines of an international conference on haze, organised by think-tank \u00a0Singapore Institute of International Affairs and held at St Regis Singapore.</p><p>In 2015, the region was plagued with the worst haze on record, as warmer and drier weather caused by the El Nino weather phenomenon resulted in the forests in Indonesia burning harder and for a longer time. Most of the fires from that episode were concentrated in the South Sumatra province, where large swaths of peatlands are located.</p><p>Peatlands become flammable when they are drained for pulpwood or palm oil plantations. Farmers and large agroforestry companies have also been blamed for starting the fires, through slash-and-burn land clearance methods, for example.<br/> But since the intense haze episode, fire prevention efforts have been ongoing. For example, canals in the plantations have been blocked to re-wet the peatlands, and educational outreach have been conducted to reach out to small farmers about alternatives to slash-and-burn, Noerdin said.</p><p>During the event, Singapore's Environment and Water Resources Minister Masagos Zulkifli lauded Noerdin and the Indonesian government for taking \"positive action\" to tackle haze.</p><p>Masagos pointed out that there were just over 100 hot spots in Indonesia in 2016, a vast improvement from the thousands of hotspots recorded the year before.</p><p>\"Indonesia has taken positive actions to contain the number of hot spots over the past year,\" said Masagos.</p><p>For example, the Indonesian government responded quickly when land and forest fires occurred in Riau in January due to drier weather conditions. \"This allowed for the timely deployment of resources and tighter coordination between the central and provincial authorities in containing the fires,\" he said.</p><p>Masagos also pointed to longer-term measures put in place by Indonesia to address forest and land fires at source. In 2016, the Indonesian government announced a five-year moratorium on new licenses to establish palm oil concessions.</p><p>\"The moratorium will halt the draining and clearing of new carbon- rich peatland. This decision extends to concession land previously licensed to plantation companies as well,\" said Masagos.</p><p>He added that Jakarta's move was also praised by the United Nations Environment Programme's executive director Erik Solheim, who called it a \"positive and historic decision, both for Indonesia and for global efforts to tackle climate change\".</p><p>But beyond the efforts of governments, Masagos said everyone has a role to play in ensuring the region remains haze-free.</p><p>Civil society, for example, should continue fostering the environmental consciousness of people, while keeping businesses on their toes as it pushes for greater transparency.</p><p>Major buyers should also insist on purchasing from producers who subscribe to sustainable standards, Masagos said, adding that the Singapore Government will take the lead in this by buying printing paper from certified sources.</p><p>\"Let us have everyone on board this journey towards a more sustainable and responsible agroforestry sector as there is no other way,\" said Masagos.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Straits Times (Singapore)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>The Singapore city skyline was obscured by the haze on June 20, 2013.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-42967</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2017</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5S2R-VM71-F17J-S25R-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2017 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"04\" year=\"2017\"><dateText>April 7, 2017 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Singapore</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000CEC1</classCode><className>FIRE PREVENTION &amp;

For this, agroforestry can be a suitable solution that can fulfil the needs of agriculture and forest,\u201d said Prahlad Thapa, country representative of the International Union for Conservation of Nature.<br/> In 1990, the country\u2019s forest coverage was recorded at 45.5 percent, which shrank to 39.6 percent by 2000. Improved and timely conservation measures helped the country regain its forest coverage to the current state.<br/> Bishwa Nath Oli, secretary at the Ministry of Forests and Environment,said that the country needs to find a right balance between utilisation and conservation of forest resources.<br/> \u201cThere is no question about forests\u2019 contribution to the country\u2019s prosperity as a number of Sustainable Development Goals and targets are directly linked with forests. In the past, however, our education system has been largely focussed towards its conservation only. Now, the approach should also be towards utilisation of these resources while adapting scientific and sustainable forest management,\u201d Oli said.<br/> Unlike the global tourism scenario that shows only 30 percent of tourists are engaged in nature-based tourism, nearly 60 percent of tourists visiting Nepal visit protected forest areas of the country.<br/> Stakeholders pointed out the importance of balance between development and conservation to tap into the potential role forests can play in the country\u2019s overall growth.<br/> \u201cA section of the public is sceptical about using forest-based products believing that doing so will destroy nature, while others are concerned about these valuable products being underutilised. Without utilising these resources, our prosperity goal is merely a far-fetched dream,\u201d Basnet said.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Kathmandu Post (Nepal)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli plants a litchi sapling on the Singha Durbar premises in the Capital to mark World Environment Day in 2018.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-93743</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5VPS-8TF1-JDSH-21MT-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"440\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"03\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>March 23, 2019 Saturday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"55\"><className>INTERNATIONAL UNION FOR THE CONSERVATION OF NATURE &amp;

Francis insists that his concern for the environment and socio-economic imbalances are fully in line with the Catholic Church's teachings.</p><p>None of the decisions made at the synod are binding. Francis will ultimately decide what, if any, changes to make based on the recommendations that emerge from the synod.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><contact><bodyText><p><br/><br/>Editorial contactsEditing by: Stephen LowmanTel: +49 30 2852 31472;

Or whether Brexit could only worsen the state of affairs.In the hallowed halls of Westminster, the British government has been dreaming up a golden vision of sustainability for British agriculture post-Brexit.Despite positive hopes for this vision by the Soil Association, which certifies organic food in the United Kingdom and lobbies for sustainability, the group's policy officer Sam Packer is skeptical: \"The British government is seeing agriculture as an opportunity to tell a good story about Brexit.\"And this happy tale, like everything else to do with Brexit, is still up in the air.Read more: Will Brexit be bad for biodiversity in Britain?On the sustainability front, the National Farmers' Union of England and Wales (NFU) has teamed up with Greener UK (a coalition of environmental organizations, including The Soil Association) to make sure that Brexit works for farming and the environment.With agriculture a powerful force in the UK \u2014 farmers manage more than 70 percent of the land area in England and Wales, according to the NFU \u2014 such alliances could shift the equation, particularly when trade is on the table.Overthrowing the reign of CAPFar from minister's office in Westminster, on a windy hillside on the outskirts of Bristol, the enthusiasm for a brighter future has taken root with remain-voter Humphrey Lloyd.Lloyd is the grower at Edible Futures, a smallholding that sells greens and herbs to the local community. </p><p>He's also the treasurer at The Landworkers' Alliance, a union and campaign group representing the interests of small-scale and sustainable farmers.As he plants spring onions, Lloyd calls Brexit a \"unique political moment.\"The European Union's Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) has dominated agricultural payouts since before Lloyd was born in 1985. Those payments neglect smallholdings like his own. He wants to get in on the action.Packer, on the other hand, thinks that the UK's 25-year environment plan, launched earlier this year, is evidence that the status quo will win.He described the plan as including \"lots of rhetoric, lots of good words and very little binding action.\"Still, he sees as positive the fact that now change is inevitable, organizations like his are being invited to the table.Agroecology: The new buzzword At that table, the concepts of \"agroecology\" and \"agroforestry\" are being pushed into mainstream agriculture.Agroforestry involves using trees to prevent soil erosion, thus building up the health of the soil with organic matter that retains more water \u2014 and storing carbon from the atmosphere.Healthy soil is a mantra being picked up even in industrial farming. The UK government aims to make soils healthy by 2030.A bill including first-ever targets for soil health was introduced to parliament last March, and is expected to be published later in 2018.Sustainability laggard BritainFor Ped Asgarian, the manager of organic outfit The Community Farm in Somerset, Brexit certainly will not be the bright gate to a green future.While sitting at a busy pub in Chew Magna, in the south of England, he notes with irony that as Europe has sought to become more environmentally oriented for years, \"the one nation that has been really holding them back is us.\"He sees the EU as forcing sustainability onto the UK \"because our soil is vanishing fast, our biodiversity is vanishing fast, and our soil health is degrading so much.\"Read more: Soil: More than just dirtPacker agrees that Britain could just as easily have made changes from within the EU \u2014 such as localizing food systems and moving away from industrial farming, including from the import-export methods upon which it currently relies.France, for example, recently announced a commitment for 50 percent of food supplied to the public sector to be produced locally.\"The message that we can achieve more outside [the EU] can, in some ways, be unpicked through that story,\" Packer points out.The realities of eating local Eating locally grown produce is not an easy prospect, given the cool UK climate.Asgarian, who runs a box scheme selling fruit and vegetables to 450 local households a week, notes that not everything in the box comes from the farm's 22 acres (8 hectares). They grow about 30 percent of what they sell, and rely upon a network of other local growers.\"We also work with a couple of larger farms in the north and east of England, because getting enough produce year-round is quite difficult,\" he says.They even have to import some items to keep their customers satisfied.Read more: Would you eat local for a week? I tried, and discovered what eating green really meansNor can the UK rely solely on domestic sales. Currently, it exports 40 percent of its lamb, 80 percent of its dairy and 75 percent of its wheat and barley to the EU.This is why groups like the NFU have been pushing for tariff-free and frictionless trade to continue.Despite all the challenges, people like Lloyd continue dreaming.\"The history of political change is the history of hopeful people doing what they can,\" he says as he makes drills for his next line of onions. \"We need to hope, we need to work hard and we need to believe.\"Lloyd continues to be convinced that \"we can win quite a simple battle against corporate industrial agriculture in favor of something sustainable and fair.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988153634084495625176500082</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5T6W-RGV1-F03R-N01D-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"922\"/><timeReceived>5:20 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"07\" month=\"09\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>September 7, 2018 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Tax Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTNEM0E2OEE0RkQyNEY1MDhBQzdGMkQ4ODI4QTJDODE7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>Corporations Engaged in Farming</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6M0I4QkEzOTVFOEMwNDBCMThDRDgyMkM5MzAzQUQ0RDg7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6QjU1QUYzRTdGNkU2NDkwMkE4MjM2MzI1Q0MwNDM1Njg</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><classCode>ST000DKY8</classCode><className>BREXIT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST00092L9</classCode><className>SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

communities attended the recently concluded Kape Kabuhayan Kinabukasan Summit 2018, a conference on sustainable agricultural practices organized by Foundation for Sustainable Coffee Excellence (FSCE) and Henry and Sons in partnership with the local government of La Trinidad.</p><p>The Kape Kabuhayan Kinabukasan Summit, or KKK Summit 2018, is a biannual seminar designed by FSCE to unite, educate and inspire coffee growers to pursue a more sustainable future for the industry of local coffee.</p><p>FSCE director Emil Cuaresma shared that the foundation, as well as the platforms and programs under it, served as avenues for establishing shared prosperity among the local coffee growers of Benguet.</p><p>Held at the Lednicky Hall of the La Trinidad Municipal Building, the summit featured a segment on sustainable coffee farming by Prof. Valentino Macanes, associate professor, Arabica coffee scientist, and consultant and resource person of the Department of Agroforestry of Benguet State University.</p><p>He stressed the importance of a multisectoral approach where every stakeholder within the coffee value chain must do its part to maintain the quality production of Arabica coffee.</p><p>A highlight was a talk by FSCE director and Henry and Sons president Michael Harris Conlin on how to earn more from planting coffee.</p><p>Cuaresma also gave the audience a peek into the foundation\u2019s 2018 calendar filled with programs to help reach the goal of a more sustainable coffee farming landscape.</p><p>This month marks the second run of vaccination programs in partnership with luxury buffet restaurant Vikings Philippines under the Beans for the Little Ones program for coffee farming kids of a new barangay in La Trinidad.</p><p>Postharvesting facilities will then be awarded in July, while water gallons will be awarded in September, as part of the Cup to Seed and the Giving Well programs, respectively.</p><p>July\u2019s postharvest facilities were purchased through funds generated from A Cup of Thankful, a campaign started by another one of FSCE\u2019s partners, 7 Eleven.</p><p>All programs are in line with FSCE\u2019s goal of empowering Benguet coffee growers into making coffee sustainable long into the future and bringing Philippines back into the global coffee spotlight.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>Philippine Daily

Leaders from the Amazon region, Congo and Indonesia, among others, are unifying their voices in demanding greater respect and support for their communities, which they believe to be key actors in the fight to protect our planet.The Coordinator of the Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA) is one of the main indigenous organizations present at CoP13. Its members believe implementing an indigenous economy model is the only way to ensure a sustainable future. DW talked to COICA's delegate at CoP13 to find out more.DW: What do you expect from CoP13?</p><p>Henderson Rengifo: Being aware that we have taken care of our forests since ancestral times, it is very important for us to discuss its biological diversity. Governmental measures through the years have endangered our forests and biodiversity, and at the same time, are putting all of humankind at risk.We are here in Canc\u00fan to show that indigenous communities want to protect their natural resources and their biodiversity, which is essential for life on Earth. We want to impress upon governments that any decision-making on public policies must recognize and take into account indigenous peoples' proposals, in order to promote sustainable development.Why is the role of indigenous people in protecting biodiversity so important?Indigenous communities have always respected the law of nature, the life of all beings and the great biological diversity that exists in their territories.Every being and every part of the forest plays a very important role in regulating life in it, and only by caring for all of nature can we insure a safe future for the next generations. COICA has helped organized the third Global Canoe action to highlight the importance of indigenous people and local communities in protecting biodiversity. The action is promoted with the phrase, \"Indigenous peoples ... have solutions to combat climate change that work.\"What are these \"solutions that work\" to combat climate change?In Peru alone, 15 million hectares of forest are legally recognized as being indigenous territories, although many more are without recognition. In these territories, we work to create an alternative way of caring for forests, thus helping cool the global warming crisis. Protecting forests is the best solution to fighting climate change.How does this work?We not only protect forests, but also manage them properly. We support an indigenous economy based on responsible and sustainable management of resources over time, for instance through agroforestry and harvest of wood.National economic policies are normally only based on extractive activities such as oil, gas, mining or palm-oil projects that threaten our forests. Governments are not providing real alternatives for indigenous people to manage their forests by adding value to the forests' own resources.The indigenous economy is based on traditional indigenous knowledge and values, promoting solidarity over consumerism. It supports non-extractive activities such as agroforestry, bio-industries, aquaculture, community tourism and handicrafts.Could the indigenous economy be implemented at a global scale?No, because it is not an economy of scale - but it can help make big changes. We are on the right path, and indigenous people have proposals that will contribute to minimizing and mitigating climate problems. These proposals can also help states plan sustainable development.If everyone would adopt our way of life, we could fight against climate change - but for that, we have to manage forests sustainably.Henderson Rengifo is the president of AIDESEP, Peru's largest federation of indigenous Amazon communities. Rengifo is also the delegate of the Coordinator of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon River Basin (COICA) at the CBD CoP13.The interview was conducted by Irene Banos Ruiz. </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL1099881480936946970251761700104</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5MB1-SY41-F03R-N0HW-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"767\"/><timeReceived>11:22 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2016 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"12\" year=\"2016\"><dateText>December 5, 2016 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"84\"><className>CONVENTION ON BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST0009FXV</classCode><className>BIODIVERSITY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

The German government supports the protected areas financially.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The allegations are not new: in 2016, the non-governmental organisation Survival International submitted a formal complaint to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) against the World Wide Fund For Nature (WWF) over alleged human rights violations by park rangers ('eco-guards').</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A research team of the Centre for Rural Development's postgraduate programme at Humboldt University Berlin spent three months in Cameroon last year to explore governance challenges of Lob\u00e9k\u00e9 National Park. The conflict between eco-guards and local communities were also an issue on site.</p><p>Community members reproached eco-guards with allegations of abuse. Remarkably, most interlocutors stated that they had not experienced direct violence by eco-guards themselves but based their claims on the accounts of others. However, reported incidents of direct violence have created an atmosphere of fear and apprehension. The eco-guards, too, reported feeling unsafe during their patrols. According to a young ranger their job is essentially a matter of life and death: 'If I confiscate a weapon today, it is not the weapon that will kill me tomorrow.'</p><p>The following factors aggravate the conflict:</p><p> The complaint mechanism set up in 2014 by WWF and the local NGO CEFAID to report human rights abuses by eco-guards is ineffective: Local people do not know of the mechanism's existence.</p><p> Safari companies have taken over law enforcement in the park's buffer zone and cooperate with the Cameroonian military \u2013 without the involvement of trained eco-guards. According to accounts of local communities, the military regularly resorts to violence and prevents locals from accessing their agroforestry zones.</p><p> The Cameroonian state neglects its eco-guards: The difficult working conditions cause a lot of frustration for the rangers. It is plausible that the eco-guards' frustration negatively influences their behaviour.</p><p>The international attention on rights abuses in protected areas is welcome. But: the single focus on the conflict between eco-guards and local population appears misguided. It does not represent the biggest issues on the ground.</p><p>Protected areas are surrounded by so-called 'buffer zones'. In Lob\u00e9k\u00e9's buffer zone, concessions of private companies overlap with local communities' agricultural zones. The resulting legal uncertainty primarily benefits the more powerful safari, timber and mining companies, which severely restrict the access and usage rights of the local population. The restrictions that these concessions impose are hardly considered in the current media debate.</p><p>Furthermore, the conflict between eco-guards and local population is a symptom of a larger conflict: conservation is understood as antagonistic to socio-economic development. That is hardly surprising. The local population is extremely poor and depends on local resource use and hunting to survive. Both, however, are severely restricted. In addition, the state of Cameroon is largely absent in the park's buffer zone, with little public investment in basic infrastructure like schools, hospitals and water supply. Most interviewees hold the park management accountable for covering their basic needs. The park management, however, is unable to cope with these high expectations, exacerbating the conflict between park authorities and local communities.</p><p>In light of the challenges, many call for an immediate stop to donor funding. The already chronically underfunded protected areas of the Congo Basin would then no longer be able to exist. This would have fatal consequences not only for endangered species like gorillas and forest elephants, but also for the local population. If dissolved, it is likely that the area of Lob\u00e9k\u00e9 National Park would either be leased to private companies or taken over by large-scale poachers. The latter group especially has no interest in respecting local usage rights \u2013 and eludes accountability.</p><p>Reference</p><p>Lambini, C., et al: Konflikte, Partizipation und Co- Management in Schutzgebieten: Eine Fallstudie ber den Lob\u00e9k\u00e9- Nationalpark in Kamerun (Conflicts, participation and co-management in protected areas: a case study on the Lob\u00e9k\u00e9 National Park in Cameroon \u2013 only in German), SLE Studienreihe 2018.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-D+C3004201900023</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2019</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5W0W-0M81-F00C-60CC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2019-04-30</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"739\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2019 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2019\"><dateText>April 30, 2019 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Yun said he had<br/> occasionally seen some villagers transporting Krak, which is used to<br/> make poles or fence, but no luxury timber.</p><p>\u201cMost timbers was from their farmlands,\u201d he said.</p><p>Battambang provincial environment department director Kort Boran told<br/> The Post on Thursday that a part of the Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary<br/> is mere \u201cbrushwood\u201d and not a jungle area with big trees.</p><p>He said remaining forest in Battambang is concentrated in Samlot<br/> district, which connects it to Pailin province and Thailand\u2019s Chonburi<br/> province.</p><p>\u201cI believe some people have illegally crossed the border to log wood<br/> and bring the timber to sell to local companies. But I don\u2019t believe<br/> there is any logging in the Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary because the area<br/> has no big trees at all,\u201d he said.</p><p>Boran said his department has no authority to probe claims of Rath<br/> Sambath\u2019s timber trade, though he will order park rangers to continue<br/> patrolling the Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary and the Samlot area.</p><p>Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary director Heang Pronh said his rangers<br/> had found no cases of forestry crimes in the sanctuary in recent<br/> patrols.</p><p>\u201cIf the villagers fell trees on their farmlands to sell to timber<br/> depots or private firms, it might be true. And if that\u2019s the case, our<br/> rangers have no right to prohibit them. I think some villagers\u2019 reports<br/> are baseless,\u201d he said.</p><p>Provincial forestry administration director Pit Phireak said the<br/> company in question, Rath Sambath, is planting cashew nuts, rubber trees<br/> and other agroforestry crops on its 2,000ha-plus economic land<br/> concession.</p><p>\u201cI don\u2019t know if the company is buying timber from loggers outside<br/> the concession areas as claimed by the villagers. But if the timber is<br/> cut from their farmlands, it\u2019s not illegal, unless it\u2019s from protected<br/> areas,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries spokesman Srey<br/> Vuthy on Thursday said the company has the right to reap forestry<br/> benefits \u2013 if it is within its ELC boundary.</p><p>\u201cThe company has no right to collect forestry benefits outside its land,\u201d he said.</p><p>The Phnom Samkos Wildlife Sanctuary covers approximately 60,000ha, spanning Pursat and Battambang provinces.</p><p>It is rich in biodiversity and home to more than 200 species of<br/> birds, over 60 species of mammals, more than 50 kinds of reptiles, over<br/> 60 kinds of fish and thousands of insect species, said a study by the<br/> Ministry of Environment and Fauna and Flora International.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Source: </emphasis>The Phnom Penh Post (Cambodia)</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p>A company that has received an economic land concession (ELC) in Battambang province\u2019s Samlot district is trading timber from outside its ELC boundary, activists said.</p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-88928</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2018</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5V38-NR41-F17J-S473-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-08-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"564\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2018 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"31\" month=\"12\" year=\"2018\"><dateText>December 31, 2018 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>Cambodia</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Politics</className></classificationItem><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009F92</classCode><className>FORESTRY &amp;
