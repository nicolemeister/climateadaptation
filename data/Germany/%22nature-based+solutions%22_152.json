The island in the middle of the Mediterranean, between Italy and North Africa, has no lakes or rivers and doesn't get much rainfall. And with a hot, dry climate, a population of 563,000 - and more than six times that in yearly tourist visits - every drop counts.\"We have lived forever without enough water,\" said Thomas Bajada, a marine biologist and recently elected member of the European Parliament. But, he told DW, that scarcity has forced his country to innovate.Today, around two-thirds of its drinking water comes from the sea, desalinated water that's blended with a minimal supply of groundwater. Investment in other technical solutions - smart water meters, leakage management, wastewater reuse - also helps keep the taps from running dry. </p><p>For now, at least.One-fifth of Europe already under water stressBut as temperatures rise and weather patterns become increasingly unreliable due to climate change, Malta's water challenges are expected to spread.With many European cities and regions still relying on outdated water management practices, around one-fifth of the continent already faces water stress every year, the European Environment Agency (EEA) reported. It noted that Europe is anticipating water demand to double by 2050, leading to severe water shortages in the future.\"Europe is at the forefront of a growing water crisis - one that threatens industry, agriculture, ecosystems and citizens' access to water,\" said Loic Charpentier, advocacy head at industry body Water Europe, which promotes water technology.Extreme heat and prolonged periods of drought, once rare in Europe, are becoming a yearly problem in many regions. Multiple heat waves in 2024 shattered temperature records, with Central and Eastern Europe and the Mediterranean region suffering the most from heat stress and shrinking water reserves, according to data from the EU's Copernicus Climate Change Service.The first-ever European Climate Risk Assessment, released by the European Environment Agency in March 2024, stressed that these new weather extremes were already severely disrupting ecosystems, agriculture and economic activity, human health and water supplies. Drought and extreme heat could also \"exacerbate existing risks and crises leading to water and food insecurity, disruptions of critical infrastructure, and threats to financial markets and stability.\"Water scarcity leaded to 'rising conflicts'\"No one sees what is coming when we speak about water, both water pollution and water scarcity,\" said Athenais Georges of the European Water Movement advocacy group. \"It's a huge environmental and social justice issue, because if you have scarce water, you have rising conflicts. [We've seen] that already in other regions in the world.\"In 2012, the European Water Movement spearheaded the Right2Water campaign, signed by more than 1.6 million EU citizens, which called on the European Commission to make sure water remains a public service and \"ensure that all inhabitants enjoy the right to water.\"The Drinking Water Directive, the EU's main law on drinking water, was revised following the campaign and entered into force in 2021. It obliges EU member countries to \"improve access to safe drinking water\" for all citizens.And yet, EEA data shows that some 30% of EU citizens still suffer water scarcity every year.Can a new EU water strategy fix this?The European Commission is due to finally present its Water Resilience Strategy in early June, after taking it off the agenda ahead of the 2024 EU elections in the wake of farmer protests and right-wing criticism of the EU's ambitious climate plans. The strategy is expected to focus heavily on efficiency, water reuse and technological fixes - especially in sectors that rely on water, like industry and agriculture.\"We want to address the root causes of water challenges, including pollution, scarcity and the impact of climate change,\" said Jessika Roswall, the EU commissioner for the environment and water resilience, speaking at the European Parliament in early May. She also highlighted plans to \"foster the competitive edge of our EU water industry.\"Lawmakers called on the EU Commission to be \"ambitious\" in its update to the current water management and climate adaptation strategy, which Bajada called \"scattered, sectoral and unreactive\".\"That means moving from promises to real, binding action. We cannot afford to treat water as infinite. That is why this report calls for enforceable water efficiency and abstraction targets - sector by sector, basin by basin,\" said Bajada, the report's rapporteur. He acknowledged that while water management is a national issue, enshrined in the EU treaty, member states also need to understand that it is a responsibility shared across borders.Solutions: Modernize infrastructure, boost efficiencyEU lawmakers said the Commission must prioritize dedicated funding for water resilience - money to modernize water infrastructure, set up nature-based solutions and use artificial intelligence and other emerging technologies to boost efficiency, monitoring and security.\"We need money to directly invest in innovation, to directly invest in a smarter way of water management, in industry, in agriculture,\" Bajada, of the center-left Socialists and Democrats group, told DW. \"Let's invest through public-private partnerships, using the [European Investment Bank] to scale up investment, but also a direct line in the upcoming [EU] budget.\"\"Drought and climate adaptation are only part of the larger puzzle,\" Charpentier, of Water Europe, said in an email, emphasizing the need to develop new infrastructure and expand digitalization. \"Europe must stimulate investments across sectors - from citizens and businesses to local and regional authorities.\"Restoring water by 'giving space back to nature'Environmental campaigners, however, are disappointed in what they said were successful efforts by conservative and far-right lawmakers to dilute the role of nature-based solutions, saying it set a \"worrying precedent\" ahead of the release of the Commission's strategy. They have called out the move to weaken nature restoration and conservation goals, along with measures to address water pollution.\"We cannot tackle a continent increasingly depleted of clean water or repair broken water cycles without working with nature,\" said the Living Rivers Europe NGO coalition in a statement. \"Nature-based solutions, such as restoring wetlands and removing barriers obstructing rivers, are far more cost-effective, straightforward, and environmentally sustainable than grey infrastructure and techno-fixes.\"\"You cannot comply with environmental, social and ethical objectives when you are profit-driven,\" said Georges of the European Water Movement, which campaigns against the privatization of water services. She told DW that new, modern infrastructure like desalination plants and dams were energy intensive to build and operate, and require costly maintenance.By contrast, she said, an approach that helped to retain more water in the soil and replenish depleted groundwater reserves - for example, by using permeable surfaces in cities, or giving more space to rivers and streams - was more sustainable in the long run.\"If you take a look at both [types of] solutions, what's easier, what's the most cost efficient?\" said Georges. \"It's just giving space back to nature.\"Edited by: Sarah Steffen</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/is-europe-prepared-for-worsening-drought-and-water-scarcity/a-72651580?maca=en-vam_rssnewstex_dw-35593-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL10998801JWXEEF76KZ29VCS7XVXN8A3V</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FYR-JS13-RT0D-52X6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-04</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1281\"/><timeReceived>12:23 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

During the event, representatives from London, Liverpool, and Shanghai jointly launched the World-class Waterfront Development Initiative, aiming to drive the comprehensive transformation of urban waterfronts worldwide?from spatial regeneration to the integration of ecology, economy, and culture. The initiative aspires to establish global demonstration zones and pioneering models of waterfront development aligned with the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.    Julia King, Co-founder of Social Place and former Researcher at the Cities Research Centre at the London School of Economics, shared her perspective: \"I think China broadly has done a lot more interesting projects around nature-based solutions for rivers in general. And I think the approach that Shanghai is taking to its river, to its principal attributes is something that I think we could probably learn a lot from and then have an exchange as to kind of around public realm.\"    Michael Clifford, Economic Advisor at EY-Parthenon, added: \"I think there's already a good foundation of working collaboration between London and Shanghai. London has a real focus on investable propositions and opportunities and particularly in the development space, a whole set of kind of development opportunities around and alongside the river.\"    Our Water Season 2 will launch a six-day program in London featuring six flagship events focused on cultural dialogue, historical and environmental renewal, Sino-British numismatic heritage, multimedia art, culinary exchange, and global innovation collaboration. Later this year, the season will return to Shanghai, where activities like the Shanghai?London \"Poetry in Twin Cities Metro\" campaign will be officially unveiled.Hashtag: #ShanghaiEye The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.

This marks the first time the U.S. developed a strategy to scale up nature-based solutions.  John Podesta, Senior Advisor to the President for Clean Energy Innovation and Implementation, and chair of President Biden's National Climate Task Force, unveiled the roadmap at the opening of the U.S. Center at United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change's Conference of the Parties (COP27). Podesta urged other nations to join the U.S. by taking bold action to invest in nature.    The Roadmap submitted to the National Climate Task Force calls on expanding the use of nature-based solutions and outlines five strategic areas of focus for the federal government: Update Policies to Accelerate Nature-Based Solutions; Unlock Funding for Nature-Based Solutions; Lead with Federal Facilities and Assets; Train the Nature-Based Solutions Workforce; and Prioritize Research, Innovation, Knowledge, and Adaptive Learning.  President Biden has already commitment to reduce U.S. greenhouse gas emissions 50-52 percent below 2005 levels in 2030, to conserve at least 30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030, and to increase community resilience to extreme weather and other climate impacts.   \"By announcing this roadmap and actions at the UNFCCC COP27, we recognize the need for global action to confront these triple crises and look forward to announcing additional actions during the upcoming Convention on Biological Diversity COP15,\" the White House said.

Losses are likely to increase as climate change intensifies extreme weather events while rapid urban sprawl has increased asset values in high-risk areas. Protective measures such as dykes, dams and flood gates come at a price, but their financial benefits can exceed costs for rebuilding after a disaster by up to ten times, a Swiss Re Institute study shows.  Veronica Scotti, Chairperson Public Sector Solutions at Swiss Re said: \"Investments in climate adaptation, such as flood preparedness, not only promote economic stability and create jobs, but also help keep people safe. Yet there is chronic underfunding. It is therefore crucial to create the conditions for private capital to flow into climate adaptation projects and at the same time optimise the use of public funds. Quantifying the benefits of adaptation measures is a key step towards facilitating public-private investment and ultimately closing the huge financing gap.\"  To determine how effective investments in flood adaptation measures can be, it is important to quantify their financial benefits. Swiss Re Institute has carried out a study comparing economic benefits and cost ratios of selected flood adaptation measures. This value can serve as a guideline for investment decisions and help identify the best flood adaptation methods to ensure a community's economic stability, safety and resilience.  Benefit-to-cost ratio can vary significantly depending on the region. Swiss Re Institute research shows that grey infrastructure, such as dykes and levees, is highly effective in reducing coastal flood damage. Globally, their benefits can outweigh costs by two to seven times, and even up to ten times in flood-prone areas. Built to optimal standards, these structures can reduce flood damage by 60-90%, especially in densely populated regions. In less populated areas, nature-based solutions such as barrier island restoration or foreshore vegetation can be equally effective.  Similarly, policy interventions, such as land use restrictions, can enhance the value of flood prevention, particularly in emerging economies. Flood defences and, zoning restrictions are found to be almost twice as effective and feasible than accommodative measures, such as dry proofing for both coastal and river floods.  All flood interventions, especially when upgraded and maintained, can benefit both insurers and policyholders. The public and private sectors can work together in facilitating and accelerating risk adaptation: by focusing on preventing and reducing future flood losses, the public sector can shift the remaining risks to the re/insurance industry and support economic stability after disasters. By being involved in the early stages of planning protection measures, the re/insurance industry can help mitigate risks and provide financial protection.  Download report \"Resilience or rebuild?

New technology solutions from across the globe.The first half of September 2024 saw devastating floods in Nigeria, Myanmar, the Czech Republic, Budapest and other parts Central Europe after heavy rainfall.In August, floods hit Bangladesh and left more than 500,000 people without clean water, sanitation, dry clothes and other basics like medication.With experts tending to attribute these extreme weather events to climate change, governments and communities are looking towards mitigation and adaptation strategies.For instance, investment in grey infrastructure projects, using concrete and steel, and natural green initiatives could help to prevent the very worst impacts of more frequent and severe flood events.Mobile flood barriers in VeniceVenice, one of the world's most iconic European cities, faces a double-whammy existential crisis: a combination of climate-driven sea level rise and the city's slowly sinking into the muddy foundations upon which it was built.It's calculated to be sinking at about 2.5mm per year on average, and that for the past 150 years. Some studies suggest much of the city could be under water by the middle of the next century - a modern-day Atlantis.But the more immediate challenge is flooding.Planning for flood-prevention systems in Venice stretches back to the 1980s. In 2003, construction of the MOSE system began.MOSE features four mobile inlet barriers at points along the lagoon that separate the city from the sea.Each barrier consists of a series of gates that can be raised to separate the lagoon from the surrounding ocean during high flood tides.Flow-through, flood control and 'dry' dams in Japan, USTypically, dams are used to block a river as a means of water storage.But flow-through dams are designed to allow water to move during normal conditions. </p><p>Rather than storing water in dry periods, they come into action during severe weather: They close up and store the floodwaters on an upper floodplain, and protect land on the other side of the structure.Water is then released back into the lower part of the river system once the floods have subsided.Such dams have been constructed in Ohio, in the US, and in Japan, along the Masudagawa and Hata rivers. Another is being built along the Asuwa river. House stilts, breakaway walls and self-elevating homesStilts have long been used to support freestanding homes and protect them against flooding. But the idea is becoming popular in areas that are only now having to adjust to extreme weather and flooding.While stilted houses have been commonly used in small island nations, where sea levels are rapidly rising, as well as floodplains in Asia and Africa, other nations are increasingly looking towards such techniques as a means of improving housing.In the US, regulations stipulate that stilt supports need to be strong enough to withstand flooding and wind forces, while elevating buildings high enough to withstand a \"once in a century\" flood.In the United Kingdom, a mechanical jack system has been developed by a company called FloodJack. It detect rising waters and activates a foundational elevation system to protect homes from water damage.But for some nations, not even raised houses are enough anymore. In the wake of disastrous flooding events on the US Gulf Coast and in Australia, for instance, some governments have imposed restrictions on where homes can be rebuilt.While these aren't technological innovations, policy initiatives such as these are increasingly being looked upon as effective ways of reducing loss and damage.Barrier technology from Netherlands to AfricaBuilding temporary barricades against rising floodwaters - an idea developed by a Dutch company called SLAMDAM - has proved just as effective in African countries as it has in the Netherlands.The SLAMDAM is made of tubes that fill with water to create a temporary wall or barricade that pushes flood waters back.It has been utilized by communities in Burundi, Nigeria and Kenya. Communities have also used the stored water during dry periods for irrigation.'Nature based' flood mitigation - an opportunity for Asia?It's not just technological innovation that could help communities solve the problem of hazardous flooding. Some regions are turning towards environmental interventions. These are sometimes called \"nature based solutions\". For flood mitigation, they could include the management of the flow of water between rivers and floodplains, or the restoration of agricultural regions with native vegetation to encourage more effective stormwater storage.Other ideas include reestablishing sand dunes and mangrove forests to provide natural barricades to flooding.Such initiatives are considered \"green infrastructure\" and are being deployed across the globe.Edited by: Zulfikar AbbanySelect sources:MOSE System, Venice <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mosevenezia.eu/project/?lang=enPortable\">https://www.mosevenezia.eu/project/?lang=enPortable</url> dams in Africa / SLAMDAM <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/can-portable-dam-help-africa-counter-rising-watersNature-based\">https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/can-portable-dam-help-africa-counter-rising-watersNature-based</url> solutions for flood management in Asia and the Pacific, OECD (March 2024) <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1787/18151949\">https://doi.org/10.1787/18151949</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/how-new-technologies-can-mitigate-the-risks-of-flooding/a-70239314?maca=en-vam_rssnewstex_dw-35593-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL10998852743572350525202100018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D09-6RN1-F03R-N10S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><timeReceived>1:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Sustainable projects are now offering new hope.The Mekong River, which traverses over 4,000 kilometers (2,500 miles) of Asian countryside, is a crucial source of fishing, farming and transportation for around 65 million people.The Mekong originates in the Tibetan Plateau in China and flows to the South China Sea through Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Cambodia, and Vietnam.However, infrastructure projects designed to meet the energy demands of Southeast Asia's rapidly growing societies are on the rise in the Mekong. The intervention is being felt downstream and is putting increasing pressure on the river's ecosystems and livelihoods.Cambodia to begin work on controversial canalCambodia announced on Thursday that it will start work on the Funan Techo canal in August. The $1.7-billion ((EURO)1.6-billion) project will link the Cambodian capital, Phnom Penh, to the sea - sparking concerns in Vietnam over its impact on the rice-producing Mekong Delta, home to 17.4 million people.Environmentalists are also concerned that the 180-kilometer (110-mile) canal will potentially reduce water flow to the Mekong, among the world's most biodiverse rivers.The climate crisis is compounding the issue, with delayed rainy seasons and heatwaves further drying out fertile lands.Global food supply under pressureThe Mekong's annual flood-drought cycle supports crucial fish migrations and freshwater biodiversity. </p><p>Accounting for over 15% of the global inland fish catch, the river hosts the world's largest inland fishery.In certain regions, however, fish stocks have declined by more than 87% in the last two decades. It is a multifaceted problem, according to Courtney Weatherby, deputy director of the Southeast Asia program at the Stimson Center, a think tank dedicated to finding pragmatic solutions to transboundary issues.But many of these broader challenges can be linked with the massive dam-building spree that has been taking place across the Mekong in recent decades.Harnessing the power of flowing water to generate electricity is one of the oldest form of renewable energy. In Southeast Asia in particular, hydropower dams have become a reliable and clean source of energy - and income.You face this sort of dilemma where hydropower is considered to be clean and needed. But at the same time, it does have non-carbon environmental impacts, which can be profound, Weatherby told DW.Hydropower projects affect the river's natural rhythm, according to Stimson. They change water levels, block fish migration passages and affect agriculture that depends on the natural ability of the river system to produce sediments, nutrients and bring water through the system.Balancing the Mekong's resources with energy demandsWith less disruptive alternatives existing - such as solar and wind power - some experts say that hydropower infrastructure can also be part of the solution.The building of large-scale wind parks and installing floating solar panels on the Mekong dam reservoirs is already underway in Laos and Thailand.These projects can operate jointly with hydropower, providing the potential for future investments to slowly shift from dams to solar and wind power.According to Weatherby, the idea of these alternative approaches to energy design is see them not as one-off projects, but more a broader energy system contribution for a cleaner future.Nature-based solutionsGiven the diverse ecosystems present in the region, including wetlands, floodplains, and forests, the Mekong River Commission (MRC) sees great potential in implementing nature-based solutions.Instead of further taming the Mekong with concrete and channelized barriers, the river should reclaim its own course through the conservation of its natural resources.For instance, mangroves and marshes can act as sponges, absorbing water and reducing the impact of waves on the shorelines.Restoring and protecting these natural habitats can help mitigate floods, improve water quality, and enhance biodiversity, the Secretariat of the MRC told DW. Vietnam's new Resolution 120, dedicated to a climate-resilient transition, gives hope. It shows that there is increasing interest at the policy level in identifying nature-based solutions as feasible alternatives to more modern infrastructure.Listening to the localsWhile people living along the river are the most impacted by Mekong development projects, the MRC also counts them among the most knowledgeable and the most crucial in pushing forward alternative solutions and approaches in the region.A powerful example of how community-based organizations can speak for the Mekong and push policies to respond to local people is the Chiang Khong Conservation Group (CKCG) in northern Thailand.In 2020, after almost 20 years of activism, the group succeeded in stopping Chinese engineers from blasting river rapids along the Thai-Lao border to allow large Chinese ships to navigate further downstream.It was the first time the Thai government has halted a cross-border project due to its potential environmental harm.We need to adopt a traditional knowledge mindset. This will result in conserving energy, a system's perspective, and eco-centric policy rather than human-centric and extractive actions, CKCG's Noparat Lamun told DW.Together with the affiliated Mekong School, Lamun and his team draw from local knowledge and exchange with researchers. Their ever-growing community is training locals and young environmentalists on how best to protect their water resources and spark citizen engagement across the Mekong and beyond.The river is not healthy, but also not dead, Weatherby said.There is so much energy not only in the private sector space but also among youth in these countries really pushing for a shift, and that is exciting and promising.Edited by: Keith WalkerBefore you leave: Every Friday, the DW Asia newsletter delivers compelling articles and videos from around the continent right to your inbox.

From free public transport for youth in Porto, to green construction in Warsaw and closing Helsinki's coal plants, here's how they plan to do it.Cities are climate change's engine rooms - consuming 65% of the planet's energy and producing 70% of the greenhouse gas emissions responsible for heating up the planet. And they are often one of its biggest casualties: residents swelter in dense, concrete environments due to the \"heat island effect'.By 2050 urban populations are expected to double, meaning the climate footprint of cities could balloon unless the way we plan, power and move around them is reconfigured. Can European cities lead on climate action?As part of an EU initiative, 112 cities are hoping to rise to the challenge. </p><p>100 from across the EU and 12 from associated countries such as the UK and Turkey were selected to receive support in their efforts to rapidlyreduce fossil fuel use and ensure any unavoidable emissions can be absorbed by nature or removed via carbon capture technologies. In other words to reachnet zero by 2030.By comparison most countries around the world are falling short of the 45% reduction in emissions that scientists say are needed by the end of the decade if the world is to avoid the most catastrophic impacts of climate change.Mission cities receive technical help and support in attracting investment. They are also encouraged to develop detailed roadmaps, which the EU estimates will require an estimated 650 billion euros (over $700 billion) in investments, mostly from the private sector, to achieve.Thomas Osdoba, program director of NetZeroCities, an EU-funded project supporting the cities mission, says many of those selected share similar challenges, including old buildings that are difficult to retrofit, car-centric urban planning, limited renewable infrastructure as well as the constraints of national policies and slow investment cycles. Helsinki closes coal plants However, Osdoba highlights Helsinki as a leading example of turning climate ambitions into reality.While Finland has committed to climate neutrality by 2035, its capital is aiming to reach this in 2030 by an 80% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. So far, they almost halved emissions since 1990. As is the case for most cities, heating and transport are main sources of Helsinki's emissions. Over the next year, after closing the second of its two coal plants, the Finnish capital is set to slash its heating emissions and switch to keeping the city warm through a combination of electric boilers, bioenergy and heat pumps. The energy company in charge of district heating is owned by Helsinki and the decision to close plants illustrates how \"agile\" cities can be in climate action, explained Hanna Wesslin, climate director of the city of Helsinki. The capital is also aiming to tackle transport, the second biggest emission source, by promoting electric vehicle use and developing the charging network, as well extending its public tramway system. Free public transport for youth in Porto In Porto, Portugal, changing attitudes towards public transport is a big focus, explained Filipe Araujo, the city's vice-president responsible for the environment and climate transition office. Transport makes up 40% of the city's emissions. Araujo said the biggest investments over coming years will be in mobility, including expanding the metro system with two new lines and making 40% of public buses electric by 2027. He added that reducing the cost of a monthly transport pass to (EURO)30 and making it free for people under 23 has had a huge impact, doubling the number of 13-18-year-olds using public transport in recent years.Porto has attempted to reduce its energy consumption. Switching to LEDs in street lighting for example has more than halved energy use. And while overall, Portugal generated a record 60% of its electricity from renewables last year, Araujo said their goal is \"to produce much more energy in the city.\" He said most public buildings such as schools and libraries now have solar panels, and the city is encouraging the private sector to further invest in solar by offering property tax benefits. Porto is also investing in ensuring all social housing has solar on its rooftops so it can produce its own energy, Araujo added. \"This one is very important for us because it also tackles energy poverty.\" Millions of people across Europe are unable to afford enough energy to adequately power basic services in their homes such as heating, hot water and lighting. Greening homes and streets in Leuven, Belgium Leuven, Belgium, may be one of the smaller mission cities but is advancing quickly on a plan already 10 years in development, says Osdoba. Jessie Van Couwenberghe, leader of Leuven's Climate Neutral mission says the city has worked hard to engage all elements of society so there is a sense of ownership in its plans.As heating buildings is currently the biggest source of energy consumption in Leuven, the city is prioritizing retrofits to curb energy use and boost renewables. As part of this Leuven has created a \"Climate House\", which the public can visit for information on renovating their homes, including advice on where to find subsidies.And while massive emissions cuts are needed, it is also addressing what is happening street by street. For local communities this includes grants for projects related to nature-based solutions and asking the public to suggest areas for 'depaving' - the process of replacing concrete and asphalt surfaces with carbon absorbing plants and soil.Will cities be able to do it? But with only a few years left and a lot of money yet to be invested, how realistic are these goals? Osdoba is optimistic a good number will hit net zero by 2030 and those that don't will be much closer to it than they would have otherwise. Warsaw, one of five Polish cities on the EU mission, is a case in point. \"Frankly, it's impossible for us to be climate neutral by 2030,\" said Jacek Kisiel, deputy director of Warsaw's air protection and climate policy department, explaining the city is reliant on a state-owned heating network powered by fossil fuels, which continue to produce most of Poland's energy. \"But still, we have the ambition,\" said Kisiel.He has high hopes for a proposed green construction standard requiring all new city buildings to be powered by renewables and collect and reuse rainwater. Warsaw is also aiming to retrofit 40% of city owned buildings by 2035 so they consume less energy.

They exhibit a rich diversity of ecosystems, including high-elevation rangelands, wetlands and peatlands, which host an abundant wildlife. Some species are endemic, which means they can be found nowhere else on Earth.</p><p>The HKH's cryosphere - glaciers, permafrost and other frozen areas - helps to maintain ecosystems functional and support biodiversity. This, in turn, is crucial for the direct and indirect benefits people obtain from ecosystems, including nature-based trade, health aspects and tourism. Such benefits are called ecosystem services.</p><p>However, the cryosphere is changing significantly. The change induced by the climate crisis is directly putting at risk people in mountainous areas as well as farmers downstream who depend on these water resources for drinking and irrigation, as the International Centre for Integrated Mountain Development (ICIMOD), an intergovernmental organisation, points out in a report. The authors stress that these changes have severe impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity. This affects communities as well since their lives are intertwined with nature.</p><p>HKH member countries have already made important efforts to safeguard biodiversity. More than 40 % of the HKH region are protected. However, 39 % of the global biodiversity hotspots are still outside protected areas. This makes it harder to safeguard them not only from climate change but also from anti-environment policies, land-use change, pollution, introduction of invasive species and expanding markets.</p><p>Such dangers are a major threat to biodiversity. It is estimated, for example, that nearly a quarter of the species endemic to the Indian Himalaya could be wiped out by 2100. Even if global warming is limited to 1.5 degrees Celsius, as envisioned under the landmark 2015 Paris Agreement, the HKH region may experience species loss and a decline in ecosystem services.</p><p>The HKH region, as a contiguous ecosystem, faces cascading impacts that can have dire consequences for all HKH member countries. Regional collaboration among governments is therefore imperative, along with investments in research, data sharing and implementing an interdisciplinary approach to extreme-weather events that takes into account nature-based solutions to build resilience.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2002202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BCF-VSX1-JCH9-G3N3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-02-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"404\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"02\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>February 20, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Experts stress the need for preventive actions and sustainable forest management.Wildfires are buring again in Greece, a year after flames devoured homes and olive groves and engulfed an area bigger than New York City, leaving white ash and mourning in their wake. Greece's 2023 fire was the biggest fire ever recorded in Europe.While wildfires are a natural annual occurrence, rising temperatures and intensified drought periods are creating drier, fire-prone weather that makes them burn faster, longer and more ferociously.In Europe, as around the globe, they are becoming more frequent, intense and widespread. In 2023 alone, they scorched an area around twice the size of Luxembourg, causing more than (EURO)4 billion ($4.3 billion) in damages and releasing 20 megatons of climate-heating CO2 emissions into the air - equivalent to nearly a third of all annual emissions from international aviation in the European Union.But with rising temperatures expected to increase the risk of wildfires across Europe, is the continent prepared?Europe is expanding fire response\"Forest fires are getting more and more significant,\" said Balazs Ujvari, a spokesperson for the European Commission. </p><p>\"More and more we find situations where member states are not able to cope.\"The focus of the EU's fire response so far has been the expansion of firefighting capabilities through the EU Civil Protection Mechanism and RescEU program, which lend support to countries dealing with extreme wildfires.In 2023, its fleet of planes, helicopters and firefighters doubled in size, with the fire in Greece mobilizing the biggest EU aerial response operation to date.Ahead of this year's fire season Ujvari said they have 28 planes, four helicopters and 556 firefighters stationed across four fire-prone countries. A further (EURO)600 million has been allocated to further expanding the fleet by the end of the decade.Ujvari added that the EU can also provide images of affected areas from its Copernicus satellite system to help local authorities monitor and tackle blazes.Firefighting alone isn't enoughYet some scientists and policy experts argue the EU could do more to prevent fires starting in the first place.Around 90% of EU funding for tackling wildfires goes into response, and only 10% into prevention, according to one estimate from German EU lawmaker Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg.The occurrence of fires that are extremely difficult to bring under control - such as those during Portugal's 2017 wildfire season that burned a total of 500,000 hectares and claimed over 100 lives - highlight the limits of prioritizing fire response, said Alexander Held, senior expert at the European Forest Institute.\"Science and experience tell us that to prevent these disaster fires, it's no use investing in fire suppression because they can't be suppressed. The only thing you can do is avoid them happening or ensure that they don't burn with intensities beyond the threshold of control,\" said Held.To do this, the EU needs to push more land-based fire prevention and nature-based solutions, he said. \"The more climate change we observe, the more we should actually invest in making the landscape less burnable.\"Forest management needs to be ramped upThere are many methods available to establish more sustainable land management and increase the resilience of forests, explained Julia Bognar, head of the land use and climate program at the sustainability think tank Institute for European Environmental Policy. This includes thinning and spacing trees properly, and reducing floor vegetation through prescribed burning or introducing more grazing animals like cattle and goats that eat the dry shrubs, which act as fuel and help a fire to spread.Shifting away from monocultures, such as the eucalyptus plantations that ignited during Portugal's severe 2017 fires, would also make forests more resilient.\"With more diversity of trees and older growth trees, they have a better capacity for storing water and preventing drought,\" said Bognar.Approaches need to be tailored to the climates of individual countries, said Held, explaining in hotter places like southern Spain it would involve prescribed burning while the weather is mild and establishing a mosaic of different land use, including grazed land that keeps the biomass - which turns into fuel when it is dry and hot - at a low level.\"Here [in Central Europe] resilience means promoting broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, shady and wet forests,\" said Held, adding that technical measures like fire breaks or fuel buffer zones with reduced fuel out along routes in the forest would also help. He added encouraging more people back into rural areas to manage the land - to engage in practices such as organic farming or continuous cover forestry - is also key.More coordination and long-term solutions needed There is an increasing amount of fire prevention best practice being shared in Europe, said Bognar. This includes guidelines for sustainable forest management published by the European Commission in 2023. \"But there's not necessarily a concerted effort at the EU level to be pressing for these types of changes so it's really inconsistent across the EU,\" she said.Bognar said rethinking the EU approach to rising wildfire threats needs to include more long-term solutions, such as pushing through the proposed Forest Monitoring Framework - which would give a clearer picture of Europe's forests - and implementing the Nature Restoration Law which, despite being watered down and facing resistance from some member states, aims to support fire resilience by increasing forest biodiversity.While wildfire experts have long lamented how much more financial support there is for firefighting, there are some funds that can be used for prevention, said Held. But he explained there is too little understanding and coordination in how to access this support, and a lack of solid wildfire prevention strategy at the national level. One notable exception to this, he said, is Portugal. Since its devastating 2017 fires, the country has shifted its approach to emphasize forest management, including promoting the plantation of native fire-adapted species as well as fuel breaks - artificial areas with less vegetation that act as barriers to stop or slow down fires - and buffer zones around new and existing buildings in risk areas. France has also made changes, introducing legislation last year cracking down on landowners that fail to clear their forests of undergrowth. But Jesus San-Miguel, senior researcher at the European Commission Joint Research Centre, said a key barrier on the continent is that the European Commission can only give advice and support. Ultimately, it's member states that are responsible for forest management and fire prevention. \"Prevention is a slow process, it is less visible than firefighting,\" said San-Miguel. \"So, when you have many planes fighting, they seem to be really doing a lot but prevention should be prioritized. Because it is so much cheaper.\" This article was originally published on June 26, 2024.

Countries agreed to support the transfer of emission reductions, incentivise the private sector and pursue non-market approaches to climate adaptation and mitigation. However, little was achieved at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, and things came to a standstill at COP28.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is particularly frustrating for Africa, where hopes were high in the run-up to COP28. Two months before the conference, the countries of the continent had agreed on a common position in the Africa Climate Summit Declaration, which proposed a 'global tax system including a carbon tax on fossil fuels, maritime transport and aviation'. Africa accounts for four percent of emissions but remains among the regions most affected by the climate crisis.</p><p>The global markets for carbon credits and offsets have suffered some serious reputational damage in the recent past. Broadly speaking, emission credits are permits for emissions authorised by a governing body to participants (e.g. companies or countries) in a regulated trading system with a cap. Emission offsets are created, for example, when a company invests in environmentally friendly projects to avoid emissions. These offsets can be traded on voluntary markets. </p><p>Despite criticism, revenues from carbon taxes and trading schemes totalled $ 95 billion last year, according to the World Bank. The Bank's recently published report 'State and Trends of Carbon Pricing for 2023: International Carbon Markets' shows that financial flows in the carbon markets have increased.</p><p>Research conducted by private-sector entities Trove Research and International Emissions Trading Association indicates that $ 17 billion were invested in carbon markets between 2020 and 2022. As of 2023, the global market for carbon credits is estimated to be worth almost $ 403 billion, according to a study by InsightAce Analytic, another firm. Africa has its eye on this money flow. It can help to close the huge gaps in its climate finance.</p><p>'Studies show that with $ 20 per tonne of nature-based carbon credits, $ 82 billion could be generated annually. That's about one and a half times the money Africa receives in official development assistance,' said Claver Gatete, executive secretary of the UN Economic Commission for Africa, on the sidelines of COP28. According to Gatete, the UN agency is currently in talks with member states to ensure that Africa's partici\u00adpation in carbon markets is based on 'high integrity credits' which make sure the continent is able to unlock benefit-sharing policies, deployment of sustainable decarbonisation pathways and investments in nature-based solutions.</p><p>'Next major export'</p><p>In 2021, Gabon became the first African country to receive payments totalling $ 17 million from the Central African Forest Initiative to reduce emissions by protecting the rainforest in its Congo Basin.</p><p>This triggered a continental race for sovereign carbon-offset programmes. At COP27, Kenyan President William Ruto declared that his country's 'next major export' would be carbon credits. He said this as he joined other African heads of state to unveil the African Carbon Markets Initiative, which aims to unlock $ 6 billion in annual revenues by 2030 while creating 30 million green jobs in Africa and generating 300 million carbon credits.</p><p>A few weeks after COP27, Ruto launched an ambitious tree planting initiative that aims to plant 15 billion trees and restore about 5.1 million hectares of degraded and deforested land in Kenya by 2032, with the aim of obtaining carbon credits.</p><p>In 2023, the Kenyan leader hosted the first Africa Climate Summit in Nairobi and also positioned it as a platform for developing the continent into a hotspot for carbon credits. The summit ended with pledges for carbon credits worth $ 650 million under the African Carbon Markets Initiative.</p><p>The pledge was led by Middle Eastern conglomerates, notably the UAE Carbon Alliance and UAE's Blue Carbon Company, which signed multi-million-dollar land deals with several African governments to secure and manage forests, wetlands, peatlands, swamps and grasslands, as well as coastal mangrove forests. The governments' promise is to conserve these areas and generate carbon credits. In return, the conglomerates will sell the carbon credits to companies and governments that want to compensate for emissions and thus fulfil their climate pledges.</p><p>There are currently two types of carbon markets:</p><p>In compliance markets, governments set up and regulate an emissions trading system defined by a geographical area with an emissions cap. This is the case with the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. Under such a system, companies and countries that have exhausted their emission quotas can buy unused emission allowances from other companies to continue emitting beyond their quotas. They can also purchase 'offset credits' from other countries outside the geographical scope of the scheme.</p><p>In voluntary carbon markets, there is little or no regulation. Companies set their own emission targets and buy carbon credits from willing sellers to cover or offset their carbon emissions.</p><p>In Africa, it is mainly the voluntary market that is well established, as countries are slow to create a legal framework that enables a thriving compliance market. However, the voluntary market on the continent is controversial and has been criticised for being opaque, discriminatory, unfair and ineffective in terms of development and climate policy. The environment minister of Congo-Brazzaville, Arlette Soudan-\u00adNonault, described it as an 'unregulated Wild West'.</p><p>Kenya currently dominates the voluntary carbon market in Africa with projects such as a mangrove restoration initiative and the Northern Rangelands Trust's carbon projects, according to Kenya's special climate-change envoy Ali Mohamed. Other countries with similar projects include C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Gabon, the Gambia, Ghana, Madagascar, Mozambique, Senegal, Uganda, Zambia and Zimbabwe.</p><p>Seven weeks after the 2023 summit in Nairobi, the Kenyan government began forcibly evicting the Ogiek community from their homes in the Mau forest complex, blaming them for the deforestation of more than 2500 hectares. The government plans to fence the forest and plant 4.3 million trees. However, the evictions were temporarily halted by the Environment and Land Court two weeks after they began.</p><p>Serious flaws</p><p>It is not only in Kenya that Africa's call for carbon credits, which are touted as nature-based solutions, is being criticised by climate policy think tanks, the scientific community and civil society. They slam various projects on the continent for lack of transparency, lack of equitable revenue sharing, greenwashing and dispossession of indigenous and local communities.</p><p>In 2023, the human-rights group Survival International published a report exposing serious flaws in the Northern Rangelands Grassland Carbon Project, one of Kenya's many initiatives, including lack of prior informed consent and financial probity, opaque benefit-sharing, lack of scientific rigour and governance concerns.</p><p>The Oakland Institute, an independent policy think tank based in the US, has warned in its 2023 report that Africa faces 'devastating social and environmental impacts', including 'the prevalence of corruption and fraud in voluntary carbon markets'.</p><p>According to Anuradha Mittal, Executive Director of the Oakland Institute, the fixation of Kenya and other countries on voluntary carbon markets ignores their failures. Mittal argues that these markets have not led to a reduction in carbon emissions. 'Conflicts of interest, fraud and speculation plague these markets, while the expansion of carbon offset programmes and tree plantations leads to the expropriation of community lands to make profits for investors,' she said. 'The expansion of carbon markets does not benefit Africa, but perpetuates the status quo of resource exploitation, greenhouse-gas pollution and power imbalance.'</p><p>A coalition of civil societies led by Power Shift Africa and Climate Action Network International also published a damning report stating: 'Carbon markets benefit polluters, fossil-fuel companies and market brokers. They drive pollution beyond climate limits and are neo-colonial barriers to realising genuine African development pathways.'</p><p>If Africa's participation in the carbon markets is to truly benefit the continent, its people and its nature, the situation must develop differently. Fair cost sharing, transparency, respect for indigenous land rights and truly sustainable projects without greenwashing must take centre stage.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1004202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BS4-JXP1-JCH9-G01N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1488\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"04\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>April 10, 2024 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Nature offers a solution: Trees. A region in Germany's east has been training local forests to absorb more water.We have been altering river landscapes for hundreds of years for industry, energy, farming and building houses. River courses have been straightened, regulated, diked and deepened across the world.Parts of their floodplains, which would usually provide space for overflowing water, have been drained and filled - sometimes with the idea that this could prevent floods. But it turns out: the opposite is the case.We messed up riversIn Germany alone, two thirds of the floodplains along the 79 main rivers can no longer serve their original purpose of storing excess water, because of the dikes built to stop water from reaching them. </p><p>One third of the remaining floodplain areas are covered by fields and houses. And that's not just the case in Germany, but across Europe, where 70-90% of floodplains have been environmentally degraded. And we're paying the price now. As climate change brings more weather extremes, these altered landscapes are more prone to destructive flooding.An urban wetland region in Germany's east recognized the problem early on.\"We realized 30 years ago already that our industrial, technical advancement has made the forest in this region develop in a wrong direction, that our ecosystem isn't resilient anymore. And that we need to go back to the old ways and let nature work for us,\" said Mathias Scholz, a floodplain ecologist with the Helmholtz Centre for Environmental Research in Leipzig, who has been studying the role of rivers and coastal wetlands for decades.Why we need functioning floodplainsHealthy, functioning floodplains are very important for us, explains Scholz, as they retain water in the landscape for a longer period and act like a sponge. They are natural climate protectors and flood controllers - but only when they are supplied with water. \"This helps plants better withstand drought summers. And when the next flood comes and the river overflows its banks, it can flood nearby forests and meadows. This is one of the most effective insurances against flood damage, as part of the floodwater stays in the floodplain instead of rushing downstream and causing destruction there,\" Scholz said.If we no longer have floodplains and floodplain forests, the water flows out of the landscape very quickly, leading to increasingly larger flood waves that cause significant damage. And that's exactly what's been happening more and more in recent years.That's why Scholz - together with the city of Leipzig and Germany's environmental association NABU - decided to give the floodplain landscape around the cities of Leipzig, Markkleeberg, and Schkeuditz a more natural face again. \"Many trees developed here that are no longer flood-resistant, displacing the tree species typical of the floodplain forest,\" said Scholz.One example are oak and elm trees, which started to die off when they didn't get enough water anymore after the floodplain forest was cut off from the rivers. The problem is, these native trees can handle floods and droughts better than other non-typical species that started spreading, such as maple.And oak and elm trees suck moisture out of the soil, which decreases the amount of water contributing to flash flooding events.Training forests to help soak up water againSo, Scholz and his team had an idea. They started purposely flooding a small area of the forest every spring for decades. And measured the results. The data they collected over 30 years tells the story of an ecosystem going back to its natural state. \"We realized that we can maintain moist conditions in the forest for up to three months longer, even during drought periods, allowing the floodplain forest to adapt to these wetter, more dynamic conditions. At the same time, other species that do not belong here receded, providing space and light for tree species typical of the floodplain forest,\" Scholz said.They literally trained the forest to be able to soak up more water again. And that's important, because even if trees are flood-resistant, if they do not experience flooding for a long time, they may \"forget\" how to cope with it or adapt to it, says Scholz.\"Therefore, it is important to train these ecosystems to handle water again, so that they do not collapse after the first flood event.\"Revitalizing old water coursesSpurred on by the positive results, the city decided to do more. It brought together scientists, NGOs and local officials in 2019 to come up with a concept to rejuvenate the entire floodplains here over the next 30 years.And they just finished their first project. They restored a historic riverbed and moved the river field relatively far away from the forest edge. And they created several exit points where, when the flood comes, the water can rise and then flow over the very shallow bank directly into the forest. \"I am so very happy right now, because it was five years of hard work, of discussions, of talking to people every day, ensuring that they are not afraid when a bit of water comes,\" said Christiane Frohberg who's with the city of Leipzig's Department for Urban Greenery and Water Bodies. \"And it's just wonderful to see that we now have water in this small river, which nevertheless has a significant impact,\" she added. The goal for the next 10-15 years is revitalizing more than 16 kilometers (about 10 miles) of former river paths in this region. They want to reconnect dried-up river arms and flood at least 30% of the floodplain area via the new river to give the floodplains their natural face again.But that will take a lot of time, money and negotiations. What's the price tag?Projects like this come with a hefty price tag. The city of Leipzig already spent 6.5 million euros - largely funded by the German state - to buy back land and build new bridges and gateways for crossing the newly restored river. Especially getting the farmers in the region on board was tricky.\"You can't simply expropriate people without offering alternatives,\" said Scholz.\"But bringing more water into the landscape doesn't necessarily mean giving up agricultural use; it just means that agricultural practices need to be adapted. So, this means that transitioning from arable land to a wild pasture must ultimately be achieved, but this change must also be appropriately compensated,\" he added.It sounds like the city is spending a lot of money on their restauration project - but flooding is actually the most expensive natural hazard in Europe, with a study by the European Commissionestimating that river-based flood risk could increase ten-fold to (EURO)9.3 billion by the end of this century. Most large European cities are situated on floodplains. Hamburg, Paris, Florence, Zaragoza, London, Geneva, Ghent and Linz are the ones that are predicted to suffer most flood damages in the future, according to the study.That's why EU Environmental Ministers recently approved a contested Nature Restoration Law that seeks to regrow forests, re-wet moors and return rivers to their natural, free-flowing states. A move that Scholz welcomes. \"When we consider the monetary damage that extreme events ultimately inflict on our society and the long-term efforts required to address them, it becomes clear that investing in ecosystem restoration is a future-proof investment,\" he said.Transferring knowledgeAnd more and more European cities situated in floodplains are experimenting with nature-based approaches. The project in Leipzig has become a blueprint for others. Scholz has been cooperating with colleagues from Estonia, Spain and Portugal to share knowledge and best practices, such as how to retain water in an area as long as possible. \"My advice to all places across the world is: protect what you already have, don't get rid of more wetlands, recognize your potential and invest in nature-based solutions.

What is being done to help the continent navigate a fire-risk future?Last summer flames devoured homes and olive groves as they raged uncontrollably for days in Greece, engulfing an area bigger than New York City and leaving white ash and mourning in their wake. It was the biggest fire ever recorded in Europe. While wildfires are a natural annual occurrence, rising temperatures and intensified drought periods are creating drier, fire-prone weather that makes them burn faster, longer and more ferociously.In Europe, as around the globe, they are becoming more frequent, intense and widespread. </p><p>In 2023 alone, they scorched an area around twice the size of Luxembourg, causing more than (EURO)4 billion ($4.3 billion) in damages and releasing 20 megatons of climate-heating CO2 emissions into the air - equivalent to nearly a third of all annual emissions from international aviation in the EU. But with rising temperatures expected to increase the risk of wildfires across Europe, is the continent prepared? Europe is expanding fire response \"Forest fires are getting more and more significant,\" said Balazs Ujvari, spokesperson for the European Commission. \"More and more we find situations where member states are not able to cope.\" The focus of the EU's fire response so far has been the expansion of firefighting capabilities through their EU Civil Protection Mechanism and RescEU program, which lend support to countries dealing with extreme wildfires. Last year its fleet of planes, helicopters and firefighters doubled in size and the fire in Greece mobilized the biggest EU aerial response operation to date. Ahead of this year's fire season Ujvari says they have 28 planes, 4 helicopters and 556 firefighters stationed across four fire-prone countries and a further (EURO)600 million is allocated to further expanding the fleet by the end of the decade. He adds that the EU can also provide images of affected areas from its Copernicus satellite system to help local authorities monitor and tackle blazes. Firefighting alone is not enough Yet some scientists and policy experts argue the EU could do more to prevent fires starting in the first place. Around 90% of EU funding for tackling wildfires goes into response, and only 10% into prevention, according to one estimate from German MEP Anna Deparnay-Grunenberg. The occurrence of fires that are extremely difficult to bring under control - such as those during Portugal's 2017 wildfire season that burned a total of 500,000 hectares and claimed over 100 lives - highlight the limits of prioritizing fire response, says Alexander Held, senior expert at the European Forest Institute. \"Science and experience tell us that to prevent these disaster fires, it's no use investing in fire suppression because they can't be suppressed. The only thing you can do is avoid them happening or ensure that they don't burn with intensities beyond the threshold of control,\" said Held. To do this, the EU needs to push more land-based fire prevention and nature-based solutions, he said. \"The more climate change we observe, the more we should actually invest in making the landscape less burnable.\" Forest management needs to be ramped up There are many methods available to establish more sustainable land management and increase the resilience of forests, explains Julia Bognar, head of the land use and climate program at the sustainability think tank Institute for European Environmental Policy. This includes thinning and spacing trees properly, and reducing floor vegetation through prescribed burning or introducing more grazing animals like cattle and goats that eat the dry shrubs which act as fuel to a fire's spread. Shifting away from monocultures, such as the eucalyptus plantations that ignited during Portugal's severe 2017 fires, would also make forests more resilient. \"With more diversity of trees and older growth trees they have a better capacity for storing water and preventing drought,\" said Bognar. Approaches need to be tailored to the climates of individual countries, said Held, explaining in hotter places like southern Spain it would involve prescribed burning while the weather is mild and establishing a mosaic of different land-use, including grazed land that keeps the biomass - which turns into fuel when it is dry and hot - at a low level. \"Here [in central Europe] resilience means promoting broad-leaved forest, mixed forest, shady and wet forests,\" said Held, adding that technical measures like fire breaks or fuel buffer zones with reduced fuel out along routes in the forest would also help. He added encouraging more people back into rural areas to manage the land - to engage in practices such as organic farming or continuous cover forestry - is also key. More coordination and long-term solutions needed There is an increasing amount of fire prevention best practice being shared in Europe, says Bognar. This includes guidelines for sustainable forest management published by the commission last year. \"But there's not necessarily a concerted effort at the EU level to be pressing for these types of changes so it's really inconsistent across the EU.\" Bognar says rethinking the EU approach to rising wildfire threats needs to include more long-term solutions, such as pushing through the proposed Forest Monitoring Framework - which would give a clearer picture of Europe's forests - and the Nature Restoration Law which, despite being watered down and facing resistance from some member states, would support fire resilience by increasing forest biodiversity. While wildfire experts have long lamented how much more financial support there is for firefighting, there are some sources of money that can be used for prevention, says Held. But he explains there is too little understanding and coordination in how to access this support and a lack of solid wildfire prevention strategy at the national level. One notable exception to this, he says, is Portugal. Since its devastating 2017 fires, the country has shifted its approach to emphasize forest management, including promoting the plantation of native fire-adapted species as well as fuel breaks - man-made areas with less vegetation that act as barriers to stop or slow down fires - and buffer zones around new and existing buildings in risk areas. France has also made changes by last year introduced legislation cracking down on landowners that fail to clear their forests of undergrowth. But Jesus San Miguel, senior researcher at the European Commission Joint Research Centre, says a key barrier on the continent is that the European Commission can only give advice and support: ultimately it is member states that are responsible for forest management and fire prevention. \"Prevention is a slow process, it is less visible than firefighting,\" says San Miguel. \"So, when you have many planes fighting, they seem to be really doing a lot but prevention should be prioritized. Because it is so much cheaper.\" Edited by: Tamsin WalkerSources: <url normalizedValue=\"https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/wildfires-2023-among-worst-eu-century-2024-04-10_enEU\">https://joint-research-centre.ec.europa.eu/jrc-news-and-updates/wildfires-2023-among-worst-eu-century-2024-04-10_enEU</url> Joint Research Centre information on 2023 wildfires <url normalizedValue=\"https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2943European\">https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_2943European</url> Commission information on rescEU<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.oecd.org/climate-change/wildfires/policy-highlights-taming-wildfires-in-the-context-of-climate-change.pdf\">https://www.oecd.org/climate-change/wildfires/policy-highlights-taming-wildfires-in-the-context-of-climate-change.pdf</url> Taming Wildfires in the Context of Climate Change, OECD report</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/wildfires-is-the-eu-doing-enough-to-stop-the-continent-burning/a-69232846?maca=en-vam_rssnewstex_dw-35593-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL10998852015363245875709500212</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CBB-R3P1-F03R-N0DJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-06-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1271\"/><timeReceived>6:12 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

These are not only crippling economies and people's livelihoods but also costing lives across the continent.After the worst drought in decades, East Africa is now being pounded by heavy rains. At least 180 people have died in floods and landslides in Kenya since the rainy season began in mid-March, with hundreds of thousands forced to leave their homes.The flooding in Kenya is absolutely out of control, reporter Andrew Wasike told DW's Africalink program. The rains just won't stop. </p><p>Whole villages across Kenya have just disappeared. And the worst part? Roads are gone, bridges are completely washed out, people are cut off. It's heartbreaking, and the forecast says this rain isn't going to let up anytime soon.Tanzania and Somalia have also been hard hit by torrential rain and severe floods, displacing tens of thousands and inundating crop lands.In contrast to that, southern Africa is suffering from prolonged dry spell at the same time, which has scorched crops during what is supposed to be the growing season, threatening food security.These are only a few of the natural disasters currently clobbering the continent.Why is Africa so vulnerable to natural disasters?The reasons for Africa's propensity to suffering natural hazards are complex but include the reduced capacity of governments and institutions to protect communities from and respond to disasters.The vast majority of Africans are also dependent on rain-fed agriculture for their food, making them especially vulnerable to suffering the negative effects of flooding and drought.Recurring disasters, which can wipe out crops and cause massive displacement, often leave poor nations picking up the pieces of one event when they are being slammed by another.For instance, in 2023 Malawi was lashed by Cyclone Freddy, which dumped six months of rainfall in six days and triggered mudslides and floods across the nation, killing more than 1,000 people. But Freddy came hard on the heels of two prior cyclones in 2022.In total, Malawi, which is still one of the world's poorest countries, has experienced 16 major flooding events, five storm-related disasters and two severe droughts since 2010, according to the World Bank.This has left almost no time for the country to recover and has resulted in a severe erosion of food security at the national level, finds the World Bank.Why are natural disasters particularly hard on Africa?Climate change meanwhile is increasing the frequency and severity of natural hazards on the continent, find numerous experts, including the UN's World Meteorological Organization (WMO).The likelihood of severe droughts, for instance, has increased 100-fold on the Horn of Africa. In southern Africa, the impacts of the El Nino climate phenomenon, which brings drier and warmer weather and low and erratic rainfall as well as floods, are becoming more intense and prolonged due to global warming, writes climate change expert Tadadzwanashe Mabhaudhi in a 2024 article for The Conversation.At the same time, man-made changes to both rural and urban environments are also worsening the effects of natural disasters. Some of these disasters are caused by environmental degradation, loss of wetlands, loss of forests, and so any little amount of rain that comes causes floods, climate change expert Sosten Chiotha, told DW.Factors such as increased settlements, deforestation, livestock grazing and clearing for crops are dramatically altering the landscape in many rural areas, making it susceptible to the effects of erosion after severe weather events.In urban areas, on the other hand, the unchecked expansion of many of Africa's cities is seeing people building shelters along rivers and on wetlands, destroying natural buffers for floodwaters. Informal settlements also fill in green spaces, resulting in a lack of drainage to carry away floodwaters.Drainage systems clogged with plastic pollution, a reality in many African towns and cities, also add to the growing flood risk.What can Africa do to better prepare for natural disasters?As with most issues, there is no single solution to address everything; however, certain approaches have come up repeatedly in public debates on Africa's levels of preparedness.Improved evaluation of weather data is one way to be better prepared, says Chiotha, who is also the regional director for Southern and Eastern Africa at Regional Director at LEAD, a leadership non-profit.Let's enhance our monitoring and the collecting of long term data. Many of the disaster issues in Africa don't appear in the IPCC [Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change] reports because basically there is very little data, he said.Improving on early warning systems would also help people on a continent where more than half the population aren't covered by such a system.The damage caused by a disaster can be reduced by nearly one-third if an early warning is issued within 24 hours, according to the World Meteorological Organization. Last year, the organization launched an initiative to try to give more Africans access to an early warning system about impending disasters.Nature-based solutions, such as preserving forests and wetlands to reduce flooding, are also being hotly discussed.But for that to happen, you need to ensure that the services that people derive from these forests and from these wetlands [such as wood for energy or clearing for agriculture] can be found elsewhere somehow, said Chiotha.

They renewed this promise in 2009 when they committed to jointly mobilise $ 100 billion per year by 2020 to this end. At the 2015 climate summit in Paris, they agreed to extend that goal until 2025 and to set a new collective goal of at least $ 100 billion per year for the period after that.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a previous contribution, we assessed to what extent rich countries meet their obligations. We concluded that they largely fail to do so. In this essay, we check what changed after the most recent UN climate summit in December 2023 in Dubai (COP28).</p><p>At COP28, new pledges were made to different climate funds that help poorer countries to take action on climate. First, at the opening of COP28, a fund covering loss and damage was formally established. Following suit, several countries announced pledges to the fund. France and Italy made the largest commitment ($ 108.9 million each), followed by Germany and the United Arab Emirates ($ 100 million each). In total, pledges so far have reached about $ 661 million.</p><p>UNFCCC members had decided to establish the Loss and Damage Fund at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh in 2022. The aim was to compensate vulnerable countries for climate-induced harm which already occurred or no longer can be avoided, and which goes beyond what people can adapt to. </p><p>However, despite this decision, negotiations on how the fund would operate continued through 2023. Finally, stakeholders agreed that the fund will be administered by the World Bank, via a board of 26 directors representing both industrialised and developing countries. The fund should receive both public and private contributions.</p><p>Second, Dubai saw additional funding for the Green Climate Fund (GCF). The GCF was created in 2010 to provide developing countries with funding for both mitigation and adaptation. The fund accepts contributions from UNFCCC countries, public, non-public and alternative sources, including countries not party to the UNFCCC and private foundations. A total of $ 9.3 billion were confirmed for the initial resource mobilisation from 2015 to 2018, while $ 9.9 billion were confirmed for the first replenishment period from 2019 to 2023.</p><p>The second GCF replenishment period is running from 2024 to 2027. Previous to COP28, countries had already pledged to deliver $ 9.3 billion during that period. In Dubai, an additional $ 3.5 billion were announced. If all contributions are confirmed, the GCF will receive at least $ 12.8 billion in the period.</p><p>Third, several countries made pledges to the three UNFCCC funds dedicated to adaptation. All funds were established in 2001. Concerning the Adaptation Fund, the countries pledged a total of $ 192 million. Germany promised the largest sum ($ 65.7 million). The Adaptation Fund is dedicated to providing financial resources for climate adaptation in countries which are not mentioned as advanced countries in \u00adUNFCCC Annex I - and especially the most climate-vulnerable ones.</p><p>The Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF) and the Special Climate Change Fund (SCCF) focus on adaptation in the areas of agriculture, water and nature-based solutions as well as early warning and climate information systems. In Dubai, pledges to the LDCF totalled $ 141.7 million, while those to the SCCF amounted to $ 32.5 million. Both funds are operated via the Global Environmental Facility. While the LDCF focuses on the urgent and immediate adaptation needs of least-developed countries, the SCCF supports all developing countries with a special focus on climate adaptation in small island states.</p><p>Keeping things in perspective</p><p>According to an OECD report, in 2021 the total climate finance provided amounted to $ 89.6 billion (OECD 2023). Based on preliminary data, OECD finds it likely that the $ 100 billion goal was met in 2022. Without a doubt, the pledges made in Dubai are an important step towards fulfilling the goal in the medium term.</p><p>However, the good news should be taken with a grain of salt for at least three reasons. First, $ 100 billion per year is only a small fraction of what is needed to fund adaptation and loss and damage in developing countries.</p><p>Second, the burden for the $ 100 billion/year goal continues to be unevenly distributed. The World Resources Institute (WRI), an independent think tank based in Washington D.C., assessed how much each developed country should contribute to the goal based on their GNI and population. According to the WRI, only very few countries contribute their fair share, and the pledges made in Dubai did not change that.</p><p>Third, some of the most important reasons why developed countries fail to keep their promises have not been successfully addressed in Dubai. For example, not complying with climate-finance pledges remains unsanctionable.</p><p>Growing geopolitical challenges</p><p>Meanwhile, geopolitical conflicts keep diverting attention and resources away from climate financing. Western countries have increased their military budget since Russia's attack on Ukraine. This money cannot be spent on other objectives, including climate action. The Gaza war is a major source of instability too. Hostilities have escalated since Hamas attacked Israel on 7 October 2023, and there is a considerable risk of the war spreading across the Middle East. Animosities between the US and Iran are a sign of concern, as is the strategic competition between the US and China.</p><p>The outcome of the US presidential elections is likely to impact climate finance too. Under Donald Trump as president, the US withdrew from the Paris climate agreement in 2017. President Joe Biden returned his country to the agreement after entering office in 2021. Should Donald Trump win the election in November this year, American and international climate policy might suffer tremendously.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP0503202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6BGF-F7Y1-F00C-61M8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-03-05</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"986\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"05\" month=\"03\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>March 5, 2024 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp; Journals</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English US</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>N813211MM</classCode><className>FOUNDATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>STX000949</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DR4J</classCode><className>GREEN FINANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"79\"><classCode>STX000484</classCode><className>DEVELOPMENT BANKS</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"city\"><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>GX115</classCode><className>PARIS, FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"state\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009TXV</classCode><className>DUBAI, UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"country\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>GC354</classCode><className>UNITED ARAB EMIRATES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"73\"><classCode>GC318</classCode><className>GERMANY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"72\"><classCode>GC317</classCode><className>FRANCE</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup></metadata></articleDoc></content></entry>",

Fresh sand will be needed to rebuild the shoreline \u2014 but sourcing the highly sought after resource can cause other problems.A winter of heavy storms and flooding, especially in late December, washed away vast stretches of protective sand dunes and bathing beaches on Germany's North Sea islands.Coastal areas on islands like Sylt, Borkum and Norderney, which together attract millions of tourists, will need to be rebuilt before the summer holidays - an extensive and expensive procedure.In what's known as beach nourishment, load after load of sand will be moved in to reconstruct depleted coast. The state government in Lower Saxony, where Borkum and Norderney, are located, has already said it will provide up to \u20ac700,000 (about $760,000) to shore up the region's main moneymaker.Does rebuilding beaches harm the environment?In this case, sand to replenish North Sea beaches likely won't come from too far away. </p><p>In previous years, it's been sourced from further down the shore or from neighboring islands. As one official told a local news outlet in 2017, the sand isn't gone, it's just somewhere else.The island of Sylt, for example, has replenished beaches with sand from the ocean floor for the last 40 years.Dredging ships suck up a mixture of sand and water from the seafloor in an area about 8 kilometers (5 miles) from the shoreline. They dump that sand on the beach and in offshore reef zones, which helps reduce the power of incoming waves.While better than using sand shipped in from the other side of the world, this method has consequences for coastal and river ecosystems. Scooping up all that sand can destroy underwater life and disrupt nesting sites for birds and other animals.It can also make coastal erosion and landslides - which are already increasing due to climate change - more likely in the long run.As sand is removed from the ocean floor, coastal sand will eventually flow away from the shore to fill the gap left by what's been removed. This causes the beach to retreat even further. And beach nourishment is never permanent - soon enough, added sand will be washed away and more is needed.Sand can be supplied from other places though to avoid the environmental impact of offshore dredging. Cities like Manila in the Philippines and Miami in the US, for example, use sand from inland sand mines, dug up in quarries or dredged from rivers and lakes. But experts have warned it's vital to use sand that closely matches the composition of the native beach, to avoid potential contaminants and protect flora and fauna that have adapted to a specific sand type.Why is sand such an important resource ?After water, sand is the second-most used resource on Earth, according to the UN Environment Program. But it isn't only needed to rebuild beaches. Regular sand - a natural mix of crushed rock, minerals and other organic material found at the bottom of lakes, rivers and the ocean - is vital in the construction sector, and is used to make glass and concrete.It's also used to create new land in major metropolises like Singapore, and China's Hong Kong and Shanghai where space is at a premium.Silica, a type of specialized sand, is used to make silicon - a key ingredient in circuits and microchips.Germany imports significant shiploads of sand every year. In 2022, the country brought in around 1.55 million metric tons of both regular and specialized sand, according to data gathering platform, Statista. It ranks among the world's top 10 sand importers, along with the United States, Belgium, the Netherlands, Canada and China, the world leader.Are there alternatives to sand?Even though the planet is home to huge sandy deserts like the Sahara, which is about 9 milllion square kilometers in size, much of the sand there is useless for industrial purposes. That's because desert sand - smoothed into tiny spheres by the winds - is the wrong shape and size. Only the jagged sand particles found at the bottom of rivers, lakes and in the sea bind well enough to make strong concrete and other products.Due in part to rapid urbanization and digitization, global demand for sand is increasing. According to UN figures, sand mining has increased more than threefold over the past two decades to over 50 billion metric tons every year.The US is by far the largest exporter, shipping nearly 6.3 billion tons in 2022. That accounted for around 31.5% of global exports, more than double the export volume of other top exporters like the Netherlands (12.4%), Germany (8.2%) and Belgium (5.9%).Heightened demand has led to an increase in illegal dredging in places like India, Vietnam and China, where environmental and labor laws aren't always as strict.But even in approved mines in major export countries like the US, Malaysia, Europe and Canada, digging up all that sand can harm biodiversity and disrupt marine currents and water tables. It can also increase erosion, destroying coastal land and making it more vulnerable to extreme weather. Mining pollutes waterways, while shipping of sand releases carbon emissions too.But alternatives to sand mining exist. Glass can be recycled, ground into tiny particles and used in construction and to replenish beaches. And fly ash - the minute bits of ash, dust and soot created by burning fuel - can also be used as a primary binder in concrete, eliminating the need for sand entirely.When sand is essential, the UN has recommended that it be extracted and transported in a socially and environmentally sound manner, and that degraded ecosystems are restored with nature-based solutions.Edited by: Jennifer CollinsSources:World Economic Forum, Sand mining is close to being an environmental crisis.

But too much can have devastating impacts on wildlife and other biodiversity. So, what can be done to protect vulnerable ecosystems?As images of river markers swallowed by rivers and homes awash with water that had nowhere else to go, become a more common occurrence, it is hard to imagine there is anything potentially beneficial about flooding. </p><p>Indeed, of all climate-related weather extremes recorded in the European Union between 1980 and 2022, it accounted for the greatest economic loss. Yet, its consequences for the natural non-built environment are not always negative.James Dalton, Director of the Global Water Programme at the International Union for Conservation of Nature, says many ecosystems in fact rely on seasonal rising waters for the occurrence of normal ecological processes such as distributing soil nutrients.We use river systems for a steady supply of nutrient flow that enriches ecosystems further down the river system, but also flows into estuaries and deltas, which are the most biologically productive parts of the world, he said. We need floods because they flush down sediments and they flush down nutrients and they flush down certain species as well, which are critically important. Flood waters recede leaving behind sediment and nutrients, which provide a rich, natural fertilizer, improving soil quality and promoting plant growth. It is one of the reasons that many towns and cities have grown up around rivers. As well as providing much needed water and a means of transporting goods, the deposited nutrients serve as fertile ground for farming. Flooding is also useful in replenishing groundwater supplies. While the process happens naturally in some regions, in California, regulators are planning to divert and store excess floodwaters to help refill natural underground reservoirs to store water for periods of drought. When flooding becomes a problem for wildlife But beyond the natural order of things, in a world where global temperatures continue to rise, causing heavier and often unpredictable rain patterns in some regions of the world, the impacts are not so beneficial.We are seeing floods become more destructive and last for longer and be faster in terms of impact because of changes in rainfall, said Dalton. And that is having an impact on biodiversity.\"One of the most obvious impacts of flooding on wildlife is that some species cannot escape the rising waters fast enough. In 2012, for example, hundreds of animals, including the endangered one-horned rhino, were killed when the Kaziranga National Park in northeastern India was hit by severe floods. Even if animals manage to escape, flooding can destroy their habitats and breeding grounds. The more damaging floods scour riverbanks and floodplains, so can shift sediment and soil in a way that can affect migratory species because they can't get to where they need to be at a particular time for spawning and breeding. So you affect the natural reproduction cycles of species, said Dalton.Plants can also be impacted by flood waters containing agricultural pesticides, industrial chemicals or sewage. If animals eat contaminated plants, they are exposed to toxins and impurities, which also then make their way into the food chain.Eroding an essential food and environmental resource: soil While some soil benefits from flooding, faster-flowing waters leave a more destructive imprint, potentially wiping out the top five to 10 centimeters of the most nutrient-rich earth.Imagine when you have a flooding event, said Michael Berger, consultant for sustainable agriculture at WWF Germany, the soil can just be flooded away and there's nothing anymore. There's still soil but the most precious part is gone. It cannot be rebuilt by humans and it's the basis of producing food. As the most species-rich habitat in the world, soil is also essential for preserving biodiversity. According to a new report published by the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, linked to Germany's Green party, healthy earth can store more carbon dioxide than forests.Soil erosion destroys habitats and landscapes, but also prevents the earth from absorbing water when there are big flooding events, exacerbating the problem. We need healthy soils in order to adapt to the climate crisis. They can store up to 3,750 tons of water per hectare and release it again as required, said Imme Scholz, president of the Heinrich B\u00f6ll Foundation, in a press statement. What can we do to protect ecosystems from flooding? Dalton says there are ways to limit the impacts of flooding and that many reasons why floods are potentially worse than they should be is because we've built things in the way of floodwaters or we put things in the floodplains.\" A lack of affordable housing in cities all over the world has led to more and more developers being allowed to build on floodplains, which means homes and businesses are going up in potentially dangerous places. Reconstituting the way that rivers function and going back to how they should be meandering and connecting them together, connecting rivers to their floodplains, connecting groundwater to surface water is important because that's all effectively the network of letting water flow, said Dalton. Diversifying agriculture away from industrial methods to such practices as agroforestry, which intentionally integrates trees into farming, can also prevent against the impacts of flooding. When you have a flooding event, it can slow down the speed of the water. And the slower the water is running, the less erosion you have, said Berger. We as humans facing climate change with all its flooding events or drought events, we should definitely go for nature-based solutions instead of putting concrete everywhere and believing we can solve everything with our technology, he said.

His Excellency COP28 President Designate Dr Sultan Al-Jaber and GFANZ Co-Chair and UN Special Envoy for Climate Action and Finance Mark Carney addressed the session, which brought together policymakers, market standard setters, and leaders in business and finance committed to scaling climate finance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The session confirmed the urgency of ensuring that high-integrity voluntary carbon markets (VCMs) are scaled, given the critical role they can play in mobilizing significant flows of cross-border financing to emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs). Participants highlighted the role VCMs can play in financing some of our most urgent priorities, such as nature-based solutions, the accelerated phaseout of coal assets and investment in new climate technologies.</p><p>The discussion addressed that mobilizing VCMs, at the pace and scale needed to preserve nature and the carbon budget, would require addressing any remaining uncertainty on how compliance and voluntary, domestic and cross-border markets come together, and providing capacity building for those countries seeking to leverage the VCMs. Common foundations were needed, across a range of credit types, and coalescing around new supply and demand-side standards being developed by ICVCM and VCMI was critical. Important work to develop the supply of new types of credit - including those designed to accelerate much needed energy transition - was addressed.</p><p>The session also addressed the need to enable high integrity demand pathway to net zero for corporate buyers, whereby reductions of absolute emissions are prioritized, with appropriately defined scope to recognize compensation of residual emissions. The discussion emphasized that to secure the foundations of a high integrity, liquid market in 2023, efforts to align supply, demand, legal, and accounting standards must be facilitated and supported.</p><p>More specifically, participants addressed:</p><p>- Overarching purpose and rules. The session highlighted the specific role VCMs   play in generating cross-border finance for nature preservation, energy   transition, and new climate technologies, and the need to build understanding   of how compliance and voluntary, domestic, and cross-border markets complement   and interact with each other. It was noted that there need be no tradeoff   between domestic mitigation and raising cross-border finance, even where host   countries retain emissions reductions from voluntary projects to count towards   their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). - High-integrity supply and demand . Speakers applauded progress made on the   important work initiated at COP26, to build supply and demand-side standards   to secure credibility, integrity, and transparency. Speakers noted the   importance of supporting and coalescing around the final standards, led by   ICVCM and their Core Carbon Principles and Assessment Framework on the supply   side, and VCMI and their provisional Claims Code of Practice on the demand   side. - Building high integrity demand. Lessons learned by corporates and financial   institutions seeking to finance high-integrity carbon projects were discussed.   Participants noted the need for the private sector to prioritize absolute   emissions reductions but with appropriately defined scope to recognize   compensation of residual emissions. Participants noted that these efforts sit   within a broader architecture of carbon accounting standards and net-zero   frameworks and recognized these need to come together in a consistent and   efficient way. - Capacity building and de-risking . The challenges associated with building and   scaling high-integrity carbon projects in EMDEs were recognized, as well as   the need for innovative financing mechanisms to de-risk these projects in   these regions. Attendees also emphasized the need to ensure that local   communities and indigenous peoples remain at the core of project design and   are able to reap maximum co-benefits.</p><p>Following the event, COP28 President-Designate, His Excellency Dr Sultan Al Jaber, said : \"Voluntary carbon markets have the potential to be a powerful enabler in financing decarbonization efforts across industries, cities and entire economies, especially in emerging and developing economies. In order to achieve their potential, we must enhance the credibility of carbon markets and ensure that the highest-integrity standards are firmly in place. This can only be done through collaboration between governments, organizations, and civil society to create a supportive regulatory environment, establish a level playing field, and raise universal standards. By working together, acting in unity and focusing on integrity, the value of this vital tool in our collective decarbonization efforts will increase.\"</p><p>UN Special Envoy on Climate Action and Finance and GFANZ Co-Chair, Mark Carney, said : \"With only seven years left to halve emissions and keep 1.5 degrees alive, we cannot afford to leave major sources of climate finance untapped. Voluntary carbon markets could channel hundreds of billions of dollars to nature-based solutions and accelerated coal phaseout.

This involves managing and restoring ecosystems to reduce the effects of flooding, drought and extreme heat. A good example is restoring mangroves - shrubs or trees growing along ocean coasts or in slightly salty inland waterways - to help safeguard the surrounding land. Such measures also protect infrastructure such as bridges and buildings against extreme weather. They also create jobs, promote public health and purify water resources.</p><p>Nature-based solutions offer untapped potential for environmental improvement. According to the United Nations Global Compact - a UN-sponsored agreement among businesses to adopt sustainable policies - nature-based solutions can deliver one-third of the mitigation needed to meet global climate targets by 2030.</p><p>Digitalisation - using digital technologies to create value and improve efficiency - is another often-neglected contributor to a green recovery. At its best, digitalisation enables socially inclusive transformation by making information more accessible and easing communication. Digital technology has nearly infinite applications, from strengthening payment systems to enabling financial inclusion and fostering education and health care. Properly implemented, digitalisation can create business opportunities for small and mid-sized enterprises on electronic platforms. It can also help to integrate a region into the global economy.</p><p>Improving transport and energy infrastructure would also speed progress toward a green recovery. Transport and electricity generation are responsible for 65 % of LAC's CO2 emissions.</p><p>Air quality in the region's cities would benefit from greater availability of electric and non-motorised transport. If electric vehicles were available to all drivers in five major LAC cities - Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; San Jos\u00e9, Costa Rica; Mexico City, Mexico; and Cali, Colombia - more than 435,000 premature deaths could be avoided by 2050.</p><p>The connection between economic recovery and more sustainable energy and transport infrastructure is clear. Adopting green technologies in these sectors creates jobs in the short term and promotes a livable environment in the long term. The LAC region could create 15 million net new jobs by 2030 in renewable energy, construction, manufacturing and sustainable agriculture by backing a transition to net-zero emissions, according to a joint study in 2020 by the Inter-American Development Bank and the International Labor Organization.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2001202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64K6-PBC1-JCH9-G21T-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-01-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"425\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"01\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>January 20, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

While the UNEP report partly attributes this retreat to external circumstances such as the COVID pandemic and the economic impacts of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, the adaptation finance gap has nonetheless grown to between $194 billion (\u20ac183 billion) and $366 billion a year. Meanwhile, the adaptation finance needs of climate vulnerable developing countries are 10-18 times above what they are currently receiving, notes Adaptation Gap Report 2023: Underfinanced. Underprepared. </p><p>This adaptation gap is 50% greater than assumed before the study research began. This is a hugely worrying deceleration, wrote Inger Andersen, executive director of UNEP, in a report foreward. Adaptation funding can make a big difference if committed now, say the report authors.If an annual $16 billion were invested in making agriculture more resilient to heat and drought, through better water management or reforestation programs for example, it would prevent some 78 million people from starving or suffering chronic hunger, notes UNEP.Meanwhile, every $1 billion invested in adaptation against coastal flooding could lead to a $14 billion reduction in economic damages from extreme storms and rising sea levels.Yet in 2021, funding declined by around 15%, with around $21 billion generated globally by international adaptation finance mechanisms for developing countries.Part of the problem, says lead author Henry Neufeldt, is that governments and private financers primarily contribute to disaster relief in times of crises, and fail to adequately fund long-term adaptation measures. This reactive approach will force climate funds to pay much higher adaptation costs in the future, he says. The same goes for loss and damage, or climate compensation to be paid by the biggest greenhouse gas emitters, a key theme at this year's COP28 UN climate conference in Dubai.Andersen called for COP28 to be the moment that the world committed fully to insulating low-income countries and disadvantaged groups from damaging climate impacts.'Many impacts can still be prevented'UNEP identifies seven ways to increase funding, including through domestic expenditure, international finance and the private sector.But adaptation first needs to become a key component of broader international climate financing that is also focused on mitigation and loss and damage. This funding should take into account\" the adaptation needs and priorities of developing countries, and especially women and disadvantaged groups, says UNEP. But much more private investment is also required.Referring to the commitment made as part of the 2021 Glasgow Climate Pact to double international adaptation finance by 2025, UNEP says this goal can be significantly\" increased as parties negotiate a new collective climate finance target for 2030.But according to Henry Neufeldt, the pledge made in Glasgow to double finance to around $40 billion annually, even if reached, will only narrow the current gap by five to 10%.Harjeet Singh, an adaptation and loss and damage expert at global climate think tank, Climate Action Network (CAN), reiterates the benefits of spending more on adaptation.There are still many impacts that can be prevented if we retrofit our homes, if we are able to have climate resilient seeds, Singh told DW. If we are able to have strong early warning systems, that's what we mean when we say adaptation.He suggests that the finance shortfall can be partly made up if we start taxing and punishing these fossil fuel and polluting industries.It is shocking and ironic that fossil fuel companies, who are responsible for causing and exacerbating the climate crisis, continue to make profits to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars, Singh told DW.On the other hand, communities who are not responsible for causing the climate crisis are suffering and they're not getting any support.The goal is not only to fund badly need adaptation efforts in the Global South, but also the so-called just transition from oil and gas to clean energy in poorer countries.Henry Neufeldt, meanwhile, believes that a lack of ambition among Global North governments to support adaptation has to change if the massive finance gap is to be bridged.Adaptation planning and implementation also appear to be plateauing, according to the report. While five out of six countries now have at least one national adaptation planning instrument, including nature-based solutions such as reforestation to boost food security, planning is slowing and requires greater support, says UNEP.The number of adaptation actions supported through the four international climate funds surveyed in the report was also lower in 2022 than in the previous year.We need to reinvigorate the process, said Neufeldt. Climate impacts are rising and our investment isn't.Failure to fund adaptation could trigger loss and damage blowoutAs a result of slow adaptation, but also failed mitigation measures, climate-related losses and damages are also increasing, the report notes.It is very important to understand that if we don't adapt now, we will see more loss and damage, said Harjeet Singh.Adaptation is no longer an investment in the future but a current unfolding crisis, Henry Neufeldt explained.Look at the wildfires, look at the flooding in Pakistan last year, the flooding in China this year, he said. The less we adapt and mitigate, the more loss and damage we will have to deal with. That is much more expensive than dealing with adaptation now.Edited by: Anke Rasper</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL109988169891957646825876100118</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">109988</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69J2-29J1-F03R-N166-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-02</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1026\"/><timeReceived>10:06 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 2, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST0009ZGL</classCode><className>CLIMATOLOGY</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DKU4</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"89\"><classCode>STX000483</classCode><className>DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N624230GC</classCode><className>DISASTER RELIEF</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DLA3</classCode><className>ECONOMICS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEWJ</classCode><className>EXTREME TEMPERATURES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DF9I</classCode><className>HEAT WAVES</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>N928120KM</classCode><className>INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>STX001197</classCode><className>NATURAL DISASTERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000DEUI</classCode><className>SEVERE WEATHER</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST000D1EZ</classCode><className>STARVATION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"78\"><classCode>ST00097CV</classCode><className>UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000526</classCode><className>DROUGHT</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"77\"><classCode>STX000631</classCode><className>ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS &amp;

No single party has all the solutions, and COP28 must bridge the trust gap between North and South, East, and West, and build a platform for action through partnership. This is what the Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum represents.\"</p><p>Badr Jafar, Chair of the Forum and COP28 Special Representative for Business and Philanthropy, said \"There is no time to waste, and no need to wait. The Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum showcases over 20 major actions that CEOs and philanthropists can take now demonstrating accessible ways for private sector leaders to move beyond pledges and declarations and into action and implementation in ways that are suited to their capabilities and competencies.\"</p><p>Jennifer Jordan-Saifi, CEO of the Sustainable Markets Initiative, said \"Building on the vision of our founder, King Charles III, and the momentum of the Sustainable Markets Initiative's CEO summits at COP26 and COP27, the COP28 Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum's purpose statement amplifies calls from the private sector to be at the table for all future UNFCCC COPs.

To deliver, the COP28 Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum commits to:</p><p>- Supporting an annual Business and Philanthropy Climate Forum alongside the   world leaders' summit at every UNFCCC COP until at least 2030. This Forum will   serve as the foundation for the private sector to: enhance alignment of   industry, finance and country roadmaps; conduct an annual industry-by-industry   assessment on progress; and, raise the bar on ambitions, including alignment   with science-based targets. - Engaging in private sector diplomacy and the creation of innovative private   sector mechanisms to support cross-border transition efforts, including   blended finance and trade instruments. - Demonstrating the moral courage required as decision-makers to boldly lead the   transition to a sustainable, just, and prosperous future. - Adopting an authentic sustainable orientation, embedding sustainability in   business models, decisions, and actions. - Investing in sustainability-aligned research, development, commercialization,   technology, and innovation alongside youth and supporting the green,   sustainably focused jobs of the future. - Aligning country, industry, and financial roadmaps. Moving together, create   efficiencies and economies of scale that will enable collective progress and   accelerate sustainable transitions. - Showcasing game-changing entrepreneurs, technologies and solutions that are   emerging around the world. At the same time, remove barriers that are impeding   progress in deployment and scale-up of these technologies. - Bringing sustainable markets from niche to norm by reimagining mandates,   project pipelines, financial structuring, and models of return. In this way   entirely new sustainable industries, products, services, and supply chains can   be created, while in parallel helping to transition and transform existing   systems to a more sustainable trajectory. - Building conservation and nature-based solutions into the asset base, supply   chains, and disclosures. - Addressing market challenges and helping reorient economic subsidies,   financial incentives, and regulations in support of global climate,   biodiversity, and UN SDG targets across all industries. - Adopting common standards, metrics, working definitions and traceability   within, and wherever possible, across industries.</p><p>To learn more about the COP28 Business and Philanthropy Forum programming and events, please visit the <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bpcforum.org\">http://www.bpcforum.org</url>/</p><p>Photographs will be available via the UNFCCC Flickr page: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.flickr.com/photos/unfccc\">https://www.flickr.com/photos/unfccc</url></p><p>About Business &amp; Philanthropy Forum</p><p>Under the chairpersonship of the COP28 Special Representative for Business and Philanthropy, Badr Jafar, the first of its kind Business &amp; Philanthropy Climate Forum (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bpcforum.org/\">http://www.bpcforum.org/</url>) (BPCF), runs alongside the COP28 World Climate Action Summit with Heads of State and Government from 1-2 December 2023 in the Blue and Green Zones.</p><p>Read more: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bpcforum.org\">http://www.bpcforum.org</url>/</p><p>Notes to Editors COP28 UAE:</p><p>- COP28 UAE will take place at Expo City Dubai from November 30-December 12,   2023.

At the same time, food production contributes to climate change, causing about 30?% of global greenhouse-gas emissions. This multifaceted problem needs a multifaceted solution. The global community, and countries in their contexts, must modify food systems in ways that overcome current food insecurity and ensure food security long term. All issues must be addressed head on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">'Food security' is defined as access to sufficient quantities of food in appropriate quality. It obviously depends on an adequate and affordable supply of all ingredients required for a nutritious diet. Today, about 735 million people around the world do not get sufficient food and are undernourished as a result. About 3 billion, moreover, do not consume healthy diets.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Unless comprehensive action is taken, the climate crisis will make matters worse. A holistic agri-food system perspective must consider the entire range of actors involved in the production, aggregation, processing, distribution, consumption and disposal of food products. It must also take account of agriculture (including livestock), forestry, fisheries and food industries, as well as the broader economy, social disparities and the natural environment.</p><p>A sustainable food system must achieve good nutrition for all in a way that preserves the foundations of future generations' food security. This challenge has economic, social, cultural and environmental dimensions. It is crucial to preventing further loss of biodiversity and to stabilising the climate.</p><p>Mitigation, adaptation, transformation</p><p>Many national food systems, as well as the global food system, are losing resilience. 'Resilience' is the capability to cope with shocks without significant loss of livelihood, health and nutrition. Food-system resilience can be understood as a function of hazard, vulnerability and exposure to climate risks. It is therefore essential to limit the climate-related hazards that affect food supply, reduce food systems' vulnerability and lower people's exposure to risks. Three policy approaches serve this triple purpose:</p><p>Mitigation of climate change. Radically reducing emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases is indispensable for sustainable food security. Global heating is leading to extreme weather events, which affect production as well as farm workers' health. Moreover, recent science suggests that extreme heat curtails photosynthesis, with serious impacts on crops and forests. And this is not just a terrestrial agenda, because climate change affects oceans, which also have a bearing on food systems. Nature-based solutions such as agroforestry, coupled with sustainable land and soil management, serve mitigation. However, mitigation in itself is no longer enough to safeguard food security.</p><p>Adaptation to climate change. People can protect themselves by increasing their chances to cope. Important issues include affordable access to clean energy, water and healthcare. All of them have a bearing on good nutrition. Long-term adaptation, however, will be impossible unless mitigation puts an end to further heating.</p><p>Transformation. Socio-ecological systems, including the lifestyles of wealthy nations, must change to become sustainable. In particular, people in high-income countries must reduce their consumption and assume responsibility for their impact on the environment.</p><p>The climate crisis negatively affects food security in several ways. For example, access to safe drinking water is becoming more precarious. Climate events like floods often disrupt it. Diarrhoeal diseases, however, affect humans' intake of micronutrients. These illnesses have a strong correlation with rising temperatures. At the same time, heat waves make it more difficult to handle food safely.</p><p>The climate crisis also affects market dynamics and causes price volatility. Price hikes are happening more frequently. Several issues can exacerbate the impacts of weather-related shortfalls in food production. They include poor market transparency, financial speculation in commodity markets as well as export restrictions. The current grain-market disruptions resulting from Russia's attack on Ukraine show how important unrestricted exports are.</p><p>Crucial policy areas</p><p>Policymakers' action must not only boost food systems' resilience against known risks around the world, but also increase resilience to so-far unknown ones. Cross-cutting action is necessary. In particular, progress is needed in seven policy areas:</p><p>Sustainable land management (SLM): Relevant aspects include sustainable water management, ecosystem health, agricultural productivity, climate adaptation and mitigation as well as the protection of biodiversity. SLM incentives (such as payments for ecosystem services) are necessary. Crop cultivation and livestock production must be practiced in economically viable and environmentally sustainable ways. Social protection. Poverty often undermines families' food security. Nutrition interventions like school meal programmes are helpful. So are cash-transfer schemes or job creation. Countries with low and middle incomes deserve support for improving social protection. Access to healthcare and education are essential. Where related polices are not in place, they should be adopted. Food security hinges on the reduction of inequality. Diversification. Diversifying agriculture and supply chains strengthens food-system resilience. However, diversification has costs as it reduces opportunities for economies of scale and specialisation. Transaction costs tend to rise accordingly. Another challenge is that resilience is not just about withstanding current shocks, but also about maintaining the capacity for future development. If diversification hampers the latter, it is not fully conducive to resilience building.</p><p>International trade. Ensuring free and open global food trade will require a reinvigoration of the World Trade Organization (WTO). Panic-induced border closures lead to international price spikes. Transparent information on production, stocks and government interventions around the world is critical and must be made publicly available (e.g., through the Agricultural Market Information System - AMIS). Trade facilitation in terms of investments in infrastructure - including particularly the digitisation of customs systems - matters too.</p><p>Insurance is a promising tool to strengthen food-system resilience. It spreads both the risks and the costs of negative shocks among a large pool of people, enhancing resilience at the level of individuals. However, it does not prevent or reduce climate risks. Insurance may thus prove counterproductive if it motivates people to continue unsustainable activities. Though this kind of financial service is quite effective in terms of managing individual shocks, it is less useful when many people experience shock impacts at once, as is typically the case in extreme weather events. Migration. In response to the climate crisis, people are leaving their homes. In some cases, migration is basically a form of livelihood diversification. Remittances from migrant workers contribute to their families' resilience after all. However, entire areas are likely to become uninhabitable, for example, as the rising sea level inundates islands. Migration processes and policies need to be coordinated, and both sending and receiving countries must act in ways that make migration strengthen the resilience of individuals and systems. Climate refugees from countries that are becoming uninhabitable must get an internationally recognised climate refugee passport.</p><p>Science-based innovation. Science is facilitating key innovations in food systems, including efforts to reduce risks and to enhance productivity. Bioscience and digital technology are important. Scientific research also helps to find new ways to maintain and, if necessary, renew productive soils, water resources and even entire landscapes. Science is also needed to protect biodiversity, including agricultural genetic diversity. Research can help to reduce inequality too. More funding is needed for research on food systems.</p><p>We live in the Anthropocene, the age in which humanity is shaping the Earth's geosphere, biosphere and atmosphere. Action to enhance food security must be embedded in a broad strategic agenda of transformation. The global community must shift to a sustainable bioeconomy. It also needs a coherent governance structure to safeguard both food security and the global environment. The SDGs provide the concept, but not the policy framework for such joint action.</p><p>Long-term food security is intricately linked to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, the UN Convention on Biodiversity, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification and the Sustainable Development Goals. So far, appropriate funding has not been made available for any of the above-mentioned global agreements. That must change for the sake of humanity's common future.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2510202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69G9-97J1-F00C-60R8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-25</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1507\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 25, 2023 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Thirty years later, it is still in question whether and to what extent related promises are being fulfilled. Climate-related finance is a broad term. Generally speaking, it means funding (either public or private) for reducing greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions or adapting to the impacts of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Given that governments only have indirect discretion over private finance flows, we will focus on public finance in this essay. Public climate finance follows different avenues:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It can be delivered through mechanisms established alongside the climate regime, such as the Global Environmental Facility (GEF), which then allocate funding to climate-related activities.</p><p>Money can also be allocated via other multilateral institutions, especially multilateral development banks, which then fund efforts in developing countries.</p><p>Finally, it can be delivered bilaterally, according to agreements between high-\u00adincome and developing countries.</p><p>Tackling global environmental challenges</p><p>Climate finance is thus directly related to climate-change mitigation, climate adaptation or both. However, it may also target broader objectives, for example, nature-based solutions for infrastructure purposes in line with the objectives of the three so-called Rio conventions. Apart from the \u00adUNFCCC, the UN Convention on Biodiversity and the UN Convention to Combat Desertification were on the agenda of the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Global environmental objectives include:</p><p>limiting global warming to less than 2?oC compared to pre-industrial levels,</p><p>halting further loss of biodiversity,</p><p>protecting land and marine ecosystems and</p><p>stopping land degradation.</p><p>Biodiversity finance aims specifically to stop or reverse nature loss in order to protect human health and prosperity. Progress on this front was recently made at the 2022 UN Biodiversity Conference in Kunming-Montr\u00e9al. For example, the summit foresaw an annual $?20 billion of biodiversity funding from 2025, rising to $?30 billion from 2030.</p><p>The climate summit in Sharm el Sheikh in 2022, moreover, decided to establish another form of climate finance. Loss and damage funding is supposed to compensate vulnerable countries for harm already caused by climate change. However, UNFCCC members did not reach an agreement on how loss and damages will work in practice, so progress cannot be evaluated yet.</p><p>Three caveats should be made before looking at the progress high-income countries have made in providing public finance:</p><p>A political commitment is different from a legally binding goal.</p><p>Committed and disbursed funding are not synonyms.</p><p>Actual results depend on disbursed money being used for tangible purposes. Assessing whether that is the case is extremely important, but beyond the scope of this article.</p><p>$?100 billion a year</p><p>At the Copenhagen climate summit in 2009, developed countries pledged to jointly mobilise $?100 billion per year by 2020 to address climate change in developing countries. The decision was a rare example of a quantified climate-related finance target. The pledge was formalised one year later. The Paris climate summit decided that $?100 billion per year should be seen as a minimum, not a goal. The pledge included public, private, bilateral, multilateral and alternative funding.</p><p>So far, the pledge remains unfulfilled. Its reiteration along with the promise to live up to it soon have become an awkward ritual of the UN's annual climate summits. The gap seems to be closing, but progress has been painfully slow.</p><p>In 2022, the OECD published data on climate finance for the years 2013 to 2020. In that time span, disbursements increased by almost 60?%, from $?52 billion in 2013 to $?83?billion in 2020. Public finance (both bilateral and multilateral) played the largest role. Its share in total increased, from 73?% ($?38 billion) in 2013 to 82?% ($?68 billion) in 2020.</p><p>Assessments from WRI and ODI</p><p>The World Resources Institute (WRI), an independent think tank based in Washington D.C., also analysed finance for the period from 2013 to 2018. Adjusting data to eliminate double counting, it presented smaller numbers than the OECD. According to the WRI, bilateral and multilateral climate finance from high-income to developing countries amounted to only $?22 billion in 2013 and $?33 billion in 2018. Including outflows from multilateral development banks, the figures rose to $?34 billion in 2013 and $?55 billion in 2018.</p><p>According to either data set, high-income countries did not collectively meet their pledges. Attempts to break down responsibility country by country show that very few are contributing enough. The failure fits a pattern. In 1970, high-income countries pledged to spend an annual 0.7?% of their gross national income (GNI) on official development assistance (ODA). Collectively, they only disburse about 0.33?% of their joint GNI.</p><p>The WRI's analysis assessed how much each developed country should contribute towards the $?100 billion/year goal considering their GNI and population, which are proxies for responsibility and capacity for climate action. The authors calculated countries' fair share based on two different scenarios. The first was that at least $?70 billion of the total should be public finance. The second was that public finance would cover $?100 billion, given that this amount is a floor, not a target. The WRI concluded that, in 2018, only Austria, Denmark, France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden paid their fair share under the first scenario, and only France, Germany, Japan, Norway and Sweden did so under the second.</p><p>Britain's Overseas Development Institute (ODI) similarly concluded that in 2017/2018, only Norway, Sweden and Germany provided their fair share, with France and Japan coming close. The USA was at the bottom, providing a mere four percent of its fair share.</p><p>Why countries fail to comply</p><p>There are several reasons why developed countries fail to fulfil their pledges. First of all, there is no sanction for non-compliance. Most climate commitments are toothless, even if they are considered legally binding. Removing the threat of sanctions makes negotiations easier, but the price is a lack of incentives for countries to comply.</p><p>The collective nature of the pledge is another factor. At first glance, a collective pledge is easier to make since individual partners do not commit to a specific sum. In the longer run, of course, it is difficult to hold individual countries accountable for collective failure if there never was a clear agreement on burden sharing.</p><p>In addition, there is still a lot of debate about how to implement the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibility and Respective Capabilities (CBDR) within the UNFCCC. According to this principle, high-income countries should provide climate-related finance to developing countries. Yet countries disagree about how they should be held accountable for past emissions, and how current emissions should be addressed. These arguments generate more heat than light. As a matter of fact, no country is a monolithic entity, so governments pay attention to a variety of interests. Moreover, country groups are very heterogeneous too.</p><p>Growing polarisation</p><p>Finally, the international system is changing, and those changes have impacts on climate negotiations. Strategic competition of the USA and China is increasingly polarising the multilateral scenario, with countries taking sides on political, economic and technological issues. The Covid-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine have further deepened the divide.</p><p>It also matters that the US has a long history of slowing down climate action. In 2001, President George Bush Jr. withdrew from the Kyoto Protocol, arguing that it created an unfair trade advantage for China. In 2017, President Donald Trump withdrew from the Paris Agreement. Although President Joe Biden has reinstated climate change as a key issue, the current fragmentation in American politics makes it less likely that the US will assume its fair share of responsibility. Tensions between the two countries affect prospects for international cooperation in general. Like the rest of the world, both the USA and China have a rational interest in tackling climate change. Yet it remains to be seen if they will be able to collaborate in this area as competition on other issues increases.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1710202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69DK-HGR1-F00C-60KV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-10-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1412\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"17\" month=\"10\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>October 17, 2023 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

They are Dr. Drew Harvell, Dr. Jessica Gephart, Dr. Christine Kreuder Johnson, Dr. LaShanda Korley, Dr. Prineha Narang, Frances Seymour, and Dr. Kyle Whyte.   Drew Harvell is Professor Emerita of Cornell University, Affiliate Faculty University of Washington, and Fellow of the Ecological Society of America. Dr. Harvell's research on sustainability of the oceans has taken her from the coral reefs of the Caribbean and Pacific to the cold waters of the Pacific Northwest. Her current research focuses on health of top predators and seagrass meadows in the transboundary waters of the Salish Sea.  Her recent book, Ocean Outbreak, details infectious epidemics in the ocean and solutions that benefit people and biodiversity.    Jessica Gephart is an Assistant Professor in Environmental Science at American University. Her research focuses on how environmental shocks disrupt seafood trade.  Christine Kreuder Johnson is a Professor of Epidemiology and Ecosystem Health and Director of the EpiCenter for Disease Dynamics at the University of California. Her work is committed to transdisciplinary research to characterize the impacts of environmental change on animal and human health and guide public policy to mitigate pandemic threats.    LaShanda Korley is a Distinguished Professor in Materials Science and Engineering and Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering at the University of Delaware. Korley is a global leader in using biologically inspired and sustainable principles for the molecular design, manufacture, and valorization of functional polymeric systems.  Prineha Narang is a Professor and Howard Reiss Chair in Physical Sciences at UCLA where she leads an interdisciplinary group in quantum science and technology.    Frances Seymour is an expert on tropical forests and climate change. She is a Distinguished Senior Fellow at the World Resources Institute, Chairs the Board of the Architecture for REDD+ Transactions, and is lead author of the book, Why Forests? Why Now? The Science, Economics, and Politics of Tropical Forests and Climate Change.   Kyle Whyte is a professor in the environmental justice specialization at the University of Michigan. His research focuses on Indigenous peoples' rights and knowledge in climate change and conservation planning, education, and policy.    The scientists are approved by the Secretary of State. They travel as private citizens to engage internationally with civil society as well as government interlocutors. Science Envoys help inform the Department of State, other U.S. government agencies, and the scientific community about opportunities for science and technology cooperation.    The 2023 cohort was selected because of their expertise in key issues facing the world today and will focus on these priority areas during their service which include Ocean Conservation and Marine Protected Areas; Illegal, Unreported, and Unregulated Fishing; One Health and Zoonotic Diseases; Plastic Pollution; Quantum Information Science and Technology; Nature-Based Solutions to Climate Change; and, the Nexus of Environmental Science and Indigenous Knowledge.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has repeatedly made urgent statements about what this means: more extreme weather events, scarce water, an uncertain food situation and probable social upheavals, to name but a few. But it also means fewer species and less biodiversity, and that we will conceivably reach ecosystem tipping points. More than 50 % of all natural ecosystems have already been destroyed; one in every eight species is at risk of extinction. Then we will lack important pollinators such as birds or insects, for example. The planet's limits have been reached. Only resolutely setting a new course can help.</p><p>The best way to do this is by jointly addressing climate and biodiversity. They reinforce each other, both positively and negatively. When forests are cleared for farming, not only are species and ecosystem services lost, but vast amounts of climate-damaging greenhouse gases are also released. According to joint analyses by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, plants and oceans absorb about half of the CO2 emitted by humans - and they do so naturally. This ability is reduced by global warming and changes in the oceans. It is therefore important to quickly cut emissions from fossil fuels while simultaneously preserving forests, oceans and natural habitats. Their outputs are important for drinking water, food and oxygen. But they also store carbon and slow down further warming.</p><p>Placing areas under protection is not enough to achieve these ends. Instead, our economies and our investments must become climate-neutral and ecologically friendly. The financial sector must contribute to the transformation and has recently learned a lot: EU regulation, banking supervision and the capital market are increasingly taking environmental and climate-related issues into account. KfW firmly adheres to international guidelines and systematically incorporates climate risks and the protection of biodiversity into its banking business.</p><p>However, still too little focus is placed on the connection between climate action and biodiversity conservation, both in policy and in practice. Thirty years after Rio, it is time to build a bridge - this is precisely what KfW Development Bank is striving towards with efforts that include promoting 'nature-based solutions', for example, through reforestation or the restoration of landscapes. This approach helps biodiversity while protecting the climate at the same time.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP0210202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66HS-H1P1-F00C-63X8-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-10-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"02\" month=\"10\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>October 2, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The full updated announcement is set out below. The above change has been reflected in the Energy Transition Strategy 2024 (ETS24) which is available on the Shell website and has been marked with a footnote in the ETS24 itself. An updated version of the ETS24 has also been filed with the NSM. ---   * Shell will continue its drive to halve emissions from its operations (Scope     1 and 2) by 2030, compared with 2016 on a net basis. By the end of 2023,     Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net     carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with     2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.   * To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a     new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products     by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [A].   * Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of     2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in     the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. \"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer. \"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world- leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets:   * By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve     emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above     and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization     Charter agreed at COP28.   * We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were     one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane     emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity -     significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to     the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further     supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring.   * In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the     energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the     third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors   * For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and     performance please read the full report, online here:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>)   * Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at     Shell's 2024 AGM.   * Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales     volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and     reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.   * We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our     oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).     That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer     emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517     million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes     CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by     2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes,     impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.   * Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by     both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions).     While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we     cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments     and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in     demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions,     more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition     of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of     renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy,     one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our     determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to     our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up     low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of     Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the     largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.   * Find out more about Shell's 2023 Capital Markets Day online:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>) Enquiries UK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550 Shell plc - Energy Transition Strategy Chair's message This energy transition update marks an important moment for Shell. It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].  A. Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\\xEDzen  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low- carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one- third compared with the world's best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company     of Nigeria Limited (SPDC  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]  A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the     40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes     associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading     purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Our journey towards net zero 2023   * Invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions, of our total capital spending     of $24.4 billion in 2023. This included the acquisition of Nature Energy,     one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas in Europe.   * Our Timi platform in Malaysia, mainly powered by solar and wind energy,     started production.

H. Our target is to eliminate routine gas flaring from upstream operations by     2025, subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC.  I. We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use     of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category     11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category     11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and     569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles.

Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this 10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low- carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. In non-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10% of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio- feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector.  A. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap     reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO(2) emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio- alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel                             Passenger road transport    Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25   million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil   production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles,  including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging           points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO(2) includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO(2) emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.  A. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low- carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:   * Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon     intensity.   * Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil     production stable.   * Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to     offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s. -------------------------------------------------   Estimated share of energy sales 2016-2030 [A] +------------------+------+------+--------------+ |                  | 2016 | 2023 | 2030         | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Oil products [B] | 57%  | 48%  | 39%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | LNG              | 14%  | 22%  | 26%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Pipeline gas     | 25%  | 21%  | 21%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Electricity      | 3%   | 7%   | 11%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Biofuels         | 1%   | 2%   | 3%           | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ [A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non- operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.  A. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities     (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where     hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.  A.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to:   * Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional     energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and     hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.   * Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil     products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in     areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.   * Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of     the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own     production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutions     for our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future   * Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and     lubricant offerings   * Building for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels   * Preparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storage   * Supported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low- carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low- carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today.   Scaling our network of public EV charging points   Thousands              2020   2021    2022    2023     2025   2030   Other      0.5    0.002   0.022   0.021    ~70    ~200   Asia       0.5    0.068   0.27    1.002   China      0      1.964   17.55   32.576   Europe     0      5.021   8.937   16.579   Americas   0      0.044   0.07    3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen- based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Ra\\xEDzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.   Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly               2025   2030   2035   2040   2045                            2050   Gas          2.1    2.2    2.4    2.6    2.9                             3.4   Hydrogen       0    0.1    0.3    0.5    0.7                               1   Batteries    0.2    0.4    0.5    0.8    1.1                             1.7   Other        0.4    0.3    0.3    0.4    0.4                             0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation. Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023. Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low- carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO(2) from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co(2) capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen- based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non- operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm(3)) Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in our Upstream business In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO(2)e in 2022.  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\\xEDzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Ra\\xEDzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia FerrariShell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half- times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to- hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO(2) since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Scotford, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year [A]. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The CO(2) will be shipped from two of \\xD8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO(2) equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The captured CO(2) will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO(2) emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. [A] Corrected on March 20, 2024 due to an editorial error. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first- ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO(2) captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:   * Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.     For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software     system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they     emit.   * Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our     CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's     largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.   * Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable     hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO(2) emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start- ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)  Sector                               Policy Positions           Advocacy Theme

activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low- carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross- border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments     and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of     Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership. Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)  A. On a net basis.  B. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.  C. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into     low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning     plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.

The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be     recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact     of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  B. Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell- operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve     near zero methane emissions by 2030  B. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as     the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total     volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.  C. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected)     defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of     oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.  D. Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control     including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy     Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset     remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as     aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower- carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\\xB0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\\xB0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5\\xB0C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\\xB0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.  A. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of     limiting warming to 1.5\\xB0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning     warming to 1.5\\xB0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much     the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5\\xB0C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under- represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:   * Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net     basis (2016 baseline);   * Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and   * Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero     methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:   * LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;   * Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in     support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission     by 2030, on a net basis; and   * Supporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-     out.      A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category         11) were 517 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO(2)e         in 2021. For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a \"significant best efforts basis\". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B]                     2020     2021     2022     2023 -----------------------------------------------------   MSCI               A        AA       AA       AA -----------------------------------------------------   Sustainalytics   36.8 H   35.1 H   34.7 H   33.7 H -----------------------------------------------------   ISS                C        C+       C+       C+ ----------------------------------------------------- ISS The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.  A. Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024  B. MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in     managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A     lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial     impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are rated on a 12-point scale from     A+ (best) to D-(worst). Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short- term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\\xB0C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three?high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023.   Disclosure framework             2022   2023 -----------------------------------------------   Yes, meets all criteria             5      2 -----------------------------------------------   Partial, meets some criteria        3      7 -----------------------------------------------   No, does not meet any criteria      1      1 ----------------------------------------------- We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report. Cautionary note The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our' are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term \"joint venture\", \"joint operations\", \"joint arrangements\", and \"associates\" may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Forward-looking statements This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec- filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as cash capital expenditure and divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2) compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2 )equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e( CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

By the end of 2023,     Shell had achieved more than 60% of this target. Shell also reduced the net     carbon intensity of the energy products it sells by 6.3% compared with     2016, the third consecutive year it hit its target.   * To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, Shell has set a     new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of its oil products     by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). [A]   * Shell confirms it will invest $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of     2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making Shell a significant investor in     the energy transition. London, 14 March 2024 - Shell plc (Shell) has published its first energy transition update since the launch of its Powering Progress strategy in 2021. At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement to limit global warming to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. Shell's strategy supports a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. \"Energy has made an incredible contribution to human development, allowing many people around the world to live more prosperous lives. Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in recent years in many countries and technologies, which reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy,\" said Wael Sawan, Shell's Chief Executive Officer. \"Shell has a very important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can have the greatest impact through the energy transition and create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition,\" said Sawan. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. Liquefied natural gas (LNG) is a critical fuel in the energy transition, and we are growing our world- leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. We are cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable, and growing sales of low-carbon energy solutions while gradually reducing sales of oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel. As one of the world's largest energy traders, we can connect the supply of low-carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil and gas. We have made good progress against our climate targets:   * By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve     emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. This goes above     and beyond the targets set by signatories to the Oil and Gas Decarbonization     Charter agreed at COP28.   * We continue to be an industry leader in reducing methane emissions. We were     one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane     emissions by 2030. In 2023, we achieved 0.05% methane emissions intensity -     significantly below our target of 0.2%. And in 2023 we also contributed to     the World Bank's Global Flaring and Methane Reduction Fund - further     supporting industry-wide action to drive down methane emissions and flaring.   * In 2023, we achieved our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the     energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016 - the     third consecutive year we hit our target. As Shell transforms into a net-zero emissions energy business, we aim to take the lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. To help drive the decarbonisation of the transport sector, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).[A] Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our integrated power business. We plan to build our power business, including renewable power, in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA, and have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe. In line with this shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we will focus on select markets and segments. This includes selling more power to commercial customers, and less to retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect lower total growth of power sales to 2030, which has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of 20%. We will continue to transparently report our progress against our targets and ambitions every year. Driving towards a net-zero future We are investing $10-15 billion between 2023 and the end of 2025 in low-carbon energy solutions, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. And in 2023, we invested $5.6 billion on low-carbon solutions, more than 23% of our total capital spending. These investments include electric vehicle charging, biofuels, renewable power, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage. Our investments in new technologies are helping to reduce emissions for Shell and our customers. We aim to help scale new technologies to make them an affordable choice for our customers and are focusing our advocacy on key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition: policies that support national net-zero ambitions including carbon pricing, supplying the secure energy the world needs, driving changes in demand and growing low-carbon solutions. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO2e in 2021. ENDS Notes to Editors   * For full details of updates to our climate targets, ambitions and     performance please read the full report, online here:     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> (<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url>)   * Shareholders will have an advisory vote on the Energy Transition Strategy at     Shell's 2024 AGM.   * Shell's net carbon intensity is the average intensity, weighted by sales     volume, of the energy products sold by Shell. It is tracked, measured and     reported using our Net Carbon Footprint (NCF) methodology.   * We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our     oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).     That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. Customer     emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517     million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes     CO2e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO2e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by     2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with     additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes,     impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards.   * Reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by     both Shell (Scope 1 and 2 emissions) and our customers (Scope 3 emissions).     While we can encourage the uptake of low-carbon products and solutions, we     cannot control the final choices customers make. Support from governments     and policymakers is essential to create the right conditions for changes in     demand. In 2023, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon energy solutions,     more than 23% of our total capital spending. This includes the acquisition     of Nature Energy, which makes Shell one of the largest producers of     renewable natural gas in Europe. And our ongoing investment in Sprng Energy,     one of India's leading renewable power platforms, demonstrates our     determination to invest in growing renewable capacity in areas that play to     our strengths and add most value. We are also pioneering efforts to scale up     low-carbon solutions, such as by starting construction in late 2022 of     Holland Hydrogen 1 in Rotterdam, which is anticipated to become one of the     largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe.   * Find out more about Shell's 2023 Capital Markets Day online :     <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.shell.com/ets2024pdf\">www.shell.com/ets2024pdf</url> Enquiries UK / International Media Relations: +44 20 7934 5550 Shell plc - Energy Transition Strategy Chair's message This energy transition update marks an important moment for Shell. It comes three years after we launched our Powering Progress strategy, and builds on our Capital Markets Day in June 2023 when we set out our plans to create more value with less emissions. Our target to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains at the heart of our strategy and is transforming our operations and energy products. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. As we work towards net zero, we are reducing emissions from our operations and energy products while becoming an increasingly successful organisation. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses: Integrated Gas, Upstream and Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions. In this publication, we set out pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors - transport and industry - based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the products they need through the transition. Helping reduce emissions for our customers We want to lead in the decarbonisation of transport using the strength of our brand, deep customer relationships and global reach. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and remain one of the world's largest blenders and distributors of biofuels [A]. As the energy transition progresses, we expect to sell more low-carbon products and solutions, and less oil products including petrol and diesel. To measure our progress, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B].  A. Includes volumes from our joint venture Ra\\xEDzen  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The world needs a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to maintain secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low-carbon solutions. We are growing our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business so that we can continue to provide a critical fuel in the energy transition. Our investments in carbon capture and storage, hydrogen and renewable energy will help us produce LNG with lower carbon intensity in the future. Through our world-class trading business, we can connect the supply of low- carbon energy to demand, as we have done for many years with oil, gas and LNG. As we work towards net zero, we are making clear choices about where we can add most value for our investors and customers. We expect renewable power will be critical for helping our commercial customers decarbonise, and plan to build our integrated power business in places including Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe we have a competitive position there. Technologies of the future We are increasing our investments in research and development, and investing in the fuels of the future. We aim to scale up new technologies to create affordable options for our customers into the 2030s. We are building Holland Hydrogen 1, one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe, close to our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands. We are also investing in carbon capture and storage technology to reduce emissions from our own operations such as refineries and LNG plants, and, in the longer term, to help our industrial customers reduce their emissions too. I saw first-hand the potential of some of the exciting new technologies we are developing when I visited Oman in January 2024. We are part of a group exploring a project to produce green ammonia and liquefied synthetic gas from renewable hydrogen. These technologies are still in the early stages, but they could help to decarbonise industry and commercial road transport in the future. More value with less emissions At our Capital Markets Day, we said we would deliver more value with less emissions. We have made good progress in our first year under our new Chief Executive Officer Wael Sawan. In 2023, we returned 42% of our cash flow from operations to our shareholders, the upper end of our 30-40% range through the cycle. We also reduced carbon emissions from our operations by 31% compared with 2016 levels, putting us well on the way towards our target of a 50% reduction by 2030 on a net basis. We achieved our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. Transparency and shareholder support In 2021, 89% of our shareholders voted in support of our Energy Transition Strategy. Since then, we have published two progress reports, which our shareholders have also supported. Along with other Board members, I met with many of Shell's largest institutional shareholders following those votes. I appreciate their time and feedback and look forward to our next engagement in April 2024. The publication of our Energy Transition Strategy brings increased transparency, and better dialogue with our institutional investors. We heard that following Capital Markets Day, for example, some wanted us to be clearer about how we will deliver both more value and less emissions, and we are showing exactly that in this update. This year, we are again asking our shareholders to vote at our Annual General Meeting on our Energy Transition Strategy. As before, this vote is purely advisory, and not binding for our shareholders. The legal responsibility for approving or objecting to Shell's strategy lies with the Board and Executive Committee. We believe our strategy will transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, creating value for our shareholders, customers and wider society. We will offer shareholders an advisory vote at the 2024 Annual General Meeting based on the energy transition plans described in this publication and our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. The Board recommends that shareholders vote in favour of the Resolution asking them to support those plans. Sir Andrew Mackenzie Chair Chief Executive Officer's introduction This is our first update to the Energy Transition Strategy that we published in 2021. It is an opportunity to take stock of our progress, to reflect on what we have learned, and to look forward as we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050. Over the past three years we have seen the critical importance of secure and affordable energy for economies and people's lives. As the world's population grows by an estimated 2 billion people by 2050, and the benefits of energy are extended to the hundreds of millions who do not have it today, demand for energy will only grow. At the same time, the world must achieve an orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy to achieve net-zero emissions. Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of global energy demand, with an even greater reliance in many developing countries. We support a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure and affordable energy supplies as the world moves to net zero. I am encouraged by the rapid progress in the energy transition in many countries and technologies in recent years, including the continued growth in demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG), a critical fuel in the energy transition, and for low-carbon energy solutions such as solar and wind power, and electric vehicles. This progress reinforces my deep conviction in the direction of our strategy. Shell has an important role to play in providing the energy the world needs today, and in helping to build the low-carbon energy system of the future. There are exciting opportunities to use the strength of our innovation capabilities in the areas where we can have the greatest impact. Our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions - sets the direction for everything we do. Progress towards our targets Since we launched our Powering Progress strategy, we have made good progress against our climate targets, and learned where we have competitive strengths. By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016. We achieved this by adapting our portfolio, including by repurposing refineries, and making changes to our operations such as powering some oil and gas platforms with renewable energy. We continue to be one of the leaders in reducing emissions of methane, a potent greenhouse gas that can be released during oil, gas and LNG production. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030. In 2023, we continued to keep our methane emissions intensity well below 0.2%. We made good progress towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations, compared with 2016 [A]. We also met our short-term target to reduce the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, with a 6.3% reduction against our target of 6-8% compared with 2016. More value, less emissions At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In this energy transition update, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses. In Integrated Gas, we are growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity. In Upstream, we are reducing emissions from oil and gas production. In Downstream and Renewables and Energy Solutions, we are growing sales of low-carbon products and solutions such as biofuels, electric vehicle charging and renewable power, while investing in hydrogen and other fuels of the future. Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers through the energy transition. Our ability to raise and invest capital depends on delivering strong returns to shareholders, shaping the role that Shell can play on the journey to net zero. We believe this focus makes it more, not less, likely that we will achieve our climate targets and ambitions. Reducing emissions from production We believe the world will continue to need oil and gas for many years -- produced with much lower emissions -- alongside cleaner energy such as advanced biofuels, renewable power and hydrogen. We expect LNG will play a critical role in the transition. It continues to provide a secure supply of energy in many European countries. It also offers flexibility to electricity grids as wind and solar power grow, and opportunities to lower carbon emissions from industries such as cement and steel by replacing coal. In the future, by powering our LNG plants with renewable electricity, and adding carbon capture and storage, we aim to lower the carbon intensity of our LNG plants. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%), for example, the largest private-sector investment in the country's history, will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one- third compared with the world's best performing facilities. The Vito platform in the Gulf of Mexico (Shell interest 63.1%) is reducing emissions from oil and gas production. The platform started production in 2023 and is expected to produce around 80% less carbon dioxide emissions over its operating life, compared with the original design. We are using the same concept for two more platforms in the Gulf of Mexico, Whale (Shell interest 60%) and Sparta (Shell interest 51%). Supporting our customers as they decarbonise We aim to lead in the energy transition where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. The transport sector is a good example. We are building on our customer relationships and expertise to help drive the decarbonisation of passenger cars, heavy-duty trucks, planes and ships. We aim to grow our public charging network for electric vehicles, and stay a leader in biofuels including sustainable aviation fuels or renewable diesel made from waste. By repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, we are creating the low-carbon production hubs of the future. As we grow sales of low-carbon fuels we expect to reduce sales of oil products such as petrol and diesel. We have set a new ambition to measure our progress, to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11) [B]. Our ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals for transport, which are among the most progressive in the world. Our focus on value has led to a strategic shift in our power business towards select markets and segments. One example is selling more power to commercial customers, including renewable power, and less to retail customers. As a result, we expect lower growth in sales of power overall. We have updated our net carbon intensity target to reflect that change, with a 15-20% reduction by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. Towards net zero In total, we invested $5.6 billion in low-carbon solutions in 2023, which was 23% of our capital spending. We are spending $10-15 billion on low-carbon solutions between 2023 and 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. With our focused approach, we believe our investments will have an important impact, allowing us to develop low-carbon solutions at increasingly affordable prices for our customers. Shell will provide the different kinds of energy the world needs. We will invest in producing LNG with lower carbon intensity, in reducing emissions from oil and gas production, and in providing cleaner energy solutions. As we transform Shell into a net-zero emissions energy business, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition. Wael Sawan Chief Executive Officer  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of Shell Petroleum Development Company     of Nigeria Limited (SPDC  B. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. Our Energy Transition Strategy 2024 Our key beliefs have informed our strategy, enabled our progress, and will allow us to deliver on our updated targets and ambitions. 1 Today, the world must meet growing demand for energy while tackling the urgent challenge of climate change. There needs to be a balanced and orderly transition away from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy solutions to maintain secure and affordable energy supplies. 2 Our target to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 across all our operations and energy products is transforming our business. We believe this target supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, to limit the rise in the global average temperature to 1.5\\xB0C above pre-industrial levels. 3 At our Capital Markets Day in June 2023, we outlined how our Powering Progress strategy delivers more value with less emissions, emphasising the \"more value\" part of our strategy. In our Energy Transition Strategy 2024, we are focusing on how the same strategy delivers \"less emissions\". 4 By the end of 2023, we had achieved more than 60% of our target to halve Scope 1 and 2 emissions from our operations by 2030, compared with 2016, and reduced our total methane emissions by 70%. 5 We believe liquefied natural gas (LNG) will play a critical role in the energy transition, replacing coal in heavy industry. It also has a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, helping to reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. LNG helps to provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewable generation is growing rapidly. 6 Investment in oil and gas will be needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline rate of the world's oil and gas fields, which is 4-5% a year. 7 We expect rapid growth in electric vehicles, including electric trucks, and believe biofuels and natural gas will also play a role in reducing emissions from heavy-duty transport. To help drive the decarbonisation of transport, we have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11).That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A]  A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569     million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the     40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes     associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading     purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards. 8 We believe carbon abatement technologies such as carbon capture and storage will be needed for the world to reach net-zero emissions. We believe once key regulations, technologies and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits will emerge. 9 Our focus on performance, discipline and simplification is driving clear choices about where we can create the most value for our investors and customers. We believe renewable energy will be an essential part of a net-zero world. In line with our strategic shift to prioritise value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. As a result, we expect lower growth of power sales overall. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell by 2030, compared with 2016, against 20% previously. 10 We are investing $10-15 billion in low-carbon energy solutions between 2023 and the end of 2025, making us a significant investor in the energy transition. By providing the different kinds of energy the world needs, we believe we are the investment case and the partner of choice through the energy transition.

We have set a new ambition to reduce absolute emissions related to the use     of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, compared with 2021 (Scope 3 Category     11). Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category     11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 and     569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021. The energy system: our beliefs Today, fossil fuels meet around 80% of the world's primary energy use. There is even greater reliance in many developing countries where security of supply and stable prices are critical to their development. The world's primary energy demand is just over 300 million barrels of oil equivalent per day (mboe/d); with around 250 mboe/d from fossil fuels. Of this, 100 mboe/d is from oil, 80 mboe/d is from coal and 70 mboe/d is from gas. As demand for energy continues to grow, driven by rising populations and increased prosperity, the world must transition from fossil fuels to low-carbon energy in a balanced way to achieve net-zero emissions. The transition to net zero will not be linear, as different countries take different approaches and move at different paces. Public policy, developments in technology and infrastructure, and a functioning carbon market are essential to create the demand signals for the private sector to invest at scale. This will require collaboration between policymakers, customers and private organisations like Shell that have the financial strength, experience and capabilities to help build the new energy system. Developing our beliefs We have developed our beliefs through our engagements with customers, policymakers, scientists and thought leaders from around the world. We have used research from our technology programmes, along with work carried out by the International Energy Agency, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and several other external bodies. We have also drawn from the expertise in our own energy security scenarios, Sky 2050 and Archipelagos, which we published last year. Although our scenarios are not expressions of our strategy and are not our business plans, they help inform our beliefs. Our scenarios are quantified by our World Energy Models, which are supplemented with climate analysis done in conjunction with Massachusetts Institute of Technology. We will continue to challenge our own beliefs as technology, policy and customer preferences evolve. Increasing demand Since 2000, annual air mileage has tripled, passenger road mileage has doubled, and production of steel has more than doubled. We expect continued growth in the transport and industrial sectors, driven by rising populations and higher living standards in emerging and developing countries, where more than a quarter of the world's population still lack basic energy provisions. Oil demand has grown from 57 million barrels a day (mb/d) to almost 100 mb/d in the last 40 years, with occasional annual declines in recessions, and the notable decline caused by the Covid pandemic. In all cases, demand has rebounded. However, we believe growth in oil demand is set to slow in the second half of this decade, and could start falling in the 2030s because of increasing vehicle efficiency and growth in electric vehicles.

Demand for natural gas has also seen steady growth over the last 40 years, adding an average of about 60 billion cubic metres (bcm) of new demand a year. Demand for liquefied natural gas (LNG) has grown much faster, from about 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in 1983 to more than 400 mtpa in 2023. Today, LNG makes up around 13% of the global gas market, a figure expected to exceed 20% by 2040. The global LNG market will continue growing at least through the 2030s, mostly driven by industrial decarbonisation in China, and strengthening demand in other Asian countries. LNG can help displace the use of coal in industry and power generation, and can top up supply in regions of declining domestic gas production such as Europe. The prospects for LNG demand are increasingly independent of pipeline natural gas because the fuel can be transported at short notice, and can also be used as a substitute for higher-carbon liquid fuels in shipping. Global demand for coal rose by 3.6% from 2013 to the end of 2023, when it reached a new high. This increase was fuelled by strong demand in developing economies. Coal demand increased by 35% in India and by 13% in China during this 10-year period, due to rising demand for electricity and weak hydropower output. We believe replacing coal with natural gas, LNG and renewable power will be a key factor in reducing emissions.

Source: Shell analysis of IEA Extended Energy Balances (2023). Energy investment Significant investment will be required to keep supplying oil and gas while low- carbon alternatives are developed and made commercially available. This continued investment is needed because demand for oil and gas is expected to drop at a slower rate than the natural decline of the world's oil and gas fields, which is at 4% to 5% a year. Worldwide oil and gas production, outside North America, has been at around 120 mboe/d from 2013 until the end of 2023, despite cumulative oil and gas investment of more than $2 trillion over the same period. Current global investment in low- and zero-carbon energy is around $1.7 trillion a year. To reach net zero by 2050, scenarios suggest that $3-4 trillion of commercially viable investment in low-carbon energy is required each year.

Global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 Carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions from the energy system amounted to almost three-quarters of global greenhouse gas emissions in 2023. Tighter government policies will help to reduce carbon emissions at a rate consistent with the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. Even without these policies, we expect that the global demand for fossil fuels would fall from today's level of around 80% to below 70% by 2040. If the world follows a path to net-zero emissions by 2050, the figure could go down to 50%. This will be driven by electrification and the scaling-up of renewable energy generation.

Source: Shell analysis and IEA's Extended energy balances (2023). Industry Industry makes up 44% of the world's final energy use, with oil, gas and coal meeting almost 64% of this demand. Today, industry also uses substantial amounts of power generated by fossil fuels. The sector includes heavy industry, light industries such as manufacturing, mining and agriculture, and non-energy use feedstocks in chemicals. Heavy industry Heavy industry includes the energy-intensive production of steel and cement, which use high-temperature processes that can be hard and expensive to electrify. This sector represents 17% of final energy use, mainly in the form of coal, gas and electricity. Higher standards of living are built on the output of heavy industry. For example, the in-use stock per capita of steel in OECD countries ranges from 10-15 tonnes per person (t/p) compared with a world average of around 4 t/p [A]. Since 2000, OECD countries have seen a modest decline in energy demand as industrial output has plateaued. In non-OECD countries, demand has nearly tripled, driven by industrialisation. Much of this increase in demand comes from China, which currently produces around half the world's steel and cement. The use of coal in heavy industry has fuelled much of the industrial growth in non-OECD countries over the last two decades, while OECD countries use far less coal and proportionally more gas and power. In non-OECD countries, gas and electricity have increased their market share against coal, and we expect this trend to continue. We believe natural gas and LNG will play an important role in replacing coal in high-temperature heavy industry applications. They can help address both local air emissions and wider climate considerations. More plentiful and affordable renewable electricity will also play a role in decarbonising this sector. Once electrification has taken place, gas will have a back-up role because many industrial processes require a high reliability of power supply. We also see potential for hydrogen in the long-term when it becomes cost competitive. Light industry Light industry constitutes around 17% of final energy use. Its energy requirements vary from fuel for heavy equipment to medium-level heat and electricity for manufacturing facilities. The energy mix for light industry includes coal, oil, gas, electricity and some commercial biomass. Many areas of light industry have already switched to electrification. We see this trend continuing with more action needed to increase efficiency. Supportive government policies are also needed to decarbonise the sector. Non-energy use Non-energy use is dominated by petroleum feedstocks and natural gas, and some coal in Asia. It represents about 10% of final energy use, but there are limited emissions as the feedstocks are transformed into material goods such as lubricants, plastics and fertilisers. Many of these products indirectly help reduce emissions when used in insulation in buildings or in plastics which reduce the weight of vehicles. We believe bio- feedstocks and recycling will grow in importance in this sector.  A. Source: International Energy Agency. Iron and Steel Technology Roadmap     reserved.

Transport sector The transport sector represents nearly 30% of final energy use, with oil products meeting more than 90% of this demand. The remainder is mostly met by LNG, compressed natural gas and biofuels. Global CO(2) emissions from transport amount to around 8 gigatonnes (GT) a year, which is about one-seventh of global emissions. Oil products dominate transport because of their high energy density, convenience and cost competitiveness. In some markets, such as Europe and the USA, alternative transport fuels like ethanol are mandated. In Europe, where road transport fuel taxes are high, electric vehicles are increasingly cost competitive. However, in marine and aviation alternatives remain expensive. Bio- alternatives are at least twice the cost of oil products, and synthetic fuels manufactured from hydrogen can be up to eight times more expensive.

Source: Shell Scenario team interpretations of 2023 market data when Brent crude oil prices averaged $83/barrel                             Passenger road transport    Today, there are around 1.3 billion cars on the road, consuming around 25   million barrels of oil per day (mb/d), which is a quarter of the world's oil   production. Biofuels such as ethanol are used in some markets but currently amount to less than 5% of demand. We expect a rapid growth in electric vehicles,  including plug-in hybrids. Today there are around 40 million such vehicles on the roads, with up to 275 million expected by 2030. The availability of charging           points will be critical for the growth in electric vehicles. The share of electric cars in new car sales has increased from less than 3% in 2018 to 18% in 2023. The most rapid growth is in China, the world's largest car market, followed by Europe and the USA. In China, there are a wide range of vehicles for sale at under $40,000, while in other markets electric vehicles generally sell at above this price before government subsidies are applied. Commercial road transport Commercial road transport, which includes 70 million trucks, uses 16 mb/d. We believe the shift of commercial road transport towards low-carbon solutions is less than a decade behind that of passenger cars. We expect that biofuels and renewable natural gas will keep playing a role in reducing emissions from trucks. In the long term, we expect electricity or hydrogen to become the main paths to decarbonisation, depending on advances in technology, government policy and customer preferences. Aviation Demand for aviation fuel has rebounded from its Covid lows and is now at about 7 mb/d. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) made from used cooking oils and other feedstocks is seen as a credible alternative to jet fuel. Today, SAF represents less than 0.1% of total demand, but we expect its market share to grow with support from governments. Around 11 markets have SAF targets, including Europe and Singapore. Some 25 airlines representing a combined 35% of global aviation emissions also have SAF targets. Government mandates are essential to increase demand for SAF because it costs consumers between two and four times more than conventional aviation fuel. There is limited evidence that passengers will voluntarily pay a premium to cover the extra cost. In the long term, advances in technology may create opportunities to use synthetic fuels such as e-kerosene, but further research and development is required. Shipping Shipping represents about 6 mb/d of oil demand. About 5% of shipping gross tonnage in operation today is fuelled by LNG, which can reduce emissions by up to 23% compared with conventional fuels. Of the new ships on order, about 25% of gross tonnage is being designed for LNG. A significant number of the ships in operation today already have dual fuel capabilities, giving them the flexibility to run on alternatives. We believe demand for LNG in shipping will grow, including for liquefied biomethane. Fuels such as methanol and ammonia could be options for shipping in the long term, but we see challenges with both of them. Buildings Residential and commercial buildings represent just under 30% of final energy use. This energy is used to heat the buildings and power electrical devices, and around two-thirds of it comes from low-carbon sources. The global building stock has become about 75% more efficient in the last 40 years due to improved building standards, better insulation, and more efficient appliances. Electrification has helped to decarbonise this sector and we see this continuing, with an increased use of electric heat pumps and cookers, reducing demand for natural gas in homes. Supportive policies will be key to continuing this trend. Information technology services, including data centres, artificial intelligence and cryptocurrencies, are a rapidly growing part of the building sector. We believe global electricity demand in this area could double from 2023 to 2026. Power Power is the most rapidly decarbonising part of the energy system. More than 40% of electricity is now generated from renewables and nuclear. There has been rapid growth in wind and solar generation in the last 10 years, expanding from 3.5% of total power generation in 2013 to nearly 18% in 2023. Around 22% of final energy use was electrified by the end of 2023, up from around 18% in 2010. We think this trend is accelerating, aided by the adoption of electric vehicles and heat pumps. Electrification of final energy use could reach 30-40% by 2040. We expect that wind and solar will continue to dominate power generation growth as governments rightly support their scale-up, which will also require significant expansion of national electricity grids. We see natural gas having a continued role in displacing coal in power generation, which helps reduce local air pollution and carbon emissions. Natural gas also helps provide the flexibility the power system needs, at a time when renewables are growing rapidly, and its role is especially crucial in managing seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand. Carbon abatement We believe carbon abatement will be an important tool to reach net-zero emissions. Once key regulations and standards are in place, a large-scale business for carbon credits could emerge. Carbon credits may be used to compensate for emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. The cost of carbon abatement can be split into three tranches. Abatement for less than $100 a tonne of CO(2) includes efficiency measures in industry and buildings, changes in agriculture, forestry and other land use practices, and some switching from coal to gas or renewables in power generation. The middle tranche of abatement costs between $100 a tonne and $200 a tonne and includes the use of carbon capture and storage (CCS) in power generation and industry. The highest abatement costs are at more than $200 a tonne. These include parts of the transport and industry sectors, and directly capturing carbon from the atmosphere. Carbon removals are likely to become an important way to limit the long-term temperature rise. Both of Shell's energy security scenarios envisage the need for multi-billion tonne a year carbon removals, which will need to be financed by emitters purchasing carbon credits. Demand for carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market is expected to grow significantly. CCS also has the potential to make a meaningful reduction in CO(2) emissions. While there are only around 50 million tonnes per annum (mpta) of CCS in operation today, there are around 300 mtpa of projects under consideration [A]. Many net-zero scenarios show the industry growing to more than 1,000 mtpa by the mid-2030s.  A. Global CCS Institute, 2023. The Global Status of CCS: 2023. Australia Shell's strategy to 2030 Our strategy transforms Shell into a net-zero emissions business by 2050 by delivering more value with less emissions. It supports our purpose - to provide more and cleaner energy solutions Our beliefs inform our strategy. While the energy transition will move at different paces in different countries, we expect global growth in demand for oil will slow this decade, and is likely to start declining in the following decade. We also expect global demand for LNG will continue to grow at least through the 2030s. We believe the world needs a balanced energy transition, one that maintains secure energy supplies, while accelerating the transition to affordable low- carbon solutions. Our strategy supports a balanced transition by providing the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the energy system of the future. As we implement our strategy, we are becoming a multi-energy business offering our customers more and cleaner energy solutions. We are reducing emissions from our operations, and helping our customers move to cost-competitive and cleaner energy. Our energy transition plans cover all our businesses:   * Integrated Gas - Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon     intensity.   * Upstream - Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil     production stable.   * Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions - Transforming our businesses to     offer more low-carbon solutions while reducing sales of oil products.

Today, around 70% of our cash flow comes from our Integrated Gas and Upstream businesses, with the remaining 30% generated by our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses. The opposite is true for emissions. Around 75% of Shell's recorded emissions come from our Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses, with the vast majority generated when our customers use our products. The remaining emissions are generated within Integrated Gas and Upstream, with a large proportion also coming from when our customers use our products. Across all our businesses, more than 90% of our emissions are reported as Scope 3. Shell will reduce emissions over time as our product mix evolves to meet changing customer demand. We will continue to produce LNG and oil with less emissions, while the mix of our sales will move more towards low-carbon solutions such as biofuels, renewable energy and hydrogen, and away from oil products such as petrol, diesel and jet fuel into the 2030s. -------------------------------------------------   Estimated share of energy sales 2016-2030 [A] +------------------+------+------+--------------+ |                  | 2016 | 2023 | 2030         | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Oil products [B] | 57%  | 48%  | 39%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | LNG              | 14%  | 22%  | 26%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Pipeline gas     | 25%  | 21%  | 21%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Electricity      | 3%   | 7%   | 11%          | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ | Biofuels         | 1%   | 2%   | 3%           | +------------------+------+------+--------------+ [A] Share of energy products sold, aggregated on energy basis (lower heating value) in final energy equivalents.

Leading Integrated Gas Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity We plan to grow our LNG business by 20-30% by 2030 compared with 2022. We are developing new projects with lower carbon intensity by using renewable power and carbon abatement technology in the form of carbon capture and storage. Beyond our own production, we will continue to add scale and flexibility to our portfolio by buying LNG from others. Our LNG business will remain a key priority for Shell, meeting continued strong demand especially in Asia where we send most of our shipments today. As we grow our LNG business we will be targeting opportunities which have an internal rate of return of 11% or higher.

It continued to play a vital role in providing energy security in Europe in 2023. LNG is also a critical fuel in the energy transition. It is the lowest-carbon fossil fuel, producing around 50% less carbon emissions than coal when used to generate electricity, according to the International Energy Agency. Compared with coal, LNG emits far lower amounts of sulphur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and other compounds that contribute to local air pollution.

LNG is the lowest-carbon marine fuel available at scale today and offers significant greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions reductions compared with conventional fuels. LNG also offers a long-term decarbonisation pathway through bio-LNG when the supply is scaled up. Shell has developed the world's largest LNG fuelling network of ports and bunker vessels on key trading routes, enabling more customers to choose LNG. To deliver the full GHG benefits of LNG, methane emissions must be minimised. We are working with partners, industry and universities to develop and implement technologies that reduce methane emissions associated with the use of LNG. Reducing methane emissions Methane emissions from natural gas and LNG contribute to global warming. Methane is a potent GHG and reducing emissions of methane is considered one of the most effective near-term actions to keep the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement within reach. As we grow our LNG business, we continue to make the reduction of methane emissions a priority. We were one of the first companies to set a target to achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 across all our operations. Through our more efficient new plants, and projects to reduce methane emissions from existing assets and our shipping fleet, we aim to deliver LNG with some of the lowest methane emissions in our industry. We are working with others to increase transparency on methane emissions, improve accuracy of reporting and drive reductions in methane emissions across our industry. We have been enhancing the accuracy of our reported emissions through the implementation of the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework in our operated and non- operated assets. In 2023, Shell received UNEP's recognition for being on track to achieve OGMP 2.0's gold standard of reporting in its operated assets by the end of 2023 and non-operated assets by 2025. This would be the third consecutive year that Shell has achieved this highest standard. Working with others Shell is a signatory of the Oil and Gas Decarbonisation Charter launched at COP28, which focuses on driving down Scope 1 and 2, flaring and methane emissions. We led the development of the Methane Guiding Principles Coalition which brings together industry and civil society to drive reductions in methane emissions from the natural gas supply chain. Signatories of the Methane Guiding Principles are engaging with governments and industry in 20 countries to inform policies and regulations and disseminate best practice. Shell is a contributor to the OGMP 2.0 Methane Reporting Framework which is the only measurement -based international framework for methane emissions in the oil and gas sector. We are also a member of the Oil &amp; Gas Climate Initiative which has launched the Aiming for Zero Methane Emissions by 2030 initiative. Role of LNG in the energy transition Supporting renewable energy: Using LNG for power generation offers flexibility and the ability to quickly ramp up or down. LNG will be essential for maintaining grid stability as the share of renewables increases. Reducing air pollution: Gas-fired power generation can help significantly reduce air pollution when compared to the emissions released by coal-fired plants. Industrial and high-temperature applications: Gas and LNG are important for sectors where electrification is challenging, such as high-temperature industrial processes. They provide the necessary energy intensity and reliability that renewables currently cannot match, helping industries like cement and steel on their decarbonisation journeys.

Energy security: While displacement of coal by renewables is expected to be dominant in the power sector, gas and LNG will also have an important role. They will continue to provide the flexibility electricity grids will need, and energy security in the coming decades in developed countries. Climate policy and emissions trading: In regions with stringent climate policies and emissions trading systems, such as the European Union, gas and LNG can help meet emissions targets by replacing more carbon-intensive fuels. Lower-carbon fuel for transport: In some of the slower-to-abate transport sectors, such as long-distance commercial road transport and marine, LNG can help with their decarbonisation journeys. It is a solution that is both available and more affordable today when compared with other low-carbon products, and reduces emissions when compared with oil-based products.

Advantaged Upstream Cutting emissions from oil and gas production while keeping oil production stable We continue to focus on more value and less emissions, and expect that our oil production will remain stable through to 2030. The oil we are producing will increasingly come from our world-class deep-water business. Through innovative designs, our deep-water platforms are producing higher-margin and lower-carbon barrels. Maintaining oil production this decade Our oil production peaked in 2019, and by the end of 2023 had fallen by around 20%. We believe that continued investment will be needed to maintain oil supplies as existing fields naturally decline faster than reductions in demand. To keep production of crude oil and natural gas liquids stable to 2030 at 1.4 million barrels per day, we are focusing exploration on our existing positions and basins where hydrocarbons have been discovered already. This includes our high-margin deep-water positions. Across our upstream portfolio we are targeting an internal rate of return of 15% or higher. We do not anticipate any new frontier exploration entries after 2025 [A]. From the beginning of 2023 until the end of 2025, we will have started projects with a total peak production of more than 500,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. Around 40% of these projects are in deep water. They include the US Gulf of Mexico, where we are the leading operator and have one of the lowest GHG intensities in the world for oil production. As we continue to meet the world's demand, we will build on the strengths of our current portfolio to continue to deliver lower-carbon barrels with higher margins.  A. A frontier entry refers to Shell participating in new exploration activities     (seismic activities, exploratory drilling) outside countries where     hydrocarbons have been discovered already (by Shell or other companies).

Decarbonising our operations As a responsible energy producer, we are implementing carbon management plans and reducing carbon emissions from our assets. We are looking at ways to electrify our offshore oil facilities, and using wind and solar power to reduce operational emissions. We see carbon capture and storage (CCS) as a core technology to further capture emissions from our facilities, reusing our own depleted oil and gas fields where possible. We are working towards our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025, five years ahead of the World Bank's initiative [A]. Routine flaring burns gas that is not used or reinjected into wells, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change.  A.

We aim to lead in the energy transition in areas where we have competitive strengths, see strong customer demand, and identify clear regulatory support from governments. We are starting from a place of strength. Our global customer reach, and our supply and trading capabilities in low-carbon products, mean we are well placed to profitably deliver the low-carbon solutions people and businesses need. We are also able to identify changes in demand for products so that we can respond quickly. In the transport sector, for example, we see attractive growth opportunities in charging for electric vehicles and in biofuels for cars, trucks, planes and ships. We are strengthening these businesses to support our customers as they decarbonise and move from oil products to lower-carbon alternatives. As the energy transition evolves, we expect that growth in demand for oil products for transport will slow, and then decline. We are transforming our refinery portfolio and targeting value over volume in our marketing business. As a result, we will sell less oil products and more low-carbon products. Our strategy is to:   * Repurpose our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional     energy and chemicals parks, providing cleaner molecules such as biofuels and     hydrogen to help our customers decarbonise.   * Transform our marketing business by gradually reducing exposure to oil     products used for transport, while changing our product mix by investing in     areas such as electric vehicle charging, biofuels, and integrated power.   * Use technology and innovation to develop the business models and fuels of     the future. The strength of our trading capabilities, coupled with our own     production, will help us deliver affordable and low-carbon solutions     for our customers. Focused on developing low-carbon solutions for today, tomorrow and the future   * Delivery today: Repurposing energy and chemical parks, Mobility and     lubricant offerings   * Building for tomorrow (2025+): Electric vehicle charging, low-carbon fuels   * Preparing for the future (2030+): Hydrogen, Carbon removal and storage   * Supported and enabled by Integrated Power, trading and optimisation Delivering today Today, we are repurposing our remaining integrated refineries to focus on four regional energy and chemicals parks, which we are transforming into the low- carbon hubs of the future. As part of this process, we have completed the strategic review of our Energy and Chemicals Park Singapore with divestment as our preferred option. We are also high-grading our European energy and chemicals parks. This means retiring certain units and continuing with some divestments we have already announced. We are looking to strengthen our global retail and lubricants marketing businesses as the energy transition evolves, meeting the changing needs of our customers, and making value-driven choices region by region. That means growing our portfolio of low-carbon fuels and charging for electric vehicles in markets that meet our investment criteria such as China, Europe and the USA, and reducing our presence in others. As an example, we have signed an agreement to sell our shareholding in Shell Pakistan. Oil for lubricants and chemicals Most of the oil products sold by Shell are used in the transport sector. We estimate that 15-20% of the total oil products we sell are used for non-energy products such as lubricants and chemical products. Chemicals are used in many parts of modern life, from cosmetics to household goods. Lubricants are needed for virtually every machine and engine in operation. As these products are not combusted, their use does not cause Scope 3, Category 11 emissions. In 2023, Shell invested $2.3 billion in producing non-energy products including lubricants, chemicals, convenience retailing, agriculture and forestry, construction and road. We are upgrading our retail network, with expanded electric vehicle charging and convenience offers, in response to changing customer needs. In total, we plan to divest around 500 Shell-owned sites (including joint ventures) a year in 2024 and 2025. We are growing our premium lubricants portfolio to supply key energy transition sectors such as transformer oils used for offshore wind parks, and cooling fluids to support the development of electric vehicle car batteries. Supply, logistics and trading play a crucial role in ensuring we meet our customers' needs and generate strong returns. Our world-leading trading and optimisation business generates additional value by connecting supply and demand, for both conventional and low-carbon fuels across our global businesses. We will continue to grow our trading business in low-carbon molecules, carbon credits and power as the energy transition accelerates. Building for tomorrow (2025+) To build the businesses of tomorrow, we continue to strengthen our offer of low- carbon solutions where we see a significant increase in customer demand and supportive government policies. Between now and 2030, we are focusing on three areas where we have the potential to positively impact the energy transition by reducing the cost for our customers - electric vehicle charging, biofuels and integrated power. Electric vehicle charging We are growing our electric vehicle charging business to support customers who choose to change from a petrol or diesel vehicle to an electric one. We are focusing on offering our customers choices where we see increasing demand, such as in the fast-growing electric mobility markets of China and Europe. We aim to increase the number of public charge points we operate to around 200,000 by 2030, from around 54,000 today.   Scaling our network of public EV charging points   Thousands              2020   2021    2022    2023     2025   2030   Other      0.5    0.002   0.022   0.021    ~70    ~200   Asia       0.5    0.068   0.27    1.002   China      0      1.964   17.55   32.576   Europe     0      5.021   8.937   16.579   Americas   0      0.044   0.07    3.605 We are focusing on public charging, rather than home charging, because we believe it will be needed most by our customers. We have a major competitive advantage in terms of locations, as our global network of service stations is one of the largest in the world. We have other competitive advantages, such as our convenience retail offering which allows us to offer our customers coffee, food and other convenience items as they charge their cars. As we grow our business offering charging for electric vehicles, we expect an internal rate of return of 12% or higher. Biofuels We are expanding our world-leading biofuels business to meet growing customer demand and where we can use the strength of our supply and trading positions. Aviation and shipping remain some of the slower-to-decarbonise sectors and will require low-carbon molecular solutions such as biofuels and synthetic hydrogen- based fuels at scale in the future. Shell is already one of the world's largest energy traders and blenders of biofuels selling significantly more low-carbon fuels than we produce. We expect to continue to grow both our own production and sales of biofuels in the coming years. We are focusing on producing premium biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG). These fuels will help to reduce emissions in commercial road transport. To support our production of biofuels, we are investing in new feedstocks through investments and partnerships while using the strength of our trading business to expand sales beyond our production volumes. Through our Ra\\xEDzen joint venture in Brazil we are already the largest producer of second-generation ethanol and the leading sugar-cane ethanol producer globally. To support growing demand for biofuels this decade, we are developing more second-generation technologies. We are also developing technologies and feedstocks that aim to allow continued and sustainable growth in biofuels while minimising impacts on the environment and food supplies. Following the 2023 acquisition of Nature Energy, one of the largest producers of RNG in Europe, we have a strong position in RNG. We are actively looking for more opportunities to meet emerging demand for RNG, especially in north-west Europe. We expect to generate an internal rate of return of more than 12% from our new investments in low-carbon fuels. Integrated power We will continue to grow our integrated power business with selective investments in renewable power generation. We will also use the strength of our trading and optimisation capabilities to meet the growing need for flexible power storage solutions such as batteries. We already have a significant presence in battery and storage through both our ventures programme and investments in research and development. We are making disciplined choices to create value from our power portfolio, stepping back from activities that do not fit our strategy or that do not generate enough returns. We have exited renewable projects in Ireland and France, and sold our home energy businesses in the UK and Germany. We are focusing on selling power, including renewable power, to business customers. We are also using renewable power to decarbonise our own operations. Over time, we will also use our renewable power capacity to produce low-carbon molecules such as hydrogen. We expect returns from power generation to be in line with the market, at around 6-8% ungeared, with opportunities to create higher returns from areas such as trading and optimisation.   Flexible power generation capacity demand is projected to grow significantly               2025   2030   2035   2040   2045                            2050   Gas          2.1    2.2    2.4    2.6    2.9                             3.4   Hydrogen       0    0.1    0.3    0.5    0.7                               1   Batteries    0.2    0.4    0.5    0.8    1.1                             1.7   Other        0.4    0.3    0.3    0.4    0.4                             0.5 [A] Gas includes both open-cycle and combined-cycle gas turbine power generation. Source: McKinsey Energy Solutions Global Energy Perspective 2023. Preparing for the future (2030+) This decade, we are also focusing on developing integrated energy hubs, select carbon capture and removal businesses, such as CCS, and fuels of the future, such as hydrogen, to prepare to meet our customers' needs after 2030. We plan to create integrated energy hubs around our energy and chemicals parks in North America and north-west Europe, and other locations where we see significant potential for high growth in demand in the future. These include Australia, Brazil, China and India. We will be focusing our investments in these hubs as we integrate our businesses and trading capabilities to deliver affordable low-cost solutions to our customers. We are researching the development of fuels such as liquefied synthetic gas (LSG), which is produced when renewable hydrogen is combined with captured carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to create natural gas, which is then liquefied. This low- carbon gas can be directly used in existing gas networks and infrastructure, including LNG plants. Carbon capture and removal We are developing technologies related to carbon capture and storage (CCS) and carbon removals, which are necessary to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. For the rest of this decade, we will direct most of our investments in CCS towards decarbonising our own operations. We are also looking to turn this into a profitable business for Shell by helping other companies decarbonise their operations in the future. However, in many countries CCS still lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates policy mechanisms to enable CCS, and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. Direct air capture (DAC) technology can also play a key role in the energy transition. We are aiming to make it more affordable and scalable through several pilot projects. DAC extracts CO(2) from the air to provide a carbon feedstock for synthetic products, or when coupled with transport and storage, to enable it to be stored underground. In combination with carbon capture and removal technologies, a functioning global carbon market will be a critical enabler of an accelerated energy transition. We are actively participating in carbon markets, and building and managing a diverse portfolio of high-quality carbon credits, including nature-based and non-nature based solutions, to help our customers decarbonise. Our transitions plans cover all our businesses Leading Integrated Gas Advantaged Upstream Differentiated Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions Focused decarbonisation pathways We have identified pathways to net zero for our two biggest customer sectors, transport and industry. These two sectors make up more than 70% of global final energy demand and more than 55% of global carbon emissions today. Our pathways are based on where we believe we have the competitive advantages to provide our customers with the affordable productions they need though the transition.

Leading to our strategic decarbonisation areas for this decade Electric vehicle charging Biofuels infrastructure Integrated power positions Co(2) capture and removal value chains Enabled by our strengths and competitive advantages Trading capabilities and infrastructure networks Technology and innovation Policy and advocacy More value with less emissions: our actions Putting our strategy into action across all our businesses Our beliefs about the energy transition inform our strategy to deliver more value with less emissions. Our strategy is based on the areas where Shell has unique competitive strengths, allowing us to be a successful business through the energy transition. Growing our world-leading LNG business with lower carbon intensity As we grow our world-leading liquefied natural gas (LNG) business by 20-30% by 2030, we will continue to reduce the carbon intensity of our operations. Our LNG joint venture in Canada (Shell interest 40%, non-operated) will use natural gas and renewable electricity to reduce emissions from the plant by more than one-third compared with the world's best performing facilities when it starts up. The commissioning process is expected to begin in 2024 and will continue into 2025. In Qatar, Shell is a partner in the North Field Expansion, the largest LNG project in the world. It comprises the North Field East (Shell interest 6.25%) and North Field South (Shell interest 9.375%) projects. By using carbon capture and storage, these projects will help provide LNG with a lower-carbon footprint to our customers. Shell's share of these projects will be around 3.5 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) of LNG when production starts later this decade. Shell is working with shipping companies to help decarbonise the marine sector. Parts of the marine sector uses LNG to power some of its ships, with the aim of switching to liquefied biomethane or liquefied e-methane, a hydrogen- based fuel, in the longer term. Artificial intelligence for LNG Artificial intelligence (AI) is helping us reduce carbon emissions at LNG plants by using information from sensors to calculate the most efficient settings for equipment. At one LNG facility, we estimate these technology developments are reducing carbon dioxide emissions by around 340,000 tonnes a year. We have used these automation and optimisation technologies to reduce emissions at multiple LNG facilities. Reducing methane emissions We continue to enhance the accuracy of our reported methane emissions and reduce emission sources across Shell-operated assets. By the end of 2023, around 80% of fugitive-emission sources at our operated oil, gas and LNG production facilities used leak detection and repair programmes to tackle leaks and monitor equipment. Shell works with others to share our learnings and drive industry-wide action on methane operations. We are a founding signatory of the Oil and Gas Methane Partnership (OGMP) 2.0 reporting framework and have been implementing the framework in our operated and non-operated assets, engaging with our non- operated joint-venture partners to achieve improved accuracy or reporting beyond our operations. We test and use latest technologies to monitor our emissions. In 2023, we successfully completed a pilot with GHGSat, a pioneer in methane detection, to test satellite capabilities for monitoring methane emissions from offshore facilities. The aim is to use this technology more widely in the future. We have also been using drones and satellites to monitor the methane emitted during the production and processing of natural gas, and the export of LNG. This has helped us reduce wells maintenance periods and carefully control gas dryness during processing to limit venting. We have reduced vented methane emissions at our QGC business in Queensland by more than 2,800 tonnes since 2017.

[B] Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is the operator that market their gas (including LNG and GTL assets) defined as the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic meter (Nm3) per total volume of gas available for sale in Nm(3)) Cutting emissions from oil and gas production in our Upstream business In our Upstream operations, we are cutting emissions from oil and gas production to meet our targets, which are some of the most ambitious in our industry. Reducing operational emissions is a key factor in the development of new projects. Our Vito deep-water platform (Shell interest 63.1%) in the Gulf of Mexico is one of our newest platforms and has a peak production of 100,000 barrels of oil equivalent a day. The platform is expected to reduce carbon dioxide (CO(2)) emissions by around 80% over its operating life, compared with its original design. In addition to the reduced emissions, Vito also cost 70% less than the anticipated cost of the original design, an example of creating more value with less emissions. Vito's design is being replicated in two other deep-water platforms in the Gulf of Mexico: Whale and Sparta. The Shell-operated Whale project (Shell interest 60%) is expected to start production towards the end of 2024 and is expected to operate with less emissions than Vito. A final investment decision for the Sparta project (Shell interest 51%) was announced in December 2023, with production due to begin in 2028. Shell will use the experience of the Vito and Whale projects to enhance the design and energy efficiency capabilities of Sparta. We are reducing the carbon intensity of new projects elsewhere. Timi in Malaysia (Shell interest 75%) is our first wellhead platform to be powered by a solar and wind hybrid power system. This unmanned platform, which delivered its first gas in August 2023, is around 60% lighter than a conventional tender-assisted drilling wellhead platform, helping to reduce the emissions needed to develop the project. Reducing routine flaring We are working to reduce routine flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Our target is to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations by 2025 [A]. This commitment challenges us to move faster than the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. In 2023, around 10% of our greenhouse gas emissions from flaring occurred at facilities where there was no infrastructure to capture the gas, which is similar to the 2022 figure. Overall flaring decreased to 2.8 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023 from 3 million tonnes of CO(2)e in 2022.  A. Subject to the completion of the sale of SPDC. In Norway, Shell is the operator of the Ormen Lange gas field (Shell interest 17.8%). This is an underwater facility connected to Nyhamna, an onshore processing and export plant. The Ormen Lange is powered by renewable hydroelectricity provided by the Norwegian grid. This same source of renewable hydroelectricity provides around 93% of the energy needed for Nyhamna. We are installing further underwater compression units to increase gas recovery from the Ormen Lange field, which will also be powered by the same renewable hydroelectricity. Within our Upstream portfolio we have made divestments, including the sale of our interest in the Malampaya gas field in the Philippines in 2022 and our Permian business in the USA in 2021. These sales were strategic moves, which also resulted in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Downstream, Renewables and Energy Solutions businesses: offering more low-carbon solutions We are reducing emissions associated with our refineries by transforming them into energy and chemicals parks. This transformation is under way at Norco in the USA, Scotford in Canada, Pernis in the Netherlands and Rheinland in Germany. In January 2024, we took a final investment decision to convert the hydrocracker of the Wesseling site at the Energy and Chemicals Park Rheinland into a production unit for Group III base oils to produce high-quality engine and transmission oils. The repurposing of this refinery is a significant step towards serving our growing lubricant customer base with premium base oils, delivering more value with less emissions. The Wesseling site will stop processing crude oil into petrol, jet fuel and diesel by 2025. When it starts operations in the second half of this decade, the production unit will be highly electrified and is expected to cut Shell's Scope 1 and 2 emissions by around 620,000 tonnes a year. This is the latest development in the transformation of Rheinland, which includes investments in a 10-megawatt electrolyser to produce renewable hydrogen and a biomethane liquefaction plant. Biofuels We are developing biofuels such as sustainable aviation fuel, renewable diesel and renewable natural gas (RNG) to help our customers decarbonise without having to change their cars, trucks, planes or ships. Shell is one of the world's largest traders and blenders of biofuels, meeting around 6% of global demand. In 2023, around 9.7 billion litres of biofuels went into our petrol and diesel worldwide, compared with 9.5 billion litres in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen, our joint venture in Brazil (Shell interest 44%), is one of the world's biggest bioethanol producers, delivering some of the lowest carbon intensity biofuels available today. The majority of the ethanol and cellulosic ethanol produced by Ra\\xEDzen is sold unblended to international customers in markets such as Europe, Japan and the USA. It is used in the transport, pharmaceutical and manufacturing industries, among others. Ra\\xEDzen produced around 3.12 billion litres of ethanol in 2023, up from around 3 billion in 2022. Ra\\xEDzen's Costa Pinto plant produced 30 million litres of second-generation ethanol made from inedible agricultural waste in 2023, up from 26 million in 2022. In 2023, the joint venture also commissioned the first of eight advanced biofuel plants which it aims to build in Brazil. In February 2023, we completed the nearly $2 billion acquisition of Nature Energy, making us one of the largest producers of renewable natural gas (RNG) in Europe. RNG, produced by turning organic material such as agricultural waste into renewable energy, is a low-carbon fuel that can power trucks and ships. With our partners, Nature Energy owns and operates 13 biogas plants in Denmark and one plant in the Netherlands. The biofuels plant at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands is expected to be one of Europe's biggest once operational in the latter half of the decade. It is expected to be capable of producing 820,000 tonnes of biofuels from waste each year. This facility will have the capacity to produce enough renewable diesel to avoid 2.8 million tonnes of carbon emissions a year. Sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) could account for more than half of the plant's biofuels capacity, with the rest being renewable diesel. Shell can adjust this mix to meet changing customer demand. SAF currently accounts for less than 0.1% of global aviation fuel. Shell's investment will help increase SAF production, which is vital if aviation is to cut carbon emissions. To support our biofuel production capacity, we are also investing in new feedstocks for biofuels. In 2022, Shell acquired waste recycling company EcoOils which produces advanced biofuels feedstock at its facilities in Malaysia and Indonesia. This will enable the production and supply of low-carbon fuels like SAF to customers. We also invested in agroforestry company Investancia Group (Shell interest 30%) in 2022. Together, Shell and Investancia are using degraded cattle land in Paraguay to plant pongamia oil trees to grow sustainable feedstock to make biofuels. Lower-carbon race fuel for Scuderia FerrariShell has developed a race fuel containing 10% of second-generation bioethanol for Scuderia Ferrari to use in its Formula 1 racing cars. We use digital simulation to predict the combustion behaviour and performance of each fuel blend to significantly reduce the development time, and maximise performance and efficiency. The team is now working on a 100% sustainable race fuel, which includes several different sustainable fuel components, to meet requirements for the 2026 Formula 1 season. Electric vehicle charging Shell is well positioned to become a profitable leader in public charging for electric vehicles, meeting the growing demand from drivers who need to charge on the go. At the end of 2023, we had around 54,000 public charge points for electric vehicles at Shell forecourts, on streets and at locations such as supermarkets. This was up from 27,000 in 2022. We expect to have around 70,000 public charge points by 2025 and around 200,000 by 2030. Shell Recharge, our public charging network, currently operates in around 33 countries. We opened our largest electric vehicle charging station in the world in China, the world's largest market for EVs, in September 2023. The 258 fast-charging points at the Shell Recharge Shenzhen Airport EV Station serve thousands of drivers every day. The charging points are partially powered by rooftop solar panels with the capacity to generate 300,000 kilowatt hours of renewable electricity a year. The charging station, a joint venture between Shell and Chinese electric car manufacture BYD (Shell share 80%), has a utilisation rate of two-and-a-half- times the local average. China is one of the most important growth markets for our Mobility business. In March 2023, we completed the acquisition of Volta Inc. in the USA. We now operate one of the largest public electric vehicle charging networks in the country, with more than 3,000 charge points across 31 states and more than 3,400 additional charge points in development. Integrated power positions Our power business brings together our expertise in generation, trading and marketing. We are making selective investments in renewable generation, batteries and other grid-flexibility technologies, to provide low-carbon solutions to our commercial and industrial customers, and to decarbonise our own operations. We aim to profitably deliver more renewable power solutions, by growing our portfolio in select markets such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. At the end of 2023, we had around 2.5 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity in operation, 4.1 GW under development and around 40 GW of potential capacity in our pipeline globally, including utility-scale solar and integrated wind-to- hydrogen projects. In 2023, Shell sold around 279 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity, which is more than enough to meet the annual needs of Australia. In the USA, the solar, wind and battery company Savion, which we acquired in 2021, has started to develop new solar plants. Once operational, they will generate around 500 megawatts (MW) of renewable power. We are also investing in growing our renewable energy capacity elsewhere. In 2022, we acquired Sprng Energy in India and in 2023 we acquired Isemaren in Spain. We are also developing our own positions, such as our Pottendijk and Koegorspolder solar farms in the Netherlands. In 2023 in the Netherlands, the Hollandse Kust Noord offshore wind farm (Shell interest 79.9%), which has a generating capacity of 759 MW, became operational. Hollandse Kust Noord will eventually produce the equivalent of almost 3% of electricity demand in the Netherlands. Ecowende (Shell interest 60%), our joint venture with Eneco, announced plans to develop a 760 MW wind farm nearby called Hollandse Kust West. We are also developing utility-scale battery storage systems in select markets. In March 2023, we entered into a partnership to deliver a battery storage system in Australia. Shell will have access to 100% of the battery system's offtake over a 20-year period. Completion of the project is expected in late 2024. Hydrogen We continue to invest in the production of hydrogen, looking for ways to expand the technology and reduce costs so that it becomes an affordable and available low-carbon option for the future. To deliver the full low-carbon potential of hydrogen, we continue to learn about where emissions, including methane, can occur during production and use. We are also identifying opportunities to address them in collaboration with others. We see a role for hydrogen as a feedstock, for example to make synthetic fuels, and as an energy carrier across industry and transport. At the end of 2022, we started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 in the Netherlands, which will be one of the largest renewable hydrogen plants in Europe when it becomes operational in the second half of the decade. The 200 MW electrolyser will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Holland Hydrogen 1 will help to decarbonise the production of our petrol, diesel and aviation fuel at the Shell Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam. In the longer term, the plant could also supply hydrogen to help reduce emissions in transport and industry. In Oman, we acquired a 35% interest in Green Energy Oman, which will produce hydrogen from seawater, powered by up to 25 GW of solar and wind energy. Shell is the lead operating partner. The project is expected to be operational by the early part of the next decade and aims to produce around 1.8 million tonnes of hydrogen a year at full capacity. As a founding member of the H2 Accelerate consortium, Shell continues to work with partners to enable the use of hydrogen to decarbonise long-haul road transport across Europe. The consortium is trying to develop a programme to make hydrogen a commercially viable fuel for the trucking sector. Carbon capture and storage (CCS) Shell continues to work with governments, customers and partners to unlock the potential of CCS to reduce emissions where there are few low-carbon alternatives. CCS technologies are necessary to meet the temperature goals of the Paris Agreement. However, in many countries CCS lacks a clear business model. To address this challenge, Shell advocates for policy mechanisms and supports industry partnerships dedicated to the growth of commercially viable CCS projects. By the end of 2023, the Quest CCS facility at the Scotford upgrader in Canada (Shell interest 10%) had captured and safely stored more than 8.8 million tonnes of CO(2) since it began operating in 2015. We are exploring the possibility of increasing CCS capacity at Quest, initially by 750,000 tonnes a year. Our Northern Lights CCS project (Shell interest 33.3%) in Norway signed contracts in 2023 to transport and safely store 1.2 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The CO(2) will be shipped from two of \\xD8rsted's biomass power plants in Denmark and a Yara ammonia and fertiliser plant in the Netherlands. It will then be stored 2,600 metres below the seabed in the North Sea. In Australia, the Gorgon CCS project (Shell interest 25%, operated by Chevron) reported it had stored more than 9 million tonnes of CO(2) equivalent by the end of 2023. In addition to these significant emission reductions, Chevron has confirmed it had acquired and surrendered carbon credits to address historical injection shortfalls. The project started operating in 2019 and is the largest CCS operation in the world. Construction of Porthos, Europe's largest CCS facility, will begin at the port of Rotterdam in 2024. Shell will be the biggest customer, supplying 1 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. The captured CO(2) will be transported to empty gas fields under the North Sea around 20 kilometres off the Dutch coast. This will reduce the Netherlands' annual CO(2) emissions by around 2% for 15 years from 2026. In 2023, Shell and Esso were jointly awarded three licences in the UK's first- ever carbon storage licensing round. The joint venture (Shell interest 50%) will evaluate three sites in the North Sea for the potential storage of CO(2) captured and transported from industrial facilities in the UK. Also in 2023, Shell's CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology won a bid for deployment at a CCS plant in Abu Dhabi, UAE. The plant will capture and permanently store 1.5 million tonnes of CO(2) a year. Direct air capture Shell's research programmes have been developing technology to directly remove carbon from the atmosphere for several years. In 2023, we took the decision to build a direct air capture (DAC) demonstration unit at our technology research centre in Houston, Texas, USA. The aim of the project, which has a targeted start-up date of 2025, is to prove the viability of Shell's solid sorbent technology. The unit is being developed by a diverse team of Shell scientists, engineers and technical experts across the globe. Integrated energy hubs As part of our approach to the energy transition, we are developing integrated energy hubs to reduce our own emissions and those of the products we sell. At our Energy and Chemicals Park Rotterdam in the Netherlands, for example, we are integrating biofuels, hydrogen and CCS into our existing facilities. We have started to build Holland Hydrogen 1 which will help to decarbonise fuel production at the nearby energy and chemicals park once operational. The hydrogen plant will be powered by renewable energy from the Hollandse Kust (noord) offshore wind farm. Some of the emissions from the energy hub will be captured and stored under the North Sea by two CCS projects once they are in operation. These are Porthos, where we are the biggest customer, and Aramis, a joint venture. As the market develops, we will seek opportunities for future projects and use our customer relationships to meet increasing demand for low-carbon solutions.

They may be used by Shell and its customers to compensate emissions in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce and compensate. We are clear that carbon credits need to have a robust carbon benefit and deliver a positive impact on ecosystems and communities. We work closely with local partners to ensure that the carbon credits projects we invest in are of a high quality. We select projects that are certified under credible and independent carbon credit standards. These include the Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard and the American Carbon Registry. We do this to ensure that the carbon credits are real and verifiable, and that issues such as permanence, additionality and leakage have been adequately considered. We also help develop and buy carbon credits generated by other nature-based projects and by technologies. We carefully source and screen the credits we purchase and retire from the market. In 2023, Shell's net carbon intensity (NCI) accounted for 20 million carbon credits, of which 4 million were linked to the sale of energy products. Of the 20 million tonnes of carbon credit retirements included in Shell's NCI metric for 2023, 85% were certified by Verra, 9% by the American Carbon registry, 6% by Gold Standard, and less than 1% via Australian Carbon Credit Units. Tracking SAF with blockchain We are using new technologies to power our Upstream and Downstream assets, improve our trading and supply operations, and deliver compelling new materials and molecules. Avelia, a business model developed in partnership with Accenture and American Express Global Business Travel, uses blockchain to help our customers securely and transparently track emissions reductions and the environmental attributes of the sustainable aviation fuel they acquire, tracing it from production through to delivery into aviation fuelling networks. Technology and innovation Built on more than 125 years of technological innovation, our company's future performance depends on the successful development, demonstration and commercial deployment of new technologies and new products. In 2023, research and development expenditure on projects that contributed to decarbonisation was around $628 million, up from around $440 million in 2022. The 2023 figure represents around 49% of our total expenditure on research and development, up from around 41% in 2022.

Our technology and innovation portfolio helps to deliver Shell's strategy by:   * Achieving more value with less emissions across our core businesses today.     For example, the Just Add Water System, developed by Shell, uses a software     system to reduce fuel costs for marine vessels and the GHG emissions they     emit.   * Creating the low-carbon products and solutions of tomorrow, such as our     CANSOLV\\xAE carbon capture technology which will be deployed on the world's     largest CCS plant in Abu Dhabi.   * Exploring the transformative technologies of the future, such as renewable     hydrogen, direct air capture, and heat and power storage solutions. The technologies and business models we are developing will shape the products and services we offer our customers in the transport and industry sectors. At our Zhuhai plant in China, which produces lubricants and greases, we have introduced a thermal energy storage system. This system replaces diesel fuel with renewable electricity to generate the process steam required for manufacturing lubricants. The storage system will optimise steam production and is expected to reduce the use of diesel by 300 tonnes and CO(2) emissions by more than 900 tonnes a year. By demonstrating the benefits of this type of system on a Shell facility, we are in a position to encourage and support the decarbonisation of our customers. We invest in the latest energy technologies through our partnerships with start- ups and leading academic institutions. For example, we are working with Imperial College London in the UK to develop new technologies, with a particular focus on electric vehicles, lubricants, energy storage, CCS, and materials. Powering industry through investments Shell Ventures invests in start-ups and bigger companies that seek to electrify energy systems, decarbonise transport, gain data-based insights and provide innovative customer solutions. In 2023, we invested in a German company called Kraftblock, which has created energy storage systems to help the industry sector switch from fossil fuels to renewable energies. The technology also allows customers to recycle waste heat. Shell Ventures is a partner with Norwegian company Corvus Energy, a leading supplier of safe, innovative and reliable energy storage solutions for the maritime industry. The company's battery storage systems replace diesel and bunkering oil, thereby reducing emissions. The storage systems are used on vessels in Shell's operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Climate policy engagement Comprehensive, coherent and consistent policies are a crucial part of the journey to net zero. With the right policy and regulatory conditions, we can profitably increase our investments through the energy transition. We advocate robust policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers and reduce our own emissions. Our advocacy, directly to governments, and indirectly through industry associations and coalitions, is a key part of our strategy. Shell engages with governments, regulators and policymakers in different ways to help shape policy, legislation and regulation. Our public policy positions serve as a framework for our advocacy with governments, international organisations, industry associations, and other stakeholders, globally, regionally and within countries. In using the positions, we recognise that the pace of the energy transition will vary around the world. In the table below, we show how our advocacy focuses on four key areas which we believe are critical to the energy transition and will support Shell's strategy. Policy and advocacy Advocacy Themes: A Achieving net-zero emissions Cross-sector policies that support the achievement of national net-zero ambitions through comprehensive policy frameworks and carbon pricing, and which seek to ensure a just transition B Supplying the secure energy the world needs Policies that support energy security, such as clear and predictable regulatory frameworks that enable the production of hydrocarbons with lower emissions C Driving changes in demand Policies that support changes in customer demand in transport and industry, such as vehicle standards, mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, and demand for low-carbon products D Growing low-carbon solutions Policies that encourage the development of low-carbon solutions, including incentives for biofuels, flexibility in feedstock choices, and effective regulatory frameworks for hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS)  Sector                               Policy Positions           Advocacy Theme

activity Advocacy in action Advocating policies that encourage demand for and incentivise investment in low- carbon solutions is a key part of our engagement with governments and regulators. In the USA, for example, we advocate permits for projects to be granted faster and with fewer hurdles. Delays, caused in part by prolonged litigation, negatively impact the delivery of projects. We believe reform of the permit system will help to deliver new projects relating to the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act and the Inflation Reduction Act. To achieve this reform, we have constructively engaged in legislative negotiations in the House of Representatives and Senate to advance bipartisan legislative solutions. In the EU, Shell is advocating policies to enable commercial investments in the energy transition, notably the creation of demand for low-carbon solutions. We supported the Fit for 55 package, including binding targets for the use of renewable hydrogen and advanced biofuels. We supported policies to accelerate the electrification of road transport and frameworks that help the business case for carbon abatement and removal. In Brazil, we advocate the establishment of a national emissions trading system (ETS), which is a form of carbon pricing. We believe this would incentivise decarbonisation at the lowest cost, and support the long-term development of a global carbon market. The ETS is awaiting a final review by the Federal Senate, after which it is expected to be written into law. In the Asia-Pacific region, Shell is working with local and national governments to develop policy and regulatory frameworks for CCS. The creation of cross- border CCS hubs in the region could benefit multiple industries across the region. In 2024, Shell and ExxonMobil were selected to work with the Singapore government as lead developers for a cross-border CCS project that could store at least 2.5 million tonnes of carbon dioxide a year by 2030.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------  A. These developments include acquisitions, investments, projects, divestments     and withdrawals, at various stages of maturity and with different levels of     Shell interest from minority investment to full ownership. Targets, ambitions and performance Our target is to become a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 It includes net-zero emissions from our operations, as well as net-zero emissions from the end-use of all the energy products we sell. In the short and medium term, we have set climate targets for emissions that we are able to control, namely our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, methane emissions, and flaring. We have also set climate targets and ambitions for emissions that are outside our control. These include our ambition to reduce the Scope 3, Category 11 customer emissions from the use of our oil products, and our target to reduce the net carbon intensity of all the energy products we sell. Targets and ambitions Net-zero emissions by 2050 (Scopes 1, 2 and 3) Emissions from our own operations (Scope 1 and 2) Target Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 [A] under operational control (2016 reference year) Target Eliminating routine flaring from Upstream operations by 2025 [B] Target Maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve near-zero methane emissions by 2030 Emissions from the products we sell (Scope 3) Target Updated Net carbon intensity (NCI) Introducing a range of 15-20% for our target to reduce NCI by 2030 (2016 reference year) Ambition New Oil products ambition Reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030, Scope 3 Category 11 [C] (2021 reference year)  A. On a net basis.  B. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC.  C. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11)     were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO2e) in 2023 and 569     million tonnes CO2e in 2021. Reducing our absolute Scope 1 and 2 emissions In October 2021, we set a target to halve the emissions from our operations (Scope 1), plus the energy we buy to run them (Scope 2), by 2030 compared with 2016 levels on a net basis. To decarbonise our operations, we are focusing on:   * making portfolio changes such as acquisitions and investments in new, low-     carbon projects. We are also decommissioning plants, divesting assets, and     reducing our production through the natural decline of existing oil and gas     fields;   * improving the energy efficiency of our operations;   * transforming our remaining integrated refineries into     low-carbon energy and chemicals parks, which involves decommissioning     plants;   * using more renewable electricity to power our operations; and   * developing carbon capture and storage (CCS) for our facilities. If required, we may choose to use high-quality carbon credits to offset any remaining emissions from our operations, in line with the mitigation hierarchy of avoid, reduce, and compensate. The chart below shows our progress since 2016 in reducing our Scope 1 and 2 emissions and gives an indication of how we expect to achieve our target in 2030. The actions we will take to achieve our target will depend on the evolution of our asset portfolio and the continued development of technologies that reduce carbon emissions. We expect that on a net portfolio basis, new investments across our portfolio will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions between 2024 and 2030, but this increase will be outweighed by planned divestments and natural decline. Our investments in producing low-carbon energy such as biofuels will increase our Scope 1 and 2 emissions, while reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell. Subsequent reductions in our emissions are reflected in the mechanisms outlined below and reflect an expected path to meeting our target in 2030.

The 2016 baseline was not recalculated in 2023. The 2016 baseline may be     recalculated in future years if an acquisition or a divestment has an impact     of more than 10% on the total Scope 1 and 2 emissions.  B. Operational control boundary.  C. Including nature-based solutions. Our direct GHG emissions (Scope 1, operational control boundary) decreased from 51 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2022 to 50 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023, driven by several factors including: divestments in 2022 (e.g. Deer Park and Mobile refinery, Tunisia Miskar concession, offshore Baram Delta Operations (BDO) PSC and Block SK307 PSC in the Philippines) and handover of operations in OML 11 in Nigeria in 2022; unplanned downtime (e.g. Deer Park Chemicals); reduced flaring from assets including Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo); reduction activities and purchase of renewable electricity. These decreases were partly offset by Shell Polymers Monaca having more units online in 2023 and higher emissions from our Pearl gas-to-liquids plant and our Prelude floating liquefied natural gas facility with increased production. Our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 provides more details of how we reduced our Scope 1 and 2 emissions. Methane emissions Methane emissions include those from unintentional leaks, venting and incomplete combustion, for example in flares and turbines. Our target to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% continued to be met in 2023. Shell's overall methane emissions intensity was at 0.05% for facilities with marketed gas and 0.001% for facilities without marketed gas. We believe our methane emissions are quantified according to industry best practice. This target covers all Shell- operated oil and gas assets in our Upstream and Integrated Gas businesses. By the end of 2023, we reduced our total methane emissions by 70% since 2016. In 2023, Shell's total methane emissions were 41 thousand tonnes compared with 40 thousand tonnes in 2022. The increase was due to venting (for example, the maintenance of our Prelude asset and operational issues in assets operated by SarawakShell Berhad) and an increase in reported emissions from integrated gas assets in Canada resulting from the adoption of enhanced source level measurements in line with OGMP reporting requirements.

Our target is to maintain methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieve     near zero methane emissions by 2030  B. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that market their gas (incl. LNG and GTL assets), defined as     the total volume of methane emissions in normal cubic metre (Nm3) per total     volume of gas available for sale in Nm3.  C. Methane emissions intensity from all oil and gas assets for which Shell is     the operator that do not market their gas (e.g. where gas is reinjected)     defined as the total mass of methane emissions in tonnes per total mass of     oil and condensate available for sale in tonnes.  D. Total methane emissions for all assets under Shell operational control     including Integrated Gas and Upstream and Downstream and Renewables Energy     Solutions assets, quantified according to industry best practice. Routine flaring We are working to reduce flaring, which is inefficient and contributes to climate change. Routine flaring of gas occurs during normal oil production when it is not possible to use the gas or reinject it into the well. In 2021, we brought forward our target to eliminate routine flaring from our upstream operations to 2025 [A] from 2030. This accelerates our commitment of 2015 to end routine flaring as a signatory to the World Bank's Zero Routine Flaring by 2030 initiative. Total routine flaring from our upstream oil and gas assets remained relatively stable in 2023 compared with 2022 at 0.1 million tonnes, having reduced from 1.1 million tonnes in 2016. Around 50% of total routine and non-routine flaring in our Integrated Gas and Upstream facilities in 2023 occurred in assets operated by the SPDC and Shell Nigeria Exploration and Production Company (SNEPCo). On January 16, 2024, Shell reached an agreement to sell SPDC to a consortium of five companies, subject to approvals by the Federal Government of Nigeria and other conditions.  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. Reducing net carbon intensity We have set targets to reduce the net carbon intensity (NCI) of the energy products we sell by 9-12% by 2024, 9-13% by 2025, 15-20% by 2030, and 100% by 2050. The intended use of the NCI metric is to track progress in reducing the overall carbon intensity of the energy products sold by Shell. Net carbon intensity measures emissions associated with each unit of energy we sell, compared with a 2016 baseline. It reflects changes in sales of oil and gas products, and changes in sales of low and zero-carbon products- such as biofuels, hydrogen and renewable electricity. Unlike Scope 1 and 2 emissions, reducing the net carbon intensity of the products we sell requires action by both Shell and our customers, with the support of governments and policymakers to create the right conditions for change. Our focus on where we can add the most value has led to a strategic shift in our power business. We plan to build our integrated power business, including renewable power, in places such as Australia, Europe, India and the USA. We have withdrawn from the supply of energy directly to homes in Europe because we do not believe that is where our strengths lie. In line with our shift to prioritising value over volume in power, we are concentrating on select markets and segments. One example is our focus on commercial customers more than retail customers. Given this focus on value, we expect growth in total power sales to 2030 will be lower than previously planned. This has led to an update to our net carbon intensity target. We are now targeting a 15-20% reduction by 2030 in the net carbon intensity of the energy products we sell, compared with 2016, against our previous target of a 20% reduction. Acknowledging uncertainty in the pace of change in the energy transition, we have also chosen to retire our 2035 target of a 45% reduction in net carbon intensity. The biggest driver for reducing our net carbon intensity is increasing the sales of and demand for low-carbon energy. The chart on the next page illustrates how changes in the volume of products and services we sell could result in net carbon intensity reductions through to 2030. The change in our sales of these products and services will also reflect the development and adoption of new technologies and infrastructure, and the adoption of public policies designed to encourage the energy transition. In 2023, Shell's NCI was 74 grams of carbon dioxide equivalent per megajoule of energy (gCO(2)e/MJ), a 2.6% decrease from the previous year and a 6.3% reduction compared with 2016, the base year. The decrease in Shell's NCI in 2023 was mainly achieved through a reduction in the average intensity of power sold and the use of carbon credits. The power intensity reduction was driven mainly by progress in grid decarbonisation in key markets such as the USA and Europe, and partly by increased sales of renewable power, including the retirement of Renewable Energy Certificates.

Carbon credits such as nature-based solutions can be used to offset     remaining carbon emissions, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors such as     aviation and industries including cement and steel. We undertake external verification of our GHG emissions annually. Our Scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions from assets and activities under our operational control and emissions associated with the use of our energy products (Scope 3) included in our NCI have been verified to a level of limited assurance. Ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products We have set a new ambition to reduce customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 15-20% by 2030 compared with 2021 (Scope 3, Category 11). That is more than 40% compared with 2016 reported emissions. [A] This level of ambition is in line with the European Union's climate goals in the transport sector, among the most progressive in the world. Achieving this ambition will mean reducing sales of oil products, such as petrol and diesel, as we support customers as they move to electric mobility and lower- carbon fuels, including natural gas, LNG and biofuels. [A] Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category 11) were 517 million tonnes carbon dioxide equivalent (CO(2)e) in 2023, 569 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2021 and 819 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2016. Of the 40% reduction by 2030, around 8 percentage points are related to volumes associated with additional contracts being classified as held for trading purposes, impacting reported volumes from 2020 onwards..

Shell supports the more ambitious goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit the rise in global average temperature this century to 1.5\\xB0C above pre- industrial levels. There is no established standard for aligning an energy supplier's decarbonisation targets and ambitions with the 1.5\\xB0C temperature goal of the Paris Agreement. For this reason, we have defined our net carbon intensity target using 1.5\\xB0C scenarios developed for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Sixth Assessment Report (AR6). We start with the complete set of 1.5\\xB0C scenarios [A] and then exclude scenarios which are too reliant on carbon removals or use of bioenergy before removing outliers. We then calculate an emissions intensity for each scenario which is comparable to our own net carbon intensity. Finally, we produce a 1.5\\xB0C pathway based on the reductions in emissions intensity over time. We have chosen to use a range instead of any individual scenario to better reflect the uncertainty of the energy transition.  A. These are the AR6 scenarios which have a greater than 50% likelihood of     limiting warming to 1.5\\xB0C with no or limited overshoot (C1) or of returning     warming to 1.5\\xB0C after a high overshoot (C2). Overshoot describes how much     the global temperature in a scenario exceeds 1.5\\xB0C before returning. We believe that using this pathway to set our targets demonstrates that they are aligned with the more ambitious 1.5\\xB0C goal of the Paris Agreement. This is illustrated in the chart below.

To achieve net zero, we will reduce emissions from our own operations, change the mix of the energy products we sell and grow new carbon removal and abatement businesses. At the same time, we will work to help advance the critical factors required for the world to achieve net zero. Critical factors on the path to net zero The scale of the energy transition requires fundamental change in both supply and demand. It will take supportive government policies, advances in technology and investments by companies across all parts of the economy to achieve this. We advocate policies, legislation and regulations in areas where we can best support the decarbonisation of our customers, reduce our own emissions and help accelerate the energy transition. To help stimulate demand, we are investing in scaling up low-carbon solutions so that they become an affordable choice for our customers. Through partnerships with start-ups and leading academic institutions, we are also helping to develop the technologies of the future that will be critical to achieving net zero such as direct air capture, renewable hydrogen and heat and power storage solutions. Multi-energy business There remains significant uncertainty around the shape of the future energy system. As a result, we are developing a multi-energy portfolio that has the flexibility to respond to uncertainty, and that will allow us to remain a successful business and achieve net-zero emissions. By 2050, we expect that low-carbon products and solutions will have grown to become a material part of our portfolio. These solutions will be in the form of sustainable biofuels as well as liquid synthetic products, such as synthetic kerosene for aviation, that will be created through new technologies. At the same time, we will have focused our oil and gas businesses on projects with higher margins and lower carbon emissions, while pairing these projects with carbon capture and storage to further reduce emissions. In addition to our energy sales, a core part of our future business will be helping customers to decarbonise in the sectors where we have competitive advantages, including by capturing carbon and storing it, or by using the carbon to produce low-carbon products such as hydrogen. While the journey to net zero will include significant challenges, it also presents many opportunities. Through the actions we are taking today, we are positioning Shell to deliver more value with less emissions as we transform into a net-zero emissions energy business.

It also needs to be a just transition, which means a fairer distribution of the costs and benefits of the world's transition to a net-zero emissions energy system. Shell aims to contribute to a just and inclusive transition by making a positive economic and social impact on communities, workers and customers. Closing the energy access gap Today, around 675 million people do not have access to electricity and 2.3 billion lack access to clean cooking facilities, according to the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs. Shell has pledged $200 million as part of a broader initiative to help people get access to energy in the near and medium term. The initiative aims to help millions of people in underserved communities in sub-Saharan Africa, India and South-east Asia get access to electricity and improved cooking conditions. Skills for the future As more jobs are created in renewable energy, it is important to provide workers with the opportunity to learn new skills. This requires robust dialogue and collaboration between governments, businesses and the workforce. We are aiming to help 15,000 people in the UK get jobs with a focus on the energy transition by 2035. Shell, together with its partners, is supporting the creation of two energy transition skills hubs in Scotland and one in Wales. The facilities, which are expected to open in 2024 and 2025, aim to provide people with skills for the future, such as in wind turbine maintenance and heat pump installation. In 2023, around 6,900 Shell employees - up from around 4,000 in 2022 - completed courses linked to the energy transition, including hydrogen production, carbon capture and storage, and greenhouse gas and energy management. We use our existing structures to expand social dialogue with employees, employee representative bodies, relevant local government agencies and communities to address the social aspects of the energy transition and to advance human rights and labour rights. Equal opportunities Equality of opportunity for groups that have been traditionally under- represented in energy is an important element of a just transition. Shell has set an ambition to become one of the most diverse and inclusive organisations in the world. This is embedded in our company strategy and applies to all parts of our business. We currently prioritise four areas: gender, race and ethnicity, LGBT+ and disability inclusion and enablement. Communities At our Pottendijk wind and solar power park in the Netherlands, which opened in 2023, we are sharing the proceeds from the renewable energy we generate. Over the next 16 years we expect to pay around $2 million into a community fund, which the municipality of Emmen will use as the community sees best. In Nigeria, Shell-funded investment company All On has agreed to invest $11 million in 25 mini-grid projects across the country. The company plans to supply affordable solar energy to communities that need it the most. Human rights, governments and industry Respecting human rights is an essential element of a just transition. Shell is committed to respecting human rights, as set out in the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the International Labour Organization's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work. Read more about our approach at shell.com/justtransition Climate governance Our governance framework is designed to effectively deliver on the energy transition ambitions and targets of our Powering Progress strategy, which seeks to deliver more value with less emissions. The Board reviews our energy transition strategy periodically and oversees its implementation and delivery. In 2023, the Board considered climate-related matters throughout the year, including the assessment of climate-related risks and the effectiveness of corresponding risk management activities. The Board also challenged and endorsed business plans, including consideration of major capital expenditures, acquisitions and divestments. Our remuneration policies are designed to challenge and support the Executive Committee (EC) to reduce net carbon emissions, while generating shareholder value. Energy transition targets were part of the 2023 annual bonus scorecard (15% weighting), applicable to the majority of Shell's employees, as well as the 2023 Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP) awards for senior executives (25% weighting) and the 2023 Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards for other employees (12.5% weighting), both vesting in 2026. Carbon management framework (CMF) We employ several processes across our organisation to ensure that management teams can effectively monitor and manage climate-related matters, including the delivery of Group carbon targets. These processes are supported by a combination of carbon management standards in projects, business growth forums where portfolio decisions are made, and capability development programmes. To drive delivery of carbon targets in the 2023 operating plan cycle, our net carbon intensity targets were translated into net absolute emissions budgets for each business. This enabled trade-offs within those budgets between emitting carbon and generating shareholder value. We also use carbon metrics (profitability per unit of carbon emitted) in decision-making when comparing different growth opportunities against each other. For the 2024 LTIP and PSP awards, \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" performance condition retains the same weightings as for 2023. The extent to which awards will vest will be based on a holistic assessment of progress towards reducing emissions from our operations and supporting our customers to reduce their emissions. This will be based on our journey to net-zero targets for our own operations of:   * Halving Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 2030 under operational control on a net     basis (2016 baseline);   * Eliminating routine flaring from upstream operations by 2025 [A]; and   * Maintaining methane emissions intensity below 0.2% and achieving near-zero     methane emissions by 2030. It will also be based on progress in developments that support the energy transition to 2030 and beyond, such as the development of our power business (including renewables), lower-carbon LNG, biofuels, electric vehicle charging, hydrogen and carbon capture and storage (CCS).  A. Subject to completion of the sale of SPDC. We will take into account progress towards achieving a 15-20% reduction in NCI by 2030 (2016 baseline) and a 15-20% reduction in customer emissions from the use of our oil products by 2030 (2021 baseline) [A]. We will also take into account Shell's wider performance in accelerating the energy transition, for example by demonstrating leadership and advocacy in standard setting, alongside any other factors that are considered material. In 2024, we have adjusted the energy transition measure in our annual scorecard in light of our energy transition strategy update. By doing this, we continued to align to Shell's strategic objective of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050, supporting a balanced energy transition by responsibly delivering the oil and gas people need today, while helping to build the clean energy system of the future. The metric \"Shell's journey in the energy transition\" in the annual bonus scorecard represents:   * LNG volumes - equity liquefaction;   * Reducing operational emissions - operational actions to reduce emissions in     support of our target to achieve a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emission     by 2030, on a net basis; and   * Supporting customer decarbonisation - electric vehicle charge point roll-     out.      A. Customer emissions from the use of our oil products (Scope 3, Category         11) were 517 million tonnes CO(2)e in 2023 and 569 million tonnes CO(2)e         in 2021. For further details see \"Governance of climate-related risks and opportunities\" in our Annual Report and Accounts 2023. Energy transition and advisory votes Shell offered its first Energy Transition Strategy for submission to a shareholder advisory vote at the 2021 Annual General Meeting. The vote offered shareholders an opportunity to engage with and support Shell's energy transition plans. Shell was one of the first companies in the world to introduce such a vote. In 2022 and 2023, Shell also offered an advisory vote on its progress in putting its energy transition plans into action in the previous year. Following engagements with institutional investors, we found that expectations around issues such as the inclusion of an absolute Scope 3 target influenced the voting decisions of many investors, rather than the progress report itself. As a result, going forward, the energy transition progress report will be part of the Annual Report and Accounts without an advisory vote, while the Energy Transition Strategy (this publication) will be updated and offered for an advisory vote at least every three years. Climate litigation Climate litigation Environmental activists continue to bring litigation against governments and companies for the effects of climate change on individuals and communities around the world. In the Netherlands, Shell is appealing a decision from the District Court of The Hague ordering us to reduce worldwide aggregate carbon emissions across Scope 1, 2 and 3 by net 45% by 2030, compared with 2019 levels. The order states that reductions in Scope 2 and 3 emissions should be on a \"significant best efforts basis\". We are appealing the decision because we do not believe this is the right solution for the energy transition. By focusing on one company, and only on the supply of energy rather than the demand for it, we believe the ruling is ineffective and even counterproductive in addressing climate change. It is not clear how Shell can be ordered to reduce the emissions it does not control from customers, who are not under a similar legal obligation to reduce their emissions. The court is also asking Shell to reduce emissions significantly faster than the EU, which has one of the most ambitious pathways in the world. Shell believes that by working together, with effective government policies, the world can help shift consumer demand to low-carbon products and develop the infrastructure and technology needed for the energy transition, while maintaining a secure and affordable supply of energy. Shell's appeal will be heard by the Dutch Court of Appeal in April 2024. As we wait for the outcome of the appeal, Shell is taking active steps to comply with the ruling. Climate standards and benchmarks Climate initiatives and benchmarks play a role in supporting Shell's efforts in the energy transition. They promote an ongoing dialogue between interested parties and highlight areas of progress against externally established criteria. Doing business in a clear, open way is a commitment we work hard to keep, and we promote transparency where possible throughout our industry. We continue to learn as we work to provide relevant information to key stakeholders groups. In doing so we work with a number of stakeholders including regulators, auditors, investors and non-governmental organisations. Our strategy and progress in the energy transition, as well as our efforts to increase transparency, are recognised across environmental, social and governance (ESG) frameworks. Over the years, our performance scores have improved consistently, as evidenced by the assessment done by various external parties, including the most recent analysis from the Carbon Tracker Initiative [A] which highlights Shell's good practices and key improvements in the financial related climate disclosures. ESG rating agencies [B]                     2020     2021     2022     2023 -----------------------------------------------------   MSCI               A        AA       AA       AA -----------------------------------------------------   Sustainalytics   36.8 H   35.1 H   34.7 H   33.7 H -----------------------------------------------------   ISS                C        C+       C+       C+ ----------------------------------------------------- ISS The ISS ESG net zero alignment model evaluates whether companies have a credible decarbonisation strategy, including interim greenhouse gas emissions targets and substantiated commitments to achieving net zero by 2050. Shell is one of eight companies in the oil and gas sector that received a net zero overall alignment status of \"aligning\" in 2023.  A. Flying Blind: In a Holding Pattern, Carbon Tracker Initiative, February 2024  B. MSCI: A score of AA and AAA indicates the company is leading its industry in     managing the most significant ESG risks and opportunities. Sustainalytics: A     lower score indicates a lower risk of experiencing material financial     impacts from ESG factors. ISS: Companies are rated on a 12-point scale from     A+ (best) to D-(worst). Climate Initiatives Transition Pathway Initiative The Transition Pathway Initiative (TPI) is a global, asset-owner led initiative which assesses companies' preparedness for the transition to a low-carbon economy. TPI assess a companies' performance and progress in the energy transition against internationally agreed benchmark. TPI's assessment is divided into two parts: management quality and carbon performance. Management quality describes a company's carbon management practices and governance, with a higher score indicating better performance. Carbon performance compares a company's emissions pathway against different climate scenarios consistent with the Paris Agreement. The carbon performance scores indicate whether a company's targets and plans are aligned in the short- term (2025), medium term (2035), and long-term (2050). In terms of management quality, in 2023, we received the highest score of four (strategic assessment) for the management of our greenhouse gas emissions, and of risks and opportunities related to the low-carbon transition. This exceeds the average score of 3.2 across all assessed companies in the oil and gas sector (90) In relation to carbon performance, although Shell's goal of becoming a net-zero emissions energy business by 2050 remains unchanged, TPI no longer considers this target to be aligned with its 1.5\\xB0C benchmark. This is the result of TPI's approach to accounting for customer mitigation actions. Climate Action 100+ Climate Action 100+ is an investor-led initiative that drives corporate action on climate change, representing investors with assets of around $68 trillion. Its net zero company benchmark assesses companies against three?high-level goals set by investors: emissions reduction, governance, and climate-related disclosures. It tracks business alignment with a net-zero emissions future and the Paris Agreement goal of limiting global temperature rise to 1.5\\xB0C. The disclosure framework evaluates the adequacy of corporate disclosure in relation to key actions companies can take to align with the goals of the Paris Agreement, and is assessed by the Transition Pathway Initiative. The latest results for Shell are shown below, based on publicly disclosed information as of May 29, 2023.   Disclosure framework             2022   2023 -----------------------------------------------   Yes, meets all criteria             5      2 -----------------------------------------------   Partial, meets some criteria        3      7 -----------------------------------------------   No, does not meet any criteria      1      1 ----------------------------------------------- We are disappointed to see that our ratings have deteriorated in some areas in the latest assessment, which is largely due to annual updates to the methodology used. We have a strong governance and commitment to transparency so that investors can continue to assess our climate strategy and compare our progress with that of other companies. We will continue our engagement with CA100+ and TPI with the aim of ensuring that our current targets and disclosures are reflected in their benchmark and hope we can continue to improve the outcome in their assessment. Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Since 2017, Shell has supported the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD). The TCFD is a global initiative to get companies across all sectors to assess climate-related risks and opportunities. It recommends disclosure of qualitative and quantitative information aligned to its four core elements: governance, strategy, risk management, and metrics and targets. Our climate-related financial disclosures are consistent with all the TCFD's Recommendations and Recommended Disclosures. Please refer to our Annual Report and Accounts 2023 for more details. Shell's disclosures related to recommendations by the TCFD are set out in the \"Our journey to achieving net zero\" section of the Annual Report. Cautionary note The companies in which Shell plc directly and indirectly owns investments are separate legal entities. In this report \"Shell\", \"Shell Group\" and \"Group\" are sometimes used for convenience where references are made to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general. Likewise, the words \"we\", \"us\" and \"our' are also used to refer to Shell plc and its subsidiaries in general or to those who work for them. These terms are also used where no useful purpose is served by identifying the particular entity or entities. \"Subsidiaries\", \"Shell subsidiaries\" and \"Shell companies\" as used in this report refer to entities over which Shell plc either directly or indirectly has control. The term \"joint venture\", \"joint operations\", \"joint arrangements\", and \"associates\" may also be used to refer to a commercial arrangement in which Shell has a direct or indirect ownership interest with one or more parties. The term \"Shell interest\" is used for convenience to indicate the direct and/or indirect ownership interest held by Shell in an entity or unincorporated joint arrangement, after exclusion of all third-party interest. Forward-looking statements This report contains forward-looking statements (within the meaning of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995) concerning the financial condition, results of operations and businesses of Shell. All statements other than statements of historical fact are, or may be deemed to be, forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements of future expectations that are based on management's current expectations and assumptions and involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results, performance or events to differ materially from those expressed or implied in these statements. Forward-looking statements include, among other things, statements concerning the potential exposure of Shell to market risks and statements expressing management's expectations, beliefs, estimates, forecasts, projections and assumptions. These forward-looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as \"aim\", \"ambition\", \"anticipate\", \"believe\", \"could\", \"estimate\", \"expect\", \"goals\", \"intend\", \"may\", \"milestones\", \"objectives\", \"outlook\", \"plan\", \"probably\", \"project\", \"risks\", \"schedule\", \"seek\", \"should\", \"target\", \"will\" and similar terms and phrases. There are a number of factors that could affect the future operations of Shell and could cause those results to differ materially from those expressed in the forward-looking statements included in this report, including (without limitation): (a) price fluctuations in crude oil and natural gas; (b) changes in demand for Shell's products; (c) currency fluctuations; (d) drilling and production results; (e) reserves estimates; (f) loss of market share and industry competition; (g) environmental and physical risks; (h) risks associated with the identification of suitable potential acquisition properties and targets, and successful negotiation and completion of such transactions; (i) the risk of doing business in developing countries and countries subject to international sanctions; (j) legislative, judicial, fiscal and regulatory developments including regulatory measures addressing climate change; (k) economic and financial market conditions in various countries and regions; (l) political risks, including the risks of expropriation and renegotiation of the terms of contracts with governmental entities, delays or advancements in the approval of projects and delays in the reimbursement for shared costs; (m) risks associated with the impact of pandemics, such as the COVID-19 (coronavirus) outbreak, regional conflicts, such as Russia's invasion of Ukraine, and a significant cybersecurity breach; and (n) changes in trading conditions. No assurance is provided that future dividend payments will match or exceed previous dividend payments. All forward-looking statements contained in this report are expressly qualified in their entirety by the cautionary statements contained or referred to in this section. Readers should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements. Additional risk factors that may affect future results are contained in Shell plc's Form 20-F for the year ended December 31, 2023 (available at shell.com/investors/news-and-filings/sec- filings.html and sec.gov). These risk factors also expressly qualify all forward-looking statements contained in this report and should be considered by the reader. Each forward-looking statement speaks only as of the date of this report, March 14, 2024. Neither Shell plc nor any of its subsidiaries undertake any obligation to publicly update or revise any forward-looking statement as a result of new information, future events or other information. In light of these risks, results could differ materially from those stated, implied or inferred from the forward-looking statements contained in this report. Shell's net carbon intensity Also, in this report we may refer to Shell's \"net carbon intensity\", which includes Shell's carbon emissions from the production of our energy products, our suppliers' carbon emissions in supplying energy for that production and our customers' carbon emissions associated with their use of the energy products we sell. Shell only controls its own emissions. The use of the term Shell's \"net carbon intensity\" is for convenience only and not intended to suggest these emissions are those of Shell plc or its subsidiaries. Shell's net-zero emissions target Shell's operating plan, outlook and budgets are forecasted for a ten-year period and are updated every year. They reflect the current economic environment and what we can reasonably expect to see over the next ten years. Accordingly, they reflect our Scope 1, Scope 2 and Net Carbon Intensity (NCI) targets over the next ten years. However, Shell's operating plans cannot reflect our 2050 net- zero emissions target, as this target is currently outside our planning period.In the future, as society moves towards net-zero emissions, we expect Shell's operating plans to reflect this movement. However, if society is not net zero in 2050, as of today, there would be significant risk that Shell may not meet this target. Forward-looking non-GAAP measures This report may contain certain forward-looking non-GAAP measures such as [cash capital expenditure] and [divestments]. We are unable to provide a reconciliation of these forward-looking Non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures because certain information needed to reconcile those non-GAAP measures to the most comparable GAAP financial measures is dependent on future events some of which are outside the control of Shell, such as oil and gas prices, interest rates and exchange rates. Moreover, estimating such GAAP measures with the required precision necessary to provide a meaningful reconciliation is extremely difficult and could not be accomplished without unreasonable effort. Non-GAAP measures in respect of future periods which cannot be reconciled to the most comparable GAAP financial measure are calculated in a manner which is consistent with the accounting policies applied in Shell plc's consolidated financial statements. The contents of websites referred to in this report do not form part of this report. We may have used certain terms, such as resources, in this report that the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) strictly prohibits us from including in our filings with the SEC. Investors are urged to consider closely the disclosure in our Form 20-F, File No 1-32575, available on the SEC website sec.gov. Additional information As used in this Report, \"accountable\" is intended to mean: required or expected to justify actions or decisions. The accountable person does not necessarily implement the action or decision (implementation is usually carried out by the person who is Responsible) but must organise the implementation and verify that the action has been carried out as required. This includes obtaining requisite assurance from Shell companies that the framework is operating effectively. \"Responsible\" is intended to mean: required or expected to implement actions or decisions. Each Shell company and Shell-operated venture is responsible for its operational performance and compliance with the Shell General Business Principles, Code of Conduct, Statement on Risk Management and Risk Manual, and Standards and Manuals. This includes responsibility for the operationalisation and implementation of Shell Group strategies and policies. CO(2) compensation does not imply that there is no environmental impact from the production and use of the product as associated emissions remain in the atmosphere. CO(2) compensation is not a substitute for switching to lower emission energy solutions or reducing the use of fossil fuels. Shell businesses focus first on emissions that can be avoided or reduced and only then, compensate the remaining emissions. \"carbon neutral\" or \"CO(2) compensated\" indicates that Shell will engage in a transaction where an amount of CO(2 )equivalent to the value of the remaining CO(2)e emissions associated with the raw material extraction, transport, production, distribution and usage /end-of-life (if Lubricants or other non-energy product) of the product are compensated through the purchase and retirement of carbon credits generated from CO(2) compensation projects. Although these carbon credits have been generated in accordance with international carbon standards, the compensation may not be exact. CO(2)e( CO(2) equivalent) refers to CO(2), CH(4), N(2)O.

Under the agreement, Climeworks will remove more than 7,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide\u00a0(CO2) from the atmosphere on Partners Group?s behalf, which will be permanently stored underground. The DAC agreement with Climeworks is a significant step for Partners Group, which announced in 2022 that it would develop a decarbonization program to achieve net zero corporate greenhouse gas (?GHG?) emissions by 2030. While a priority of the program will be to reduce the firm?s overall emissions, removing residual emissions via capture and storage of atmospheric CO2 will also play a role in achieving the net zero goal. The agreement with Climeworks is Partners Group?s first adoption of a technology-based solution to address GHG emissions and sits alongside the firm?s growing portfolio of nature-based solutions, such as reforestation, which also contribute to enhancing biodiversity.  Partners Group co-led a CHF 600 million fundraising round in Climeworks in 2022 on behalf of its clients. As it\u00a0does with all portfolio companies, the firm is currently working with the Climeworks management team and other investors with a focus on addressing the massive scale up the industry requires.  David Layton, Partner and Chief Executive Officer, Partners Group, comments: ?The agreement with Climeworks reflects Partners Group?s focus on sustainability and its commitment to achieving positive stakeholder impact over the long term. Our aim is to be a sustainability leader in private markets by driving forward positive change at the companies under our stewardship, and also by playing a leading corporate role in the transition to a net zero global economy.? Christoph Gebald, co-founder and co-CEO, Climeworks, says: ?We are proud to welcome our investor Partners Group as a client and to support their journey toward net zero. High-quality carbon removal must be scaled to gigaton level by 2050, and multi-year agreements like this one are a crucial lever. Partners Group?s commitment to high-quality carbon removals underlines the leading role of the financial services industry in this scale-up. As one of the global leaders in private markets, Partners Group sends a strong signal, which will hopefully inspire more companies to take action on carbon removal.? Climeworks? DAC technology actively removes CO2 from the atmosphere in a scalable manner, which can\u00a0then be permanently stored\u00a0underground. In Iceland, where Climeworks operates the world?s largest DAC facility and storage installation in operation, called Orca, its air-captured CO2 is mixed with water and pumped underground, where, through the Carbfix method, it reacts with basaltic rock formations and mineralizes. Through this accelerated natural process, the CO2 turns into stone and is permanently removed from the air for thousands of years. This full DAC and storage process is third-party verified by an independent quality and assurance leader. In 2022, Climeworks broke ground on a second, larger plant in the same country, called Mammoth, which represents a demonstratable step in the Company?s ambitious scale-up plan.

Under the agreement, Climeworks will remove more than 7,000 metric tons of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere on Partners Group's behalf, which will be permanently stored underground.  The DAC agreement with Climeworks is a significant step for Partners Group, which announced in 2022 that it would develop a decarbonization program to achieve net zero corporate greenhouse gas (\"GHG\") emissions by 2030. While a priority of the program will be to reduce the firm's overall emissions, removing residual emissions via capture and storage of atmospheric CO2 will also play a role in achieving the net zero goal. The agreement with Climeworks is Partners Group's first adoption of a technology-based solution to address GHG emissions and sits alongside the firm's growing portfolio of nature-based solutions, such as reforestation, which also contribute to enhancing biodiversity.  Partners Group co-led a CHF 600 million fundraising round in Climeworks in 2022 on behalf of its clients. As it does with all portfolio companies, the firm is currently working with the Climeworks management team and other investors with a focus on addressing the massive scale up the industry requires.  David Layton, Partner and Chief Executive Officer, Partners Group, comments: \"The agreement with Climeworks reflects Partners Group's focus on sustainability and its commitment to achieving positive stakeholder impact over the long term. Our aim is to be a sustainability leader in private markets by driving forward positive change at the companies under our stewardship, and also by playing a leading corporate role in the transition to a net zero global economy.\"  Christoph Gebald, co-founder and co-CEO, Climeworks, says: \"We are proud to welcome our investor Partners Group as a client and to support their journey toward net zero. High-quality carbon removal must be scaled to gigaton level by 2050, and multi-year agreements like this one are a crucial lever. Partners Group's commitment to high-quality carbon removals underlines the leading role of the financial services industry in this scale-up. As one of the global leaders in private markets, Partners Group sends a strong signal, which will hopefully inspire more companies to take action on carbon removal.\"  Climeworks' DAC technology actively removes CO2 from the atmosphere in a scalable manner, which can then be permanently stored underground. In Iceland, where Climeworks operates the world's largest DAC facility and storage installation in operation, called Orca, its air-captured CO2 is mixed with water and pumped underground, where, through the Carbfix method, it reacts with basaltic rock formations and mineralizes. Through this accelerated natural process, the CO2 turns into stone and is permanently removed from the air for thousands of years. This full DAC and storage process is third-party verified by an independent quality and assurance leader. In 2022, Climeworks broke ground on a second, larger plant in the same country, called Mammoth, which represents a demonstratable step in the Company's ambitious scale-up plan.

Projections show that a sizable part of South Asia will experience heat stress conditions.India has already been witnessing above-average temperatures this winter season, with its hottest February in well over a century and the India Meteorological Department (IMD) forecasting enhanced probability of heat waves between March and May. Summer seems to come earlier every year in India, with the average daytime temperature as much as 3.4 degrees Celsius above the norm while central India recorded its second warmest February with the average maximum temperature more than 2 degrees Celsius higher than normal. Above normal maximum temperatures are likely over most parts of northeast India, east and central India and some parts of northwest India from March to May, the IMD said in a statement. Experts predict tougher times with an increased heat wave probability during the upcoming summer season. </p><p>The bigger problem is the threat of crop damage. The maximum temperature in some wheat growing areas such as Rajasthan soared above 39 degrees Celsius (102 degrees Fahrenheit) earlier this month, nearly 7 C (12.6 F) above normal, according to IMD data. Last year, for instance, India recorded its hottest March, which triggered an early onslaught of heat waves,engulfing several states across northern, central and eastern regions for two months. The country then reported 280 heat wave days between March 11 and May 18. &amp;#39;A disaster in the making&amp;#39; Experts are highlighting La Nina as a cause for the heat, which refers to the periodic cooling of ocean surface temperatures in the central and east-central equatorial Pacific that affects global weather patterns. The summer of 2023 is a disaster in the making that will feature an unprecedented heat wave due to a weak western disturbance and the prevailing La Nina condition, Abinash Mohanty, sector head of climate change and sustainability at IPE-Global, an international development organization, told DW. Mohanty pointed out that climatological and meteorological conditions coupled with unsustainable anthropocentric activities are causing harsher heat waves that will severely affect food chains. Earlier this week, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) launched its synthesis report on the climate crisis saying that despite progress in policies and legislation around climate mitigation since the previous such report in 2014, it is likely that warming will exceed 1.5 C during the 21st century. This year has already witnessed anomalies in February, and an enhanced probability prediction by IMD suggests that the situation is going to be tougher in the coming months, said Mohanty. Akshay Deoras, a meteorologist at the UK&amp;#39;s National Centre for Atmospheric Science and the Department of Meteorology, said early heat waves do not necessarily mean more frequent and intense heat waves. While the official forecast suggests an enhanced probability of heat waves over central and northwestern parts of India during March to May, some models disagree, Deoras told DW. Extreme weather events becoming the norm Given models have a varying prediction skill, we cannot be sure right now about the enhanced probability of heat waves this season. It is important to remember that the frequency, intensity, and duration of potential individual heat waves in a season cannot be predicted, added Deoras. Scientists and meteorologists assert that changes in temperature and rainfall in India will add to the current water stress in the country. More importantly, premature rains could damage winter-sown crops, such as wheat, rapeseed and chickpeas, just before harvesting begins. According to a study by the Indian Institute of Technology Gandhinagar (IIT), the frequency of severe heat waves in India will increase 30-fold by 2100. Under a business-as-usual scenario, heat wave frequency might increase 75-fold. If temperatures continue to rise and monsoon rainfall patterns continue to change, the country could see a GDP loss of 2.8%, depressing the living standards of nearly half its population by 2050, according to a World Bank report in 2018. Sounding a dire warning, the report said almost half of South Asia&amp;#39;s population, including India, now lives in vulnerable areas and will suffer from declining living standards that could be attributed to falling agricultural yields, lower labor productivity or related health impacts. Based in New Delhi, the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE), a public interest research and advocacy non-profit organization, said the localized climate disasters, on 241 of 273 days until October last year, had claimed at least 2,755 lives, while affecting some 1.8 million hectares of crop area, killing more than 69,000 livestock, and destroying 416,667 houses. Feeding and powering a heat-stressed India calls for impact-based heat wave early warning, promoting ways and means to restore the fissured landscapes through nature-based solutions. This can make agri-food systems heat stress ready, followed by a fast-tracked renewable energy deployment across the heat-wave hotspots, stressed Mohanty from IPE-Global. Heat waves are termed the silent disaster as heat-related deaths are often undercounted around the world, according to the World Weather Attribution Network. From the last few years, it is increasingly clear that India is among the most vulnerable countries when it comes to climate change. Experts argue that the country&amp;#39;s early warning system needs to become more robust.

(OFP), a pioneering open forest measurement, reporting and verification platform built on a carbon neutral blockchain, today announced it has raised USD 4.1 million in a recently closed pre-seed round, attracting some 17 investors groups including venture capitalists and angel investors. VC tech specialists such as Shima Capital, \u00dcbermorgen Ventures, Not Boring Capital, Mercy Corps Ventures, Byzantine Marine, Big Brain Holdings and Valor Capital have joined with a number of angel investors in supporting the platform. Founded in 2021, OFP is already working with some  projects worldwide through its revolutionary blockchain-based measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) technology. These projects will be the first in history to utilize OFP?s 100% blockchain-native MRV platform. Open Forest Protocol is an open platform allowing forest projects of any size, all over the world, to measure, report and verify their forestation data ? thus creating benefits all along the value chain, from local communities on the ground to the voluntary carbon market. Funds raised are being used to continue to build and ship the core infrastructure of the system and to ramp up the onboarding of projects across governments, NGOs and individuals. Founded by Swiss scientist Frederic Fournier and American web3 specialist Michael Kelly, OFP brings together an international team of passionate and skilled professionals to combine expertise in environment, climate and blockchain. Prior to raising a pre-seed, OFP?s original funding came from a single angel contributor. OFP Project, Green Balam Forests, with the Forester data collection app in the field in Guatemala Carbon neutral blockchain technology OFP gives decentralized agency to forest projects of any size to measure, report and verify their forestation data on the Proof of Stake (PoS), climate neutral NEAR blockchain by registering their forest project within OFP?s open-access platform. Projects record tree data within the forest using OFP?s mobile app and then send the information to be immutably stored in the open, blockchain-based registry. In what has been an expensive, exclusive, opaque and slow system which unfortunately excludes the majority of potential projects and local communities, OFP?s innovative approach is a validator network whose sole responsibility is to ensure that only valid, verifiable data passes through. This network coalesces around the ground truth data provided to the platform, and stress-tests it against the unique capabilities, data sets and technologies that validators have access to. As a result, every single data set is ultimately reviewed by dozens of entities such as validation/verification bodies (VVBs) and forest expert companies in remote sensing, environmental consulting, etc. Fred Fournier, Open Forest Protocol CEO, said: ?The strong support of investors experienced in our pre-seed round is a validation of both our vision and strategy. Only an equitable, truthful system backed by immutable, open data will truly value forests on the ground as well as in the voluntary carbon market. We must act together to fight for our planet and give value to nature.? ABOUT OPEN FOREST PROTOCOL Open Forest Protocol is an open forest measurement, reporting and verification platform built on a carbon neutral blockchain. As a public protocol, OFP has its legal seat in Zug, Switzerland, a team of developers in Ukraine, on the ground specialists in East Africa and Central America, engineers and economists in the USA, legal and managing execs in Western and Northern Europe. # # # Media contacts: U.S. &amp;

On the one hand, they are already being severely impacted; on the other, they have few technological or financial resources to carry out mitigation or adaptation measures. However, there are also many opportunities in sustainable economic growth with fewer emissions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In its 2020 report, the World Economic Forum coined the term 'New Nature Economy'. The idea is to reduce the resources a society needs to achieve prosperity, thereby protecting ecosystems.</p><p>New Nature Economy offers a broad spectrum of new business models that use innovative technology and attract private capital. Some are already successful. Ecotourism, a responsible and sustainable way to travel, is one well-known example. Various market research studies estimated the market size of ecotourism at around $ 180 billion in 2019, with an annual growth rate of approximately 10 to 15 %.</p><p>Insects as a source of protein</p><p>Another example is breeding insects as an alternative protein source for humans and animals. Edible insects have a similarly high protein content as meat, but rearing them uses significantly less space and energy compared to other livestock. At the moment they remain a niche product, but in the past two years, three insect species were approved for human consumption in the EU.</p><p>'Zero waste' has become a slogan on social media. This is how bakeries are springing up that bake fresh bread from old - and textile factories that recycle cotton and turn it into new clothes. Apps that broker leftover food from restaurants help to reduce food waste and thus protect the environment. Nature-based solutions like purifying water through plant-based purification systems are attracting the interest of investors. According to estimates by the World Economic Forum, the business potential of New Nature Economy is $ 10.1 trillion annually by 2030. It could also create 395 million jobs.</p><p>The advantage of digitalisation and technology</p><p>Based on these examples, it's clear that technologies will play a leading role in the transformation to New Nature Economy. Technological advances present a major opportunity for low-income countries. They can base their growth on significantly improved technologies, whereas industrialised countries often underwent the Industrial Revolution at the expense of the environment.</p><p>According to the German Institute of Development and Sustainability (IDOS), the swift increase in emissions in low-income countries can primarily be attributed to their rising energy needs, which at the moment are still largely being covered by fossil fuels.</p><p>For a long time, high transition costs were a serious impediment to the development of renewable energies in these countries. However, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) reports that these costs have dropped significantly over the last decade, partly due to improved technologies and competitive supply chains. For example, the IRENA database shows that the cost of electricity from photovoltaic plants dropped by 85 % between 2010 and 2020, while the cost of concentrated solar power fell by 68 % and wind power by 56 % (onshore) and 48 % (offshore).</p><p>This trend is expected to continue for the foreseeable future. Clean energy is now not only affordable, but often even more competitive than fossil fuels. The transition to renewable energy sources offers enormous potential for economically weak countries - both in terms of saving costs and emissions.</p><p>However, there are some points to consider so that renewable energies can really make the greatest possible contribution to sustainable business. For example, the production of building components for renewable energy infrastructure itself requires a great deal of energy and materials. It is important to ensure that this process leaves as small a carbon footprint as possible.</p><p>The performance of power plants based on renewable energies is strongly dependent on weather conditions. For that reason, technological innovations are essential in this area to further boost storage capacity and diversify the energy mix. They are the only way to mitigate fluctuations in electricity production due to unfavourable weather conditions.</p><p>Furthermore, social and ecological aspects must be taken into account in the planning and realisation of such power plants in order to reconcile the interests of all those involved and affected. For example, people who are to be resettled because of the construction of a hydropower plant must be fairly compensated. In the case of projects like offshore wind parks or tidal power plants, the protection of marine life must be ensured.</p><p>Smart farms and driverless trucks</p><p>In addition to the transition of energy sources, digitalisation and the use of smart climate technologies is another factor for green growth, emission reduction and the mitigation of climate risks. A 2020 study by the German digital association Bitkom shows that digital technologies could save up to 20 % of global greenhouse gas emissions. The greatest potential can be found in the energy, building, mobility and transportation sectors, as well as in agriculture and industry.</p><p>Innumerable innovations are already on the way. In the logistics sector, driverless electric trucks can increase the efficiency of goods transport and reduce emissions at the same time. Thanks to the quick growth of network capacity and available data, driverless trucks can find the best route, analyse traffic situations and communicate with other vehicles. Thus they can avoid traffic jams and accidents and deliver their goods more efficiently. The use of electric vehicles lowers fossil fuel consumption, and an improved traffic flow raises the quality of life, increases traffic safety and reduces emissions.</p><p>Smart farming has become a reality as well. Digital devices can analyse weather conditions, monitor plant growth, improve irrigation efficiency and reduce groundwater consumption. Drones that spray fertiliser, for example, raise dosing accuracy, lower fertiliser consumption and therefore also emissions from fertiliser production.</p><p>Intelligent building technologies have been monitoring energy consumption in homes for some time and network technical devices there. For example, they control shading, heating and cooling systems as well as lighting and can thus optimise energy consumption.</p><p>GreenTechs like Husk Power Systems are playing an increasing role in the energy sector as well. With financial support from the German development financier DEG, Husk develops and operates low-cost hybrid power plants based on renewable energies in Nigeria and India. These so-called mini-grids make it possible to use appliances such as refrigerators, fans or water treatment plants. They are a series of electricity generators and, possibly, energy storage systems that are operated as a single system and connected to a distribution grid that provides localised electricity.</p><p>However, according to the Bitkom study mentioned above, 1.8 to 3.2 % of global greenhouse gas emissions are caused by the production of digital devices and the operation of digital infrastructure. Therefore, it is also important for digital solutions to find a healthy balance through climate-friendly hardware production and an optimised energy mix for the high energy demand of data centres and networks.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP0604202300001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6802-PMS1-F00C-62HC-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-04-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1225\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"06\" month=\"04\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>April 6, 2023 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

VC tech specialists such as Shima Capital, \\xDCbermorgen Ventures, Not Boring Capital, Mercy Corps Ventures, Byzantine Marine, Big Brain Holdings and Valor Capital have joined with a number of angel investors in supporting the platform. Founded in 2021, OFP is already working with some 40 afforestation/reforestation projects worldwide through its revolutionary blockchain-based measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) technology. These projects will be the first in history to utilize OFP's 100% blockchain-native MRV platform.  Open Forest Protocol is an open platform allowing forest projects of any size, all over the world, to measure, report and verify their forestation data - thus creating benefits all along the value chain, from local communities on the ground to the voluntary carbon market.  Funds raised are being used to continue to build and ship the core infrastructure of the system and to ramp up the onboarding of projects across governments, NGOs and individuals.  Founded by Swiss scientist Frederic Fournier and American web3 specialist Michael Kelly, OFP brings together an international team of passionate and skilled professionals to combine expertise in environment, climate and blockchain. Prior to raising a pre-seed, OFP's original funding came from a single angel contributor.

Projects record tree data within the forest using OFP's mobile app and then send the information to be immutably stored in the open, blockchain-based registry.  In what has been an expensive, exclusive, opaque and slow system which unfortunately excludes the majority of potential projects and local communities, OFP's innovative approach is a validator network whose sole responsibility is to ensure that only valid, verifiable data passes through. This network coalesces around the ground truth data provided to the platform, and stress-tests it against the unique capabilities, data sets and technologies that validators have access to. As a result, every single data set is ultimately reviewed by dozens of entities such as validation/verification bodies (VVBs) and forest expert companies in remote sensing, environmental consulting, etc.  Fred Fournier, Open Forest Protocol CEO, said: \"The strong support of investors experienced in our pre-seed round is a validation of both our vision and strategy. Only an equitable, truthful system backed by immutable, open data will truly value forests on the ground as well as in the voluntary carbon market. We must act together to fight for our planet and give value to nature.\"  ABOUT OPEN FOREST PROTOCOL  Open Forest Protocol is an open forest measurement, reporting and verification platform built on a carbon neutral blockchain. As a public protocol, OFP has its legal seat in Zug, Switzerland, a team of developers in Ukraine, on the ground specialists in East Africa and Central America, engineers and economists in the USA, legal and managing execs in Western and Northern Europe.

This includes ensuring access to safe and healthy food and targeting novel microbial-based solutions to improve nutrition, enhance wellness and reduce disease.</p><p>The e[datascientist] (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.eaglegenomics.com/what-we-do/e-datascientist-platform\">https://www.eaglegenomics.com/what-we-do/e-datascientist-platform</url>) (TM) is a platform powered by network science1 and multilayer hypergraphs2, applying machine learning and artificial intelligence to provide a data-driven insight journey into solving complex problems and delivering greater impact in climate resilience, improving plant nutrient density, and increasing data-driven wellness and human health outcomes.</p><p>The platform integrates active learning at every step of the microbiome innovation journey, from characterising and describing microbiomes, to a better understanding of complex causal mechanisms to elucidating host-microbiome interactions. Eagle Genomics is reinventing life sciences research and development by bridging the 'translation gap,' enabling scientific knowledge from a range of disparate sources and data sets to be integrated and analyzed through the e[datascientist] platform to create novel hypotheses and deliver robust, scientifically underpinned practical solutions.</p><p>\"We are energised to partner with ICRISAT, which has over half a century of experience in improving dryland agri-food systems across the poorest communities of the world from which we can draw valuable data and explore the pressing questions of our time that remain unanswered.</p><p>\"This promises enormous consequences for both public policies to incentivize private sector investment in new initiatives, and measures to address global challenges, that are jointly good for humanity and a corporation's bottom line.</p><p>\"Just as the digital revolution has brought new opportunities and improved our world, so can the Bio Revolution - towards which we are working with ICRISAT alongside other partners,\" said Anthony Finbow.</p><p>Sharing Knowledge for More World Firsts Director General ICRISAT, Dr Jacqueline Hughes said the MOU would see ICRISAT share datasets with Eagle Genomics, drawing upon extensive on-the-ground experience in Asia and Africa that had led to several agricultural world firsts. These include developing early maturing groundnut as well as high iron biofortified pearl millet, innovations that have directly responded to the challenges posed by climate change. This new partnership offers an opportunity to address, and even leapfrog beyond, the Sustainable Development Goals to drive science-based targets for regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\"The efficacy of our interventions both past and emerging and on which some 2.2. billion people depend, will increasingly depend on informed data-driven decisions in an increasingly complex world.</p><p>\"This partnership will advance an understanding of microbiome interactions - from soil, to plant, to farm, to fork, to gut, to health, and their relationship with our food system and offer new approaches to sequester carbon efficiently, enhance nitrogen and phosphate availability for plants, reduce soil erosion and flooding and improve crop and community resilience to climate change and climatic events. Furthermore, it will provide meaningful nature-based metrics to enhance our understanding of regenerative impact from a biological standpoint.</p><p>\"Increasing the nutrient density in our food through enhancement of microbiomes will help ensure ICRISAT's mandate crops can address food security and malnutrition, in populations living in drought-prone dryland areas.</p><p>\"I am delighted that our collaboration with Eagle Genomics, and the strength they bring to our high-calibre partnerships, will advance our mission of reducing poverty, hunger and malnutrition for the world's poor,\" said Dr Hughes .</p><p>At the conclusion of the signing, ICRISAT and Eagle Genomics applauded the Innovations for Drylands Conference. They said that the MOU would help underpin next-generation innovation to safeguard the lives and livelihoods of the over two billion people living in the drylands of Asia, Africa and beyond. It will contribute to safe and nutritious food for all, through a shift to sustainable consumption and nature-positive production systems that can drive One Health outcomes for humans, animals, and the environment.</p><p>Notes</p><p>1.

Experts from around the are involved. On 6 and 7 October this year, the focus will be on how climate and biodiversity protection are interrelated. To support the event, KfW is publishing a supplement in D+C/E+Z. We will post the contributions on our website. The first item is an interview with Svenja Schulze, Germany's Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to your ministry, biodiversity loss is the second global crisis the world faces after climate change. Based on this, the future of humanity also critically depends on global biodiversity. Why?</p><p>Without fertile soil, air to breathe, clean drinking water and natural resources, we can't survive, and all these things are only possible with intact ecosystems. They feed us, protect us from natural disasters and protect us from the many effects of the climate crisis. At the same time, biodiversity is suffering massively from the consequences of climate change. The climate is changing too quickly - species and ecosystems don't follow suit. This is a vicious cycle - one we urgently need to break. Development for all people, climate change mitigation and the preservation of biodiversity must be carried out in harmony. This is a challenge that I have already dealt with as Federal Minister for the Environment and on which I can now continue to work in concrete terms as Minister for Development. Our work determines the future of the planet.</p><p>Every day, up to 150 animal and plant species disappear from the earth. Why is this relevant to people's lives?</p><p>Species are dying at a pace not seen in human history. The animal and plant species affected are irrevocably lost. However, each species has an important function in an ecosystem, and with each species lost, the likelihood of the system collapsing increases. The consequences are dramatic. We are already seeing the harbingers: the hunger crisis, conflicts over scarce water, increasing heat.</p><p>The effects are putting a strain on all of us, but particularly on poor countries and vulnerable population groups - especially indigenous peoples and local communities. Their natural livelihoods are being lost and conflicts over resources are increasing. This is particularly unfair, as vulnerable population groups have contributed least to the causes of biodiversity loss.</p><p>Today, international attention is primarily focused on the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus crisis. How can more willingness to act and awareness of problems for climate change mitigation and the preservation of biodiversity be re-established worldwide?</p><p>I see it differently: Climate change mitigation receives a good deal of attention - in this Federal Government, but also in the population. Everyone is experiencing it. Climate change does not take a break, even in times of war. We just experienced a summer in Europe hotter than ever before. We are working decisively towards a liveable future for our and future generations. Climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation were top issues at the G7 meeting at Elmau Castle. At all levels, we are currently working on a successful global climate change conference in Sharm El Sheikh in November and a new global framework for biodiversity conservation, which will be decided at the UN nature summit in Montreal in December.</p><p>There are always conflicts between conservation and the fight against climate change, for example in the energy transition when building wind turbines. How can the two be combined in partner countries?</p><p>Of course, there are conflicting objectives. The partner countries deal with the same issues we do in that respect. A good balance between protection and sustainable use is necessary. The solutions are also similar, for example, checking environmental compatibility, determining environmentally friendly locations. And another vitally important factor is that these processes must involve all relevant stakeholders, especially those who are most impacted but have contributed the least: the indigenous and local populations in our partner countries. That is a question of justice. Sustainable agriculture is another important factor. And with nature-based solutions, forests, oceans and mangroves can be preserved as natural carbon sinks while simultaneously enhancing human and nature's ability to adjust to a changing climate. Naturally, conservation areas are also extremely important for the preservation of ecosystems. For example, with the Legacy Landscapes Fund, a global natural heritage fund, we recently established an important instrument to enable selected outstanding conservation areas to receive long-term 'permanent financing' and planning security that is unaffected by crises.</p><p>At the moment, global warming is continuing to progress and we continue to lose biodiversity. How optimistic are you that it is possible to successfully reverse this trend?</p><p>We have already been able to achieve a lot over the past several years. The global deforestation rate fell by a third between 2010 and 2020 in comparison with the previous decade. Protected areas already account for over 16% of land area and 8% of the oceans. Without these and other measures, two to four times as many birds, amphibians, insects and mammals would probably have died out. Our efforts are having an impact on a small scale, and we need to build on that. We still have a chance to preserve biodiversity and protect the planet from reaching the tipping point. Biodiversity and climate change mitigation are not a luxury, they are essential for survival - for us and for all generations to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2509202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66G8-STG1-F00C-608X-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"950\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"25\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 25, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The climate crisis was obviously of top concern. Extreme weather events are causing increasing harm around the world. The following page gives you an overview of pertinent contributions we published in 2022.</p><p>The worst weather-related disaster hit Pakistan in the summer. About a third of the country was flooded due to unusually heavy monsoon rains. As our correspondent in Islamabad pointed out, Pakistan suffered the impacts of the human-made climate crisis, to which its people have hardly contributed. Pakistani policymakers, as Imran Mukhtar wrote, had irresponsibly failed to prepare the nation for the impacts in the course of at least a decade.</p><p>African suffering</p><p>The media pay attention to things that happen suddenly, not slow-moving developments. Therefore, many people around the world are unaware of the Horn of Africa suffering devastating drought for the third year in a row. Humanitarian relief is needed, and experience shows that it should not only be linked to longer-term development, but peacebuilding efforts as well. Our contributor Christoph Schneider-Yattara who works for the Protestant agency Bread for the World, spoke of a 'sustainable development nexus'.</p><p>As climate impacts worsen, more and more international support is needed. Burundi is one of the 20 countries that are most exposed to global heating. As a result, tens of thousands have been internally displaced in the past two years. The most important reason was flooding. State agencies and international organisations are making efforts, both to provide humanitarian assistance and to prevent further damage. On our platform, Mireille Kanyange shared her insights from Bujumbura.</p><p>All too often, smaller-scale disasters are not taken note of by international media. However, extreme weather conditions continue to haunt many parts of the world, causing local-level devastation. Agriculture is often affected. Our correspondent Ronald Ssegujja Ssekandi reported from Uganda.</p><p>Multilateral policymaking remains insufficient</p><p>Humankind has been aware of climate change for decades. The UN Framework Convention on Climate Change was agreed 30 years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. Nonetheless, we still do not have a grip on the problems. My colleague J\u00f6rg D\u00f6bereiner assessed the results of this year's climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt.</p><p>In Rio in 1992, the consensus was to focus on mitigating climate change. The idea was that adapting to the phenomenon would be too expensive, require funds that would better be used to phase out fossil fuels. As action was inadequate, the international community had to put adaptation on the global agenda some 15 years later. We now know that adaptation efforts have been insufficient too, so it has become necessary to set up a fund for losses and damages.</p><p>The good news is that competent action actually makes a difference.</p><p>How insurance schemes and governmental social protection can help</p><p>Around the world, there are good examples of what needs to be done. Insurance policies can help, and promising progress has been made in the Caribbean archipelago, which is severely exposed to hurricanes. Marjorie Pons Pi\u00f1eyro from the Dominican Republic assessed the situation for us.</p><p>More generally speaking, far too many people are not insured against climate risks, and that is especially so in low income countries. For things to change, the business environment must improve. A team of co-authors from the Munich RE foundation - Renate Bleich, Dirk Reinhard and Christian Barthelt - elaborated things on our platform.</p><p>Social protection systems help to shield vulnerable people from climate risks and reduce social disparities. The great challenge is that they tend not to exist where they are needed most. Stefan Beierl of GIZ discussed the implications in D+C/E+Z.</p><p>Physical infrastructure matters too, of course</p><p>To limit the impacts of global warming, infrastructure must improve in many places. The Ganges Delta is a region that has always been exposed to extreme weather events, and Bangladesh has made remarkable progress towards becoming climate resilient. Cyclones today claim far fewer lives than those of the past did - when the country's population was actually smaller. Md Bodrud-Doza from the Dhaka-Based International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCD) elaborated on what makes the difference.</p><p>Adaptation measures, of course, must not worsen other environmental problems. In particular, ecosystems must not be harmed. Nature-based solutions are therefore best. David Mfitumukiza of Uganda's Makerere University told my colleague J\u00f6rg D\u00f6bereiner and me about African experiences in an interview.</p><p>German development agencies such as KfW Development Bank are keenly aware of global heating and the erosion of biodiversity being mutually reinforcing. This vicious circle must be broken, argues Svenja Schulze, Germany's federal minister of economic cooperation and development.</p><p>On her behalf, these international development agencies are paying increasing attention to environmental issues. At the same time, it has become evident that domestic action is needed at home too. The food disaster in Germany's Ahr Valley in the summer of 2021 would have been less devastating had the authorities learned lessons from previous events in Germany and other countries. In regard to civil protection, Germany can take a page from other countries, as Wolf R. Dombrowsky of Steinbeis University Berlin argued on our platform.</p><p>Moving beyond denial</p><p>The USA too is increasingly hit by weather-related disasters. Wildfires, heatwaves, hurricanes and floods are becoming more frequent, more dangerous and more costly. Nonetheless, conservative forces still deny the climate crisis. Katie Cashman, a Minnesota-based environmental activist believes it would be good to stop speaking of 'natural' disasters when it is human-made climate change that is causing serious damages.</p><p>When Katie wrote her comment, US President Joe Biden's climate agenda was still stuck in the Senate. The good news is that he has managed to make Congress pass ambitious climate legislation which should achieve at least 80 % of what he had proposed. That is enough to keep alive, but more must certainly happen.</p><p>IPCC, UNEP and other multilateral bodies sound the alarm</p><p>We have seen that lagging behind what is needed to be done proves costly. The big question is: Will policymakers heed the warnings? There is no lack of scientists sounding the alarm.</p><p>According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the 1.5 degree-Celsius limit will almost certainly be breached, at least temporarily. Our Indian colleague Roli Mahajan summarised its most recent global report on adaptation to global heating.</p><p>Other multilateral documents point in the same direction. Extreme weather is causing disasters. Mahwish Gul, who is based in Nairobi, read several publications of the UN Environment Programme on the matter.</p><p>We must not forget that the climate crisis is exacerbating other environmental problems. The core message of the second Global Land Outlook was that humanity must take urgent action to restore and protect land. Desertification and global heating are mutually reinforcing phenomena. Our Nigerian author Chimezie Anajama wrote about the Global Land Outlook, which was published by the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD).</p><p>So far, the editorial I wrote for the May issue of our Digital Monthly - the focus section dealt with extreme weather - has aged well. There really are no more excuses for not acting fast.</p><p>Hans Dembowski is the editor in chief of D+C Development and Cooperation / E+Z Entwicklung und Zusammenarbeit.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2712202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:675X-3K51-JCH9-G1WX-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1350\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 27, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Experts from around the are involved. On 6 and 7 October this year, the focus will be on how climate and biodiversity protection are interrelated. To support the event, KfW is publishing a supplement in D+C/E+Z. We will post the contributions on our website. The first item is an interview with Svenja Schulze, Germany's Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development.</p><p>According to your ministry, biodiversity loss is the second global crisis the world faces after climate change. Based on this, the future of humanity also critically depends on global biodiversity. Why?</p><p>Without fertile soil, air to breathe, clean drinking water and natural resources, we can't survive, and all these things are only possible with intact ecosystems. They feed us, protect us from natural disasters and protect us from the many effects of the climate crisis. At the same time, biodiversity is suffering massively from the consequences of climate change. The climate is changing too quickly - species and ecosystems don't follow suit. This is a vicious cycle - one we urgently need to break. Development for all people, climate change mitigation and the preservation of biodiversity must be carried out in harmony. This is a challenge that I have already dealt with as Federal Minister for the Environment and on which I can now continue to work in concrete terms as Minister for Development. Our work determines the future of the planet.</p><p>Every day, up to 150 animal and plant species disappear from the earth. Why is this relevant to people's lives?</p><p>Species are dying at a pace not seen in human history. The animal and plant species affected are irrevocably lost. However, each species has an important function in an ecosystem, and with each species lost, the likelihood of the system collapsing increases. The consequences are dramatic. We are already seeing the harbingers: the hunger crisis, conflicts over scarce water, increasing heat.</p><p>The effects are putting a strain on all of us, but particularly on poor countries and vulnerable population groups - especially indigenous peoples and local communities. Their natural livelihoods are being lost and conflicts over resources are increasing. This is particularly unfair, as vulnerable population groups have contributed least to the causes of biodiversity loss.</p><p>Today, international attention is primarily focused on the war in Ukraine and the coronavirus crisis. How can more willingness to act and awareness of problems for climate change mitigation and the preservation of biodiversity be re-established worldwide? </p><p>I see it differently: Climate change mitigation receives a good deal of attention - in this Federal Government, but also in the population. Everyone is experiencing it. Climate change does not take a break, even in times of war. We just experienced a summer in Europe hotter than ever before. We are working decisively towards a liveable future for our and future generations. Climate change mitigation and biodiversity conservation were top issues at the G7 meeting at Elmau Castle. At all levels, we are currently working on a successful global climate change conference in Sharm El Sheikh in November and a new global framework for biodiversity conservation, which will be decided at the UN nature summit in Montreal in December.</p><p>There are always conflicts between conservation and the fight against climate change, for example in the energy transition when building wind turbines. How can the two be combined in partner countries?</p><p>Of course, there are conflicting objectives. The partner countries deal with the same issues we do in that respect. A good balance between protection and sustainable use is necessary. The solutions are also similar, for example, checking environmental compatibility, determining environmentally friendly locations. And another vitally important factor is that these processes must involve all relevant stakeholders, especially those who are most impacted but have contributed the least: the indigenous and local populations in our partner countries. That is a question of justice. Sustainable agriculture is another important factor. And with nature-based solutions, forests, oceans and mangroves can be preserved as natural carbon sinks while simultaneously enhancing human and nature's ability to adjust to a changing climate. Naturally, conservation areas are also extremely important for the preservation of ecosystems. For example, with the Legacy Landscapes Fund, a global natural heritage fund, we recently established an important instrument to enable selected outstanding conservation areas to receive long-term 'permanent financing' and planning security that is unaffected by crises.</p><p>At the moment, global warming is continuing to progress and we continue to lose biodiversity. How optimistic are you that it is possible to successfully reverse this trend?</p><p>We have already been able to achieve a lot over the past several years. The global deforestation rate fell by a third between 2010 and 2020 in comparison with the previous decade. Protected areas already account for over 16% of land area and 8% of the oceans. Without these and other measures, two to four times as many birds, amphibians, insects and mammals would probably have died out. Our efforts are having an impact on a small scale, and we need to build on that. We still have a chance to preserve biodiversity and protect the planet from reaching the tipping point. Biodiversity and climate change mitigation are not a luxury, they are essential for survival - for us and for all generations to come.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2609202200002</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66G9-S9T1-JCH9-G01V-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1012\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 26, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Scholars and environmental agencies keep warning that global heating is very dangerous. To change course, action must urgently be taken.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global ecosystems have already changed drastically. The ice on the Arctic Ocean has been reduced by about one half since satellite measurements started four decades ago, as the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) reported in its Foresight Brief 28 in January this year. Should temperatures keep rising at current rates, UNEP expects the Arctic Ocean to be free of ice by 2050.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The trend is evident in the Antarctica too. Since 1979, satellites never detected as little ice as today. The ice shield used to be thicker and extend further.</p><p>At the same time, forest fires are happening more often - even in areas, where they used to be quite rare. Increasing aridity, hot air, dry lightning and strong winds lead to longer fire seasons. In recent years, Australia's East and the US west coast saw unprecedented and devastating blazes. If greenhouse-gas emissions are not reduced, disastrous wildfires may increase by one third until 2050 and even two thirds until the end of the century, according to a recent UNEP report (2022, 2) on the matter.</p><p>Changing water cycles</p><p>In eastern Africa satellites currently register the worst heat and the least rainfall since the technology was introduced. Some 25 million people are reckoned to be exposed to food and water insecurity (see Christoph Schneider-Yattara on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Water cycles are changing, making arid areas even drier. Devastating droughts are currently affecting parts of Latin America and western Asia too. According to a report on water published by the World Meteorological Organization (2021), 70 countries suffer drought in an average year.</p><p>On the other hand, torrential rains are haunting other parts of the world. South Africa recently saw its rainiest season in history - and it caused deadly flooding. In Sydney, Australia, this March was the wettest on record. Flash floods proved devastating. For the eastern USA, for example, 2021 was an unusually wet year. In India, there was 129 % more rain last September than normal. 2020 was the United Kingdom's fifth wettest year, and six of the 10 wettest years occurred in the past 20 years.</p><p>Around the world, the number of flood disasters has increased by 134 % since the year 2000, according to the World Meteorological Organization, whereas the number and duration of droughts increased by 29 %.</p><p>1.5\u00b0 threshold</p><p>In its 6th Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warns that, due to human activity, global temperatures have risen by 1.1 \u00b0C since the industrial revolution began. Most likely, the threshold of 1.5\u00b0 will be breached (see Roli Mahajan on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>). As UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres stated in his foreword, 'we are on a fast track to climate disaster.' He made an emphatic call to world leaders that 'it is time to stop burning our planet and start investing in the abundant renewable energy all around us.'</p><p>Scientists warn that global heating will spin out of control and escalate irreversibly if we pass certain tipping points. Cascading impacts would thus result from the melting of Greenland's ice sheet, the end of Ocean currents or the destruction of the Amazon rain forest.</p><p>To get a grip on the climate crisis, 195 countries concluded the Paris Agreement on Climate Change seven years ago. The stated goal was to keep global warming 'well below two degrees' and, if possible, stay within 1.5\u00b0. Governments committed to drafting and implement actioning plans with nationally determined contributions to global climate action.</p><p>When the Glasgow climate summit took stock last year, failure was generally acknowledged. Assessing the summit result in a press release, for example, UNEP declared that the new and updated commitments of 120 countries would only reduce the emissions forecast for 2030 by 7.5 %. To limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0, 55 % would be needed.</p><p>The way forward</p><p>According to UNEP's most recent emissions gap report, ten large economies account for two thirds of global greenhouse-gas emissions. China, the EU (counted as a single economy) and the USA are responsible for 41.5 %. UNEP insists that climate protection hinges on action in these huge markets - and that it is still possible to stabilise the global climate.</p><p>Nature-based solutions, renewable energies and energy efficiency all have great potential, according to UNEP. At the same time, forests and other eco-systems must be restored. The UN agency makes it quite clear that investments in fossil fuels must stop, subsidies for fossil fuels must stop and ultimately the usage of fossil must stop too.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1206202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:65NR-12W1-JCH9-G183-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"783\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>June 12, 2022 Sunday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The term 'green recovery' sounds promising, but does not accurately describe what is happening. David Mfitumukiza of Makerere University in Kampala assessed matters in our interview.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What impacts of the climate crisis are currently hurting people in East Africa?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There are three main hazards: drought, flooding and shifting seasons. The third is actually the most important for nature-economies where agriculture is the dominant sector. Unfortunately, it is getting the least attention. Changing weather patterns reduce food production and incomes. Subsistence farming is affected worse, because smallholders cannot afford to invest in new equipment or inputs. They have no wiggle room. Of course, the impact on commercial farms is bad too. When drought or floods occur, they are often devastating of course. People in some parts of Kenya and neighbouring regions in Ethiopia and Somalia are currently suffering food insecurity because rainfall was erratic and insufficient.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What does Covid-19 mean in this context?</p><p>Well, the pandemic is not over, so it's impossible to give a conclusive assessment (see Ben Ezeamalu on our D+C/E+Z platform). Several things are evident nonetheless. \u00acPoverty has increased. The urban poor could not work during lockdowns. Food distribution suffered because markets had to close. Fresh produce could thus not be distributed, and prices dropped dramatically. For example, a bunch of bananas that previously would have fetched the equivalent of four US dollars suddenly was only worth ten cents. In our world region, moreover, rural-urban dynamics matter very much. Typically, people who live in the villages depend on some kind of financial report from relatives or well-wishers in the cities. In times when poverty gets worse in urban areas, it therefore gets worse in rural areas too. Moreover, public services deteriorated, especially in rural \u00acareas where they were weak to begin with.</p><p>What are the environmental consequences?</p><p>The pressure on marginal land has been increasing faster than it usually would. Village people are desperate to expand their fields. A certain pressure exists all the time as all countries in the East African Community have population growth rates of at least 2.3?%. Because of the pandemic, however, we lost even more forest, grasslands and wetlands than we normally would. Those losses always weaken ecosystems, not least because they further reduce biodiversity, and one consequence is that nature's resilience to climate change keeps dwindling. At the same time, carbon is released into the atmosphere, so the climate crisis is further exacerbated. In our part of the world, poverty, population growth and the global environmental crisis are mutually reinforcing phenomena. Coronavirus has made everything worse.</p><p>Do African countries need stimulus programmes to improve matters in the sense of a green recovery or a green new deal? The guiding idea is to do two things at once: fight poverty and support the transition to a sustainable economy.</p><p>We certainly need the economy to recover and to get people out of the pit. I am not sure, however, that 'green recovery' is a term that describes what is happening. Our governments are focusing on getting the economy started again. That is their top priority. They do not worry much about environmental sustainability. We certainly still need economic growth if we want to reduce poverty, but it is unfortunately less obvious to everyone - at least in the short term - that growth must be environmentally sustainable. Our systems of governance tend to be weak, but only strong systems are able to take longer-term trends into account. In least-developed countries (LDCs), public finances are generally stretched. That means that the scope for stimulus programmes is very small, which in turn reinforces the disposition to think in the short term.</p><p>So when governments do consider environmental issues, they are probably more interested in adaptation to climate change than in mitigation?</p><p>Yes, the thinking is that African countries have contributed very little to causing global heating so they cannot do much to control that problem. At the same time, LDCs are especially exposed to the impacts, so everyone understands that we must adapt. This reasoning is flawed however. Yes, it is true that, in our countries, transportation, power generation and industries do not emit huge quantities of greenhouse gas emissions. However, deforestation, the loss of wetlands and the degradation of ecosystems in general do contribute to the climate crisis. Our contribution to mitigation should be to stop those trends.</p><p>And what can a country like Uganda do to adapt to a hotter climate?</p><p>There's a lot we can do. When infrastructure was built in the past, weather risks did not get much attention. That has changed. Today, potential flooding is slowly being considered in the planning and construction of cross-country roads. In similar ways, we can make sure that infrastructure such as power supply stays operational in cases of excessive rainfall or unusual heat. In regard to agriculture, a lot can be done as well. Small-scale irrigation schemes are most valuable, they often involve water harvesting. By storing water when it rains, we can boost farming in general and considerably reduce the impact of drought. African governments are aware of these things, so they feature in national adaptation plans. Nature-based solutions are the best options because they are very cost-effective and typically contribute to climate mitigation as well as adaptation.</p><p>Please tell us more about nature-based \u00acsolutions?</p><p>Well, many communities depend on natural resources, so communities' resilience typically depends on the resilience of the ecosystems they live in. Ultimately, this is about making people's livelihoods compatible with sustainable land use, instead of only trying to maximise the output of agriculture in the short term by adopting supposedly modern technologies (see article by Susanne Neubert on our D+C/E+Z platform). A very promising project is the Adaptation Fund Wetlands Restoration Project, which is implemented by Uganda\u00b4s Ministry of Water and Environment. The local people are directly involved, and they are keen on making things work out because they understand just how important the natural resources are. Of course, grasslands, forests and savannahs deserve attention too.</p><p>Let's return to the topic of stimulus programmes. High-income nations have invested trillions of dollars, but low-income nations cannot afford government spending of that kind. What international assistance do you need?</p><p>Well, we certainly need funding. Whether you call it climate finance, official development assistance or debt relief does not matter much. Money is not everything however. As I said earlier, systems of governance matter very much. They must ensure that money flows to where it is needed most - grassroots communities. Funding from international agencies should therefore go along with technical cooperation to boost state capacities. International agencies should not only talk to national governments; they must also pay attention to community-based organisations who know best what is needed in terms of infrastructure, health care, education, public services et cetera. Central governments generally understand that international support which we need can actually reach the places where the impacts are felt. In fact, there is an initiative started by LDCs governments to promote this cause. It is called the LDC Initiative for Effective Adaptation and Resilience (LIFE-AR). It was signed by national governments, but the programme is designed to support local governments in building effective systems and financing mechanisms to boost grassroot resilience.</p><p>Bilateral and multilateral agencies cannot bypass state agencies when they attempt to deliver support. Unfortunately, they do not find powerful sub-national partners everywhere as easily as in Kenya, where county governors are quite influential.</p><p>Yes, it is important to decentralise governance, and again, technical cooperation can help. On the other hand, cross-border thinking is needed too. In Africa, traditional community life largely ignores national borders. Nomadic communities move from place to place, and in times of crisis, other people start fleeing to relatives, who may live in a different country. In such settings, support for a specific communities in need should not be limited to a single country. More generally speaking, policymakers should always pay attention to these things. We are dealing with global problems and certainly need international solutions.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1002202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:64RN-KCD1-F00C-61X7-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-02-10</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1451\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"10\" month=\"02\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>February 10, 2022 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

(MA) said Tuesday it has pledged to reach net zero emissions by 2050.   The company's global action plan aims to continue to reduce greenhouse gases or GHG by remaining focused on the decarbonization of its operations and bolstering its efforts to decarbonize its supply chains.  Mastercard noted that its net zero goal builds upon its existing GHG commitments that align with the Business Ambition for 1.5C pledge.   Mastercard has gained Science Based Targets initiative or SBTi approval for its GHG goals. The company is currently working towards its SBTi-approved goal to reduce total Scope 1 and 2 emissions by 38 percent, and Scope 3 emissions by 20 percent by 2025 from a 2016 baseline.  The company has already achieved 100 percent renewable electricity in 2020, reinforced by a commitment to RE100.   Mastercard said it will initially focus on two priority areas to make progress against its emissions targets - decarbonizing its own operations and leading on supplier sustainability.  Mastercard operates close to 180 facilities across the world and is prioritizing renewable energy and energy efficiency programs. This includes the expanded use of solar panels in data centers, which account for more than 50 percent of energy usage across the company.   Currently all Mastercard owned properties in the U.S. are fitted with solar panels and all owned properties across the world are LEED certified.  In the future, Mastercard will also review opportunities for investing in carbon removal projects. This includes new nature-based solutions as well as technologies and services that reduce carbon impact as well as support broader local economic and social development goals.  In addition, Mastercard is mobilizing its technology, expertise, and global partnerships network to lead on collective climate action, through initiatives such as the Greener Payments Partnership and the Priceless Planet Coalition.      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPAENG-161166886800579AFU0579</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPAENG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61VR-F2K1-J9XT-N39Y-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-01-26</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"328\"/><timeReceived>2:47 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 dpa-AFX Wirtschaftsnachrichten GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>dpa-AFX International ProFeed</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0503\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"01\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>January 26, 2021 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

That analysis showed that there is a broad consensus on the need for such programmes and their benefits within the scientific community and at international organisations such as the World Bank, International Monetary Fund (IMF), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) and UN Environment Programme (UNEP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Studies confirm that green programmes can be very effective drivers of economic recovery, sometimes even more effective than conventional measures. For example, investment in renewable energy pays off more in macroeconomic terms than state support for fossil fuels. Investment in nature conservation, too, can have a very high multiplier effect, meaning that it generates high impacts on demand and employment. Money spent on unsustainable land use, on the other hand, tends to have a negative impact on an economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Criteria for green measures</p><p>There is widespread agreement in the scientific community on the criteria that green stimulus measures should meet. It is important that they:</p><p>are feasible in the short run,</p><p>have a high impact on demand and employment (targeted),</p><p>place only a temporary strain on state budgets (temporary) and</p><p>make a positive contribution to socio-ecological transformation (see Sabine Balk's article on the need for a socio-ecological transformation on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.dandc.eu\">www.dandc.eu</url>).</p><p>Some economic areas are particularly suitable for sustainable recovery programmes. They include non-fossil energy production, energy-efficient building renovation, sustainable mobility and measures for the ecological transformation of industry. The last area mentioned encompasses, for example, the development of a hydrogen-based economy and the promotion of technologies to increase energy and material efficiency. Climate adaptation measures and nature-based solutions such as reforestation are also often rated very highly.</p><p>Which particular measures can be feasibly implemented depends partly on country-specific circumstances, such as economic structure and administrative, technical and financial capacities, and partly on the availability of projects that are already planned and can be swiftly implemented.</p><p>Evaluations of existing green recovery programmes show significant differences. In industrialised countries the range of support areas is very broad, whereas in emerging economies and developing countries the focus is often solely on the development of renewable energy - especially solar energy - and preservation of the natural capital stock, for example economically important ecosystem services such as forests or marine sanctuaries.</p><p>Just a flash in the pan</p><p>Studies on green economic recovery programmes launched during the 2008/2009 financial and economic crisis show that they might only have a momentary effect. For example, although global greenhouse gas emissions declined slightly in 2009, they rose sharply again in 2010. The main reasons for the upturn were low energy prices and high government spending on fossil fuel-based activities.</p><p>Therefore, it is necessary to check all economic stimulus measures for environmentally harmful and climate-damaging effects and to embed green recovery programmes in structural reforms. This includes dismantling environmentally harmful subsidies and implementing carbon pricing. In addition, regulatory barriers need to be removed and green investment targets set.</p><p>It is also important to promote green financial instruments, build green infrastructures such as charging points for electric vehicles, expand public transport networks and power grids, and launch training programmes so that the social and ecological transformation is not hampered by a shortage of skilled workers.</p><p>Policy-making is lagging behind</p><p>More than two years after the onset of the corona crisis, questions need to be addressed about the extent to which policy-makers heeded the recommendations of the scientific community and the scale on which green economic recovery programmes were implemented. The answer is sobering: from a global perspective, green recovery measures played a minor role to combat the corona crisis.</p><p>The Global Recovery Observatory - a platform created by the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), IMF and GIZ to promote knowledge exchange and green fiscal policy - tracks countries' COVID-19 recovery spending. It estimates that total spending worldwide on measures to address the crisis amounted to around US$ 18 trillion (as of August 2022), most of which went on short-term rescue efforts. Only a little over US$ 3 trillion was longer-term recovery spending and less than a third of that was used to fund green programmes.</p><p>Even so, compared to the 2008/2009 financial crisis the importance of green economic recovery measures has increased significantly. Evidence of this can be seen, among other places, in many EU countries, partly as a result of the EU Recovery and Resilience Facility earmarking considerable financial resources for green measures.</p><p>Green recovery spending has been confined to relatively few countries, most of them in the industrialised world. This is largely due to the fact that the financial resources of developing and emerging economies are much more limited. In 2020, per capita spending on recovery programmes in industrial countries was 17 times higher than in developing and emerging economies. This shows how important debt relief and targeted financial support by the industrialised world is. They empower developing and emerging nations, too, to implement green programmes.</p><p>Moreover, green programmes' positive impacts on the environment are often counteracted by negative impacts from other stimulus measures. The IMF found that in the Group of 20 leading economic nations (G20), 1.4% of corona spending in 2020 had a positive climate impact, while 1.7% was harmful to the climate. Analyses by the Global Recovery Observatory conclude that only 3% of expenditures on economic recovery have a positive effect on the natural capital stock but 17% of spending has a negative impact. With regard to the goal of air pollution control, the positive and negative impacts are more or less equal. These are shocking findings and underline the importance of applying environmental and sustainability checks to all stimulus measures.</p><p>Whether the world as a whole will emerge from the crisis greener as a result of the corona programmes that have been implemented is impossible to say at this stage. It is too early to make a final judgement because programmes are still ongoing and quantitative impact studies are hardly available.</p><p>Because of the war in Ukraine, the world is now once again in an economic crisis. And the measures taken in response to that crisis will again be decisive. If the sharp rise in fossil fuel prices is used as an opportunity to promote energy efficiency, green energy and post-fossil production technologies, the crisis could become a catalyst for sustainable development. Developing countries and emerging economies urgently need support in this regard because the constraints on their financial capacities have been even intensified by the current surge in energy and food prices and the economic crisis.</p><p>If, on the other hand, the response to sharply rising fossil fuel prices and gas supply shortages is to subsidise fossil fuels even more and to develop new sources of fossil fuels, the targets of the Paris Climate Agreement will hardly be achievable any more.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2709202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:66GH-89R1-JCH9-G3V3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-09-27</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1269\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"27\" month=\"09\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>September 27, 2022 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

The new commitment means that by 2030, every Apple device sold will have net zero climate impact.  The iPhone maker said it is already carbon neutral for its global corporate operations.   The company plans to reduce emissions by 75 percent by 2030 while developing carbon removal solutions for the remaining 25 percent of its comprehensive footprint.  Apple noted that it is establishing an Impact Accelerator that will focus on investing in minority-owned businesses that drive positive outcomes in its supply chain and in communities that are disproportionately affected by environmental hazards.   The accelerator is part of Apple's recently announced $100 million Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, focused on efforts that address education, economic equality, and criminal justice reform.  The US-China Green Fund will invest $100 million in accelerated energy efficiency projects for Apple's suppliers.  Apple will remain at 100 percent renewable energy for its operations - focusing on creating new projects and moving its entire supply chain to clean power.  Apple now has commitments from over 70 suppliers to use 100 percent renewable energy for Apple production - equivalent to nearly 8 gigawatts in commitments to power the manufacturing of its products.  Globally, Apple is launching one of the largest new solar arrays in Scandinavia, as well as two new projects providing power to underserved communities in the Philippines and Thailand.  The company also announced that the first batch of this low carbon aluminum is currently being used in production intended for use with the 16-inch MacBook Pro.
