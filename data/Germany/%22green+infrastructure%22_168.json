The partnership aims to set up a nationwide battery swap network, with a long-term goal of 10,000 stations to establish a new benchmark for green infrastructure in China. For fiscal 2025, the collaboration plans to construct at least 500 battery swap stations.  On the Shanghai Exchange, the stock is trading down 7 percent at 5.37 yen.   Sinopec said that as per the agreement, the two companies will make use of their respective strengths to accelerate the development of battery swap ecosystems and standardize operations.   With the deal, the company expects to create an effortless \"swap-as-fast-as-refuelling\" experience for Chinese electric vehicle owners.   Sinopec said that the partnership will take forward the existing efforts by both companies in energy stations, storage, and advanced materials. Together, they will develop smart energy microgrids that integrate solar power, energy storage, charging, battery swapping, and inspection systems.   Looking ahead, there are plans to expand the collaboration into broader areas like zero-carbon solutions, vehicle ecosystems, and battery materials, the company added.

In a high- level working session held at the Yacht Club de Monaco, innovation met finance to chart a clear course toward healthier oceans and sustainable infrastructure. The event, led by Blumorpho in partnership with the International Association of Port Cities (AIVP) and supported by the Prince Albert II of Monaco Foundation, brought together port authorities, financial institutions, corporations, and innovators to activate actionable financial mechanisms for the sustainable transformation of coastal urban ecosystems. Part of the momentum building toward the 'Blue Economy Finance Forum' and the UN Ocean Conference (UNOC), the initiative aims to accelerate the deployment of scalable, investable solutions in support of net-zero and biodiversity objectives. Opening the session, Bernard d'Alessandri, General Secretary of the Yacht Club de Monaco, stated: \"On behalf of our President, HSH Prince Albert II, we are pleased to welcome you to the Yacht Club de Monaco to address this key issue. We would like to congratulate the Blumorpho team for their initiative and leadership. On our side, and as part of our collective ambition, 'Monaco, Capital of Advanced Yachting', we are fully committed to advancing sustainable yachting through concrete actions, including the development of the SEA Index(\\xAE), a tool to assess the carbon footprint of superyachts; and support for pioneering projects through the Monaco Energy Boat Challenge (1-5 July 2025). This commitment is more essential than ever, and we are proud to contribute to the dialogue on how to protect our Ocean.\" The day unfolded through expert panels, collaborative workshops, and project showcases, with three core themes emerging: ports as platforms for systemic innovation, strategic capital for climate impact, and concrete, investment-ready projects. Port cities were highlighted as drivers of integrated innovation, connecting clean energy, biodiversity, mobility, and industrial transformation. Financially, new models are gaining traction, from blended finance and blue bonds to private equity and infrastructure debt. Flagship projects from Kribi, Riga, San Diego, Genoa, and Bordeaux showcased pathways that combine decarbonization, aquaculture, digital infrastructure, and inclusive growth. \"The real challenge is not only funding the transition, but designing collaborative and business models that align profitability with long-term climate and societal goals,\" explained G\\xE9raldine Andrieux, CEO of Blumorpho. Featured case studies included Ineos Energy's integrated approach to carbon capture and storage, and Republic Bank's expanding role in green infrastructure across Caribbean ports and beyond. \"As key players in the globalisation of trade, port cities bear a large share of the responsibility for the climate change. But the richness of their ecosystem means that they are also home to some of the solutions,\" said Bruno Delsalle, General Manager of AIVP. The session sets the stage for a shared roadmap to be presented at the AIVP World Conference Cities &amp; Ports 2025, scheduled in New York this November. Tisha Marajh, Group Sustainability Officer at Republic Bank, concluded with a firm call to action: \"We don't have time to waste. We are among the most affected by climate change. Phased investments tailored to attract different kinds of financing can provide a more sustainable path forward. We also need systems to identify small upstream projects, manage ESG risks, and facilitate technology transfer. Sustainable finance is a market opportunity, and we, as financial institutions, are ready to engage, if the right conditions are in place, in Caribbeans and at global scale.\" For more information: Press Office LaPresse - <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ufficio.stampa@lapresse.it\">ufficio.stampa@lapresse.it</email> (<email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ufficio.stampa@lapresse.it\">ufficio.stampa@lapresse.it</email>) A photo accompanying this announcement is available at <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e7fafc56-2f31-440f-acac-\">https://www.globenewswire.com/NewsRoom/AttachmentNg/e7fafc56-2f31-440f-acac-</url> 429c5639e3c7 \u00b0    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPAENG-174972725400877AFU0385</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPAENG2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6G1G-NPN3-RTDG-R1JY-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-06-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"680\"/><timeReceived>1:20 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2025 dpa-AFX Wirtschaftsnachrichten GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>dpa-AFX International ProFeed</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0503\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"06\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>June 12, 2025 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

Luxaviation potential involvement could take the form of cash funding to finance initial development activities, support in the strategic definition and global visibility as well as offtake agreements in relevant SAF Zero projects such as Paris-Vatry SAF. SAF Zero is dedicated to fast-tracking the production of sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) by establishing an investment and project development platform that brings key stakeholders together. Combining Haffner Energy's proprietary technologies and Luxaviation's experience and strategic positioning in the aviation sector, SAF Zero is to finance and develop industrial SAF production projects. Operating under an exclusive license, SAF Zero will supply Haffner Energy's technologies to third parties under license agreements, designing, delivering and potentially operating key equipment based on these technologies. \"We are thrilled to collaborate with Luxaviation, a powerful partner working alongside us to position SAF Zero as a cornerstone of Europe's clean aviation strategy ,\" said Philippe Haffner, co-founder and CEO of Haffner Energy. France-based Haffner Energy relies on its 32-year experience to design, manufacture, supply, license, and operate proprietary disruptive clean fuels solutions, including critical technologies for pathway-agnostic SAF production, using all types of residual biomass and municipal waste. The company has already announced the development of a number of SAF projects, notably Paris-Vatry SAF in France, where full scale production is expected to be reached by 2030 when the next stage of the European SAF mandate kicks in. As a founding partner of SAF Zero, Haffner Energy will provide engineering support and supply of critical equipment as needed for the projects developed by SAF Zero. \"At Luxaviation, we believe that the future of aviation must be sustainable, and that requires bold partnerships and innovative solutions. Our collaboration with Haffner Energy and our interest in SAF Zero reflect our commitment to accelerating the adoption of sustainable aviation fuel and driving meaningful change across the industry. By combining our operational expertise with Haffner Energy's cutting-edge technology, we are taking a decisive step toward a cleaner, more responsible future for aviation,\" said Patrick Hansen, CEO of Luxaviation Group. Luxaviation operates one of the largest fleets of private aircraft worldwide. It is actively committed to the decarbonization of aviation through a three-pronged strategy: improving fuel efficiency; reducing emissions by actively increasing SAF use and electrification of ground operations; buying offsets for remaining GHG emissions. Since 2021, Luxaviation's annual sustainability report tracks progress against targets. In 2023, Luxaviation launched \"Go-to-Zero\" Investment Fund to foster SAF production. Both Luxaviation and Haffner Energy are members of Project SkyPower, an international CEO-led initiative dedicated to accelerating the development and adoption of SAF. About Haffner Energy Haffner Energy designs, manufactures, supplies, and operates biofuel and hydrogen solutions using biomass residues. Its innovative, patented thermolysis technology produces Sustainable Aviation Fuel, as well as renewable gas, hydrogen, and methanol. The company also contributes to regenerating the planet through the co-production of biogenic CO2 and biochar.

London, bolstered by its dynamic economy, cultural vibrancy, and unparalleled global connectivity, retained its #1 ranking for a third consecutive year. Paris secured the #2 spot with its ambitious sustainability investments and transformative post-Olympic legacy projects, while Berlin landed at #3, thriving as a creative capital and geopolitical nerve center in a rapidly evolving Europe. Resonance's 2025 Europe's Best Cities report (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldsbestcities.com/reports/2025-europes-best-cities/\">https://www.worldsbestcities.com/reports/2025-europes-best-cities/</url>) combines global user-generated data, core statistical performance, and new proprietary research, including a landmark Ipsos survey of 7,500 Europeans across 10 countries, to create the continent's most comprehensive city ranking. \"As Europe redefines itself politically and economically, its cities are once again leading the way,\" said Chris Fair, President &amp; CEO of Resonance Consultancy. \"From sustainability breakthroughs to cultural reinvention, the cities topping our list are those not only navigating disruption, but seizing it to shape more livable, lovable, and prosperous futures.\" The Top 10 Europe's Best Cities for 2025 (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldsbestcities.com/rankings/europes-best-cities/\">https://www.worldsbestcities.com/rankings/europes-best-cities/</url>) are: 1. London, United Kingdom 2. Paris, France 3. Berlin, Germany 4. Barcelona, Spain 5. Rome, Italy 6. Madrid, Spain 7. Amsterdam, Netherlands 8. Vienna, Austria 9. Prague, Czechia 10. Stockholm, Sweden The 2025 Europe's Best Cities ranking (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.worldsbestcities.com/rankings/europes-best-cities/\">https://www.worldsbestcities.com/rankings/europes-best-cities/</url>) arrives at a pivotal moment:   * Cities are reshoring industries, investing heavily in green infrastructure,     and leveraging their heritage to attract a new generation of global talent     and visitors.   * Major urban development projects, like Paris's Grand Paris Express metro     expansion and London's Canary Wharf 3.0 transformation, exemplify a new era     of strategic placemaking and urban resilience.   * Europe's renaissance in sustainable travel is evident with the surge in     high-speed rail and overnight train services, making connectivity and low-     carbon mobility central to city competitiveness. \"Europe's urban appeal remains timeless, but today's leaders are reimagining their cities for an era of economic self-reliance, environmental urgency, and experiential living,\" said Jason McGrath, EVP and Head of U.S. Corporate Reputation at Ipsos, the Best Cities research partner. \"Our new research shows that while iconic cities remain beloved, emerging destinations are gaining ground fast among Europeans for livability, visitability, and career opportunities.\" How the ranking was built: The Place Power(TM) Score, Resonance's proprietary methodology, evaluated each city's performance and perception across three core pillars:   * Livability (housing affordability, green spaces, healthcare, air quality)   * Lovability (culture, nightlife, dining, attractions, social media     engagement)   * Prosperity (economic strength, labor force participation, educational     attainment, startup ecosystem) This year's index reflects fresh realities, including affordability pressures, reshoring of critical industries, new mobility patterns, and carbon-conscious travel behaviors across Europe. A ranking of the continent's best-performing cities has rarely been this illuminating. The full Europe's Best Cities 2025 report is availabe here.

It is financed by European and national emissions trading and carbon taxes on heating oil, natural gas, gasoline or diesel, which are expected to rise next year in order to keep the fund's \u20ac57 billion target.A boost for green constructionA bulk of the sum in 2024 will go to Germany's construction sector, with some \u20ac18.9 billion in subsidies for building renovations and new buildings in 2024, the ministry said in a statement.Construction Minister Klara Geywitz (SPD) said that the financial boost could provide important impetus for the construction industry to make buildings greener. </p><p>Subsidies for renewable energy will also get a boost, with some \u20ac12.6 billion allocated.Berlin is hoping to shore up the hydrogen industry, with \u20ac18.6 billion, as part of its plan to transition to renewables.In terms of transportation, the fund will provide some \u20ac12.5 billion to Germany's rail network between 2024 and 2027. Likewise, on electric automobiles Germany will allocate \u20ac4.7 billion for the country's e-mobility charging infrastructure.Reducing reliance on ChinaGermany's boost in green funding for next year comes as countries like the US have increased subsidies that threaten to lure European manufacturers and as China maintains its position as exporter of critical parts in green infrastructure.To reduce its reliance on Chinese imports, Germany is investing \u20ac4.1 billion form the green fund in subisidies for local production capacity for raw materials and transformation technology such as solar power components.Some \u20ac4 billion in subsidies will also go to support semi-conductors production next year as part of a \u20ac20 billion allocated for the industry, including some \u20ac5 billion just for Taiwan's TSMC to build a factory in Saxony.Germany's Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, will take a look at the government's green fund plan in September, with a final vote of approval expected some time in December.While you're here: Every Tuesday, DW editors round up what is happening in German politics and society.

Sales increased by 5.9% compared to the first quarter of 2024. Sales from water services provided to business customers in the first quarter of 2025 in the main service area of Tallinna Vesi were EUR4.16 million, which is 2.8% less than the year before. Sales from water services provided to private customers increased by 17.6% in the first quarter compared to the same period of the previous year and totalled EUR7.3 million. These trends in sales are linked to the obligation imposed by law to harmonize the price of the service for private and business customers. The company's net profit in the first quarter of 2025 was EUR3.44 million, which is EUR0.43 million more than in the same period of the previous year. Net profit was impacted by the change in the price for water services and lower interest costs due to the lower Euribor. Tallinna Vesi is moving towards a more sustainable operating model and a reduction of its environmental footprint, supported by new investments such as the launch of a combined heat and power (CHP) plant. \"In the first quarter, we produced 2.2 GWh of energy at the CHP plant from biogas generated during wastewater treatment, which will help reduce costs by by EUR250,000 and provide water services at prices consumers can afford,\" said Aleksandr Timofejev, CEO of Tallinna Vesi. In the first quarter, the company continued to invest as planned to future-proof its infrastructure and ensure the continuity of the vital service it provides. The total investment planned for this year amounts to EUR61 million. \"Investment is essential to ensure the sustainability of water infrastructure and to cope with changing climatic conditions - for example, exceptionally heavy rains in January brought one and a half times the usual amount of water to the wastewater treatment plant. To ensure the smooth functioning of life in the city, it is necessary to continue investing in the development of separate stormwater systems,\" explained Aleksander Timofejev. He says the construction and rehabilitation of water, sewer and stormwater systems will peak during the summer months, and the company aims to carry out all the work with as little disruption to traffic and people's lives as possible. In 2025, investment projects will continue in the treatment plants, for example, emergency generators were installed in the pumping stations in the first quarter to ensure continuity of service in the event of a major power cut. At the wastewater treatment plant, the treatment process will be upgraded by reconstructing the existing screens at the plant and installing new screens at the main pumping station. This will improve the capability to remove debris in the first treatment stage, making the whole treatment process more efficient. In the first quarter of 2025, tap water quality was excellent, similar to the previous year, meeting 100% of all quality requirements. \"We work hard every day to provide our customers and consumers with the highest quality tap water. Throughout the year, we have continued to make significant investments in the water network and have cleaned more than 140 kilometres of water pipes using ice-pigging technology,\" said Timofejev. In the first quarter, an outage map was made available on Tallinna Vesi's website, giving consumers an overview of planned and emergency water interruptions, ice-pigging areas and the location of temporary water tanks. In the first quarter of 2025, Tallinna Vesi continued to explain the principles of water service as a vital service and to promote the benefits of drinking tap water to the public. The company also participated in career fairs organized at universities to present the job and internship opportunities available at the company. Tallinna Vesi's long-standing commitment to environmental sustainability was recognized in a Kantar Emor survey published in March, which ranked the company among the top five green infrastructure companies. During the quarter, preparations began for the opening of more than fifty public drinking water taps, which will be available to citizens from May to October. In the first quarter of 2025, the quality of the treated effluent from the Paljassaare Wastewater Treatment Plant exceeded the effluent standards. To maintain a clean Baltic Sea, the company uses efficient treatment processes that removed more than 240 tonnes of debris, 40 tonnes of sand, 479 tonnes of nitrogen and 59 tonnes of phosphorus from wastewater during the first quarter of 2025. The water loss rate in the water distribution network fell to 15.88% in the first quarter of the year, compared with 16.55% a year earlier. In order to keep water loss rates low, the company carries out continuous online monitoring of the water network and continues with its planned water network rehabilitation programme. By the end of the first quarter of 2025, Tallinna Vesi had rehabilitated and constructed ca 7 kilometres of pipelines, more than half of which (4 km) using no-dig methods. In the first quarter, the work that started last year continued on Lastekodu Street and on Paljassaare and Kopli streets. In co-operation with the City of Tallinn, work has started on V\\xE4rvi, Mustj\\xF5e and Vesiv\\xE4rava streets, where the stormwater pipeline is crucial both for draining stormwater from the Rail Baltic terminal and the Peterburi Road, and for mitigating stormwater floodings during heavy rainfall in the car tunnel on J\\xE4rvevana Road. On S\\xF5le Street, a critical water main supplying the North Tallinn area was rehabilitated. Particular attention was paid to the construction of separate stormwater systems to separate stormwater from wastewater so that it does not need to be discharged to a wastewater treatment plant. At the beginning of the year, the subsidiary company Watercom started to rehabilitate pipelines with new equipment that allows the rehabilitation to be carried out using a no-dig method, i.e. without excavating trenches. Most of the work using this new method will be carried out in the spring and summer. By the end of the first quarter of 2025, Tallinna Vesi had installed smart meters for 67% of its customers. The company plans to replace the water meters of all customers in its service area with smart meters by the end of 2026 at the latest. The new meters provide information on water consumption, enabling the detection of leaks in the customer's pipes as early as possible. This saves the environment and minimizes potential damage to property due to water emergencies. AS Tallinna Vesi is the largest water utility in Estonia, providing services to approximately 25,000 private and business customers and approximately 500,000 end consumers in Tallinn and its surrounding municipalities. Tallinna Vesi is listed on the main list of the Nasdaq Tallinn Stock Exchange. The largest shareholdings in the company are held by the City of Tallinn (55.06%) and the energy group Utilitas (20.36%). 24.58% of the company's shares are freely floating on the Nasdaq Tallinn Stock Exchange.

This investment is designed to address critical infrastructure gaps, attract local and global businesses, and contribute to Nigeria's economic diversification agenda.  The funds will support the first phase of the 860-hectare Lagos Free Zone, focusing on land development, industrial facilities, and logistics infrastructure. Owned by Singapore based Tolaram, a diversified multinational group with operations across Africa, Asia, and Europe, Lagos Free Zone is strategically integrated with the Lekki Deep Sea Port and will provide an integrated industrial ecosystem for efficient import and export operations, serving as a gateway for Nigeria's integration into global value chains.  With Nigeria's economy projected to grow by 3.7% by 2026, investments in infrastructure are vital to ensuring sustainable growth. When fully occupied, Lagos Free Zone is expected to create approximately 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs, while contributing significantly to Nigeria's GDP upon completion.  \"This investment reflects IFC's commitment to fostering inclusive economic growth and sustainable development in Nigeria. Lagos Free Zone is poised to become a transformative hub for industrial activity, driving job creation and enhancing Nigeria's competitiveness in global markets. We are proud to partner with Lagos Free Zone in building the infrastructure necessary to attract global and local businesses, enabling Nigeria to achieve its full economic potential.\" said, Dahlia Khalifa, IFC Regional Director, Central Africa and Anglophone West Africa.  The investment in Lagos Free Zone also reflects IFC's commitment to sustainable development, with a focus on green infrastructure. Approximately 15% of the investment is earmarked for climate-related initiatives, including Excellence in Design for Greater Efficiencies (EDGE)-certified buildings and climate-resilient infrastructure.  \"IFC's support represents a significant and positive recognition of our vision to establish Lagos Free Zone as a world-class industrial hub. This investment allows us to scale up the existing infrastructure to attract more foreign and local tenants while promoting sustainability and creating economic opportunities for Nigeria. Lagos Free Zone, integrated with Lekki Deep Sea Port, facilitates ease of doing business in Nigeria and supports the Federal Government of Nigeria's drive for economic diversification and infrastructure development. We look forward to driving growth and delivering lasting impact through this transformative collaboration with the IFC\". Added, Adesuwa Ladoja, MD/CEO at Lagos Free Zone Company.  Lagos Free Zone is already home to several manufacturing brands like Kellogg's, Dano Milk, Colgate, BASF, ADM, and Tata International.  This investment aligns with Nigeria's ongoing economic reforms and IFC's strategic frameworks, including the World Bank Group's Nigeria Country Partnership Framework (2021-2025) and its 2015 Climate Action Plan, both of which prioritize economic diversification, the development of competitive clusters, and investments in climate-resilient infrastructure.

CIP's extensive experience in managing the complex nature of risks in building large-scale offshore wind farms, as well as its strong collaboration with local supply chains, authorities, and communities, will contribute to successfully delivering Taean Wind Power. Thomas Wibe Poulsen, Partner at CIP, said: \"Taean represents an attractive opportunity to increase our offshore wind footprint in Korea. We look forward to completing this exciting project together with our new partners at Vena Energy who, with a strong track record of developing green energy solutions across the APAC region, is a great match for us. The participation in the Taean project will further strengthen and diversify CI V's investment portfolio and support our ambition of securing attractive risk-adjusted returns for our investors.\" Simone Grasso, Chief Investment Officer of Vena Energy, highlighted the strength of this partnership: \"Taean Wind Power represents a significant step forward in advancing Korea's energy independence and decarbonisation goals, and we are proud to partner with CIP to bring this project to life. By combining our respective capabilities and expertise, we are paving the way for the successful delivery of this landmark project, contributing to Korea's green energy transition. We look forward to collaborating with all stakeholders to position Korea as a global leader in the offshore wind sector and to deliver meaningful and lasting economic benefits for the country.\" South Korea has significant potential for offshore wind and is one of the most promising markets in Asia Pacific, with an ambitious target of 14.3GW installed capacity by 2030.

Since its IPO in June 2016, Molten has deployed over \u00a31bn capital into fast growing tech companies and has realised \u00a3660m to 31 March 2025.For more information, go to\u00a0\u00a0Chairman?s introductionFY25 was my first full financial year as Chairman and I am pleased that we remained focused on our long-term goals and the value creation potential of our portfolio. Even against a backdrop of continued volatility in the macroeconomic and Venture Capital landscape, Molten Ventures maintained its disciplined approach to capital deployment, portfolio management and strategic positioning.The broader venture ecosystem continued to adjust to higher interest rates, valuation pressure and subdued exit activity. These conditions undeniably presented challenges, but they also reinforced the need for our selective investment strategy and active support of portfolio companies.While exit activity at an industry level might have been subdued, Molten had a strong year of realisations delivering four high-value exits through the sales of M-Files, Graphcore, Endomag and Perkbox for an aggregate total deal value of over \u00a31 billion, establishing Molten as a leader in European Venture Capital exits. This, in addition to the partial realisation of Revolut at a headline valuation of $45 billion, has significantly enhanced our liquidity position. The portfolio demonstrated resilience, with several companies making material operational progress. Notably ICEYE, part of Molten?s Core Portfolio, made significant inroads during the period - securing satellite data agreements with NATO and Greece, earning recognition from TIME as a top greentech company, and being selected by NASA for Earth science research support. Meanwhile, PocDoc - for whom Molten led a \u00a310 million Seed round in November 2024 ? is revolutionising access to treatment for cardio, metabolic, and renal diseases by enabling patients to use smartphone-based technology to undertake screenings - with almost instant results. This has been a year of thoughtful and carefully executed Board succession planning. As previously announced, Ben Wilkinson succeeded Martin Davis as CEO, with Andrew Zimmermann stepping into Ben?s former role as CFO. On behalf of the Board, I want to thank Martin for his dedicated service and valuable contributions over the years. I would also like to extend a sincere thank you to Grahame Cook, who has served as our Senior Independent Director and Chair of the Audit, Risk &amp; Valuation Committee (?ARV?) since 2016. He also stepped in as interim Chair during Karen Slatford?s period of ill health, exemplifying his deep commitment to the Board. We are pleased that Grahame has agreed to stand for reappointment at the 2025 AGM for one additional year. Following the AGM, Lara Naqushbandi will succeed him as Chair of ARV, and Sarah Gentleman will take on the role of Senior Independent Director. Grahame and Lara have already been working closely this financial year to ensure a smooth and effective handover, and Grahame?s continued guidance will be invaluable as we move into FY26.We note the updated Financial Reporting Council (FRC) Code, effective from 1 January 2025, and for our Company from 1 April 2025. I am pleased to report that we anticipate full compliance with the provisions and will report on this next year.Over the course of the last 18 months, I have met all major active shareholders and remain available and very open to meetings. Please feel free to get in touch on <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:chair@molten.vc.Looking\">chair@molten.vc.Looking</email> ahead, 2025 will be an important year for policy approvals, with active engagement planned for FY26 on the Remuneration Policy. While we signposted an intention to begin this engagement during the current financial year, the Remuneration Committee decided to postpone this exercise while Ben Wilkinson and Andrew Zimmermann settled into new roles. We remain committed to ensuring that stakeholder consultation is meaningful and will take place ahead of key decisions next year. Further detail on our approach and related governance matters can be found in the Remuneration Report.Our corporate purpose is to advance society through technological innovation ? by identifying and empowering the best innovators and providing them with the tools they need to transform the way the world works. We want that future to be sustainable, fair and accessible to all. As a reminder, our sustainability commitments and progress are outlined in full in our separate Sustainability Report, which will be published on our website on 24 June 2025. The market environment remains uncertain, but we are cautiously optimistic. The long-term case for Venture Capital ? particularly in deep tech, AI and climate-focused innovation ? is compelling. Molten is well placed to navigate current conditions and deliver long-term value to shareholders. I would like to thank our shareholders for their continued support and our entire team at Molten for their tenacity and hard work during a demanding year and through continued evolution in the business. We enter FY26 with focus, resilience and confidence in our strategic direction.\u00a0Laurence Hollingworth Chairman\u00a0CEO?s statementAt Molten Ventures, our strategy is deep rooted in long-term conviction about the power and value of European technology innovation.Our model of investment and active management is proven over market cycles and, while our business is influenced by macroeconomic and geopolitical events, we are driven by consistent execution with a focus on the areas we can control. During the year, we leveraged our long-standing expertise to deliver a series of successful exits, all completed at or above holding values; continued to invest in world-class companies; and maintained strong capital allocation discipline focused on generating shareholder value.We have demonstrated our capacity for strategic innovation in our approach to structure and capital pools. This is the spirit which moved us to undertake our IPO and to develop our growing track record of strategic secondary acquisitions, which we further built on this year with our Connect Ventures Fund I acquisition. In sharpening our investment focus on Series A and B, we are reflecting our areas of greatest strength and expertise. In addition, we look to continue building scale and enhancing shareholder value as part of our new strategic priorities.Performance and achievementsThe year?s performance was underpinned by discipline, sustained momentum and continuing innovation.The overall Gross Portfolio Value is modestly down as we delivered realisations ahead of the invested capital in the period, and the growth in the portfolio was reduced by adverse foreign currency movements.Despite this, the portfolio delivered an increase in fair value of \u00a372 million in FY25, with notable gains driven by strong performers such as Revolut, Ledger, and Aircall. We continue to follow a consistent valuation process that reflects growth in portfolio companies as well as taking down the values of assets where the performance has not delivered.Realisations are crucial to our value delivery and FY25 was an exceptionally productive year for Molten, with total proceeds of \u00a3135 million, exceeding our original guidance of \u00a3100 million.These exits delivered on average a 1.8x multiple on invested capital and were all completed at or above holding value, validating not only the quality of our portfolio but also the diligent approach to our valuation methodology. They include:Graphcore: Acquired by SoftBank, delivering a 0.9x multiple on invested capital.  Perkbox: Acquired by Great Hill Partners, delivering a 1.3x multiple. Endomag: Acquired by Hologic, delivering a 3.9x multiple. M-Files: Recapitalised through Haveli Investments, delivering a 7.4x multiple. Revolut (partial exit): Secondary transaction generated c.\u00a37 million in proceeds at a $45 billion valuation, 25% above our last reported NAV.These achievements significantly increased our liquidity position, a key feature of our model, to fund the next generation of category leaders. It also allows us to effectively follow our capital allocation approach, which remains balanced: focusing on growing assets while delivering shareholder returns?underpinned by a strong financial position. Reflecting this, we commenced a share buyback programme in August 2024, which was enlarged in January and in March 2025 to a \u00a330 million committed total, going significantly beyond our stated capital allocation policy.The year marks further stabilisation since the major market change from the end of our FY22 onwards. It has been a challenging three years in which we have made difficult decisions and helped our portfolio companies to do the same. In doing so, we have demonstrated our ability to preserve value and have come through with the portfolio in good condition.Strategic refocusAfter becoming CEO in October 2024, I led a comprehensive review to ensure that Molten?s capital, team, and operations are fully aligned with the most compelling value creation opportunities. Our focus and priorities, as announced at February?s Investor Day, are clear:?\u00a0Refocus on our core investing strength of Series A and B investments: Where we bring differentiated deal flow, a strong brand, and the opportunity to lead.?\u00a0Build scale and ongoing portfolio development: Facilitate institutional co-investment alongside Molten at Series B+, increasing our access to capital and high-quality dealflow, and consistency of deployment. This aligns with the clear gap in funding for growth stage companies we see across Europe.?\u00a0Maintain a disciplined Fund of Funds programme: Concentrate future commitments on a select group of managers who provide the best insights and opportunity across the breadth of the European ecosystem.?\u00a0Preserve balance sheet strength: Sustain robust capital allocation, drive realisations, and continue disciplined investment.?\u00a0Focus on narrowing share price discount to NAV: Including through strategic share buyback programmes.\u00a0Market EnvironmentWhile the broader venture capital landscape has faced significant headwinds ? geopolitical tensions, market volatility, and pressure on IPO and funding activity ? European technology has been challenged but also proven to be resilient.European venture investment reached $66 billion (Source: PitchBook) in 2024 with investors placing increased emphasis on new technologies and capital efficiency. Europe?s core advantages ? its deep science and engineering clusters; its growing base of repeat founders and operators ? continue to strengthen.We are experiencing one of the most significant generational shifts in technology since the internet, with the rise of artificial intelligence. AI is no longer a future promise; it is a technology layer that is already reshaping every sector, from enterprise software and healthcare to financial services and infrastructure. For long-term investors like Molten, this transformation presents extraordinary opportunities to back the next wave of category-defining companies. Across our portfolio, CoachHub and Material Exchange are embedding AI into their product offering, while SalesAPE and Robin AI are AI native. Meanwhile, in Climate &amp; Energy, in order to forecast, finance, and manage massive investments in green infrastructure, energy markets are increasingly relying on smarter, more granular data that businesses like Sightline and Altruistiq provide. At the same time, structural initiatives such as the Mansion House Accord are working to unlock \u00a350 billion of UK defined contribution (DC) pension scheme capital into private markets including VC by 2030?a potentially significant source of growth funding. With the UK and Europe facing a significant scale-up funding gap, enhancing domestic institutional participation would fund our own innovation with deeper pools of capital and enable more UK and European-founded companies to scale at home, providing knock-on benefits for European economies and the retirement outcomes for pension savers.Nonetheless, market caution currently remains, with global factors such as the US tariffs contributing to stock market volatility and slower funding concerns. In the face of these challenges, we have remained disciplined, concentrating capital allocation on companies with well-identified pathways to cash generation and value creation.Our ApproachOur platform spans primary and secondary investing and primarily operates across three vehicles: Molten Ventures plc balance sheet, and our managed EIS and VCT funds. This hybrid structure allows us to combine institutional and retail capital pools, investing flexibly in a risk-adjusted, and tax-efficient manner for the managed EIS/ VCT funds.Prioritising Series A and B investments is a deliberate choice reflecting both the market opportunity and where Molten is best positioned to lead. The Series B stage, in particular, is where the risk-reward of commercial traction to upside is most compelling?it aligns with a gap to capital in the market that our experience and scale are uniquely equipped to address. While we are a generalist tech investor, this should not mask the depth of our specialist expertise. Each member of our investment team contributes deep domain understanding and, by investing across interlocking technology themes, we build insight into the intersection of product sales and customer buying behaviours. Our scale as a generalist meanwhile affords us both deep domain expertise within each team and a breadth of sub-sector exposure that surpasses many specialist funds. Molten finances some of the enabling technologies that powers advancement across whole industries: SimScale?s AI-driven simulation is redefining aerospace design, while HiveMQ?s messaging platform moves IoT data swiftly and reliably. Across fintech, climate, quantum, space and digital health, our thesis remains constant ? to back the infrastructure of innovation by investing in the software foundations of entire sectors: Thought Machine is rebuilding core banking; Riverlane is crafting the operating system for quantum computing; whilst Ledger safeguards the blockchain economy. Investments and portfolio development remain central to our ongoing value creation. We are focused on both core and emerging portfolio development to ensure a strong, broad, and consistent pipeline of growth and realisations. Embedded alongside this, our expertise in Secondary investments is a core pillar of our strategy, enabling us to acquire later-stage high quality portfolios with strong value-creation potential. A standout example this year was our acquisition of a 97% stake in Connect Ventures? Fund I, a 2012 Vintage Fund containing a portfolio of eight minority positions in businesses across Europe. Our portfolioAcross our portfolio, we continue to see compelling investment opportunities and have made investments into Renew Risk, Sightline Climate, Deciphex, PocDoc, Concretene, One Data, and FintechOS.Our core portfolio represents approximately 61% of our Gross Portfolio Value. These are increasingly mature businesses which have achieved significant levels of recognition and success. The emerging portfolio meanwhile is the engine room of the future core. \u00a3302 million of its value comes from companies in which we have invested directly, the remainder from fund investments (including via the seed Fund of Funds programme, Earlybird, and secondaries), demonstrating our range of access across Europe to opportunities from many different sources.OpportunitiesWe are building structures designed to enable institutional co-investment, amplifying our impact while maintaining a high-conviction portfolio. Additional capital through these structures, along with our managed EIS and VCT funds, help support our ability to access high-quality deal flow and consistent deployment in later-stage deals. Our Fund of Funds platform remains strategically important, but is becoming a smaller component part of our activities, whilst still providing critical insights into the ecosystem and access to market data and future deal opportunities in Europe?s seed ecosystem. Looking aheadWe have started FY26 with good momentum, with a combined c.\u00a330 million of proceeds from Lyst and Freetrade exits, and are making good progress in pursuit of all strategic priorities articulated in February 2025:?\u00a0The Molten team has been strengthened with the addition of a new Investment Manager and further Associate to the Investment Team and the appointment of a Chief People Officer.?\u00a0We are investing selectively into compelling new companies and to the development of the core and emerging portfolio. This includes four investments so far in FY26 including Hilo?s (formerly Aktiia) $42 million Series B.?\u00a0We are supporting shareholder returns through our ongoing share buyback programme, with \u00a324 million returned to date from the currently committed \u00a330 million total; ?\u00a0Our focus on cost control and simplification continues, including with the Euronext Dublin delisting last month and a more concentrated Fund of Funds programme; and?\u00a0We will provide further updates in relation to co-investment structures as the year progresses, including in respect of our proposed Molten East strategy.As detailed above, the share price discount to our NAV has been heavily influenced by external economic and geopolitical developments, and remains an area of acute focus. We are concentrating on execution and influencing what we are able to control. We are confident in our ability to make meaningful progress despite external impacts. Powered by clear strategic priorities, a solid capital base, and a highly experienced team with unrivalled reach across Europe?s tech landscape, Molten Ventures is ideally positioned to invest through market cycles and deliver value to our shareholders. Ben WilkinsonChief Executive Officer\u00a0Portfolio reviewDisciplined portfolio management remains a key differentiator at Molten. This is seen across our investment strategy and the investment process as a whole. During the year, we deployed a total of \u00a373 million including into new investments, like Deciphex and One Data, follow-ons in our existing portfolio, underlining our commitment to the likes of BeZero and SimScale, as well as into our acquisition of Connect Ventures Fund I.Portfolio valuations The Gross Portfolio Value as at 31 March 2025 is \u00a31,367 million, a decrease of \u00a312 million (1% decrease), net of investments, realisations and total fair value movement, from the 31 March 2024 value of \u00a31,379 million. The \u00a312 million decrease from prior year Gross Portfolio Value is the net impact of \u00a3135 million realisations offset by investments of \u00a373 million, \u00a372 million in fair value growth and \u00a322 million in adverse foreign exchange movements. Our portfolio valuations process continues to follow the IPEV Guidelines and factors in the market movements in the period; we have seen movements in some of our key assets to reflect public market comparatives and increased prices in recent funding rounds. We continue to see overall revenue growth in our portfolio companies with forecast average revenue growth in the Core Portfolio of 36% (2025) and year-on-year growth of 45% (2024), reflecting the ongoing innovation and digital transition continuing across sectors. The Core Portfolio is made up of 17 companies representing 61% of the Gross Portfolio Value. The Core Portfolio constituents have been updated to reflect the realisations in the period of M-Files, Graphcore, Perkbox and Endomag. Freetrade is part of the core at 31 March 2025 and was sold after the year end.New companies</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"440\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Molten Ventures plc   Ben Wilkinson (Chief Executive Officer)   Andrew Zimmermann (Chief Financial Officer)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+44 (0)20 7931 8800</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deutsche Numis   Joint Financial Adviser and Corporate Broker   Simon Willis   Jamie Loughborough   Iqra Amin</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+44 (0)20 7260 1000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Goodbody Stockbrokers   Joint Financial Adviser and Corporate Broker   Don Harrington   Charlotte Craigie   Tom Nicholson   William Hall</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+44 (0) 20 3841 6202</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sodali &amp; Co   Public relations   Elly Williamson   Jane Glover</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">+44 (0)7889 297 217   \u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0About Molten VenturesMolten Ventures is a leading venture capital firm in Europe, developing and investing in high growth technology companies.It invests across four sectors: Enterprise &amp; SaaS; AI, Deeptech &amp; Hardware; Consumer Technology; and Digital Health with highly experienced partners constantly looking for new opportunities in each.Listed on the London Stock Exchange, Molten Ventures provides a unique opportunity for public market investors to access these fast-growing tech businesses, without having to commit to long term investments with limited liquidity.

AI is no longer a future promise; it is a technology layer that is already reshaping every sector, from enterprise software and healthcare to financial services and infrastructure. For long-term investors like Molten, this transformation presents extraordinary opportunities to back the next wave of category-defining companies. Across our portfolio, CoachHub and Material Exchange are embedding AI into their product offering, while SalesAPE and Robin AI are AI native. Meanwhile, in Climate &amp; Energy, in order to forecast, finance, and manage massive investments in green infrastructure, energy markets are increasingly relying on smarter, more granular data that businesses like Sightline and Altruistiq provide. At the same time, structural initiatives such as the Mansion House Accord are working to unlock \u00a350 billion of UK defined contribution (DC) pension scheme capital into private markets including VC by 2030?a potentially significant source of growth funding. With the UK and Europe facing a significant scale-up funding gap, enhancing domestic institutional participation would fund our own innovation with deeper pools of capital and enable more UK and European-founded companies to scale at home, providing knock-on benefits for European economies and the retirement outcomes for pension savers.Nonetheless, market caution currently remains, with global factors such as the US tariffs contributing to stock market volatility and slower funding concerns. In the face of these challenges, we have remained disciplined, concentrating capital allocation on companies with well-identified pathways to cash generation and value creation.Our ApproachOur platform spans primary and secondary investing and primarily operates across three vehicles: Molten Ventures plc balance sheet, and our managed EIS and VCT funds. This hybrid structure allows us to combine institutional and retail capital pools, investing flexibly in a risk-adjusted, and tax-efficient manner for the managed EIS/ VCT funds.Prioritising Series A and B investments is a deliberate choice reflecting both the market opportunity and where Molten is best positioned to lead. The Series B stage, in particular, is where the risk-reward of commercial traction to upside is most compelling?it aligns with a gap to capital in the market that our experience and scale are uniquely equipped to address. While we are a generalist tech investor, this should not mask the depth of our specialist expertise. Each member of our investment team contributes deep domain understanding and, by investing across interlocking technology themes, we build insight into the intersection of product sales and customer buying behaviours. Our scale as a generalist meanwhile affords us both deep domain expertise within each team and a breadth of sub-sector exposure that surpasses many specialist funds. Molten finances some of the enabling technologies that powers advancement across whole industries: SimScale?s AI-driven simulation is redefining aerospace design, while HiveMQ?s messaging platform moves IoT data swiftly and reliably. Across fintech, climate, quantum, space and digital health, our thesis remains constant ? to back the infrastructure of innovation by investing in the software foundations of entire sectors: Thought Machine is rebuilding core banking; Riverlane is crafting the operating system for quantum computing; whilst Ledger safeguards the blockchain economy. Investments and portfolio development remain central to our ongoing value creation. We are focused on both core and emerging portfolio development to ensure a strong, broad, and consistent pipeline of growth and realisations. Embedded alongside this, our expertise in Secondary investments is a core pillar of our strategy, enabling us to acquire later-stage high quality portfolios with strong value-creation potential. A standout example this year was our acquisition of a 97% stake in Connect Ventures? Fund I, a 2012 Vintage Fund containing a portfolio of eight minority positions in businesses across Europe. Our portfolioAcross our portfolio, we continue to see compelling investment opportunities and have made investments into Renew Risk, Sightline Climate, Deciphex, PocDoc, Concretene, One Data, and FintechOS.Our core portfolio represents approximately 61% of our Gross Portfolio Value. These are increasingly mature businesses which have achieved significant levels of recognition and success. The emerging portfolio meanwhile is the engine room of the future core. \u00a3302 million of its value comes from companies in which we have invested directly, the remainder from fund investments (including via the seed Fund of Funds programme, Earlybird, and secondaries), demonstrating our range of access across Europe to opportunities from many different sources.OpportunitiesWe are building structures designed to enable institutional co-investment, amplifying our impact while maintaining a high-conviction portfolio. Additional capital through these structures, along with our managed EIS and VCT funds, help support our ability to access high-quality deal flow and consistent deployment in later-stage deals. Our Fund of Funds platform remains strategically important, but is becoming a smaller component part of our activities, whilst still providing critical insights into the ecosystem and access to market data and future deal opportunities in Europe?s seed ecosystem. Looking aheadWe have started FY26 with good momentum, with a combined c.\u00a330 million of proceeds from Lyst and Freetrade exits, and are making good progress in pursuit of all strategic priorities articulated in February 2025:?\u00a0The Molten team has been strengthened with the addition of a new Investment Manager and further Associate to the Investment Team and the appointment of a Chief People Officer.?\u00a0We are investing selectively into compelling new companies and to the development of the core and emerging portfolio. This includes four investments so far in FY26 including Hilo?s (formerly Aktiia) $42 million Series B.?\u00a0We are supporting shareholder returns through our ongoing share buyback programme, with \u00a324 million returned to date from the currently committed \u00a330 million total; ?\u00a0Our focus on cost control and simplification continues, including with the Euronext Dublin delisting last month and a more concentrated Fund of Funds programme; and?\u00a0We will provide further updates in relation to co-investment structures as the year progresses, including in respect of our proposed Molten East strategy.As detailed above, the share price discount to our NAV has been heavily influenced by external economic and geopolitical developments, and remains an area of acute focus. We are concentrating on execution and influencing what we are able to control. We are confident in our ability to make meaningful progress despite external impacts. Powered by clear strategic priorities, a solid capital base, and a highly experienced team with unrivalled reach across Europe?s tech landscape, Molten Ventures is ideally positioned to invest through market cycles and deliver value to our shareholders. Ben WilkinsonChief Executive Officer\u00a0Portfolio reviewDisciplined portfolio management remains a key differentiator at Molten. This is seen across our investment strategy and the investment process as a whole. During the year, we deployed a total of \u00a373 million including into new investments, like Deciphex and One Data, follow-ons in our existing portfolio, underlining our commitment to the likes of BeZero and SimScale, as well as into our acquisition of Connect Ventures Fund I.Portfolio valuations The Gross Portfolio Value as at 31 March 2025 is \u00a31,367 million, a decrease of \u00a312 million (1% decrease), net of investments, realisations and total fair value movement, from the 31 March 2024 value of \u00a31,379 million. The \u00a312 million decrease from prior year Gross Portfolio Value is the net impact of \u00a3135 million realisations offset by investments of \u00a373 million, \u00a372 million in fair value growth and \u00a322 million in adverse foreign exchange movements. Our portfolio valuations process continues to follow the IPEV Guidelines and factors in the market movements in the period; we have seen movements in some of our key assets to reflect public market comparatives and increased prices in recent funding rounds. We continue to see overall revenue growth in our portfolio companies with forecast average revenue growth in the Core Portfolio of 36% (2025) and year-on-year growth of 45% (2024), reflecting the ongoing innovation and digital transition continuing across sectors. The Core Portfolio is made up of 17 companies representing 61% of the Gross Portfolio Value. The Core Portfolio constituents have been updated to reflect the realisations in the period of M-Files, Graphcore, Perkbox and Endomag. Freetrade is part of the core at 31 March 2025 and was sold after the year end.New companies</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"48\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"176\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Company and sector</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Stage</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">What they do</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Why we?re excited about them</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Deciphex   Digital health</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Growth</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Deciphex digitises pathology workflows using AI to boost efficiency and turnaround times in research and clinical diagnostics.

During the financial year the firm has delivered a gross portfolio fair value uplift and generated strong realisation proceeds, maintaining a robust balance sheet while continuing to invest in our portfolio and enhance shareholder returns with our share buyback programme. Since our financial year end, market volatility has increased, driven in part by the US administration?s announcement?later paused?of significant tariff hikes on imported goods. However, given our portfolio?s focus on technology and software-based businesses, which are less directly affected by such measures, we do not expect any direct material impact. We will monitor this situation closely as it continues to develop, but our well-diversified portfolio and strong balance sheet position us to navigate market fluctuations effectively, as demonstrated in the sensitivity analysis in Note 31 of the financial statements.Looking ahead, we are optimistic. Our portfolio companies are innovative, future-focused, and aligned with the investment themes shaping tomorrow?s economy. We believe this positions us strongly to deliver long-term value in today?s environment ? and beyond.Financial highlightsIn the financial year to 31 March 2025 Molten delivered a fair value uplift in the underlying portfolio and strong realisations. Total Gross Portfolio fair value movement (excluding FX) was 5% or \u00a372 million, offset by adverse foreign exchange movements of \u00a322 million. Gross realisation proceeds for the year totalled \u00a3135 million, including significant realisations from M-Files, Endomag, Perkbox, Graphcore and a small partial realisation of Revolut through a Revolut-led secondary. Total realisation proceeds, therefore, far exceeded the guidance of \u00a3100 million given at the time of the 2024 full year results. At 31 March 2025, balance sheet cash was \u00a389 million, with subsequent cash received from realisations in the new financial year already at a further \u00a330 million. An undrawn revolving credit facility (RCF) of up to \u00a360 million provides further funding flexibility, subject to availability and certain drawing conditions.Our evergreen balance sheet model has allowed us to use this liquidity to maintain a strong capital position and support a balanced capital allocation policy. In the year to 31 March 2025, we deployed \u00a373 million into investments to support the growth of our portfolio and to take advantage of attractive secondary opportunities, such as the investment in Connect Ventures Fund I. We also completed \u00a315 million of share buybacks and commenced a further \u00a315 million buyback programme, recognising that the current discount level between our share price and NAV makes buying our own shares an attractive NAV per share accretive proposition.As at 31 March 2025, net assets stood at \u00a31,236 million, a decrease of \u00a315 million (1.2%) from 31 March 2024. This was primarily due to realisations exceeding investments in the year, with cash also being deployed to settle operating costs net of management fees and to fund the share buyback programme, which commenced in July 2024.Admin expenses net of fee income amounted to \u00a38 million during the period and continued to be less than the stated target of 1% of NAV. In light of increased post-Brexit regulatory pressures and comparatively low volume of trading activity on Euronext Dublin, we delisted from this stock exchange to achieve further cost and regulatory efficiencies.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Looking forward, a key strategic priority is to build scale with third-party assets managed alongside the balance sheet, which will further limit the cost drag on investment returns. We are already actively working towards the launch of our Molten East fund strategy which we expect to contribute to our fee income and investment returns over the mid to long term.Statement of comprehensive incomeWe recognised a loss after tax of just under \u00a31 million in the year, compared to a \u00a341 million loss after tax in FY24.Income recognised during the year ending 31 March 2025 comprises an investment fair value increase of \u00a323 million (31 March 2024: \u00a329 million decrease). Fee income of \u00a321 million was generated in the year (31 March 2024: \u00a320 million), principally comprised of priority profit share (?PPS?), management fees from the managed EIS/VCT funds, performance fees, and promoter fees. PPS is generated from management fees charged on the underlying plc funds; as invested capital increases/decreases net of realisations, PPS will fluctuate accordingly. The increase in fee income during the year includes EIS/VCT management and performance fees generated from realisations of Endomag and Perkbox. We anticipate that income generated from management of third-party funds will provide a further positive contribution to offset our cost base and enhance future profitability. Finance expenses increased to \u00a313 million (FY24: \u00a311 million) due to one-off fees and interest charges incurred from the extension of the debt facility. General and administrative costs (?G&amp;A?) totalled \u00a328 million (FY24: \u00a321 million). \u00a32 million of this relates to non-recurring employee restructuring and transition costs, while \u00a31 million relates to employee and setup costs related to the establishment of a new investment capability (Molten East) to build scale, which is expected to be recoverable through future income linked to a planned fund launch. The balance reflects ongoing investment in the business, the broader platform following the Forward Partners acquisition, and improved performance against corporate targets versus the prior year.\u00a0 Statement of financial positionThe Gross Portfolio Value at 31 March 2025 was \u00a31,367 million (31 March 2024: \u00a31,379 million). The decrease was driven by total realisations exceeding investments, net of fair value gains in the year. The Gross Portfolio Value is an APM (see Note 35), and a reconciliation from gross to net portfolio value ? which is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position ? is shown on page 51 of the Annual Report and Accounts. The fair value increase of \u00a372 million is the net of \u00a3180 million of valuation increases, offset by \u00a3108 million of reductions. This reflects sentiment throughout the market, with market-leading companies still commanding a premium when raising capital. However, we are still seeing decreases in the valuation multiples of comparator public companies due to some slowing of growth rates in the technology sector, which has impacted a number of our portfolio holding valuations.Our portfolio companies however continue to maintain revenue growth momentum, demonstrating the strong underlying resilience of these businesses and the structural demand for their products across their respective end-markets.The Core Portfolio achieved average revenue growth of 45% in 2024, while their cash runway also remains robust with 88% of those companies funded for at least 12 months, and 71% funded for over 18 months of runway or operating profitably.\u00a0 This reflects the maturity and scale of these businesses, which now represent 61% of the overall Gross Portfolio Value (31 March 2024: 62%).In the remaining portfolio, the Emerging Core which are on track to grow into the next components of the Core Portfolio are anticipating average revenue growth of 100% in FY25, reflecting the higher growth rates of these businesses as they rapidly grow and scale.The Gross Portfolio Value is subject to adjustments for the fair value of any accrued carried interest and deferred tax liabilities that can arise at the investment vehicle level, to generate the Net Portfolio Value of \u00a31,280 million, which is recognised at fair value through profit and loss (?FVTPL?) in the consolidated statement of financial position.The net fair value movement on investments, including foreign exchange movements, is reflected in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income. Carried interest balances of \u00a387 million are accrued to current and former employees and consultants of the Group based on the current fair value at the period end, and deducted from the Gross Portfolio Value. The Gross Portfolio Value table below reconciles the Gross to Net Portfolio Values and the movements between 31 March 2024 and 31 March 2025. The percentage of Net Portfolio Value to Gross Portfolio Value is 94% (31 March 2024: 94%), which reflects the movement in carry balances in line with the movements of the portfolio.Deferred tax liabilities arising on the investment portfolio at group level were \u00a311 million (31 March 2024: \u00a310 million) (see Note 25).Net assets Net assets in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at 31 March 2025 decreased by \u00a315 million (1.2%) from 31 March 2024, to \u00a31,236 million. This was, primarily due to realisations exceeding new investments in the year, with more cash being deployed to the Share Buyback Programmes outlined above.Executing share buybacks at a discount to NAV per share resulted in 8p of NAV per share accretion. The Net Asset Value per share as at 31 March 2025 was 671p (31 March 2024: 662p).ValuationsOur robust portfolio valuations process continues to follow the IPEV Guidelines, and we\u00a0 are committed to ensuring that our valuations are as accurate and responsive to the evolving business environment as possible.This disciplined valuation approach has been a key driver of our robust track record, proven out by our strong realisations at or above NAV holding value during the period despite challenging market conditions - see Note 30 for reference to the portfolio valuation basis. Our investment holdings typically benefit from the protective structure of preference shares to mitigate downside risk, without limiting our ability to capture significant upside as valuations grow. The governance surrounding our valuation process ensures objectivity, with external audit and validation adding further scrutiny to our approach.Debt facilityIn July 2024, the Group agreed an extension to our NAV\u00a0 debt facility with J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A. London Branch and HSBC Innovation Bank Limited (the ?Extended Debt Facility?), effective 7 September 2024. The Extended Debt Facility comprises a \u00a3120 million term loan and RCF of up to \u00a360 million, both on a three-year tenor, secured against various assets, LP interests and bank accounts in the Group.Drawdown of the RCF component of the Extended Debt Facility is subject to a maximum loan-to-value ratio of 12.5%, while the interest rate remains at SONIA plus a margin of 5.5% per annum. The value of the portfolio continues to be subject to periodic independent third-party valuation at the discretion of our lenders.We have been compliant with all relevant financial covenants throughout the period and at period-end. As at 31 March 2025, the \u00a3120 million term loan was fully drawn and the \u00a360 million RCF remained undrawn. The drawn amount is recognised in the consolidated statement of financial position at 31 March 2025, offset by capitalised fees from the setup of the Extended Debt Facility, which are being amortised over its life. For further information, please see Note 24.Total liquidity and capital allocation policyTotal Group cash available as at 31 March 2025 was \u00a389 million (31 March 2024: \u00a357 million) and \u00a360 million remained undrawn on the Company?s RCF (31 March 2024: \u00a360 million). In addition to balance sheet liquidity, our managed EIS and VCT funds also had \u00a323 million of cash available for investment as at 31 March 2025. During the period, we received cash proceeds from portfolio realisations of \u00a3135 million. A portion of this was deployed into investments totalling \u00a373 million, with \u00a38 million to admin expenses net of fee income, \u00a310 million of net finance expenses, and \u00a317 million to share buybacks.Molten manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and ongoing monitoring of forecast and actual cash flows. Capital resources are managed to ensure that there is sufficient headroom for 18 months? rolling operating expenses.In June 2024, Molten announced a capital allocation policy which included allocating a minimum of 10% of realisation proceeds to share buybacks, recognising the accretive benefits to shareholders of purchasing its own shares at the prevailing discount levels. In July 2024, following realisations tracking in line with the previously given \u00a3100 million guidance, the Company commenced an initial share buyback programme of up to \u00a310 million, which was completed on 23 September 2024. A \u00a35 million extension to the programme commenced on 21 January 2025 and completed on 12 March 2025. With ongoing strong realisation proceeds above guidance, and recognising the ongoing share price discount to net asset value, this was extended by a further \u00a315 million via an announcement on 13 March 2025, going significantly beyond the 10% of realisation proceeds in the policy. The programme was financed through cash resources, acquiring a total of 4,871,767 ordinary shares as at 31 March 2025, which represent, approximately, 2.6% of the Company?s issued share capital at year end. For further information, please see Note 27.SummaryIn summary, our exciting, resilient and diversified portfolio has delivered a fair value uplift and increased NAV per share in a challenging environment, with a strong level of realisations returning capital to the balance sheet.\u00a0 The Company continues to focus on capital allocation, balancing the pipeline of exciting new investment opportunities with the ability to drive returns to shareholders through share buyback programmes, while maintaining sufficient reserves.\u00a0Andrew ZimmermannChief Financial Officer\u00a0Gross

Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006.The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the company?s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.Directors? confirmationsThe Directors consider that the Annual Report and accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group?s and Company?s position and performance, business model and strategy.Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed in Board of Directors section on pages 80 and 81 of the Annual Report and Accounts confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:?\u00a0the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with UK-adopted international accounting standards and international financial reporting

Group;?\u00a0the Company financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards, comprising FRS 101, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and loss of the Company; and?\u00a0the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Group and Company, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.\u00a0By order of the BoardAndrew ZimmermannChief Financial Officer10 June 2025\u00a0Financial

Gonzalo Boada joins Andera Partners as a Director within the Andera MidCap team, specializing in medium-sized companies (with revenue between EUR50 and EUR500 million), aiming to drive their growth and internationalization. Andera Partners' areas of interest in Spain include business services, technology, healthcare, and niche industries.  Founded in Paris over 20 years ago, Andera Partners has established itself as one of Europe's leading private capital investment firms. Andera Partners has been active in Germany and Belgium for over 20 years and Italy for over 14 years. The expansion into Spain marks the next step in its international growth. Boada will lead our efforts in the Spanish market and expand the Madrid office in the coming years.  The opening of the Madrid office will strengthen Andera's capabilities in Spain, where the firm has already completed 20 investments (including add-ons) through various vehicles. In 2015, Andera Life Sciences, its venture capital team specializing in biotechnology and medical devices, invested in Sanifit, a company focused on vascular calcification disorders, which was later sold to Vifor Pharma, and in MedLumics, a company dedicated to cardiac devices, in 2017. Andera Infra, the firm's green infrastructure team, acquired in 2023 a minority stake in Ingenostrum, a company focused on renewable energy and data center development. In October 2024, Andera's MidCap team, supporting growth company shareholder managers, announced the acquisition of temporary staffing firm Meditempus by its portfolio company Mistertemp, and the mezzanine debt team Andera Acto supported Group ADF in its acquisition of Grupo DGH, a provider of engineering and industrial maintenance services.  Gonzalo Boada, formerly with H.I.G. Capital, has extensive experience in the private equity sector, having worked on numerous transactions, including the sale of Valencia-based bathroom furniture company Royo to the Roca Group and the carve-out of STH Group, a division of faucets and related products, from Dutch-listed Aalberts. He holds an MBA from Harvard University and dual degrees in Law and Business Administration from Universidad Pontificia Comillas (ICADE). He began his career at the Boston Consulting Group after a stint as an entrepreneur leading ePark.  Gonzalo Boada commented: \"I am thrilled to join Andera Partners and lead its expansion into Spain. Andera's expertise in inorganic growth projects and internationalization, along with its flexibility to take majority or minority stakes, positions the firm as the ideal partner for management teams seeking to scale their business.\"  Laurent Tourtois and Rapha\\xEBl Wisniewski, co-Managing Partners at Andera Partners, added: \"The opening of our Madrid office marks an important step in Andera Partners' growth. Andera's commitment to the Spanish market is strong, and we are eager to increase our activity in one of the most dynamic economies within the European Union. As we continue our expansion across Europe, we welcome Gonzalo Boada to the firm, and are confident that his talent and experience will be a significant asset to our team.\"  ABOUT ANDERA PARTNERS  Over the past 20 years, Andera Partners has established itself as one of Europe's leading private capital investment firms.

Southeast Asia's growing strategic importance positions Malaysia to enhance ASEAN's global influence. By leveraging its pragmatic diplomacy and Look East policy-emphasizing strategic partnerships with China and other East Asian nations-Malaysia can drive regional integration, foster economic growth, and ensure environmental stewardship. The task is not only to address current challenges but to lay the groundwork for a visionary ASEAN future extending to 2100, characterized by resilience, dynamism, and ecological sustainability.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">First, on economic integration and green growth. A primary focus for Malaysia will be advancing economic integration within ASEAN while embedding sustainability into economic policies. As China remains the largest trading partner in the region, Malaysia can lead initiatives that streamline trade and investment flows with an emphasis on green practices. Utilizing the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) as a framework, Malaysia can advocate for environmentally friendly trade policies and support green technologies.</p><p>In the context of the evolving global economic landscape, the rise of BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) presents both opportunities and challenges. BRICS countries, with their significant economic clout and growing influence, offer potential avenues for expanding green trade and investment partnerships. Malaysia can leverage these relationships to foster collaboration on sustainable development initiatives and green technologies.</p><p>Looking towards 2100, Malaysia could propose the creation of a unified ASEAN Green Economic Zone. This zone would harmonize regulations and policies to promote sustainable trade and investment. Prioritizing innovation in green technologies, renewable energy, and circular economy practices will be essential. Establishing long-term economic and environmental goals will help ASEAN maintain its global leadership in sustainable development, while engaging with BRICS can enhance the region's capacity to address global challenges and drive forward the green agenda.</p><p>Second, on infrastructure development and green connectivity. Infrastructure development will be a cornerstone of Malaysia's leadership, particularly within the context of China's Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). Emphasizing the modernization of infrastructure with a focus on sustainability-such as green ports, eco-friendly railways, and smart digital networks-will drive regional integration and equitable growth.</p><p>For the future, Malaysia can propose an ASEAN-wide Green Infrastructure Master Plan for 2100. This plan should include smart cities powered by renewable energy, integrated transportation networks that reduce carbon emissions, and robust digital infrastructure supporting a low-carbon economy. Investing in sustainable infrastructure will be crucial for ASEAN to adapt to global environmental trends and maintain its competitive edge.</p><p>Third, on maritime security and environmental preservation. Maritime security and environmental preservation will be critical during Malaysia's chairmanship. Malaysia can lead ASEAN in promoting peaceful dialogue and cooperation among member states and external partners, including China, with a focus on environmental protection.</p><p>Looking to 2100, Malaysia should propose the establishment of an ASEAN Maritime Environmental Security Alliance. This alliance would focus on joint efforts to combat marine pollution, protect marine biodiversity, and ensure sustainable maritime practices. By setting a clear trajectory for maritime environmental security, Malaysia can contribute to a stable and ecologically balanced Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Fourth, digital transformation and eco-friendly technology. Aligned with its Look East policy, Malaysia can drive ASEAN's green digital transformation by leveraging advancements in Chinese technology. Advocating for collaboration in e-commerce, fintech, and smart city development with an emphasis on environmental sustainability will be key.</p><p>Malaysia can propose the creation of a Digital ASEAN Green Community by 2100. This community could integrate digital platforms across member states, enhance cross-border e-commerce, and ensure equitable access to green technologies. Establishing a regional digital innovation hub focused on eco-friendly technology and entrepreneurship will be crucial. By positioning ASEAN as a leader in green digital innovation, Malaysia can ensure the region's continued growth and relevance in a rapidly evolving, environmentally-conscious technological landscape.</p><p>Fifth, on sustainability and environmental stewardship. Addressing climate change will be a central issue during Malaysia's chairmanship. Collaborating with China on green technology and renewable energy initiatives will be essential for promoting sustainable development across ASEAN.</p><p>Looking to 2100, Malaysia can propose a comprehensive long-term sustainability framework for ASEAN. This framework should include ambitious targets for carbon neutrality, significant investment in renewable energy sources, and strategies for climate adaptation and disaster resilience. Emphasizing sustainable urbanization, conservation of natural resources, and ecosystem restoration will help ASEAN meet its environmental goals and position the region as a global leader in sustainability.</p><p>Sixth, on youth engagement and green capacity building. Engaging youth and focusing on education will be vital components of Malaysia's agenda. ASEAN's young population is a significant asset for the region's future. Malaysia can champion initiatives to equip the next generation with skills for a green, digitally connected world.</p><p>Envisioning the future, Malaysia can propose a comprehensive ASEAN Youth Green Development Program by 2100. This program could focus on education in environmental science, green technology, and sustainable entrepreneurship. Building partnerships to ensure that the region's youth are prepared to address future environmental challenges and seize green opportunities will be crucial. Developing this capacity will help shape a new generation of leaders and innovators driving ASEAN's sustainable success.</p><p>In summary, Malaysia's chairmanship of ASEAN in 2025 offers a pivotal opportunity to enhance the bloc's economic, security, and environmental resilience. By deepening ties with China, advancing regional integration, and fostering sustainable and inclusive growth, Malaysia can position ASEAN as a forward-thinking, cohesive, and environmentally conscious global player. Proposing a visionary plan that extends to 2100 will ensure ASEAN not only navigates current challenges but thrives in an increasingly multipolar world, setting the stage for a prosperous and ecologically balanced future.                    </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">ASIANN-newsmldpacom2009010124101499702018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">ASIANN2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D6W-S221-JDSH-20MV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">460173</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-10-24</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1174\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Asia News Network All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Asia News Network</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"62982\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"14\" month=\"10\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>October 14, 2024 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>ASSOCIATION OF SOUTHEAST ASIAN NATIONS</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.country\"><classificationItem><className>China</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>politics</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"99\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"69\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6Q0EyOTJDQzRFNDdENDI4MEI4N0E4NTBDQzVGOTVDNDM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NTkwMDY1RDExQ0YwNDQ1RTlERUVFMjUzMUI1MkFDOTU</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Governments</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MjdEQjE4OUJDMzQxNDNEMEI0RTI1QUFCMzJENjEwRTA7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"91\"><className>Initiative &amp;

New technology solutions from across the globe.The first half of September 2024 saw devastating floods in Nigeria, Myanmar, the Czech Republic, Budapest and other parts Central Europe after heavy rainfall.In August, floods hit Bangladesh and left more than 500,000 people without clean water, sanitation, dry clothes and other basics like medication.With experts tending to attribute these extreme weather events to climate change, governments and communities are looking towards mitigation and adaptation strategies.For instance, investment in grey infrastructure projects, using concrete and steel, and natural green initiatives could help to prevent the very worst impacts of more frequent and severe flood events.Mobile flood barriers in VeniceVenice, one of the world's most iconic European cities, faces a double-whammy existential crisis: a combination of climate-driven sea level rise and the city's slowly sinking into the muddy foundations upon which it was built.It's calculated to be sinking at about 2.5mm per year on average, and that for the past 150 years. Some studies suggest much of the city could be under water by the middle of the next century - a modern-day Atlantis.But the more immediate challenge is flooding.Planning for flood-prevention systems in Venice stretches back to the 1980s. In 2003, construction of the MOSE system began.MOSE features four mobile inlet barriers at points along the lagoon that separate the city from the sea.Each barrier consists of a series of gates that can be raised to separate the lagoon from the surrounding ocean during high flood tides.Flow-through, flood control and 'dry' dams in Japan, USTypically, dams are used to block a river as a means of water storage.But flow-through dams are designed to allow water to move during normal conditions. </p><p>Rather than storing water in dry periods, they come into action during severe weather: They close up and store the floodwaters on an upper floodplain, and protect land on the other side of the structure.Water is then released back into the lower part of the river system once the floods have subsided.Such dams have been constructed in Ohio, in the US, and in Japan, along the Masudagawa and Hata rivers. Another is being built along the Asuwa river. House stilts, breakaway walls and self-elevating homesStilts have long been used to support freestanding homes and protect them against flooding. But the idea is becoming popular in areas that are only now having to adjust to extreme weather and flooding.While stilted houses have been commonly used in small island nations, where sea levels are rapidly rising, as well as floodplains in Asia and Africa, other nations are increasingly looking towards such techniques as a means of improving housing.In the US, regulations stipulate that stilt supports need to be strong enough to withstand flooding and wind forces, while elevating buildings high enough to withstand a \"once in a century\" flood.In the United Kingdom, a mechanical jack system has been developed by a company called FloodJack. It detect rising waters and activates a foundational elevation system to protect homes from water damage.But for some nations, not even raised houses are enough anymore. In the wake of disastrous flooding events on the US Gulf Coast and in Australia, for instance, some governments have imposed restrictions on where homes can be rebuilt.While these aren't technological innovations, policy initiatives such as these are increasingly being looked upon as effective ways of reducing loss and damage.Barrier technology from Netherlands to AfricaBuilding temporary barricades against rising floodwaters - an idea developed by a Dutch company called SLAMDAM - has proved just as effective in African countries as it has in the Netherlands.The SLAMDAM is made of tubes that fill with water to create a temporary wall or barricade that pushes flood waters back.It has been utilized by communities in Burundi, Nigeria and Kenya. Communities have also used the stored water during dry periods for irrigation.'Nature based' flood mitigation - an opportunity for Asia?It's not just technological innovation that could help communities solve the problem of hazardous flooding. Some regions are turning towards environmental interventions. These are sometimes called \"nature based solutions\". For flood mitigation, they could include the management of the flow of water between rivers and floodplains, or the restoration of agricultural regions with native vegetation to encourage more effective stormwater storage.Other ideas include reestablishing sand dunes and mangrove forests to provide natural barricades to flooding.Such initiatives are considered \"green infrastructure\" and are being deployed across the globe.Edited by: Zulfikar AbbanySelect sources:MOSE System, Venice <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.mosevenezia.eu/project/?lang=enPortable\">https://www.mosevenezia.eu/project/?lang=enPortable</url> dams in Africa / SLAMDAM <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/can-portable-dam-help-africa-counter-rising-watersNature-based\">https://www.unep.org/news-and-stories/story/can-portable-dam-help-africa-counter-rising-watersNature-based</url> solutions for flood management in Asia and the Pacific, OECD (March 2024) <url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1787/18151949\">https://doi.org/10.1787/18151949</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.dw.com/en/how-new-technologies-can-mitigate-the-risks-of-flooding/a-70239314?maca=en-vam_rssnewstex_dw-35593-xml-mrss\">Link to the original story.</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NWTXWW-DEWL10998852743572350525202100018</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6D09-6RN1-F03R-N10S-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-09-17</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"883\"/><timeReceived>1:52 PM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Delivered by Newstex LLC.

Results after nine months ahead of plan   06-Nov-2024 / 07:03 CET/CEST  The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.   Revenues increased to ?8.2bn at end of September thanks to strong customer business (9M\u00a023: ?8.1bn)  Loan volume of corporate clients in Mittelstand business increased by 3\u00a0% to ?62bn in Q3  9M net commission income up 4% to ?2.7bn  Net interest income after nine months at consistently high level of ?6.3bn despite rate cuts  9M costs stable at ?4.8bn ? cost-income ratio at 59%  Operating result after nine months almost stable at ?2.8bn despite decreasing interest rates  9M net result up 5% to ?1.9bn  Risk result after nine months at minus ?529m ? non-performing exposure ratio remains low at 0.9%  High CET1 ratio of 14.8% (9M\u00a023: 14.6%) expected to rise to around 15% at year-end and underpins potential for capital return  Outlook for full year: net result target of around ?2.4bn confirmed ? targets for net commission income and net interest income raised  Third share buyback: buyback of first tranche of around ?600m approved ? applied for approval for second tranche of up to ?400m ?We are convinced that we will increase our net result again this year. The customer business developed very well in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with the growth in net commission income. This shows that our growth initiatives are increasingly paying off, thanks to the very consistent implementation of our strategy. This helps us to cushion the effect of decreasing interest rates and to broaden our revenue base for the future.? Bettina Orlopp, CEO Commerzbank has improved its outlook for the 2024 financial year after the first nine months: net interest income and net commission income developed better than anticipated in the third quarter, which is why the Bank is raising its targets for both key figures. The Bank also confirms its forecast for 2024 of achieving a higher net result than in 2023. It anticipates a net result of around ?2.4bn after reaching ?2.2bn in the 2023\u00a0financial year. This means the Bank is once again heading for a record profit for the full year. In the third quarter, growth in net commission income accelerated to around 8% compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Growth in the securities business and asset management as well as in the syndication business and trade finance had a particularly positive effect. In contrast, net interest income fell slightly due to the European Central Bank?s (ECB?s) recent interest rate cuts, but the Bank benefited from the continuing high volume of deposits. Despite the economically challenging environment, the credit volume in the Corporate Clients segment rose to ?100bn in the third quarter. In the Mittelstand alone, the loan volume increased by 3% compared to the previous quarter to ?62bn. The loan book remains robust. Between January and September, revenues rose to a total of ?8.2bn. With ?1.9bn after taxes and minorities, the Bank earned 5% more in the first nine months of this year than in the same time of the previous year. The Bank continued implementing its strategic initiatives in the third quarter. A few weeks after successfully acquiring a majority stake in Aquila Capital, the Bank started the distribution of Aquila products with the launch of the European long-term investment fund (ELTIF) ?AC One Planet?. The demand from Commerzbank customers for this long-term fund, which invests in pioneering projects in the field of renewable energy, is very high. The Bank is also expanding its offering for ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices, substantiating Commerzbank?s growth ambitions in this segment. The relevant skill sets and highly specialised departments will be brought together in a separate division. In addition to the existing services in Berlin, D\u00fcsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main and Munich, the Bank is also establishing two new locations in Hamburg and Stuttgart for comprehensive advisory services for this customer group. The Bank is also continuing to implement its strategic plans abroad. To further strengthen its technological development, Commerzbank has opened a new ?IT factory? in Malaysia. Commerzbank is furthermore making good progress in its commitment to sustainability: growth in the Green Infrastructure Finance division, which focuses on project financing for renewable energies and other green infrastructure, already exceeded the record year 2023 after nine months. Between January and September, net growth in the financing volume amounted to around ?1.1bn (full year 2023: ?1bn). ?Our figures and our strong customer business emphasise that our strategy is paying off. Even in an environment of decreasing interest rates, we are delivering stable revenues and strong results. We believe we have great potential for growth, particularly in asset management and wealth management. In the lending business, we want to continue to grow in the Mittelstand business?, said Bettina Orlopp, Commerzbank?s CEO. ?To further increase the Bank?s profitability in the coming years and create sustainable value for our shareholders, we are currently working hard on upgrading our strategy for the coming years. The results will be presented on 13 February 2025.? Strong customer business: growth in commissions almost offsets decline in interest income Driven by the ongoing strength of customer business, Commerzbank?s revenues remained at a high level in the third quarter at ?2,735m (Q3\u00a02023: ?2,755m) ? despite provisions of ?227m for legal risks from foreign currency loans at Polish subsidiary mBank. The Bank benefited from accelerated growth in net commission income of around 8% to ?894m (Q3 2023: ?831m), to which both customer segments contributed. As anticipated, net interest income fell slightly to ?2,048m (Q3\u00a02023: ?2,166m, Q2\u00a02024: ?2,078m) as a result of the interest rate cuts, but remained at a high level. Between January and September, revenues increased to ?8,150m compared to the same period last year (9M\u00a02023: ?8,052m). Total costs increased only slightly in the third quarter to ?1,594m (Q3\u00a02023: ?1,549m). Compulsory contributions rose to ?64m (Q3\u00a02023: ?45m). Again, this was caused by the higher contributions to the Deposit Insurance Fund due to the increase in covered deposits. Operating expenses were also slightly higher than in the previous year at ?1,530m (Q3\u00a02023: ?1,504m). This was primarily due to higher costs incurred by mBank as a result of investments in future business growth and foreign currency effects. Other drivers were general salary increases in Germany, higher accruals for share-based variable compensation as a consequence of the strong rise in the Commerzbank share price and the increased cost base since the acquisition of Aquila Capital in June. These effects were partially offset by active cost management. Between January and September, costs fell by a total of around 1% to ?4,780m. The cost-income ratio was at 58.7% (9M\u00a02023: 59.7%). The risk result totalled minus ?255m in the third quarter (Q3\u00a02023: minus ?91m). It includes around minus\u00a0?147m from methodology updates, of which minus ?97m alone are intended to cover climate and environmental risks. In the ongoing economically challenging environment, the loan book proved to be overall robust, with three large individual cases impacting the risk result by minus ?130m. The non-performing exposure ratio (NPE ratio) was at low 0.9% (Q2\u00a02024: 0.8%). The Bank?s Top-Level Adjustment (TLA) decreased by ?94m due to reassessment. Taking into account the reduction in the TLA, the Bank still has ?242m (Q2 2024: ?336m) available mainly to cover expected secondary effects from geopolitical crises and uncertainties from inflation. After nine months, the risk result was at minus ?529m (9M 2023: minus\u00a0?367m). Overall, the operating result in the third quarter totalled ?886m (Q3\u00a02023: ?1,116m). Between January and September, it remained almost stable at ?2,841m (9M\u00a02023: ?2,879m). Net result after taxes and minority interests totalled ?642m in the third quarter (Q3 2023: ?684m), improving by 5% to ?1,926m after nine months (9M\u00a02023: ?1,829m). The Bank is therefore well on track to achieve its target of generating a higher profit for the financial year 2024 than in the previous year. Commerzbank?s Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1 ratio) was 14.8% as of 30 September (30\u00a0June\u00a02024: 14.8%, 30\u00a0September\u00a02023: 14.6%). The Bank continues to have a very comfortable buffer of 451\u00a0basis points to the regulatory minimum requirement (MDA threshold), which currently is 10.31%. Commerzbank has significant potential to return capital to its shareholders. The return on tangible equity (RoTE) was 8.7% in the third quarter (Q3\u00a02023: 9.6%) and improved to 8.8% between January and September (9M 2023: 8.6%). After nine months, the Bank is on track to achieve its target of at least 8% for the full year. ?We are consistently implementing our plans for the return of capital. We have applied for the second tranche of our share buyback to the ECB and the German Finance Agency. By further sharpening the financial targets of our Strategy until 2027 in September, we have also made it clear that we will improve our profitability beyond our original plans. This will enable us to return even more capital to our shareholders in the coming years?, said Bettina Orlopp. Segment performance: mBank more than doubles its operating result \u00a0The Corporate Clients segment generated revenues of ?1,121m in the third quarter (Q3\u00a02023: ?1,172m). After nine months, revenues were 5% higher compared to the same period of the previous year, totalling ?3,541m. Net commission income rose by around 5% to ?345m in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of the previous year. The syndication business and trade finance developed particularly strongly. Net interest income, however, fell, as anticipated, to ?629m (Q3\u00a02023: ?718m, Q2\u00a02024: ?678m) because of the recent interest rate cuts. The credit volume increased to ?100bn in the third quarter despite the challenging economic environment (Q2\u00a02024: ?99bn, Q3\u00a02023: ?97bn). The segment?s operating result totalled ?412m (Q3 2023: ?645m) and largely reflects the increased risk result in the third quarter. After the first nine months of the financial year, the operating result, which totalled ?1,623m, was almost on the same level as in the previous year (9M\u00a02023: ?1,637m). The Private and Small-Business Customers segment (PSBC) in Germany recorded stable revenues of ?1,044m in the third quarter (Q3\u00a02023: ?1,045m), despite the decline of interest rates. In the first nine months of the year, the segment?s revenues increased to ?3,276m (9M\u00a02023: ?3,240m). As anticipated, in the third quarter net interest income fell to ?537m (Q3\u00a02023: ?596m). However, the decline could largely be offset by a significant increase in net commission income by 8% to ?472m as well as valuation effects at the real estate subsidiary Commerz Real. The continued strength of the securities business had a positive effect on net commission income. Driven by the positive trend in the stock markets, the securities volume rose further to ?238bn by the end of September (end\u00a0of\u00a0June: ?233bn). The segment?s average deposit volume was stable in the third quarter at ?174bn (Q2\u00a02024: ?174bn) as well as the loan volume at an average of ?125bn (Q2\u00a02024: ?125bn). The volume of mortgage loans also remained unchanged at ?96bn (Q2\u00a02024: ?96bn). The segment's operating result of ?251m (Q3\u00a02023: ?298m) reflects, amongst others, the acquisition of Aquila Capital in June as well as increased expenses for the deposit guarantee scheme. After nine months, the result was 11% higher compared to the same period last year at ?985m (9M\u00a02023: ?885m). The Polish subsidiary mBank continued its dynamic growth in customer business. Revenues increased by a strong 40% to ?485m in the third quarter (Q3\u00a02023: ?346m), despite further provisions for legal risks for foreign currency loans totalling ?227m (Q3\u00a02023: ?234m). Between January and September, mBank?s revenues increased by one-third to ?1,239m (9M\u00a02023: ?929m). In the third quarter, net interest income rose to ?609m (Q3\u00a02023: ?561m), driven by the continued strong deposit and lending business. Net commission income also increased further, rising by around 13% to ?91m. mBank contributed ?203m to the Group?s operating result in the third quarter, more than twice as much as a year ago (Q3\u00a02023: ?89m). Without the impact of the legal risks associated with foreign currency loans and ?Credit Holidays?, the operating result would even have risen to ?404m in the third quarter (Q3\u00a02023: ?323m). In the first nine months of the year, mBank was able to more than double its operating result to ?432m compared to the same period last year (9M\u00a02023: ?175m). Outlook 2024: targets for net commission and net interest income as well as CET1 ratio raised After the first nine months of the year, Commerzbank confirms its profit target for the full year 2024: with a net result of around ?2.4bn, it is targeting a higher net result than in the 2023 financial year. The outlook is subject to the future development of burdens from Russia and foreign currency loans at mBank. Based on the strong results of the third quarter, the Bank is raising its forecast for net interest income from around ?8.1bn to around ?8.2bn for the full year. Net commission income also developed better than planned: the Bank now anticipates that net commission income will exceed the previous year?s figure by more than 5%. Previously, the Bank had anticipated net interest income to rise by 4%. On this basis, the Bank assumes revenues totalling ?10.9bn. Commerzbank now anticipates a CET1 ratio of around 15%. Previously, it had assumed a ratio of more than 14%. Commerzbank is still aiming for a cost-income ratio of around 60% for the current year. The Bank expects a risk result lower than minus ?800m for the full year assuming usage of\u00a0TLA. The Bank remains committed to its capital return plans and planned share buybacks: for this financial year, Commerzbank is aiming to return at least 70% of net result to its shareholders ? but not more than the net result after deduction of AT1 coupon payments. On 4 November, the Bank decided to start its third share buyback programme soon. Previously, the German Finance Agency and ECB had given their approval for the first tranche of ?600m. As planned, Commerzbank has applied to the ECB and the German Finance Agency for the second tranche of up to ?400m, based on the third quarter results. By strengthening the financial targets of its Strategy until 2027 in September, the Bank is increasing its capital return potential.

Net result increased to around EUR2.7 bn, which is higher than the recently targeted EUR2.4 bn. This means that the Bank increased its result by around 20% compared to the previous year. At the same time, it achieved its highest profit ever. Its revenues were the main driver: thanks to strong customer business, revenues rose by around 6% to EUR11.1 bn compared to the previous year and also exceeded the target set in autumn 2024. Despite inflation and slightly higher costs related to investments, the cost-income ratio improved to 59%, placing it below the original target of 60%. The return on tangible equity increased to 9.2%, significantly exceeding the target of at least 8%. The Bank has created a strong starting point with a series of excellent results in recent years. Commerzbank is now using this momentum to accelerate its profitable growth and to continue to advance the transformation by executing its upgraded strategy for the coming years.  Commerzbank's CEO Bettina Orlopp said: \"We have delivered again. With yet another record result, we have shown that we are creating substantial added value for our shareholders, customers, and employees. We have significantly increased our profitability, expanded our fee business as previously announced, continued to improve our cost-income ratio, and are an even more attractive employer. This provides us with a strong basis for the years to come.\"  Successful business development in 2024 creates a strong starting point for upgraded strategy  In the financial year 2024, revenues increased to EUR11,106 m (2023: EUR10,461 m). The growth was driven by the strong fee business. Net commission income increased by 7% to EUR3,638 m (2023: EUR3,386 m) thanks to the dynamic securities business and positive development in asset management. It exceeded the growth target, which was raised to more than 5% in September. Net interest income remained at a high level at EUR8,331 m (2023: EUR8,368 m). The ongoing growth in deposits and adjustments in the replication portfolio for the long-term stabilisation of net interest income compensated for the impact of interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB).  Total costs for the 2024 financial year were slightly higher at EUR6,526 m (2023: EUR6,422 m), primarily caused by increased administrative expenses, which rose to EUR6,244 m (2023: EUR6,006 m). This was mainly due to investments in the growth of mBank and higher personnel expenses. The consolidation of Aquila Capital effective since June had an impact, alongside salary increases. The Bank was able to partly compensate for these through active cost management and cost savings. Compulsory contributions decreased to EUR283 m for the full year (2023: EUR415 m), mainly because the European bank levy was significantly lower, as the Single Resolution Fund's target volume was achieved. The cost-income ratio improved to 59% (2023: 61%).  The risk result for the financial year 2024 totalled minus EUR743 m (2023: minus EUR618 m), mainly driven by single cases. The loan book continued to prove its overall resilience in a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the end of the year, the non-performing exposure (NPE) ratio was 1.1% (Q3 2024: 0.9%; Q4 2023: 0.8%). The top-level adjustment (TLA) was reduced by EUR14 m due to reassessment in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the Bank continues to have EUR228 m (Q3 2024: EUR242 m; Q4 2023: EUR453 m) mainly available to cover expected secondary effects from geopolitical crises and uncertainties from inflation.  The Bank's operating result increased by 12% to EUR3,837 m (2023: EUR3,421 m) in the financial year 2024. Net result after taxes and minority interests also rose significantly compared to the previous year: it increased by 20% to EUR2,667 m (2023: EUR2,224 m).  The CET 1 ratio rose to a comfortable 15.1% as of 31 December 2024, which underpins the Bank's very high potential for returning capital to its shareholders (Q3 2024: 14.8%; Q4 2023: 14.7%). The current buffer to the regulatory minimum requirement (MDA threshold) of around 10.3% is therefore 485 basis points. The return on tangible equity (RoTE) continued to significantly improve, reaching 9.2% in the financial year 2024 (2023: 7.7%). This means that the Bank clearly exceeded its aims to achieve a return on tangible equity of at least 8% for the full year.  Based on its strong results, Commerzbank will give back a total of around EUR1.73 bn - 71% of its net result after deduction of AT 1 coupons - to its shareholders for the financial year 2024. Part of the capital return is the Bank's third share buyback programme. In January this year, the Bank concluded the buyback of the first tranche, which it began in 2024, with a volume of around EUR600 m. The ECB and the German Finance Agency have already approved a second tranche of up to EUR400 m. The share buyback will start after the reporting for the 2024 financial year and is expected to be completed by the Annual General Meeting at the latest. Furthermore, the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board intend to propose a dividend of 65 cents per share (previous year: 35 cents per share) at the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2025. The Bank will return around EUR3.1 bn to its shareholders in total for the years 2022 to 2024, which is more than originally announced.  Designated CFO, Carsten Schmitt, explained: \"Commerzbank has what it takes to increase returns for shareholders in the years to come. Continually raising revenues, strict cost discipline, and a dynamic capital return provide the foundation for reliably increasing the Bank's profitability.\"  Segment development: loan volumes continue to rise in Corporate Clients segment  The Corporate Clients segment increased its revenues in the financial year 2024 by a total of 5% across all client groups to EUR4,724 m (2023: EUR4,486 m). Net commission income climbed by around 7% to EUR1,379 m (2023: EUR1,284 m). The main drivers were increased business activity in loan syndications and bond issuance. Growth in foreign trade and the financing of green infrastructure projects for renewable energies (CoC GIF) also had a positive impact. However, as expected, net interest income was slightly lower at EUR2,670 m (2023: EUR2,782 m) due to the downward trend of interest rates on deposits. Despite the challenging economic environment in the final quarter, loan volume growth continued: the loan volume rose by a further EUR4 bn compared to the third quarter to a total of EUR104 bn at the end of the year (Q4 2023: EUR95 bn). The increase is largely attributed to investment loans for the green transformation, the public sector and institutional clients. At EUR2,060 m, operating result was slightly below the previous year (2023: EUR2,147 m).  Significantly improved result in Private and Small-Business Customers segment  The Private and Small-Business Customers segment in Germany generated revenues of EUR4,440 m in the financial year 2024, a 7% increase compared to the previous year (2023: EUR4,134 m). Thanks to higher contribution from the deposit business, net interest income climbed by around 8% to EUR2,384 m (2023: EUR2,208 m) despite interest rate cuts by the ECB. Net commission income rose by 7% to EUR1,964 m (2023: EUR1,833 m), with strong performance in the securities business, supported by the positive market development and strategic initiatives in asset management, contributing significantly to the growth. Additionally, the segment saw strong growth in savings plans. The segment's operating result for the full year improved by 56% to EUR1,362 m (2023: EUR873 m).  In 2024, the securities volume rose significantly to EUR243 bn as per the end of December (Q4 2023: EUR215 bn), as a result of the strong market development. Loan volume averaged EUR125 bn in the final quarter, which is equal to the level of the previous quarter (Q4 2023: EUR125 bn); the average mortgage volume for the fourth quarter was EUR96 bn (Q4 2023: EUR95 bn). The Bank also gained customer deposits in the past financial year; the average deposit volume rose to EUR173 bn in the fourth quarter compared to the same quarter of the previous year (Q4 2023: EUR156 bn).  The Polish subsidiary mBank continued its strong growth in customer business in 2024. It increased its revenues by 38% to EUR1,702 m (2023: EUR1,235 m). Net commission income increased by 11% to EUR348 m (2023: EUR313 m) and net interest income rose by 9% to EUR2,382 m (2023: EUR2,176 m). This allowed mBank to compensate for provisions for legal risks for foreign currency loans (FX) totalling EUR1,002 m (2023: EUR1,094 m). mBank contributed EUR599 m to the Group's operating result in the 2024 financial year, more than four times as much as in the previous year (2023: EUR146 m). Without the impact of provisions for legal risks associated with foreign currency loans and \"credit holidays\", it would have contributed an even higher amount of EUR1,636 m in 2024 (2023: EUR1,228 m).  \"We have built a strong foundation and can now leverage market opportunities and technological advancements. With this momentum, we are accelerating our profitable growth and consistently driving forward our transformation,\" said CEO Bettina Orlopp. \"This makes Commerzbank stronger and better.\"  Strategy \"Momentum\": significant increase in financial targets until 2028  With its upgraded strategy \"Momentum\", Commerzbank has set significantly more ambitious targets than before. The RoTE is expected to improve to 15% by 2028. This means that the Bank will earn significantly more than its cost of capital and be a well-established player amongst the successful banks in Europe. It is aiming to increase its net result to EUR4.2 bn by 2028. With only a moderate rise in costs, revenues are expected to increase significantly: The Bank anticipates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% excluding provisions for legal risks for FX loans at mBank to EUR14.2 bn by 2028. The main driver will be net commission income, while a moderate increase in net interest income is expected despite ongoing interest rate cuts. The Bank plans to continue to significantly improve its cost-income ratio to around 50% - an internationally competitive level.  Commerzbank's revised financial targets, which were published in September 2024, initially extended until the year 2027. These targets are now anticipated to be partially exceeded as early as 2027 on the way to reaching the more ambitious targets by the end of 2028. The Bank aimed for a net result target of EUR3.6 bn in 2027. Based on its \"Momentum\" strategy, the Bank now forecasts a net result of EUR3.8 bn for 2027. Revenues are projected to rise to EUR13.6 bn instead of the previously expected EUR13.3 bn, and the Bank is targeting a return on equity of 13.6% rather than the previous target of 12.3%. In September 2024, the Bank's cost-income ratio target was 54%. Its new target for 2027 is 53%.  Commerzbank focusses on growth potential and strengthens its digital distribution channels  To achieve the targets of its upgraded strategy by 2028 and to accelerate its profitable growth, Commerzbank will continue to leverage further potential from its business model over the coming years. In doing so, the Bank will focus on its acknowledged strengths in the business with private and small-business customers, including its asset and wealth management, which is expected to continue to grow following recent acquisitions, the further expansion of its market leadership position in the Mittelstand, and the growth of mBank. In all business segments, the Bank will, in addition, consistently advance its offering of digital processes, solutions, and product offerings, including through the expansion of sales partnerships.  In the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, the Bank will sharpen its two-brand strategy with stronger price and product differentiation. The Commerzbank brand will continue to stand for access to a branch network with a comprehensive range of services and personal advice, in addition to extensive digital offerings. Under the brand comdirect, the Bank offers all core services as a digital primary bank and, as a performance broker, solutions for saving, investing, and securities trading.  Furthermore, the Bank aims to expand its new loan volume with private and small-business customers. It will also modernise its payment business and further strengthen its omnichannel approach. Already today, more than 90% of customer contacts are digital. More than 50% of product sales in the Commerzbank brand are concluded digitally. In addition to the various online and mobile offerings as well as the established remote advisory centre, branches remain an important sales channel that will be structurally strengthened by an adjusted advisory model. Customer areas and sales structures will be reorganised to free up more time for qualified customer advisory services at the locations. The model will be implemented in the fourth quarter of 2025. In this context, the Bank will also strengthen personal advice in Private Banking and Wealth Management.  In the Corporate Clients segment, Commerzbank will focus on an even stronger penetration of its clients in the Mittelstand and large client groups. To this end, the Mittelstandsbank Direkt team will be staffed up to ensure more active client support. Moreover, Commerzbank is strengthening its financing solutions offerings, particularly for large corporate clients, and supports Mittelstand businesses in the area of succession financing. Both advisory and financing also play an important role regarding strategic sustainability topics such as decarbonisation and the establishment of reporting around the dimensions of environment, social, and governance (ESG).  The Corporate Clients segment will also focus on international growth and strengthen its business with German clients in the USA and Asia. The Bank also plans to intensify business relationships with North American and Asian companies in selected sectors. Additional revenue potential will be gained through the acquisition of new corporate clients with increased RWA (risk-weighted assets) efficiency. On the product side, the range of services for foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity products, and transaction banking, especially for payment transactions and foreign trade business, will be specifically strengthened. Commerzbank will also significantly increase its capital efficiency and utilise securitisation to free up even more capital.  Measures to accelerate organic growth will be complemented with targeted acquisitions. Alongside this, Commerzbank aims to pursue further strategic partnerships, especially with a focus on developing innovative products, distribution channels, and IT services. Visa will become strategic partner of Commerzbank for payment cards. The two companies agreed on a long-term partnership. It supports Commerzbank's strategic direction in payments and ensures the Bank's access to future payment innovations. Commerzbank customers will preferentially receive debit and credit cards from Visa in the future.  Extensive investments in digitalisation and artificial intelligence increase efficiency  In addition to accelerating profitable growth, the consistent continuation of its own transformation is at the core of the Bank's upgraded strategy. These measures aim to reduce the complexity of processes and make Commerzbank on the whole even leaner and more efficient.  The Bank will further increase its productivity, particularly by modernising and efficiently utilising technologies. This includes accelerating digitalisation activities, for example, by using modern technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI). It will also invest in consistently modernising and streamlining its IT infrastructure.  As part of this, the Bank has already signed strategic partnerships with Google Cloud and Microsoft. The target is to significantly accelerate the transformation of the digital landscape by collaborating closely in the AI and Cloud space and by bringing skills and resources together.  For a competitive cost base, the Bank will also focus on scaling shoring and sourcing activities within the group and reducing its dependency on external service providers. The Bank will utilise international locations as well as nearshore and offshore subsidiaries to a greater extent than before, which should increase access to skilled specialists.  The efficiency gains from digitalisation, as well as the increased use of international locations, will be accompanied by further job reductions. In total, around 3,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions are expected to be cut by 2028. With approximately 3,300 FTEs this affects mainly central staff functions and Operations in Germany. At the same time, there will be an increase in staffing in selected areas, such as the international locations and at mBank. Ultimately, the number of employees in the Commerzbank Group is expected to remain constant at 36,700 FTEs worldwide.  To make the transformation process socially acceptable, Commerzbank will rely primarily on demographic change and natural fluctuations. For instance, the Bank will be offering an early partial retirement programme this year. The Bank has already agreed on these key principles in a joint transformation agreement with the employee unions. The Bank estimates restructuring charges of around EUR700 m before tax effects in 2025. The specific design of personnel measures will be subject of upcoming negotiations with employee unions.  Commerzbank will continue to ensure its attractiveness as an employer and to further raise the motivation and performance of its employees through extensive measures. For instance, the Bank is focussing on a modern, flexible workplace concept for its employees. Another planned measure is the introduction of an employee share programme to increasingly involve its employees in the Bank's future success.  Outlook for 2025: Higher net result targeted again thanks to \"Momentum\"  In 2025, Commerzbank will make significant progress towards achieving its financial targets by the end of 2028. The Bank aims for a net result of EUR2.8 bn before restructuring charges for the transformation of the Bank, while expecting a net result of EUR2.4 bn after restructuring charges. The outlook remains subject to the future development of burdens from Russia and FX loans at mBank. The Bank expects a net interest income between EUR7.7 bn and EUR7.9 bn, depending on the interest rate development and the related fair value movement between EUR0.4 bn and EUR0.3 bn, leading to a combined contribution of EUR8.1 to EUR8.2 bn. Net commission income is planned to increase by around 7%. The Bank is targeting a cost-income ratio of 57%. The risk result is expected around minus EUR850 m for the full year assuming usage of TLA. Commerzbank expects its CET 1 ratio to be at least 14% after the planned capital return and restructuring charges.  Capital return until 2028: payout ratio of 100% targeted  As the CET 1 ratio increased to 15.1% at the end of 2024 and anticipating significantly increasing results, there is an even higher potential for capital return in the coming years than previously forecast. For 2025, the Bank plans a payout ratio of more than 100% of its net result after restructuring charges and deduction of AT 1 coupon payments. Before restructuring charges, the payout ratio amounts to 100% of the net result after deduction of AT 1 coupon payments. In the years 2026 to 2028, it aims for a payout ratio of 100% after deduction of AT 1 coupon payments - subject to the successful implementation of the strategy and the macroeconomic environment. As a result, the CET 1 ratio up to 2028 will approach the target level of 13.5%.

Financial results for 2024: 2024 targets exceeded: net result increased by 20% to around ?2.7 bn ? operating result improved by 12% to ?3.8\u00a0bn  Revenues up 6% to ?11.1\u00a0bn driven by strong customer business  Net commission income up 7% to ?3.6\u00a0bn; materially better than forecast\u00a0? net interest income remains strong at ?8.3\u00a0bn despite interest rate cuts  Risk result at minus ?743\u00a0m demonstrates resilience of loan portfolio  Cost-income ratio improved to 59%  9.2% return on tangible equity much higher than target of at least 8%  Capital return for 2024 increased to around ?1.73 bn ? dividend of 65\u00a0cents per share planned Strategy upgrade until 2028 ? Commerzbank leverages strong momentum: Bank will further accelerate its profitable growth ? strategic focus on expanding business in asset and wealth management ? Corporate Clients segment primarily focussing on stronger client penetration and capital efficiency  Continual revenue growth expected despite further interest rate cuts ? net commission income expected to increase by around 7% on average   Digitalisation, artificial intelligence, and increased use of international shoring locations create greater efficiency gains  In 2025 net result target of ?2.4\u00a0bn after and ?2.8\u00a0bn before restructuring charges for transformation  Cost-income ratio expected to improve to around 50% in 2028  Net result target of ?4.2\u00a0bn and return on tangible equity target of 15% for 2028 Attractive capital return until 2028: For 2025 planned payout ratio of 100% of net result after deduction of AT\u00a01 coupons and before restructuring charges for transformation  For 2026 to 2028, payout ratio of 100% of net result after deduction of AT\u00a01 coupons planned ? subject to successful strategy implementation and macroeconomic environment  Commerzbank continued to develop dynamically in the financial year 2024 and exceeded its ambitious targets, which were raised during the year. Net result increased to around ?2.7\u00a0bn, which is higher than the recently targeted ?2.4\u00a0bn. This means that the Bank increased its result by around 20% compared to the previous year. At the same time, it achieved its highest profit ever. Its revenues were the main driver: thanks to strong customer business, revenues rose by around 6% to ?11.1\u00a0bn compared to the previous year and also exceeded the target set in autumn 2024. Despite inflation and slightly higher costs related to investments, the cost-income ratio improved to 59%, placing it below the original target of 60%. The return on tangible equity increased to 9.2%, significantly exceeding the target of at least 8%. The Bank has created a strong starting point with a series of excellent results in recent years. Commerzbank is now using this momentum to accelerate its profitable growth and to continue to advance the transformation by executing its upgraded strategy for the coming years. Commerzbank?s CEO Bettina Orlopp said: ?We have delivered again. With yet another record result, we have shown that we are creating substantial added value for our shareholders, customers, and employees. We have significantly increased our profitability, expanded our fee business as previously announced, continued to improve our cost-income ratio, and are an even more attractive employer. This provides us with a strong basis for the years to come.? Successful business development in 2024 creates a strong starting point for upgraded strategy In the financial year 2024, revenues increased to ?11,106\u00a0m (2023: ?10,461\u00a0m). The growth was driven by the strong fee business. Net commission income increased by 7% to ?3,638\u00a0m (2023: ?3,386\u00a0m) thanks to the dynamic securities business and positive development in asset management. It exceeded the growth target, which was raised to more than 5% in September. Net interest income remained at a high level at ?8,331\u00a0m (2023: ?8,368\u00a0m). The ongoing growth in deposits and adjustments in the replication portfolio for the long-term stabilisation of net interest income compensated for the impact of interest rate cuts by the European Central Bank (ECB). Total costs for the 2024 financial year were slightly higher at ?6,526 m (2023: ?6,422\u00a0m), primarily caused by increased administrative expenses, which rose to ?6,244\u00a0m (2023: ?6,006\u00a0m). This was mainly due to investments in the growth of mBank and higher personnel expenses. The consolidation of Aquila Capital effective since June had an impact, alongside salary increases. The Bank was able to partly compensate for these through active cost management and cost savings. Compulsory contributions decreased to ?283\u00a0m for the full year (2023: ?415\u00a0m), mainly because the European bank levy was significantly lower, as the Single Resolution Fund?s target volume was achieved. The cost-income ratio improved to 59% (2023: 61%). The risk result for the financial year 2024 totalled minus ?743\u00a0m (2023: minus ?618\u00a0m), mainly driven by single cases. The loan book continued to prove its overall resilience in a challenging macroeconomic environment. At the end of the year, the non-performing exposure (NPE) ratio was 1.1% (Q3 2024: 0.9%; Q4\u00a02023: 0.8%). The top-level adjustment (TLA) was reduced by ?14\u00a0m due to reassessment in the fourth quarter. Therefore, the Bank continues to have ?228\u00a0m (Q3 2024: ?242\u00a0m; Q4 2023: ?453\u00a0m) mainly available to cover expected secondary effects from geopolitical crises and uncertainties from inflation. The Bank?s operating result increased by 12% to ?3,837\u00a0m (2023: ?3,421\u00a0m) in the financial year 2024. Net result after taxes and minority interests also rose significantly compared to the previous year: it increased by 20% to ?2,667\u00a0m (2023: ?2,224\u00a0m). The CET\u00a01 ratio rose to a comfortable 15.1% as of 31 December 2024, which underpins the Bank?s very high potential for returning capital to its shareholders (Q3 2024: 14.8%; Q4 2023: 14.7%). The current buffer to the regulatory minimum requirement (MDA threshold) of around 10.3% is therefore 485 basis points. The return on tangible equity (RoTE) continued to significantly improve, reaching 9.2% in the financial year 2024 (2023: 7.7%). This means that the Bank clearly exceeded its aims to achieve a return on tangible equity of at least 8% for the full year. Based on its strong results, Commerzbank will give back a total of around ?1.73\u00a0bn ? 71% of its net result after deduction of AT\u00a01 coupons ? to its shareholders for the financial year 2024. Part of the capital return is the Bank?s third share buyback programme. In January this year, the Bank concluded the buyback of the first tranche, which it began in 2024, with a volume of around ?600\u00a0m. The ECB and the German Finance Agency have already approved a second tranche of up to ?400\u00a0m. The share buyback will start after the reporting for the 2024 financial year and is expected to be completed by the Annual General Meeting at the latest. Furthermore, the Board of Managing Directors and the Supervisory Board intend to propose a dividend of 65\u00a0cents per share (previous year: 35\u00a0cents per share) at the Annual General Meeting on 15 May 2025. The Bank will return around ?3.1 bn to its shareholders in total for the years 2022 to 2024, which is more than originally announced. Designated CFO, Carsten Schmitt, explained: ?Commerzbank has what it takes to increase returns for shareholders in the years to come. Continually raising revenues, strict cost discipline, and a dynamic capital return provide the foundation for reliably increasing the Bank?s profitability.? Segment development: loan volumes continue to rise in Corporate Clients segment The Corporate Clients segment increased its revenues in the financial year 2024 by a total of 5% across all client groups to ?4,724\u00a0m (2023: ?4,486\u00a0m). Net commission income climbed by around 7% to ?1,379 m (2023: ?1,284\u00a0m). The main drivers were increased business activity in loan syndications and bond issuance. Growth in foreign trade and the financing of green infrastructure projects for renewable energies (CoC\u00a0GIF) also had a positive impact. However, as expected, net interest income was slightly lower at ?2,670\u00a0m (2023:\u00a0?2,782\u00a0m) due to the downward trend of interest rates on deposits. Despite the challenging economic environment in the final quarter, loan volume growth continued: the loan volume rose by a further ?4\u00a0bn compared to the third quarter to a total of ?104\u00a0bn at the end of the year (Q4\u00a02023: ?95\u00a0bn). The increase is largely attributed to investment loans for the green transformation, the public sector and institutional clients. At ?2,060\u00a0m, operating result was slightly below the previous year (2023: ?2,147\u00a0m). Significantly improved result in Private and Small-Business Customers segment The Private and Small-Business Customers segment in Germany generated revenues of ?4,440\u00a0m in the financial year 2024, a 7% increase compared to the previous year (2023: ?4,134\u00a0m). Thanks to higher contribution from the deposit business, net interest income climbed by around 8% to ?2,384\u00a0m (2023:\u00a0?2,208\u00a0m) despite interest rate cuts by the ECB. Net commission income rose by 7% to ?1,964\u00a0m (2023:\u00a0?1,833\u00a0m), with strong performance in the securities business, supported by the positive market development and strategic initiatives in asset management, contributing significantly to the growth. Additionally, the segment saw strong growth in savings plans. The segment?s operating result for the full year improved by 56% to ?1,362\u00a0m (2023: ?873\u00a0m). In 2024, the securities volume rose significantly to ?243\u00a0bn as per the end of December (Q4 2023: ?215\u00a0bn), as a result of the strong market development. Loan volume averaged ?125\u00a0bn in the final quarter, which is equal to the level of the previous quarter (Q4\u00a02023: ?125\u00a0bn); the average mortgage volume for the fourth\u00a0quarter was ?96\u00a0bn (Q4\u00a02023: ?95\u00a0bn). The Bank also gained customer deposits in the past financial year; the average deposit volume rose to ?173\u00a0bn in the fourth\u00a0quarter compared to the same quarter of the previous year (Q4\u00a02023: ?156\u00a0bn). The Polish subsidiary mBank continued its strong growth in customer business in 2024. It increased its revenues by 38% to ?1,702\u00a0m (2023: ?1,235\u00a0m). Net commission income increased by 11% to ?348\u00a0m (2023: ?313\u00a0m) and net interest income rose by 9% to ?2,382\u00a0m (2023: ?2,176\u00a0m). This allowed mBank to compensate for provisions for legal risks for foreign currency loans (FX) totalling ?1,002\u00a0m (2023: ?1,094\u00a0m). mBank contributed ?599\u00a0m to the Group?s operating result in the 2024 financial year, more than four times as much as in the previous year (2023: ?146\u00a0m). Without the impact of provisions for legal risks associated with foreign currency loans and ?credit holidays?, it would have contributed an even higher amount of ?1,636\u00a0m in 2024 (2023: ?1,228\u00a0m). ?We have built a strong foundation and can now leverage market opportunities and technological advancements. With this momentum, we are accelerating our profitable growth and consistently driving forward our transformation,? said CEO Bettina Orlopp. ?This makes Commerzbank stronger and better.? Strategy ?Momentum?: significant increase in financial targets until 2028  With its upgraded strategy ?Momentum?, Commerzbank has set significantly more ambitious targets than before. The RoTE is expected to improve to 15% by 2028. This means that the Bank will earn significantly more than its cost of capital and be a well-established player amongst the successful banks in Europe. It is aiming to increase its net result to ?4.2\u00a0bn by 2028. With only a moderate rise in costs, revenues are expected to increase significantly: The Bank anticipates a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 4% excluding provisions for legal risks for FX loans at mBank to ?14.2\u00a0bn by 2028. The main driver will be net commission income, while a moderate increase in net interest income is expected despite ongoing interest rate cuts. The Bank plans to continue to significantly improve its cost-income ratio to around 50% ? an internationally competitive level. Commerzbank?s revised financial targets, which were published in September 2024, initially extended until the year 2027. These targets are now anticipated to be partially exceeded as early as 2027 on the way to reaching the more ambitious targets by the end of 2028. The Bank aimed for a net result target of ?3.6\u00a0bn in 2027. Based on its ?Momentum? strategy, the Bank now forecasts a net result of ?3.8\u00a0bn for 2027. Revenues are projected to rise to ?13.6\u00a0bn instead of the previously expected ?13.3\u00a0bn, and the Bank is targeting a return on equity of 13.6% rather than the previous target of 12.3%. In September 2024, the Bank?s cost-income ratio target was 54%. Its new target for 2027 is 53%. Commerzbank focusses on growth potential and strengthens its digital distribution channels To achieve the targets of its upgraded strategy by 2028 and to accelerate its profitable growth, Commerzbank will continue to leverage further potential from its business model over the coming years. In doing so, the Bank will focus on its acknowledged strengths in the business with private and small-business customers, including its asset and wealth management, which is expected to continue to grow following recent acquisitions, the further expansion of its market leadership position in the Mittelstand, and the growth of mBank. In all business segments, the Bank will, in addition, consistently advance its offering of digital processes, solutions, and product offerings, including through the expansion of sales partnerships. In the Private and Small-Business Customers segment, the Bank will sharpen its two-brand strategy with stronger price and product differentiation. The Commerzbank brand will continue to stand for access to a branch network with a comprehensive range of services and personal advice, in addition to extensive digital offerings. Under the brand comdirect, the Bank offers all core services as a digital primary bank and, as a performance broker, solutions for saving, investing, and securities trading. Furthermore, the Bank aims to expand its new loan volume with private and small-business customers. It will also modernise its payment business and further strengthen its omnichannel approach. Already today, more than 90% of customer contacts are digital. More than 50% of product sales in the Commerzbank brand are concluded digitally. In addition to the various online and mobile offerings as well as the established remote advisory centre, branches remain an important sales channel that will be structurally strengthened by an adjusted advisory model. Customer areas and sales structures will be reorganised to free up more time for qualified customer advisory services at the locations. The model will be implemented in the fourth\u00a0quarter of 2025. In this context, the Bank will also strengthen personal advice in Private Banking and Wealth Management. In the Corporate Clients segment, Commerzbank will focus on an even stronger penetration of its clients in the Mittelstand and large client groups. To this end, the Mittelstandsbank Direkt team will be staffed up to ensure more active client support. Moreover, Commerzbank is strengthening its financing solutions offerings, particularly for large corporate clients, and supports Mittelstand businesses in the area of succession financing. Both advisory and financing also play an important role regarding strategic sustainability topics such as decarbonisation and the establishment of reporting around the dimensions of environment, social, and governance (ESG). The Corporate Clients segment will also focus on international growth and strengthen its business with German clients in the USA and Asia. The Bank also plans to intensify business relationships with North American and Asian companies in selected sectors. Additional revenue potential will be gained through the acquisition of new corporate clients with increased RWA (risk-weighted assets) efficiency. On the product side, the range of services for foreign exchange, interest rate, and commodity products, and transaction banking, especially for payment transactions and foreign trade business, will be specifically strengthened. Commerzbank will also significantly increase its capital efficiency and utilise securitisation to free up even more capital. Measures to accelerate organic growth will be complemented with targeted acquisitions. Alongside this, Commerzbank aims to pursue further strategic partnerships, especially with a focus on developing innovative products, distribution channels, and IT services. Visa will become strategic partner of Commerzbank for payment cards. The two companies agreed on a long-term partnership. It supports Commerzbank?s strategic direction in payments and ensures the Bank?s access to future payment innovations. Commerzbank customers will preferentially receive debit and credit cards from Visa in the future. Extensive investments in digitalisation and artificial intelligence increase efficiency In addition to accelerating profitable growth, the consistent continuation of its own transformation is at the core of the Bank?s upgraded strategy. These measures aim to reduce the complexity of processes and make Commerzbank on the whole even leaner and more efficient. The Bank will further increase its productivity, particularly by modernising and efficiently utilising technologies. This includes accelerating digitalisation activities, for example, by using modern technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI). It will also invest in consistently modernising and streamlining its IT infrastructure. As part of this, the Bank has already signed strategic partnerships with Google Cloud and Microsoft. The target is to significantly accelerate the transformation of the digital landscape by collaborating closely in the AI and Cloud space and by bringing skills and resources together. For a competitive cost base, the Bank will also focus on scaling shoring and sourcing activities within the group and reducing its dependency on external service providers. The Bank will utilise international locations as well as nearshore and offshore subsidiaries to a greater extent than before, which should increase access to skilled specialists. The efficiency gains from digitalisation, as well as the increased use of international locations, will be accompanied by further job reductions. In total, around 3,900 full-time equivalent (FTE) positions are expected to be cut by 2028. With approximately 3,300 FTEs this affects mainly central staff functions and Operations in Germany. At the same time, there will be an increase in staffing in selected areas, such as the international locations and at mBank. Ultimately, the number of employees in the Commerzbank Group is expected to remain constant at 36,700 FTEs worldwide. To make the transformation process socially acceptable, Commerzbank will rely primarily on demographic change and natural fluctuations. For instance, the Bank will be offering an early partial retirement programme this year. The Bank has already agreed on these key principles in a joint transformation agreement with the employee unions. The Bank estimates restructuring charges of around ?700\u00a0m before tax effects in 2025. The specific design of personnel measures will be subject of upcoming negotiations with employee unions. Commerzbank will continue to ensure its attractiveness as an employer and to further raise the motivation and performance of its employees through extensive measures. For instance, the Bank is focussing on a modern, flexible workplace concept for its employees. Another planned measure is the introduction of an employee share programme to increasingly involve its employees in the Bank?s future success. Outlook for 2025: Higher net result targeted again thanks to ?Momentum? In 2025, Commerzbank will make significant progress towards achieving its financial targets by the end of 2028. The Bank aims for a net result of ?2.8\u00a0bn before restructuring charges for the transformation of the Bank, while expecting a net result of ?2.4\u00a0bn after restructuring charges. The outlook remains subject to the future development of burdens from Russia and FX loans at mBank. The Bank expects a net interest income between ?7.7\u00a0bn and ?7.9\u00a0bn, depending on the interest rate development and the related fair value movement between ?0.4\u00a0bn and ?0.3\u00a0bn, leading to a combined contribution of ?8.1 to ?8.2\u00a0bn. Net commission income is planned to increase by around 7%. The Bank is targeting a cost-income ratio of 57%. The risk result is expected around minus\u00a0?850\u00a0m for the full year assuming usage of TLA. Commerzbank expects its CET\u00a01 ratio to be at least 14% after the planned capital return and restructuring charges. Capital return until 2028: payout ratio of 100% targeted  As the CET\u00a01 ratio increased to 15.1% at the end of 2024 and anticipating significantly increasing results, there is an even higher potential for capital return in the coming years than previously forecast. For 2025, the Bank plans a payout ratio of more than 100% of its net result after restructuring charges and deduction of AT\u00a01 coupon payments. Before restructuring charges, the payout ratio amounts to 100% of the net result after deduction of AT\u00a01 coupon payments. In the years 2026 to 2028, it aims for a payout ratio of 100% after deduction of AT 1 coupon payments ? subject to the successful implementation of the strategy and the macroeconomic environment. As a result, the CET\u00a01 ratio up to 2028 will approach the target level of 13.5%.

The customer business developed very well in the third quarter. We are particularly pleased with the growth in net commission income. This shows that our growth initiatives are increasingly paying off, thanks to the very consistent implementation of our strategy. This helps us to cushion the effect of decreasing interest rates and to broaden our revenue base for the future.\" Bettina Orlopp, CEO  Commerzbank has improved its outlook for the 2024 financial year after the first nine months: net interest income and net commission income developed better than anticipated in the third quarter, which is why the Bank is raising its targets for both key figures. The Bank also confirms its forecast for 2024 of achieving a higher net result than in 2023. It anticipates a net result of around EUR2.4bn after reaching EUR2.2bn in the 2023 financial year. This means the Bank is once again heading for a record profit for the full year. In the third quarter, growth in net commission income accelerated to around 8% compared to the same quarter of the previous year. Growth in the securities business and asset management as well as in the syndication business and trade finance had a particularly positive effect. In contrast, net interest income fell slightly due to the European Central Bank's (ECB's) recent interest rate cuts, but the Bank benefited from the continuing high volume of deposits. Despite the economically challenging environment, the credit volume in the Corporate Clients segment rose to EUR100bn in the third quarter. In the Mittelstand alone, the loan volume increased by 3% compared to the previous quarter to EUR62bn. The loan book remains robust. Between January and September, revenues rose to a total of EUR8.2bn. With EUR1.9bn after taxes and minorities, the Bank earned 5% more in the first nine months of this year than in the same time of the previous year.  The Bank continued implementing its strategic initiatives in the third quarter. A few weeks after successfully acquiring a majority stake in Aquila Capital, the Bank started the distribution of Aquila products with the launch of the European long-term investment fund (ELTIF) \"AC One Planet\". The demand from Commerzbank customers for this long-term fund, which invests in pioneering projects in the field of renewable energy, is very high. The Bank is also expanding its offering for ultra-high-net-worth individuals and family offices, substantiating Commerzbank's growth ambitions in this segment. The relevant skill sets and highly specialised departments will be brought together in a separate division. In addition to the existing services in Berlin, D\\xFCsseldorf, Frankfurt am Main and Munich, the Bank is also establishing two new locations in Hamburg and Stuttgart for comprehensive advisory services for this customer group.  The Bank is also continuing to implement its strategic plans abroad. To further strengthen its technological development, Commerzbank has opened a new \"IT factory\" in Malaysia. Commerzbank is furthermore making good progress in its commitment to sustainability: growth in the Green Infrastructure Finance division, which focuses on project financing for renewable energies and other green infrastructure, already exceeded the record year 2023 after nine months. Between January and September, net growth in the financing volume amounted to around EUR1.1bn (full year 2023: EUR1bn).  \"Our figures and our strong customer business emphasise that our strategy is paying off. Even in an environment of decreasing interest rates, we are delivering stable revenues and strong results. We believe we have great potential for growth, particularly in asset management and wealth management. In the lending business, we want to continue to grow in the Mittelstand business\", said Bettina Orlopp, Commerzbank's CEO. \"To further increase the Bank's profitability in the coming years and create sustainable value for our shareholders, we are currently working hard on upgrading our strategy for the coming years. The results will be presented on 13 February 2025.\"  Strong customer business: growth in commissions almost offsets decline in interest income  Driven by the ongoing strength of customer business, Commerzbank's revenues remained at a high level in the third quarter at EUR2,735m (Q3 2023: EUR2,755m) - despite provisions of EUR227m for legal risks from foreign currency loans at Polish subsidiary mBank. The Bank benefited from accelerated growth in net commission income of around 8% to EUR894m (Q3 2023: EUR831m), to which both customer segments contributed. As anticipated, net interest income fell slightly to EUR2,048m (Q3 2023: EUR2,166m, Q2 2024: EUR2,078m) as a result of the interest rate cuts, but remained at a high level. Between January and September, revenues increased to EUR8,150m compared to the same period last year (9M 2023: EUR8,052m).  Total costs increased only slightly in the third quarter to EUR1,594m (Q3 2023: EUR1,549m). Compulsory contributions rose to EUR64m (Q3 2023: EUR45m). Again, this was caused by the higher contributions to the Deposit Insurance Fund due to the increase in covered deposits. Operating expenses were also slightly higher than in the previous year at EUR1,530m (Q3 2023: EUR1,504m). This was primarily due to higher costs incurred by mBank as a result of investments in future business growth and foreign currency effects. Other drivers were general salary increases in Germany, higher accruals for share-based variable compensation as a consequence of the strong rise in the Commerzbank share price and the increased cost base since the acquisition of Aquila Capital in June. These effects were partially offset by active cost management. Between January and September, costs fell by a total of around 1% to EUR4,780m. The cost-income ratio was at 58.7% (9M 2023: 59.7%).  The risk result totalled minus EUR255m in the third quarter (Q3 2023: minus EUR91m). It includes around minus EUR147m from methodology updates, of which minus EUR97m alone are intended to cover climate and environmental risks. In the ongoing economically challenging environment, the loan book proved to be overall robust, with three large individual cases impacting the risk result by minus EUR130m. The non-performing exposure ratio (NPE ratio) was at low 0.9% (Q2 2024: 0.8%). The Bank's Top-Level Adjustment (TLA) decreased by EUR94m due to reassessment. Taking into account the reduction in the TLA, the Bank still has EUR242m (Q2 2024: EUR336m) available mainly to cover expected secondary effects from geopolitical crises and uncertainties from inflation. After nine months, the risk result was at minus EUR529m (9M 2023: minus EUR367m).  Overall, the operating result in the third quarter totalled EUR886m (Q3 2023: EUR1,116m). Between January and September, it remained almost stable at EUR2,841m (9M 2023: EUR2,879m). Net result after taxes and minority interests totalled EUR642m in the third quarter (Q3 2023: EUR684m), improving by 5% to EUR1,926m after nine months (9M 2023: EUR1,829m). The Bank is therefore well on track to achieve its target of generating a higher profit for the financial year 2024 than in the previous year.  Commerzbank's Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET1 ratio) was 14.8% as of 30 September (30 June 2024: 14.8%, 30 September 2023: 14.6%). The Bank continues to have a very comfortable buffer of 451 basis points to the regulatory minimum requirement (MDA threshold), which currently is 10.31%. Commerzbank has significant potential to return capital to its shareholders. The return on tangible equity (RoTE) was 8.7% in the third quarter (Q3 2023: 9.6%) and improved to 8.8% between January and September (9M 2023: 8.6%). After nine months, the Bank is on track to achieve its target of at least 8% for the full year.  \"We are consistently implementing our plans for the return of capital. We have applied for the second tranche of our share buyback to the ECB and the German Finance Agency. By further sharpening the financial targets of our Strategy until 2027 in September, we have also made it clear that we will improve our profitability beyond our original plans. This will enable us to return even more capital to our shareholders in the coming years\", said Bettina Orlopp.  Segment performance: mBank more than doubles its operating result  The Corporate Clients segment generated revenues of EUR1,121m in the third quarter (Q3 2023: EUR1,172m). After nine months, revenues were 5% higher compared to the same period of the previous year, totalling EUR3,541m. Net commission income rose by around 5% to EUR345m in the third quarter compared to the same quarter of the previous year. The syndication business and trade finance developed particularly strongly. Net interest income, however, fell, as anticipated, to EUR629m (Q3 2023: EUR718m, Q2 2024: EUR678m) because of the recent interest rate cuts. The credit volume increased to EUR100bn in the third quarter despite the challenging economic environment (Q2 2024: EUR99bn, Q3 2023: EUR97bn). The segment's operating result totalled EUR412m (Q3 2023: EUR645m) and largely reflects the increased risk result in the third quarter. After the first nine months of the financial year, the operating result, which totalled EUR1,623m, was almost on the same level as in the previous year (9M 2023: EUR1,637m).  The Private and Small-Business Customers segment (PSBC) in Germany recorded stable revenues of EUR1,044m in the third quarter (Q3 2023: EUR1,045m), despite the decline of interest rates. In the first nine months of the year, the segment's revenues increased to EUR3,276m (9M 2023: EUR3,240m). As anticipated, in the third quarter net interest income fell to EUR537m (Q3 2023: EUR596m). However, the decline could largely be offset by a significant increase in net commission income by 8% to EUR472m as well as valuation effects at the real estate subsidiary Commerz Real. The continued strength of the securities business had a positive effect on net commission income. Driven by the positive trend in the stock markets, the securities volume rose further to EUR238bn by the end of September (end of June: EUR233bn). The segment's average deposit volume was stable in the third quarter at EUR174bn (Q2 2024: EUR174bn) as well as the loan volume at an average of EUR125bn (Q2 2024: EUR125bn). The volume of mortgage loans also remained unchanged at EUR96bn (Q2 2024: EUR96bn). The segment's operating result of EUR251m (Q3 2023: EUR298m) reflects, amongst others, the acquisition of Aquila Capital in June as well as increased expenses for the deposit guarantee scheme. After nine months, the result was 11% higher compared to the same period last year at EUR985m (9M 2023: EUR885m).  The Polish subsidiary mBank continued its dynamic growth in customer business. Revenues increased by a strong 40% to EUR485m in the third quarter (Q3 2023: EUR346m), despite further provisions for legal risks for foreign currency loans totalling EUR227m (Q3 2023: EUR234m). Between January and September, mBank's revenues increased by one-third to EUR1,239m (9M 2023: EUR929m). In the third quarter, net interest income rose to EUR609m (Q3 2023: EUR561m), driven by the continued strong deposit and lending business. Net commission income also increased further, rising by around 13% to EUR91m. mBank contributed EUR203m to the Group's operating result in the third quarter, more than twice as much as a year ago (Q3 2023: EUR89m). Without the impact of the legal risks associated with foreign currency loans and \"Credit Holidays\", the operating result would even have risen to EUR404m in the third quarter (Q3 2023: EUR323m). In the first nine months of the year, mBank was able to more than double its operating result to EUR432m compared to the same period last year (9M 2023: EUR175m).  Outlook 2024: targets for net commission and net interest income as well as CET1 ratio raised  After the first nine months of the year, Commerzbank confirms its profit target for the full year 2024: with a net result of around EUR2.4bn, it is targeting a higher net result than in the 2023 financial year. The outlook is subject to the future development of burdens from Russia and foreign currency loans at mBank. Based on the strong results of the third quarter, the Bank is raising its forecast for net interest income from around EUR8.1bn to around EUR8.2bn for the full year. Net commission income also developed better than planned: the Bank now anticipates that net commission income will exceed the previous year's figure by more than 5%. Previously, the Bank had anticipated net interest income to rise by 4%. On this basis, the Bank assumes revenues totalling EUR10.9bn. Commerzbank now anticipates a CET1 ratio of around 15%. Previously, it had assumed a ratio of more than 14%. Commerzbank is still aiming for a cost-income ratio of around 60% for the current year. The Bank expects a risk result lower than minus EUR800m for the full year assuming usage of TLA.  The Bank remains committed to its capital return plans and planned share buybacks: for this financial year, Commerzbank is aiming to return at least 70% of net result to its shareholders - but not more than the net result after deduction of AT1 coupon payments. On 4 November, the Bank decided to start its third share buyback programme soon. Previously, the German Finance Agency and ECB had given their approval for the first tranche of EUR600m. As planned, Commerzbank has applied to the ECB and the German Finance Agency for the second tranche of up to EUR400m, based on the third quarter results.

CORPORATE NEWS  Encavis Asset Management AG and Commerzbank AG achieve financial close for the project financing of the second-largest solar park in Germany Munich/Frankfurt, July 31, 2024 ? Encavis Asset Management AG (Encavis AM) and Commerzbank AG (Commerzbank) have agreed to a financial close for the Bartow solar project, which will be the second-largest facility of its kind in Germany with an expected total generation capacity of 260 MW. The project is located approximately 150 kilometres north of Berlin in the municipality of Bartow, in the state of Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The solar park is part of the portfolio of the Encavis Infrastructure Fund IV (EIF IV), which can still be subscribed to through BayernLB. The fund is particularly aimed at savings banks and cooperative banks. The financing volume of around 145 million euros is provided by Commerzbank, one of the leading financial service providers in the field of Renewable Energy projects in Germany and Europe. The necessary equity is supplied by EIF IV. The total capital will be used for the construction of the Bartow solar park. Construction of the first phase began in March 2024, and the entire project is scheduled for completion in the second half of 2025. Most of the green electricity produced will be sold to LyondellBasell (NYSE: LYB) through a 12-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Karsten Mieth, Spokesman of Encavis Asset Management AG, commented: ?We are proud to have launched this significant solar project in Germany together with Commerzbank. This successful financing underscores our commitment to sustainable energy projects and demonstrates the trust our partners have in our expertise. The Bartow solar park will make a significant contribution to the energy transition in Germany and further strengthen our position as a leading player in the field of Renewable Energy.? Commerzbank is very pleased with the successful project financing. Przemyslaw Damps, Director of Project Finance Origination at the Centre of Competence Green Infrastructure Finance (CoC GIF), stated: ?From the beginning, we were determined to support this groundbreaking project for our long-term client, Encavis Asset Management.? The challenges in structuring the PPA and the related market prices, as well as securing the land for such a large project, were successfully resolved together. The collaboration between Commerzbank and Encavis Asset Management underscores both companies' commitment to sustainable and Renewable Energy. By financing the Bartow solar park, a significant contribution is made to the energy transition in Germany and the shift to clean energy sources is advanced. ?We are confident that this partnership will lead to a successful implementation of the project, and we look forward to working together in the coming years,? added Commerzbank expert Damps.

The 18-month-old war has global repercussions that cannot be ignored, Brazilian President Luiz In\\xE1cio Lula da Silva said, adding that the group consisting of Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa is an important forum to discuss security and peace.   \"We don't underestimate the difficulties of achieving peace, but we also can't be indifferent to the death and destruction that happens every day,\" Lula said.   South African President Cyril Ramaphosa also pleaded for the Ukraine war to be resolved through negotiations.   \"BRICS countries will support efforts to end this conflict through dialogue, mediation and negotiation,\" he said.   Ramaphosa is leading an African peace initiative, including mediation efforts in Moscow and Kiev, that has so far failed to yield results.  Russian President Vladimir Putin, meanwhile, did not attend the summit in person, as he would have faced an arrest warrant by the International Criminal Court (ICC) for alleged war crimes.   In a video speech on Wednesday, Putin invited BRICS representatives to the Russian city of Kazan in October 2024 for the next summit.  The specific date is to be agreed through diplomatic channels.  Putin announced that there would be more than 200 political, economic and social events under Russia's BRICS presidency in the coming year.   This year's summit of major emerging economies runs until Thursday.   Putin used a video address to the summit leaders on Tuesday to reiterate Russian justifications for cancelling a grain export agreement with Ukraine, and made sharp criticism of the West and of Kiev.  Brazil's Lula, South Africa's Ramaphosa, China's President Xi Jinping and India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi are attending the summit in South Africa in person.  A central topic of this year's summit is the expansion of the BRICS group with new members. The member states have yet to agree on admission criteria.   China's Xi on Wednesday spoke out in favour of a rapid expansion of the group, saying the BRICS community would continue to grow and contribute to peace and development in the world.  International standards should be written and upheld by all countries based on the goals and principles of the UN Charter, \"rather than dictated by those with the most muscle and the loudest voice,\" Xi said.  Meanwhile, Lula reiterated a call for a common BRICS currency on the sidelines of the summit.   \"The decarbonization of our economies must go hand in hand with decent jobs, industrialization, green infrastructure and public services for all,\" he wrote on X, formerly known as Twitter.  \"Creating a currency for transactions between BRICS countries reduces our vulnerability,\" he added.

A leader in energy and environmental solutions technologies, the Group delivered a strong performance in the past year, exceeding market expectations. Sales were at record level, increasing by approximately 40% to EUR 87m, up from EUR 62.7m in 2022. The operative performance climbed to EUR 95.3m, a robust improvement of more than 45% (2022: EUR 65.3m). EBITDA increased by 136% to EUR 8.5m (2022: EUR 3.6m) or 10% of sales (EBITDA margin 2022: 5.5%). EBIT showed a significant turnaround from EUR 0.07m in 2022 to EUR 4.0m, moving from close to break-even to solid profitability. The EBIT margin on sales improved to 4.6% (2022: 0.1%). Adjusted for the amortization of goodwill, which was significant after the Group?s acquisitions in the past years, EBIT amounted to EUR 5.0m, the adjusted EBIT margin stood at 5.7%. Profit before tax reached EUR 2.0m (2022: EUR -0.66m), while profit after tax amounted to EUR 0.5m (2022: EUR -1.56m). ?We successfully capitalized on key opportunities, delivered the highest sales in our history, increased earnings and strengthened margins in 2023. With this financial performance, we exceeded the forecasts of financial markets. This is clear evidence that our strategic initiatives are working\", said Peter Werth, CEO of Wolftank Group. Wolftank Group?s equity improved to EUR 24.6m (2022: EUR 20.5m) in 2023. The equity ratio amounted to 22.4% (2022: 32.6%). Cash flow from operating activities was boosted to EUR 7.2m (2022: EUR 0.28m), cash flow from financing activities of EUR 6.2m remained stable (2022: EUR 6.3m). Segment PerformanceWolftank Group's operations are divided into three business segments: Environmental Services, Industrial Coatings and Maintenance, Hydrogen &amp; Renewable Energies. The Group's core businesses, environmental remediation and industrial coatings, remain the foundation of its operations. The stability and maturity of these segments provide a competitive advantage, supporting the strong order backlog in hydrogen and renewable energy. In Environmental Services, sales exceeded expectations at EUR 51.7m (2022: EUR 34.9m), with EBITDA more than doubling to EUR 5.5m (2022: EUR 2.1m) and an EBITDA margin of 10% (2022: 6%). The Industrial Coatings and Maintenance segment increased sales to EUR 14.5m (2022: EUR 8.5m), delivering an EBITDA of EUR 2.7m (2022: EUR 1.9m) and solid EBITDA margins of 18.6% (2022: 22.4%). The sales of Hydrogen &amp; Renewable Energies amounted to EUR 20.6m (2022: EUR 19.37m). Significant non-capitalizable public tender preparation and documentation costs had a direct impact on the income statement, contributing to EBITDA of EUR 0.3m (2022: -0.4m) and EBITDA margin of 1.5% in 2023 (2022: -2.1%). Strategic growth: Strengthening core business while expanding opportunities in hydrogenSignificant strategic expansion and strong financial performance reflected the company's growth and innovation across its global operations. One of the key moves in 2023 was the acquisition of a majority stake in Petroltecnica, a leading Italian environmental services provider, for EUR 4m. This acquisition enhanced the Group's environmental offering, expanding its market presence to a leading position in Italy. Petroltecnica, specializing in environmental remediation, operates several recycling facilities and has a very strong market position in the oil and gas, chemical, and manufacturing sectors. In terms of organic growth, Wolftank Group established a subsidiary in California, aligning with the strategic opportunities presented by the U.S.'s commitment to climate protection. Wolftank USA Inc. aims to capitalize on this environment by introducing the Group's innovative hydrogen solutions. Strategic partnerships for hydrogen refueling stations in Italy and Germany underscore the Group's leadership in sustainable mobility solutions. The establishment of a new, larger production facility for modular hydrogen refueling systems, investments in the development of solutions for intralogistics and power backup systems demonstrate Wolftank's commitment to leading the industry with innovations. The organic growth is proven by one of the industry's most consistent order backlogs in hydrogen refueling stations, already showing a sharply growing track for the coming years. ?We are consistently implementing our strategy. The acquisition of Petroltecnica and our entry into new markets like the U.S. are critical steps in our journey towards sustainable growth. We are a pure green company, excellently positioned to continue leading the energy transition towards an emission-free economy. We will benefit from long-term subsidized investments in green infrastructure, backed by a very stable and mature core business in environmental services,? commented CEO Peter Werth. ?We are confident that our focused strategy will continue to drive growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.? Excellent outlook for 2024Wolftank Group's core businesses Environmental Services and Industrial Coatings &amp; Maintenance, which account for three-quarters of its operations, have been significantly strengthened and had a good start to the year, demonstrating stability and growth potential. This solid foundation supports the Group?s targeted broader growth objectives and enhances resilience in more volatile market conditions. Looking ahead, the hydrogen segment is set to take off, driven by rising market needs and Wolftank?s strong positioning through long-standing expertise. Demand for new refueling stations remains strong, with a significant order backlog of 158m reflecting a very promising growth trajectory. With a very robust portfolio of projects, particularly in hydrogen and renewable energy, management targets sales between EUR 110m and EUR 127m in 2024. ?Our strategic initiatives and strong market position set the stage for another year of growth. We are excellently positioned to capitalize on the opportunities of the energy transition through our comprehensive range of services, commitment to innovation and strategic expansion\", concluded Peter Werth.Key Financial Highlights</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"496\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\">2023</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2022</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sales</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EUR\u00a0m</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">87</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">62.7</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBITDA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EUR\u00a0m</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8.5</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBITDA margin</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">10.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.5</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBIT (Earnings before interest and taxes)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EUR\u00a0m</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.07</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EBIT margin</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4.6</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.1</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Profit before tax</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EUR\u00a0m</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-0.66</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Profit after tax</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EUR\u00a0m</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.5</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">-1.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash flow from operating activities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EUR\u00a0m</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">7.2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">0.28</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Equity ratio</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">22.4</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">32.6</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Access the Wolftank Group Annual Sustainability Report online:  About Wolftank GroupWolftank Group is a leading technology partner for energy and environmental solutions operating worldwide.

A leader in energy and environmental solutions technologies, the Group delivered a strong performance in the past year, exceeding market expectations. Sales were at record level, increasing by approximately 40% to EUR 87m, up from EUR 62.7m in 2022. The operative performance climbed to EUR 95.3m, a robust improvement of more than 45% (2022: EUR 65.3m). EBITDA increased by 136% to EUR 8.5m (2022: EUR 3.6m) or 10% of sales (EBITDA margin 2022: 5.5%).  EBIT showed a significant turnaround from EUR 0.07m in 2022 to EUR 4.0m, moving from close to break-even to solid profitability. The EBIT margin on sales improved to 4.6% (2022: 0.1%). Adjusted for the amortization of goodwill, which was significant after the Group's acquisitions in the past years, EBIT amounted to EUR 5.0m, the adjusted EBIT margin stood at 5.7%. Profit before tax reached EUR 2.0m (2022: EUR -0.66m), while profit after tax amounted to EUR 0.5m (2022: EUR -1.56m).  \"We successfully capitalized on key opportunities, delivered the highest sales in our history, increased earnings and strengthened margins in 2023. With this financial performance, we exceeded the forecasts of financial markets. This is clear evidence that our strategic initiatives are working\", said Peter Werth, CEO of Wolftank Group.  Wolftank Group's equity improved to EUR 24.6m (2022: EUR 20.5m) in 2023. The equity ratio amounted to 22.4% (2022: 32.6%). Cash flow from operating activities was boosted to EUR 7.2m (2022: EUR 0.28m), cash flow from financing activities of EUR 6.2m remained stable (2022: EUR 6.3m).  Segment Performance Wolftank Group's operations are divided into three business segments: Environmental Services, Industrial Coatings and Maintenance, Hydrogen &amp; Renewable Energies. The Group's core businesses, environmental remediation and industrial coatings, remain the foundation of its operations. The stability and maturity of these segments provide a competitive advantage, supporting the strong order backlog in hydrogen and renewable energy.  In Environmental Services, sales exceeded expectations at EUR 51.7m (2022: EUR 34.9m), with EBITDA more than doubling to EUR 5.5m (2022: EUR 2.1m) and an EBITDA margin of 10% (2022: 6%). The Industrial Coatings and Maintenance segment increased sales to EUR 14.5m (2022: EUR 8.5m), delivering an EBITDA of EUR 2.7m (2022: EUR 1.9m) and solid EBITDA margins of 18.6% (2022: 22.4%). The sales of Hydrogen &amp; Renewable Energies amounted to EUR 20.6m (2022: EUR 19.37m). Significant non-capitalizable public tender preparation and documentation costs had a direct impact on the income statement, contributing to EBITDA of EUR 0.3m (2022: -0.4m) and EBITDA margin of 1.5% in 2023 (2022: -2.1%).  Strategic growth: Strengthening core business while expanding opportunities in hydrogen Significant strategic expansion and strong financial performance reflected the company's growth and innovation across its global operations. One of the key moves in 2023 was the acquisition of a majority stake in Petroltecnica, a leading Italian environmental services provider, for EUR 4m. This acquisition enhanced the Group's environmental offering, expanding its market presence to a leading position in Italy. Petroltecnica, specializing in environmental remediation, operates several recycling facilities and has a very strong market position in the oil and gas, chemical, and manufacturing sectors.  In terms of organic growth, Wolftank Group established a subsidiary in California, aligning with the strategic opportunities presented by the U.S.'s commitment to climate protection. Wolftank USA Inc. aims to capitalize on this environment by introducing the Group's innovative hydrogen solutions. Strategic partnerships for hydrogen refueling stations in Italy and Germany underscore the Group's leadership in sustainable mobility solutions. The establishment of a new, larger production facility for modular hydrogen refueling systems, investments in the development of solutions for intralogistics and power backup systems demonstrate Wolftank's commitment to leading the industry with innovations. The organic growth is proven by one of the industry's most consistent order backlogs in hydrogen refueling stations, already showing a sharply growing track for the coming years.  \"We are consistently implementing our strategy. The acquisition of Petroltecnica and our entry into new markets like the U.S. are critical steps in our journey towards sustainable growth. We are a pure green company, excellently positioned to continue leading the energy transition towards an emission-free economy. We will benefit from long-term subsidized investments in green infrastructure, backed by a very stable and mature core business in environmental services,\" commented CEO Peter Werth. \"We are confident that our focused strategy will continue to drive growth and create long-term value for our shareholders.\"  Excellent outlook for 2024 Wolftank Group's core businesses Environmental Services and Industrial Coatings &amp; Maintenance, which account for three-quarters of its operations, have been significantly strengthened and had a good start to the year, demonstrating stability and growth potential. This solid foundation supports the Group's targeted broader growth objectives and enhances resilience in more volatile market conditions.  Looking ahead, the hydrogen segment is set to take off, driven by rising market needs and Wolftank's strong positioning through long-standing expertise. Demand for new refueling stations remains strong, with a significant order backlog of 158m reflecting a very promising growth trajectory. With a very robust portfolio of projects, particularly in hydrogen and renewable energy, management targets sales between EUR 110m and EUR 127m in 2024. \"Our strategic initiatives and strong market position set the stage for another year of growth. We are excellently positioned to capitalize on the opportunities of the energy transition through our comprehensive range of services, commitment to innovation and strategic expansion\", concluded Peter Werth.

Audi does not own a plant in the US yet, but Volkswagen does.   With the new subsidies introduced last year, building a plant for electric cars in the US has become \"highly attractive,\" chief executive Markus Duesmann told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.  The auto executive was referring to the US Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $369 billion in subsidies and tax credits aimed at promoting electric vehicles and green infrastructure.   A controversial aspect of the law is a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that is limited to cars built in North America and with critical minerals for batteries sourced domestically or from a free trade agreement partner, which the EU is not.  EU officials have vociferously criticized the new law.  \"Decisions have not yet been made, but the Volkswagen Group will probably build more cars for the US market there in the future as well than before,\" Duesmann said. A separate Audi plant or a plant with other VW Group brands is possible, he said.   \"However, there is a high probability that we will do it as part of the group.\"   Volkswagen has a large plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which will henceforth also build e-cars. Audi has so far supplied the US market from its SUV plant in Mexico and its other sites. Last year, Audi sales in the US fell by 5% to 187,000 vehicles.  According to Duesmann, more than 20 new Audi models would come onto the market in the next two years, half of them fully electric.   Audi is currently building its own plant in the northern Chinese metropolis of Changchun, where up to 150,000 electric cars a year will be built for the Chinese market on the basis of the PPE luxury platform developed with Porsche.   So far, Audi has been producing in Changchun at FAW Volkswagen's plants and in Shanghai at SAIC Volkswagen.

Audi does not own a plant in the US yet, but Volkswagen does.   With the new subsidies introduced last year, building a plant for electric cars in the US has become \"highly attractive,\" chief executive Markus Duesmann told the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung newspaper.  The auto executive was referring to the US Inflation Reduction Act, which includes $369 billion in subsidies and tax credits aimed at promoting electric vehicles and green infrastructure.   A controversial aspect of the law is a $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit that is limited to cars built in North America and with critical minerals for batteries sourced domestically or from a free trade agreement partner, which the EU is not.  EU officials have vociferously criticized the new law.  \"Decisions have not yet been made, but the Volkswagen Group will probably build more cars for the US market there in the future as well than before,\" Duesmann said. A separate Audi plant or a plant with other VW Group brands is possible, he said.   \"However, there is a high probability that we will do it as part of the group.\"   Volkswagen has a large plant in Chattanooga, Tennessee, which will henceforth also build e-cars. Audi has so far supplied the US market from its SUV plant in Mexico and its other sites. Last year, Audi sales in the US fell by 5% to 187,000 vehicles.  According to Duesmann, more than 20 new Audi models would come onto the market in the next two years, half of them fully electric.   Audi is currently building its own plant in the northern Chinese metropolis of Changchun, where up to 150,000 electric cars a year will be built for the Chinese market on the basis of the PPE luxury platform developed with Porsche.   So far, Audi has been producing in Changchun at FAW Volkswagen's plants and in Shanghai at SAIC Volkswagen.

Before the pandemic, the number of people living in extreme poverty - or those living on less than 1.90 dollars a day - in the region had been declining, but in 2020, the number rose by 5.4 million, the Manila-based bank said in the report.  \"For 2021, another 4.7 million people fell below the extreme poverty threshold compared to the 2020 no-COVID-19 poverty baseline,\" the report added.  The report said the increase in poverty came as 9.3 million jobs were lost in 2021.  \"The pandemic has led to widespread unemployment, worsening inequality and rising poverty levels, especially among women, younger workers, and the elderly in South-East Asia,\" ADB president Masatsugu Asakawa said.  In its report, \"South-East Asia: Rising from the Pandemic,\" the bank said that despite brighter prospects for a recovery, the Omicron variant wave could cut the region's economic growth by as much as 0.8 percentage points in 2022.  It added that the region' economic output in 2022 was expected to remain more than 10 per cent below the baseline of a no-Covid scenario.  \"ADB will continue to work with policymakers as they seek to rebuild, improve national health systems and streamline domestic regulations to strengthen business competitiveness,\" Asakawa said.  \"We encourage South-East Asian governments to invest in smart, green infrastructure and adopt technological innovations to reinvigorate economic growth,\" he added.

Yet this week, the politicians, banking experts, civil society group leaders, and others who are gathering at that intersection ? at a two-day event organized by French President Emmanuel Macron called The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact ? are pushing an agenda that appears to be putting financing for African natural gas projects, the presumptive solution to many of the continent?s poverty woes, on the back burner, no pun intended. The Paris summit was designed to lay the groundwork ?for a new financial system suited to the common challenges of the 21st century, such as fighting inequalities and climate change and protecting biodiversity.? Though summit attendees didn?t arrive with an exact vision for what a new financial system would look like, their discussion is coalescing around four pillars: Restore fiscal space to countries facing short-term difficulties, especially the most indebted countries.  Foster private sector development in low-income countries.  Encourage investment in \"green\" infrastructure for the energy transition in emerging and developing countries.  Mobilize innovative financing for countries vulnerable to climate change. The truth is, we do need a new global financial system. It?s no secret that poor countries have more difficulty accessing financing for development projects that support economic and social growth than rich countries, and when they do, the cost of money is considerably higher, staggeringly so in some cases. It?s not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it?s become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal. And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it ? and welcome it. It?s the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects. Valid Finance Concerns?Up to a Point To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation?s capital city. Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis. When Mottley ? an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)? floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas. Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank?s biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank?s then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass? leadership, the World Bank did too little to ?align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts? ? while it continues to fund oil and gas projects). Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world?s economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments. The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to ?mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.? And, again, that?s an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa?s gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa. To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that?s not what we?re seeing. Look at Afrieximbank?s Excellent Example In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa?s important domestic banks. For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to ?invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,? and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine ?our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.? As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies. Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that? At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in ?revitalizing Africa?s climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.? To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables. This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa?s economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What?s more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa?s much-needed industrialization, we all know that?s not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now. All of this requires money. As I?ve written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won?t work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN?s sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept. \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said. The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds. Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Yet this week, the politicians, banking experts, civil society group leaders, and others who are gathering at that intersection - at a two-day event organized by French President Emmanuel Macron called The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact - are pushing an agenda that appears to be putting financing for African natural gas projects, the presumptive solution to many of the continent's poverty woes, on the back burner, no pun intended.  The Paris summit was designed to lay the groundwork \"for a new financial system suited to the common challenges of the 21st century, such as fighting inequalities and climate change and protecting biodiversity.\" Though summit attendees didn't arrive with an exact vision for what a new financial system would look like, their discussion is coalescing around four pillars:    * Restore fiscal space to countries facing short-term difficulties,     especially the most indebted countries.    * Foster private sector development in low-income countries.    * Encourage investment in \"green\" infrastructure for the energy transition     in emerging and developing countries.    * Mobilize innovative financing for countries vulnerable to climate     change.  The truth is, we do need a new global financial system. It's no secret that poor countries have more difficulty accessing financing for development projects that support economic and social growth than rich countries, and when they do, the cost of money is considerably higher, staggeringly so in some cases. It's not unusual for rich countries to borrow capital at interest rates as low as 1%; for a poor nation with risky creditworthiness, the figure is more likely to be around 14%. Since the pandemic began, things have gotten even worse all around. Global debt has risen sharply, and amid additional borrowing, it's become tougher for developing and low-income countries to repay their debts. As a result, those nations have been thrust into a vicious cycle of vulnerability, unable to grow their economies or, as the UN and summit attendees noted, to satisfy their Sustainable Development Goals (SDG). Being able to level the playing field and to create new financing sources is an honorable and perhaps overdue goal.  And, developing nations do need investment in green infrastructure. African nations need it - and welcome it.  It's the missing wording in these pillars that that concerns me as I fear once again that the global path to net zero runs roughshod over African natural gas projects.  Valid Finance Concerns-Up to a Point  To understand how the summit arrived at its slate of priorities requires delving into something called the Bridgetown Initiative, a platform established by Barbadian Prime Minister Mia Mottley and named for the island nation's capital city.  Since the COP26 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Glasgow, Scotland, Mottley has been championing a new way for rich nations to finance poor nations in a climate crisis. The Bridgetown Initiative asks for development banks to lend an additional $1 trillion at below-market rates to developing nations for climate resilience. The plan also calls for a privately backed mechanism to fund both climate mitigation and reconstruction after a crisis.  When Mottley - an outspoken critic of both the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF)- floated the Bridgetown Initiative at COP27 in Sharm el-Sheikh, Egypt, late last year, the response was overwhelmingly positive. One observer said he had never before seen the level of consensus and momentum around a single set of ideas.  Macron seized on the Bridgetown agenda. Like Mottley, Macron appears to be no great fan of the World Bank or IMF, even though France is one of the World Bank's biggest stakeholders. Without naming names, Macron has said that current financial institutions have not delivered measurable results on climate finance to poor countries. (Western nations were infuriated when World Bank's then-president David Malpass refused at a New York Times event in September 2022 to say whether the burning of oil, gas, and coal was driving climate change. The subsequent uproar led to his resignation in February of this year. Detractors said that under Malpass' leadership, the World Bank did too little to \"align its lending with international efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and [moved] too slowly to help poor countries deal with climate impacts\" - while it continues to fund oil and gas projects).  Macron said that to fight poverty, decarbonize the world's economies, and protect biodiversity, the rules of international finance have to be reset. Countries must be able to invest in sustainable development through easier access to international, domestic, public, and private financing in all its forms: concessional loans, guarantees, debt swaps, carbon markets, hybrid financing, and investments.  The Summit for a New Global Financing Pact is meant to serve as a sort of global think tank to determine the long-term strategies, multi-stake partnerships, and detailed investment plans that would allow governments to \"mobilize incentives for a more targeted and efficient use of both international and domestic resources.\"  And, again, that's an excellent idea. But the brainstorming that takes place this week will be doing developing countries, including Africa's gas-producing nations, a disservice if it focuses solely on green energy financing. I would also argue that while I recognize the need to prevent climate change and address the overall impact of the energy industry, not all fossil fuels have the same impact on the environment. Natural gas is a cleaner-burning fossil fuel than oil or coal, and it can play a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. It has a critical role to play in just energy transitions for many developing nations, including those in Africa.  To truly support developing nations, wealthier nations must accept that reality. Unfortunately, that's not what we're seeing.  Look at Afrieximbank's Excellent Example  In the run-up to the summit, there have been increasing calls for lenders of all types to reassess and reconfigure their portfolios. That includes Africa's important domestic banks.  For example, earlier this month, African civil society organizations urged the African Export-Import Bank (Afrieximbank) to \"invest in clean energy projects that focus on regional integration of the power sector,\" and to pull back on financing oil and gas projects that undermine \"our efforts to achieve 1.5 degrees climate target and the Sustainable Development Goals.\"  As the trade finance bank of Africa, Afrieximbank is motivated to see African economies, businesses, and people prosper. To that end, it supports a range of clients, including domestic energy companies.  Last November, for example, the bank signed a reserve-based lending facility term sheet with Nigerian independent oil and gas company Amni Petroleum. The USD635 million facility will allow Amni Petroleum to fund capital expenditure in the Okoro and Tubu oil and gas fields and is expected to help the company more than double its oil production in less than a year, boost liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports, and provide fuel for power generation across West Africa. This is a game-changing opportunity for a Nigerian company with Nigerian workers that will provide revenues to the Nigerian government. How could Afreximbank turn its back on that?  At almost exactly the same time, however, Afreximbank pledged USD250 billion to bridge the climate finance gap, ensuring it would have a major role in \"revitalizing Africa's climate adaptation and mitigation initiatives.\"  To me, what this proves is that financing hydrocarbon projects and green energy can go hand-in-hand. In fact, monetizing our vast reserves of natural gas can provide the financial wherewithal to help us pay for our logical, sustainable transition to renewables.  This is No Time to Turn Our Backs on Gas  Again, the problem is that the green agenda ignores how important natural gas is to bringing life-changing prosperity to the continent in the form of jobs, business opportunities, capacity building, and, yes, electricity. Gas-to-power is nothing less than central to Africa's economic and industrial future. Aligned with the UN SDG 7.1, the Africa Just and Affordable Energy Transition Initiative (AJAETI) hopes to leverage natural gas to bring affordable energy to 300 million Africans over the next four years and to transition them to clean cooking fuels. What's more, it expects to increase access to electricity from renewables by 25% over the same period. As for Africa's much-needed industrialization, we all know that's not possible solely with wind or solar power, at least not with the technologies available now.  All of this requires money.  As I've written time and time again, we cannot allow the green agenda of other nations to ignore or dismiss our unique needs and priorities. Prioritizing the financing of green projects won't work for Africa when it leaves resources in the ground that could be used to lift people out of poverty. We cannot hope to meet the UN's sustainable development goals without energy access, and we must exploit oil and natural gas to do that. Further, as Namibia's petroleum commissioner Maggy Shino reminded us at COP27, previous promises by wealthy nations to work alongside Africa to finance clean energy remain unkept.  \"If you are going to tell us to leave our resources in the ground, then you must be prepared to offer sufficient compensation, but I don't think anyone has yet come out to make such an offer,\" she said.  The fact is, African resources offer an avenue toward a greener and more prosperous future, and not just for Africa. This is where the intersection of money and climate represents the best of all worlds.  Distributed by APO Group on behalf of African Energy Chamber.

Before the pandemic, the number of people living in extreme poverty - or those living on less than 1.90 dollars a day - in the region had been declining, and was down to 14.2 million in 2019 from 21.2 million in 2017.  \"Without Covid, those living under extreme poverty would have fallen by another 1.1 million to 13.1 million,\" said James Villafuerte, a senior economist at the Manila-based bank and author of the report, \"South-East Asia: Rising from the Pandemic.\"  But in 2020, the number of people living in extreme poverty rose by 5.4 million due to Covid-19, and in 2021, \"another 4.7 million people fell below the extreme poverty threshold compared to the 2020 no-Covid-19 poverty baseline,\" the report added.  The report said the increase in poverty arose from large unemployment amid the coronavirus-related lockdowns, with 10.6 million jobs lost in 2020 and another 9.3 million jobsin 2021.  \"The pandemic has led to widespread unemployment, worsening inequality and rising poverty levels, especially among women, younger workers, and the elderly in South-East Asia,\" ADB president Masatsugu Asakawa said.  In the report, the bank said that despite brighter prospects for a recovery, the Omicron variant wave could cut the region's economic growth by as much as 0.8 percentage points in 2022.  It added that the region's economic output in 2022 was expected to remain more than 10% below the baseline of a no-Covid scenario.  \"ADB will continue to work with policymakers as they seek to rebuild, improve national health systems and streamline domestic regulations to strengthen business competitiveness,\" Asakawa said.  \"We encourage South-East Asian governments to invest in smart, green infrastructure and adopt technological innovations to reinvigorate economic growth,\" he added.

ESG funds with continued net inflows of EUR 1.7bn in Q3  Adjusted revenues stable at EUR 666m in Q3 (Q2 2023: EUR 668m)  Adjusted costs at EUR 420m in Q3 (Q2 2023: EUR 408m), up 3% q-o-q  Adjusted Cost-Income Ratio (CIR) with 63.1% in Q3 (Q2 2023: 61.0%) and 63.4% in the first nine months on track to achieve DWS? outlook for the year 2023  Net income increased by 2% to EUR 147m in Q3 (Q2 2023: EUR 145m)  Adjusted profit before tax at EUR 246m in Q3 ? down 6% q-o-q (Q2 2023: EUR 260m)  Assets under Management marginally increased to EUR 860bn in Q3 (Q2 2023: EUR 859bn; Q4 2022: EUR 821bn) as net inflows and positive effects from exchange rate movements slightly exceeded the negative impact from market developments Business Development In an again challenging market environment with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the third quarter of 2023, DWS continued to generate net inflows. Based on stable revenues and focused cost management, the company achieved solid quarterly results leading to overall good financial results for the first nine months of 2023. Driven by strong net new assets in Passive including Xtrackers the company recorded net inflows (ex cash) of EUR 1.6 billion in the third quarter. Including Cash, net flows were EUR 2.3 billion, whereof EUR 1.7 billion came from ESG products. In the first nine months of the year, DWS generated net inflows (ex cash) of EUR 20.8 billion, including Cash of EUR 17.3 billion. Assets under Management increased marginally in Q3 2023 to EUR 860 billion as net inflows and positive exchange rate movements slightly exceeded the negative impact from market developments. Compared to year-end 2022, Assets under Management increased by a total of EUR 38 billion. Due to market turmoil in 2022, DWS started the year 2023 with a significantly lower average Assets under Management basis than the previous year. In the third quarter of 2023, adjusted revenues were flat compared to the second quarter, with higher management fees and lower performance and transaction fees, which had been very high in the previous quarter. The adjusted cost base increased by 3 percent in Q3 quarter-on-quarter due to seasonal effects. The adjusted Cost-Income Ratio of 63.1 percent in the third quarter and 63.4 percent in the first nine months of the year is in line with DWS? outlook for the full year 2023. The adjusted profit before tax was 6 percent lower in Q3 compared to Q2, while net income increased by 2\u00a0percent. Adjusted revenues were virtually stable at EUR 666 million in Q3 2023 (Q2 2023: EUR 668 million). In the first nine months of 2023, adjusted revenues decreased year-on-year by 5\u00a0percent to EUR 1,943 million (9M 2022: EUR 2,049 million). That was predominantly due to lower management fees, mainly driven by declining markets in 2022, which led to lower average Assets under Management during the first nine months of 2023. This reflected the particular positive pre-war environment for asset managers in the first quarter 2022. Adjusted profit before tax declined by 6 percent to EUR 246 million in the third quarter (Q2 2023: EUR 260 million). After tax, DWS posted a 2 percent higher net income of EUR 147 million for the third quarter 2023 (Q2 2023: EUR 145 million). Adjusted profit before tax for the first nine months of 2023 decreased by 12\u00a0percent year-on-year to EUR 711 million (9M 2022: EUR 804 million). Net income dropped in the first nine months of 2023 year-on-year by 12 percent to EUR 430 million (9M 2022: EUR 488 million), which again reflects the significantly more positive market conditions at the beginning of 2022. Assets under Management (AuM) increased marginally to EUR 860 billion in the third quarter of 2023 (Q2 2023: EUR 859 billion; Q4 2022: EUR 821 billion) as net inflows and positive exchange rate movements slightly exceeded the negative impact from market developments on the AuM. Net flows ex Cash were EUR 1.6 billion (including Cash: EUR 2.3 billion) in the third quarter of 2023. Passive including Xtrackers and to a minor extent low-margin Cash products generated net inflows, while Active (ex Cash) and to a lesser degree Alternatives saw net outflows. ESG products attracted continued net inflows of EUR 1.7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to date, DWS generated net new assets ex Cash of EUR 20.8 billion (including Cash: EUR 17.3 billion). Active Asset Management ex Cash recorded net flows of minus EUR 3.3 billion in the third quarter (Q2 2023: EUR 0.3 billion). While Fixed Income generated net new assets of EUR 0.2 billion supported by inflows into flagship retail funds, the other sub-asset classes could not escape the negative market trend and lower risk appetite on the clients? side in the third quarter leading to net outflows of minus EUR 1.6 billion for Active Equity, minus EUR 1.2 billion for Multi Asset and minus EUR 0.6 billion for Active SQI. Cash products continued to be volatile and generated net flows of EUR 0.6 billion (Q2 2023: minus EUR 1.1 billion). In the first nine months of 2023, Active Asset Management ex Cash generated net new assets of EUR 2.8 billion, while low-margin Cash products saw net outflows of minus EUR 3.6 billion. Passive Asset Management generated strong net new assets of EUR 6.2 billion in the third quarter (Q2 2023: EUR 6.2 billion). Flows were driven by Xtrackers ETPs (exchange-traded funds and commodities) while institutional mandates saw minor outflows. Year-to-date, Passive Asset Management recorded net inflows of EUR 16.8 billion. In the third quarter and in the first nine months of the year, DWS ranked number two by European ETP net flows (source: ETFGI). Alternatives recorded net flows of minus EUR 1.3 billion in the third quarter (Q2 2023: EUR 3.9 billion), driven by net flows of minus EUR 0.8 billion in Liquid Real Assets and minus EUR 0.5 billion in Illiquid Alternatives. In the first nine months of the year, Alternatives generated net new assets of EUR 1.2 billion. Adjusted costs, which also exclude transformational charges and other material non-recurring expenses, increased by 3 percent to EUR 420 million in Q3 2023 (Q2 2023: EUR 408 million). This was mainly due to higher adjusted general and administrative expenses, driven by seasonal effects including marketing spend, professional fees and other service charges, while adjusted compensation and benefits costs increased only slightly. In the first nine months of the year, adjusted costs were slightly reduced by 1\u00a0percent to EUR 1,232 million (9M 2022: EUR 1,245 million) despite high inflation rates. The adjusted Cost-Income Ratio (CIR) increased by 2.1 percentage points to 63.1 percent in the third quarter 2023 (Q2 2023: 61.0 percent). Year-on-year, the adjusted CIR rose by 2.6 percentage points to 63.4 percent in the first nine months of the year (9M 2022: 60.8 percent). It remains on track to achieve DWS? outlook for the year 2023, in which the company progresses transformation activities and accommodates inflationary pressures. Growth Initiatives and Strategic Progress In the third quarter, DWS listed three new thematic Xtrackers exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Nasdaq. They are designed to provide investors equity exposure to three vital U.S. industry sectors ? U.S. green infrastructure, semiconductor and cybersecurity ? at a competitive cost. The ETFs represent the first Xtrackers thematic offering for U.S. investors. The launch supports the firm?s growth plans of expanding the Xtrackers footprint in the Americas with specialized, bespoke index investment solutions. The funds will complement DWS? European thematic ETF suite, which was launched in 2019. As a first investment for its European infrastructure investment strategy dedicated to German retail and institutional investors, DWS invested in a solar park in Klettwitz, Brandenburg, one of the largest open-space photovoltaic plants in Germany. The European infrastructure investments strategy is part of DWS? family of investment solutions to support the European Transformation. DWS announced that\u00a0Dr. Markus Kobler\u00a0has been appointed Chief Financial Officer and member of the Executive Board of DWS, effective November 1 at the latest. As Head of the CFO Division, he will be responsible for Finance, Tax, Capital Planning &amp; Management, Risk Management and Investor Relations. As previously announced,\u00a0Claire Peel, former Chief Financial Officer of DWS, decided to step down earlier this year; she left the company on September 30. Dr. Kobler was Chief Financial Officer and Member of the Executive Committee of Allianz Global Investors since 2013 and served as Head of Allianz Global Investors in the UK since 2020. Prior to joining Allianz Global Investors, Dr. Kobler was a Managing Director at Bank Julius Baer in both Zurich and Singapore. He holds an M.A. from the University of St. Gallen and a PhD from the University of Basel. At the end of September, DWS settled the SEC?s investigation into certain historic ESG processes, procedures and marketing practices in relation to DWS? US mutual funds business. The SEC ESG Order, following an extensive two-year examination, finds no misstatements in relation to DWS? financial disclosures or in the prospectuses of DWS? funds. The Order also makes clear that there was no intent to defraud, and the weaknesses identified by the SEC are in relation to processes and procedures that the firm has already taken steps to address. At the same time, DWS settled the SEC?s examination into DWS? historic AML policies and procedures. DWS is committed to maintaining a robust risk management framework, and since 2020, has taken steps to enhance its AML processes for its U.S. mutual fund business. DWS is glad that the SEC has also acknowledged its cooperation in connection with both investigations, and its remediation efforts in respect of the findings. In early October, DWS announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with BOCHK Asset Management Limited (BOCHKAM) ? a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of China Hong Kong (Holdings) Limited ? to serve investors in Hong Kong. The alliance brings together the complementary skills of DWS? investment capabilities across Active, Passive, Alternatives, as well as bespoke solutions, and BOCHKAM?s expertise in product development and servicing, as well as distribution reach in Hong Kong. The collaboration further strengthens DWS? ambition to grow its institutional, wealth management and retail solutions platforms in Hong Kong while BOCHKAM will provide its investors with greater access to the global investment expertise and innovative investment solutions offered by DWS. Outlook DWS still expects the adjusted Cost-Income Ratio (CIR) to remain below 65 percent in 2023.

Important Note This release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they include statements about our beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them. These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to the management of DWS Group GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any of them publicly in light of new information or future events. By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could therefore cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include the conditions in the financial markets in Germany, in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues and in which we hold a substantial portion of our assets, the development of asset prices and market volatility, the implementation of our strategic initiatives, the reliability of our risk management policies, procedures and methods, and other risks. The DWS ESG Framework (formerly DWS ESG Product Classification Framework) (?ESG Framework?) was introduced in 2021, taking into account relevant legislation (including SFDR), market standards and internal developments and was further described in our Annual Report 2021. Based on the further evolution of the regulatory environment, we incorporated some refinements into the ESG Framework in the fourth quarter of 2022. Besides liquid passively managed funds (ETFs) which apply a screen comparable to the ?DWS ESG Investment Standard? filter or have a ?sustainable investment objective?, as well as other liquid passively managed funds which have been labelled as ESG and/or seek to adhere to an ESG investment strategy, now also liquid passively managed funds (ETFs) which track indices that comply with the EU Benchmark Regulation on EU Climate Transition Benchmark and EU Paris-Aligned Benchmark are considered as ESG. Further details can be found in our Annual Report 2022. We will continue to develop and refine our ESG Framework in accordance with evolving regulation and market practice. The aforementioned definitions apply to the entire release. This release contains alternative performance measures (APMs). For a description of these APMs, please refer to the Interim Report, which is available at .

Addressing the general debate of the UN General Assembly, he declared that the United States was moving into a \"new era of relentless diplomacy\" as it tackles emerging technological threats and the expansion of autocratic nations.  Biden used the highest UN platform to present the paradigm shift in Washington's approach towards global issues: \"Instead of continuing to fight the wars of the past, we are fixing our eyes on devoting our resources to the challenges that hold the keys to our collective future: ending this pandemic; addressing the climate crisis; managing the shifts in global power dynamics; shaping the rules of the world on vital issues like trade, cyber, and emerging technologies; and facing the threat of terrorism as it stands today.\"  President Biden defended his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Afghanistan, driving home a message that this has opened a new chapter of intensive American diplomacy.  The use of force should be \"our tool of last resort, not our first,\" he said, arguing in favor of recalibrating priorities away from two decades of wars toward newly emerging threats.  He underscored that the world must choose between democracy and autocracy, indicating the stark difference since the Taliban again took control of Kabul and reversed 20 years of democratic gains.  In his inaugural address to the annual gathering of world leaders at the UN, the U.S. President called for a new era of global unity against the compounding crises of COVID-19, climate change and insecurity.  \"Simply put, we stand.at an inflection point in history\", he said. \"We must work together as never before.\"  Biden assured leaders attending the UN General Assembly that Washington intends to partner with allies to \"help lead the world toward a more peaceful, prosperous future for all people\".   \"Today, many of our greatest concerns cannot be solved or even addressed by the force of arms\", he stated, reminding that \"bombs and bullets cannot defend against COVID-19 or its future variants.\"  He noted that US planes carrying vaccines have landed in more than 100 countries, offering a \"dose of hope\", and said that he would be announcing additional vaccine commitments soon.   Biden also called for a new global health mechanism to \"finance global health security\" and mooted the creation of a Global Health Threat Council to stay ahead of emerging pandemics.  Without naming his predecessor, Biden stressed that his Administration has shifted away from President Donald Trump's 'America first style of diplomacy towards one of multilateralism.  \"We're back at the table in international forums, especially the United Nations, to focus attention and to spur global action on shared challenges\", he said, pointing to the U.S. government's re-engagement with the World Health Organization; participation in the COVAX vaccine initiative \"to deliver life-saving vaccines around the world\"; re-joining the Paris climate agreement; and preparing to run for a seat on the Human Rights Council next year.  He also elaborated on a new US goal under the Paris Agreement to reduce greenhouse gases to 50 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and talked about investments under discussion with Congress, including for \"green infrastructure and electric vehicles.\"      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPAENG-163232242400413AFU0413</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPAENG2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63NP-95B1-J9XT-N42K-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-09-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"568\"/><timeReceived>4:53 PM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 dpa-AFX Wirtschaftsnachrichten GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>dpa-AFX International ProFeed</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0503\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"09\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>September 22, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

KGaA / Key word(s): 9 Month figures/Quarter Results Q3 2023: DWS Progresses with Continued Net Inflows and Stable Revenues in Challenging Market Environment  25.10.2023 / 06:58 CET/CEST The issuer is solely responsible for the content of this announcement.  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------    * Continued delivery against strategy despite clients' lower risk appetite     and challenging capital markets    * Net flows ex Cash of EUR 1.6bn in Q3 resulting in EUR 20.8bn in the     first nine months of 2023     (including Cash EUR 2.3bn in Q3 2023, EUR 17.3bn in 9M 2023), driven by     strong flows into Xtrackers products. ESG funds with continued net     inflows of EUR 1.7bn in Q3    * Adjusted revenues stable at EUR 666m in Q3 (Q2 2023: EUR 668m)    * Adjusted costs at EUR 420m in Q3 (Q2 2023: EUR 408m), up 3% q-o-q    * Adjusted Cost-Income Ratio (CIR) with 63.1% in Q3 (Q2 2023: 61.0%) and     63.4% in the first nine months on track to achieve DWS' outlook for the     year 2023    * Net income increased by 2% to EUR 147m in Q3 (Q2 2023: EUR 145m)    * Adjusted profit before tax at EUR 246m in Q3 - down 6% q-o-q (Q2 2023:     EUR 260m)    * Assets under Management marginally increased to EUR 860bn in Q3 (Q2     2023: EUR 859bn; Q4 2022: EUR 821bn) as net inflows and positive effects     from exchange rate movements slightly exceeded the negative impact from     market developments  Business Development  In an again challenging market environment with ongoing geopolitical tensions in the third quarter of 2023, DWS continued to generate net inflows. Based on stable revenues and focused cost management, the company achieved solid quarterly results leading to overall good financial results for the first nine months of 2023.  Driven by strong net new assets in Passive including Xtrackers the company recorded net inflows (ex cash) of EUR 1.6 billion in the third quarter. Including Cash, net flows were EUR 2.3 billion, whereof EUR 1.7 billion came from ESG [1] products. In the first nine months of the year, DWS generated net inflows (ex cash) of EUR 20.8 billion, including Cash of EUR 17.3 billion. Assets under Management increased marginally in Q3 2023 to EUR 860 billion as net inflows and positive exchange rate movements slightly exceeded the negative impact from market developments. Compared to year-end 2022, Assets under Management increased by a total of EUR 38 billion. Due to market turmoil in 2022, DWS started the year 2023 with a significantly lower average Assets under Management basis than the previous year.  In the third quarter of 2023, adjusted revenues were flat compared to the second quarter, with higher management fees and lower performance and transaction fees, which had been very high in the previous quarter. The adjusted cost base increased by 3 percent in Q3 quarter-on-quarter due to seasonal effects. The adjusted Cost-Income Ratio of 63.1 percent in the third quarter and 63.4 percent in the first nine months of the year is in line with DWS' outlook for the full year 2023. The adjusted profit before tax was 6 percent lower in Q3 compared to Q2, while net income increased by 2 percent.  Adjusted revenues were virtually stable at EUR 666 million in Q3 2023 (Q2 2023: EUR 668 million). In the first nine months of 2023, adjusted revenues decreased year-on-year by 5 percent to EUR 1,943 million (9M 2022: EUR 2,049 million). That was predominantly due to lower management fees, mainly driven by declining markets in 2022, which led to lower average Assets under Management during the first nine months of 2023. This reflected the particular positive pre-war environment for asset managers in the first quarter 2022.  Adjusted profit before tax declined by 6 percent to EUR 246 million in the third quarter (Q2 2023: EUR 260 million). After tax, DWS posted a 2 percent higher net income of EUR 147 million for the third quarter 2023 (Q2 2023: EUR 145 million). Adjusted profit before tax for the first nine months of 2023 decreased by 12 percent year-on-year to EUR 711 million (9M 2022: EUR 804 million). Net income dropped in the first nine months of 2023 year-on-year by 12 percent to EUR 430 million (9M 2022: EUR 488 million), which again reflects the significantly more positive market conditions at the beginning of 2022.  Assets under Management (AuM) increased marginally to EUR 860 billion in the third quarter of 2023 (Q2 2023: EUR 859 billion; Q4 2022: EUR 821 billion) as net inflows and positive exchange rate movements slightly exceeded the negative impact from market developments on the AuM.  Net flows ex Cash were EUR 1.6 billion (including Cash: EUR 2.3 billion) in the third quarter of 2023. Passive including Xtrackers and to a minor extent low-margin Cash products generated net inflows, while Active (ex Cash) and to a lesser degree Alternatives saw net outflows. ESG products attracted continued net inflows of EUR 1.7 billion in the third quarter. Year-to date, DWS generated net new assets ex Cash of EUR 20.8 billion (including Cash: EUR 17.3 billion).  Active Asset Management ex Cash recorded net flows of minus EUR 3.3 billion in the third quarter (Q2 2023: EUR 0.3 billion). While Fixed Income generated net new assets of EUR 0.2 billion supported by inflows into flagship retail funds, the other sub-asset classes could not escape the negative market trend and lower risk appetite on the clients' side in the third quarter leading to net outflows of minus EUR 1.6 billion for Active Equity, minus EUR 1.2 billion for Multi Asset and minus EUR 0.6 billion for Active SQI. Cash products continued to be volatile and generated net flows of EUR 0.6 billion (Q2 2023: minus EUR 1.1 billion). In the first nine months of 2023, Active Asset Management ex Cash generated net new assets of EUR 2.8 billion, while low-margin Cash products saw net outflows of minus EUR 3.6 billion.  Passive Asset Management generated strong net new assets of EUR 6.2 billion in the third quarter (Q2 2023: EUR 6.2 billion). Flows were driven by Xtrackers ETPs (exchange-traded funds and commodities) while institutional mandates saw minor outflows. Year-to-date, Passive Asset Management recorded net inflows of EUR 16.8 billion. In the third quarter and in the first nine months of the year, DWS ranked number two by European ETP net flows (source: ETFGI).  Alternatives recorded net flows of minus EUR 1.3 billion in the third quarter (Q2 2023: EUR 3.9 billion), driven by net flows of minus EUR 0.8 billion in Liquid Real Assets and minus EUR 0.5 billion in Illiquid Alternatives. In the first nine months of the year, Alternatives generated net new assets of EUR 1.2 billion.  Adjusted costs, which also exclude transformational charges and other material non-recurring expenses, increased by 3 percent to EUR 420 million in Q3 2023 (Q2 2023: EUR 408 million). This was mainly due to higher adjusted general and administrative expenses, driven by seasonal effects including marketing spend, professional fees and other service charges, while adjusted compensation and benefits costs increased only slightly. In the first nine months of the year, adjusted costs were slightly reduced by 1 percent to EUR 1,232 million (9M 2022: EUR 1,245 million) despite high inflation rates.  The adjusted Cost-Income Ratio (CIR) increased by 2.1 percentage points to 63.1 percent in the third quarter 2023 (Q2 2023: 61.0 percent). Year-on-year, the adjusted CIR rose by 2.6 percentage points to 63.4 percent in the first nine months of the year (9M 2022: 60.8 percent). It remains on track to achieve DWS' outlook for the year 2023, in which the company progresses transformation activities and accommodates inflationary pressures.  Growth Initiatives and Strategic Progress  In the third quarter, DWS listed three new thematic Xtrackers exchange-traded funds (ETFs) on the Nasdaq. They are designed to provide investors equity exposure to three vital U.S. industry sectors - U.S. green infrastructure, semiconductor and cybersecurity - at a competitive cost. The ETFs represent the first Xtrackers thematic offering for U.S. investors. The launch supports the firm's growth plans of expanding the Xtrackers footprint in the Americas with specialized, bespoke index investment solutions. The funds will complement DWS' European thematic ETF suite, which was launched in 2019.  As a first investment for its European infrastructure investment strategy dedicated to German retail and institutional investors, DWS invested in a solar park in Klettwitz, Brandenburg, one of the largest open-space photovoltaic plants in Germany. The European infrastructure investments strategy is part of DWS' family of investment solutions to support the European Transformation.  DWS announced that Dr. Markus Kobler has been appointed Chief Financial Officer and member of the Executive Board of DWS, effective November 1 at the latest. As Head of the CFO Division, he will be responsible for Finance, Tax, Capital Planning &amp; Management, Risk Management and Investor Relations. As previously announced, Claire Peel, former Chief Financial Officer of DWS, decided to step down earlier this year; she left the company on September 30. Dr. Kobler was Chief Financial Officer and Member of the Executive Committee of Allianz Global Investors since 2013 and served as Head of Allianz Global Investors in the UK since 2020. Prior to joining Allianz Global Investors, Dr. Kobler was a Managing Director at Bank Julius Baer in both Zurich and Singapore. He holds an M.A. from the University of St. Gallen and a PhD from the University of Basel.  At the end of September, DWS settled the SEC's investigation into certain historic ESG processes, procedures and marketing practices in relation to DWS' US mutual funds business. The SEC ESG Order, following an extensive two-year examination, finds no misstatements in relation to DWS' financial disclosures or in the prospectuses of DWS' funds. The Order also makes clear that there was no intent to defraud, and the weaknesses identified by the SEC are in relation to processes and procedures that the firm has already taken steps to address. At the same time, DWS settled the SEC's examination into DWS' historic AML policies and procedures. DWS is committed to maintaining a robust risk management framework, and since 2020, has taken steps to enhance its AML processes for its U.S. mutual fund business. DWS is glad that the SEC has also acknowledged its cooperation in connection with both investigations, and its remediation efforts in respect of the findings.  In early October, DWS announced that it has entered into a strategic alliance with BOCHK Asset Management Limited (BOCHKAM) - a wholly owned subsidiary of Bank of China Hong Kong (Holdings) Limited - to serve investors in Hong Kong. The alliance brings together the complementary skills of DWS' investment capabilities across Active, Passive, Alternatives, as well as bespoke solutions, and BOCHKAM's expertise in product development and servicing, as well as distribution reach in Hong Kong. The collaboration further strengthens DWS' ambition to grow its institutional, wealth management and retail solutions platforms in Hong Kong while BOCHKAM will provide its investors with greater access to the global investment expertise and innovative investment solutions offered by DWS.  Outlook  DWS still expects the adjusted Cost-Income Ratio (CIR) to remain below 65 percent in 2023.

Important Note  This release contains forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements are statements that are not historical facts; they include statements about our beliefs and expectations and the assumptions underlying them. These statements are based on plans, estimates and projections as they are currently available to the management of DWS Group GmbH &amp; Co. KGaA. Forward-looking statements therefore speak only as of the date they are made, and we undertake no obligation to update any of them publicly in light of new information or future events.  By their very nature, forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties. A number of important factors could therefore cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement. Such factors include the conditions in the financial markets in Germany, in Europe, in the United States and elsewhere from which we derive a substantial portion of our revenues and in which we hold a substantial portion of our assets, the development of asset prices and market volatility, the implementation of our strategic initiatives, the reliability of our risk management policies, procedures and methods, and other risks.  The DWS ESG Framework (formerly DWS ESG Product Classification Framework) (\"ESG Framework\") was introduced in 2021, taking into account relevant legislation (including SFDR), market standards and internal developments and was further described in our Annual Report 2021. Based on the further evolution of the regulatory environment, we incorporated some refinements into the ESG Framework in the fourth quarter of 2022. Besides liquid passively managed funds (ETFs) which apply a screen comparable to the \"DWS ESG Investment Standard\" filter or have a \"sustainable investment objective\", as well as other liquid passively managed funds which have been labelled as ESG and/or seek to adhere to an ESG investment strategy, now also liquid passively managed funds (ETFs) which track indices that comply with the EU Benchmark Regulation on EU Climate Transition Benchmark and EU Paris-Aligned Benchmark are considered as ESG. Further details can be found in our Annual Report 2022.  We will continue to develop and refine our ESG Framework in accordance with evolving regulation and market practice. The aforementioned definitions apply to the entire release.  This release contains alternative performance measures (APMs). For a description of these APMs, please refer to the Interim Report, which is available at  <url normalizedValue=\"https://group.dws.com/ir/reports-and-events/financial-results/\">https://group.dws.com/ir/reports-and-events/financial-results/</url>.

In the first nine months of the year, we have     earned more than in the full year 2022.\"  Commerzbank continued its strong business performance in the third quarter 2023 and almost doubled its net profit after the first nine months. The Bank benefited from the interest rate environment, from a low risk result despite the economic slowdown and from its continued strict cost discipline. The Bank has almost achieved the key targets of its \"Strategy 2024\" and has laid a strong foundation for the targeted higher pay-out. It is now embarking on its next strategic phase. By 2027, the revenue base is to be further expanded through consistent customer orientation and profitability is to be continuously increased.  \"With 'Strategy 2024' we have successfully implemented difficult but necessary restructuring measures. We have established a new business model and brought Commerzbank back on track for success\", said Manfred Knof, Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank. \"Our strategic plan up to 2027 is built on this. We will increase our revenue base, further improve the cost-income ratio, and boost our return on tangible equity. This will create value for our shareholders and expand our position as a decisive player in the German banking market.\"  Net profit is to increase to EUR3.4 billion by 2027 and the return on tangible equity (RoTE) is expected to reach more than 11%. This will allow the Bank to earn its cost of capital. An increase in net commission income is anticipated to be the major contributing factor, while net interest income is expected to increase moderately from an already elevated level. The Bank's financial steering will continue to be based on the cost-income ratio, which is planned to improve to around 55% by 2027.  The target for the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is 13.5%. The Bank plans to return more capital to its shareholders. For the years 2025 to 2027, a pay-out ratio well above 50%, but not more than the net result after deduction of AT1 coupon payments, is planned. For 2022 to 2024, the plan is still to distribute a total of EUR3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs. For the current year, the Bank confirms its target to distribute 50% of its net result after deduction of AT1 coupon payments via a dividend and an applied-for share buy-back of up to EUR600 million. It is planned that this share buy-back takes place prior to the Annual General Meeting in 2024. The respective pay-out ratios depend on the economic development and business opportunities. All share buy-backs are subject to approval by the European Central Bank and the German Finance Agency.  The strategy until 2027 is based on three pillars: growth, excellence and responsibility. The Bank intends to support its customers with relevant products and solutions and to further improve the customer experience across all channels, i.e. in branches, in the advisory centre, and via digital access points. The revenue base will be strengthened primarily through expanded fee business. To increase its efficiency, the Bank will focus on simplifying digital processes. The cost-income ratio is also to be improved on this basis. Sustainability continues to be a key component of the strategy. The Bank will continue to actively shape the sustainable transformation of the German economy. Employees are crucial for successfully implementing the strategy. Therefore, the Bank will strengthen its position as an attractive employer for its employees and talents.  PSBC: Asset and Wealth Management as well as comdirect are drivers of growth  In the Private and Small-Business Customer segment (PSBC), the range of optimised and digital banking solutions will be expanded for the Bank's almost 11 million customers. With a holistic approach and its two brands, Commerzbank and comdirect, all customer needs will be met - be it online or mobile, in the advisory centre, or in the existing around 400 branches. Commerzbank is committed to offering every customer the right model for their daily banking needs. The Bank will also further develop its account and card offerings as well as payment transaction solutions. As a premium provider, Commerzbank pursues the claim to be first point of contact for demanding customers. It will expand its portfolio with a focus on securities and loan business. Commerzbank especially sees opportunities in Asset and Wealth Management. Here, activities will be expanded with tailor-made and holistic offerings for premium customers, for example through its newly founded asset management company Yellowfin. The Bank will use a holistic advisory tool within its Wealth Management consulting services: In addition to liquid assets also illiquid assets will be considered. With small-business customers, it will increase customer growth while focussing on specific target groups. comdirect will strengthen its position as the primary digital bank with an expanded product offering and its excellent brokerage platform. mBank will expand its leading position with private customers based on its attractive digital business model.  Corporate Clients: expanding leading market position  As the leading German Mittelstandsbank, Commerzbank will continue to closely accompany its corporate clients. The Bank will drive forward its previous strategy in corporate banking through targeted investments in products and digital solutions until 2027. Commerzbank will strengthen transaction banking by investing in new systems and technologies to secure its leading position in payment transactions and in the processing of German foreign trade. In international business, the Bank serves clients worldwide with a business relationship to Germany, Austria or Switzerland or with selected future-orientated industries. In the lending business, the focus is on growth in Germany and the financing of global green infrastructure projects. To this end, Commerzbank will build on its centers of competence for renewable energies in Hamburg, New York, and Singapore. In the Capital Markets segment, the Bank wants to expand its digital offering for FX and open up its trading platform to other asset classes. In addition, it will grow its bonds business.  Basis for strategy until 2027 set by strong business development in 2023  In the third quarter of the current financial year, the Bank increased its revenues by 46% to EUR2.755 billion (Q3 2022: EUR1.886 billion). The main driver was the rise in net interest income of more than one third to EUR2.166 billion (Q3 2022: EUR1.621 billion) which once again also improved quarter-on-quarter. In addition, special burdens in Poland were significantly below the previous year's figure in the third quarter. Despite a weaker securities business, net commission income was stable at EUR831 million (Q3 2022: EUR849 million). In the first nine months of the year, the Bank's total revenues amounted to EUR8.052 billion (9M 2022: EUR7.098 billion).  Despite inflationary pressure, costs increased only slightly in the third quarter to EUR1.549 billion (Q3 2022: EUR1.520 billion). This includes a decrease in compulsory contributions to EUR45 million (Q3 2022: EUR91 million), which is mainly due to lower contributions in Poland. Operating expenses increased to EUR1.504 billion (Q3 2022: EUR1.429 billion) following higher accruals for variable compensation related to the positive business development and general salary increases. Overall, the cost-income ratio improved to 56% in the third quarter (Q3 2022: 81%). After the first nine months of 2023, total costs were down by 1.4% to EUR4.806 billion (9M 2022: EUR4.873 billion); the cost-income ratio was 60% (9M 2022: 69%).  The risk result was at a low level of minus EUR91 million in the third quarter despite the challenging economic environment (Q3 2022: minus EUR84 million). This reflects the high quality of the loan book with a non-performing exposure (NPE) ratio of only 1.0%. For possible future defaults due to secondary effects from supply chain problems, inflation, and higher interest rates, the Bank still has a general risk provision (top-level adjustment (TLA)) of EUR435 million available.  In the third quarter, the Bank almost quadrupled its operating result year-on-year to EUR1.116 billion (Q3 2022: EUR282 million); in the first nine months of the year, it has increased by 83% to EUR2.879 billion (9M 2022: EUR1.571 billion). Net profit after tax and minority interests increased to EUR684 million in the third quarter (Q3 2022: EUR195 million).  The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1 ratio) increased once again to 14.6% as of 30 September 2023 (Q2 2023: 14.4%). This already takes into account the accrual for the planned pay-out of 50% of the net result after deduction of AT1 coupon payments for the 2023 financial year. The buffer to the regulatory minimum requirement (MDA threshold) of around 10.1% was 448 basis points at the end of September. Return on tangible equity (RoTE) improved significantly in the first nine months of the year to 8.6% (9M 2022: 4.3%).  \"The transformation efforts in recent years are increasingly paying off. In addition to the favourable interest rate environment, we are benefiting from a low risk result and ongoing cost discipline\", said Chief Financial Officer Bettina Orlopp. \"In the first nine months of the year, we have already earned more than in the full year 2022. We expect to increase the return on tangible equity to 7.5%, reaching our target from 'Strategy 2024' one year ahead of schedule. This is a strong basis for the planned significant increase of our pay-out.\"  Segment development in Q3: successful deposit management  In the face of increasing competition for deposits, the Private and Small-Business Customer (PSBC) segment in Germany performed well. Deposits increased to EUR157 billion (end of June: EUR153 billion) as of the end of September with customers increasingly reallocating funds from their current accounts into interest-bearing products. The lending volume increased slightly to EUR125 billion (Q2 2023: EUR124 billion). Overall, PSBC's net interest income in Germany rose by almost 9% to EUR597 million (Q3 2022: EUR550 million) in the third quarter.  The securities volume declined slightly compared to the previous quarter to EUR205 billion (Q2 2023: EUR208 billion). Year-on-year, the Bank recorded a significant increase due to the positive development on the stock exchanges (Q3 2022: EUR182 billion). Customers, however, traded significantly less due to low market volatility. In addition, increased interest rates on deposits prompted a reluctance to invest in securities. As such, the segment's net commission income fell to EUR436 million (Q3 2022: EUR451 million). All in all, operating result of the Private and Small-Business Customer segment in Germany decreased slightly to EUR299 million (Q3 2022: EUR320 million).  mBank contributed EUR89 million to the Bank's operating result in the third quarter thanks to its continued very strong customer business and was able to more than offset the additional provision of EUR234 million for its Swiss franc portfolio. In the first nine months of the year, the burdens amounted to EUR754 million. In the third quarter of 2022, mBank had still reported a loss of EUR528 million. At that time, the provision for the Swiss franc loans was almost EUR480 million, plus another special burden of EUR270 million for the \"credit holidays\".  The Corporate Clients segment increased its revenues by almost 15% to EUR1.171 billion (Q3 2022: EUR1.021 billion). It benefited from continued strong deposit business across all client groups. As a result, the segment was able to more than compensate for the slight decline in the capital market business due to lower market volatility. With a very low risk result of minus EUR4 million in Q3 (Q3 2022: plus EUR13 million), the operating result increased by almost 21% to EUR645 million (Q3 2022: EUR535 million).  Outlook for 2023 increased  Following the good performance in the third quarter, Commerzbank has improved its outlook for the full year 2023: it now expects a net profit of around EUR2.2 billion (2022: EUR1.4 billion). Revenues are expected to increase to around EUR10.6 billion (2022: EUR9.5 billion). Net interest income is anticipated to be more than EUR8.1 billion (2022: EUR6.5 billion). In its recent forecast, the Bank had projected a minimum of EUR7.8 billion in net interest income. However, some offsetting effects are expected in the fair value result in the fourth quarter as well. Net commission income is still anticipated to be slightly below last year's result of EUR3.5 billion.  The Bank confirms its cost target of EUR6.4 billion (2022: EUR6.5 billion). The cost-income ratio as key steering indicator is now expected to be 61%, approaching the target of 60% in 2024. The Bank now anticipates a risk result of below minus EUR700 million for the full year 2023 (2022: minus EUR876 million) before any potential usage of TLA. Until now, the Bank had anticipated burdens below EUR800 million. The CET 1 ratio is targeted at around 14.7% by the end of 2023. The RoTE is expected to be 7.5% (2022: 4.9%).

In the first nine months of the year, we have earned more than in the full year 2022.? Commerzbank continued its strong business performance in the third quarter 2023 and almost doubled its net profit after the first nine months. The Bank benefited from the interest rate environment, from a low risk result despite the economic slowdown and from its continued strict cost discipline. The Bank has almost achieved the key targets of its ?Strategy 2024? and has laid a strong foundation for the targeted higher pay-out. It is now embarking on its next strategic phase. By 2027, the revenue base is to be further expanded through consistent customer orientation and profitability is to be continuously increased. ?With ?Strategy 2024? we have successfully implemented difficult but necessary restructuring measures. We have established a new business model and brought Commerzbank back on track for success?, said Manfred Knof, Chairman of the Board of Managing Directors of Commerzbank. ?Our strategic plan up to 2027 is built on this. We will increase our revenue base, further improve the cost-income ratio, and boost our return on tangible equity. This will create value for our shareholders and expand our position as a decisive player in the German banking market.? Net profit is to increase to ?3.4 billion by 2027 and the return on tangible equity (RoTE) is expected to reach more than 11%. This will allow the Bank to earn its cost of capital. An increase in net commission income is anticipated to be the major contributing factor, while net interest income is expected to increase moderately from an already elevated level. The Bank?s financial steering will continue to be based on the cost-income ratio, which is planned to improve to around 55% by 2027. The target for the Common Equity Tier 1 ratio is 13.5%. The Bank plans to return more capital to its shareholders. For the years 2025 to 2027, a pay-out ratio well above 50%, but not more than the net result after deduction of AT1 coupon payments, is planned. For 2022 to 2024, the plan is still to distribute a total of ?3 billion to shareholders through dividends and share buy-backs. For the current year, the Bank confirms its target to distribute 50% of its net result after deduction of AT1 coupon payments via a dividend and an applied-for share buy-back of up to ?600 million. It is planned that this share buy-back takes place prior to the Annual General Meeting in 2024. The respective pay-out ratios depend on the economic development and business opportunities. All share buy-backs are subject to approval by the European Central Bank and the German Finance Agency. The strategy until 2027 is based on three pillars: growth, excellence and responsibility. The Bank intends to support its customers with relevant products and solutions and to further improve the customer experience across all channels, i.e. in branches, in the advisory centre, and via digital access points. The revenue base will be strengthened primarily through expanded fee business. To increase its efficiency, the Bank will focus on simplifying digital processes. The cost-income ratio is also to be improved on this basis. Sustainability continues to be a key component of the strategy. The Bank will continue to actively shape the sustainable transformation of the German economy. Employees are crucial for successfully implementing the strategy. Therefore, the Bank will strengthen its position as an attractive employer for its employees and talents.PSBC: Asset and Wealth Management as well as comdirect are drivers of growth In the Private and Small-Business Customer segment (PSBC), the range of optimised and digital banking solutions will be expanded for the Bank?s almost 11 million customers. With a holistic approach and its two brands, Commerzbank and comdirect, all customer needs will be met ? be it online or mobile, in the advisory centre, or in the existing around 400 branches. Commerzbank is committed to offering every customer the right model for their daily banking needs. The Bank will also further develop its account and card offerings as well as payment transaction solutions. As a premium provider, Commerzbank pursues the claim to be first point of contact for demanding customers. It will expand its portfolio with a focus on securities and loan business. Commerzbank especially sees opportunities in Asset and Wealth Management. Here, activities will be expanded with tailor-made and holistic offerings for premium customers, for example through its newly founded asset management company Yellowfin. The Bank will use a holistic advisory tool within its Wealth Management consulting services: In addition to liquid assets also illiquid assets will be considered. With small-business customers, it will increase customer growth while focussing on specific target groups. comdirect will strengthen its position as the primary digital bank with an expanded product offering and its excellent brokerage platform. mBank will expand its leading position with private customers based on its attractive digital business model.Corporate Clients: expanding leading market position As the leading German Mittelstandsbank, Commerzbank will continue to closely accompany its corporate clients. The Bank will drive forward its previous strategy in corporate banking through targeted investments in products and digital solutions until 2027. Commerzbank will strengthen transaction banking by investing in new systems and technologies to secure its leading position in payment transactions and in the processing of German foreign trade. In international business, the Bank serves clients worldwide with a business relationship to Germany, Austria or Switzerland or with selected future-orientated industries. In the lending business, the focus is on growth in Germany and the financing of global green infrastructure projects. To this end, Commerzbank will build on its centers of competence for renewable energies in Hamburg, New York, and Singapore. In the Capital Markets segment, the Bank wants to expand its digital offering for FX and open up its trading platform to other asset classes. In addition, it will grow its bonds business.Basis for strategy until 2027 set by strong business development in 2023 In the third quarter of the current financial year, the Bank increased its revenues by 46% to ?2.755 billion (Q3 2022: ?1.886 billion). The main driver was the rise in net interest income of more than one third to ?2.166 billion (Q3 2022: ?1.621 billion) which once again also improved quarter-on-quarter. In addition, special burdens in Poland were significantly below the previous year?s figure in the third quarter. Despite a weaker securities business, net commission income was stable at ?831\u00a0million (Q3 2022: ?849 million). In the first nine months of the year, the Bank?s total revenues amounted to ?8.052 billion (9M 2022: ?7.098 billion). Despite inflationary pressure, costs increased only slightly in the third quarter to ?1.549\u00a0billion (Q3\u00a02022: ?1.520\u00a0billion). This includes a decrease in compulsory contributions to ?45 million (Q3\u00a02022: ?91\u00a0million), which is mainly due to lower contributions in Poland. Operating expenses increased to ?1.504 billion (Q3 2022: ?1.429 billion) following higher accruals for variable compensation related to the positive business development and general salary increases. Overall, the cost-income ratio improved to 56% in the third quarter (Q3\u00a02022: 81%). After the first nine months of 2023, total costs were down by 1.4% to ?4.806\u00a0billion (9M\u00a02022: ?4.873\u00a0billion); the cost-income ratio was 60% (9M\u00a02022: 69%). The risk result was at a low level of minus ?91 million in the third quarter despite the challenging economic environment (Q3 2022: minus ?84 million). This reflects the high quality of the loan book with a non-performing exposure (NPE) ratio of only 1.0%. For possible future defaults due to secondary effects from supply chain problems, inflation, and higher interest rates, the Bank still has a general risk provision (top-level adjustment (TLA)) of ?435 million available. In the third quarter, the Bank almost quadrupled its operating result year-on-year to ?1.116 billion (Q3 2022: ?282 million); in the first nine months of the year, it has increased by 83% to ?2.879 billion (9M 2022: ?1.571 billion). Net profit after tax and minority interests increased to ?684 million in the third quarter (Q3 2022: ?195 million). The Common Equity Tier 1 ratio (CET 1 ratio) increased once again to 14.6% as of 30\u00a0September 2023 (Q2 2023: 14.4%). This already takes into account the accrual for the planned pay-out of 50% of the net result after deduction of AT1 coupon payments for the 2023 financial year. The buffer to the regulatory minimum requirement (MDA threshold) of around 10.1% was 448\u00a0basis points at the end of September. Return on tangible equity (RoTE) improved significantly in the first nine months of the year to 8.6% (9M\u00a02022: 4.3%). ?The transformation efforts in recent years are increasingly paying off. In addition to the favourable interest rate environment, we are benefiting from a low risk result and ongoing cost discipline?, said Chief Financial Officer Bettina Orlopp. ?In the first nine months of the year, we have already earned more than in the full year 2022. We expect to increase the return on tangible equity to 7.5%, reaching our target from ?Strategy 2024? one year ahead of schedule. This is a strong basis for the planned significant increase of our pay-out.?Segment development in Q3: successful deposit management  In the face of increasing competition for deposits, the Private and Small-Business Customer (PSBC) segment in Germany performed well. Deposits increased to ?157 billion (end of June: ?153\u00a0billion) as of the end of September with customers increasingly reallocating funds from their current accounts into interest-bearing products. The lending volume increased slightly to ?125\u00a0billion (Q2\u00a02023: ?124\u00a0billion). Overall, PSBC?s net interest income in Germany rose by almost 9% to ?597 million (Q3 2022: ?550 million) in the third quarter. The securities volume declined slightly compared to the previous quarter to ?205\u00a0billion (Q2\u00a02023: ?208\u00a0billion). Year-on-year, the Bank recorded a significant increase due to the positive development on the stock exchanges (Q3 2022: ?182 billion). Customers, however, traded significantly less due to low market volatility. In addition, increased interest rates on deposits prompted a reluctance to invest in securities. As such, the segment?s net commission income fell to ?436\u00a0million (Q3\u00a02022: ?451\u00a0million). All in all, operating result of the Private and Small-Business Customer segment in Germany decreased slightly to ?299\u00a0million (Q3\u00a02022: ?320 million). mBank contributed ?89 million to the Bank?s operating result in the third quarter thanks to its continued very strong customer business and was able to more than offset the additional provision of ?234 million for its Swiss franc portfolio. In the first nine months of the year, the burdens amounted to ?754 million. In the third quarter of 2022, mBank had still reported a loss of ?528 million. At that time, the provision for the Swiss franc loans was almost ?480 million, plus another special burden of ?270 million for the ?credit holidays?. The Corporate Clients segment increased its revenues by almost 15% to ?1.171 billion (Q3\u00a02022: ?1.021 billion). It benefited from continued strong deposit business across all client groups. As a result, the segment was able to more than compensate for the slight decline in the capital market business due to lower market volatility. With a very low risk result of minus ?4 million in Q3 (Q3 2022: plus ?13 million), the operating result increased by almost 21% to ?645 million (Q3 2022: ?535 million).Outlook for 2023 increased  Following the good performance in the third quarter, Commerzbank has improved its outlook for the full year 2023: it now expects a net profit of around ?2.2 billion (2022: ?1.4\u00a0billion). Revenues are expected to increase to around ?10.6 billion (2022: ?9.5 billion). Net interest income is anticipated to be more than ?8.1 billion (2022: ?6.5 billion). In its recent forecast, the Bank had projected a minimum of ?7.8 billion in net interest income. However, some offsetting effects are expected in the fair value result in the fourth quarter as well. Net commission income is still anticipated to be slightly below last year?s result of ?3.5 billion. The Bank confirms its cost target of ?6.4 billion (2022: ?6.5 billion). The cost-income ratio as key steering indicator is now expected to be 61%, approaching the target of 60% in 2024. The Bank now anticipates a risk result of below minus ?700 million for the full year 2023 (2022: minus ?876 million) before any potential usage of TLA. Until now, the Bank had anticipated burdens below ?800 million. The CET 1 ratio is targeted at around 14.7% by the end of 2023. The RoTE is expected to be 7.5% (2022: 4.9%).Financial figures at a glance</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"8\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec

Ad hoc announcement pursuant to Art. 53 LRZurich, May 2, 2022 Edisun Power announces mid-term targetsBuilding on a solid foundation and strong outlook in its core business, Edisun Power has defined an ambitious expansion plan along two key business activities: its existing Independent Power Producer (IPP) business and a pro-active asset management with the new \"buy-and-sell\" business.With a pipeline of 940 MW of projects and the need to accelerate its completion and to finance its construction, Edisun Power has announced on 25th March this year an extension of its existing \"buy-and-hold\" with a \"buy-and-sell\" business model. This balanced approach of combining stable cash-flows from the sale of renewable energy with high-margin profits from the sale of project rights, will create additional value from an ecological and economical viewpoint. For its IPP business and as a mid-term target, Edisun Power envisages to ramp-up its operating asset base from currently 84 MW to 300-350 MW (c. 1/3 of secured portfolio). For its \"buy-and-sell\" business, Edisun Power plans to sell 600-700 MW of projects (c. 2/3 of secured portfolio) to green infrastructure funds, utilities, pension funds and large corporates. This proportion shall remain as a goal for the business going forward. Until 2025, Edisun Power targets a revenue CAGR of 20% and an average EBITDA margin of more than 70%, with an equity ratio of more than 40%, while continuously increasing its dividends. To realize its defined strategy and expansion plan, Edisun Power's Board of Directors proposed an ordinary capital increase for a maximum of 1'200'000 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 30.00 each, to be fully paid up, which was approved at the Annual General Meeting on April 22, 2022 and is foreseen to be executed by end of July 2022. The company has initiated a sales process for late stage ready-to-build projects including related add-ons totaling around 185 MW to be executed in 2022. This potential sale may result in a significant increase of net profits for the period.

With a pipeline of 940 MW of projects and the need to accelerate its completion and to finance its construction, Edisun Power has announced on 25th March this year an extension of its existing \"buy-and-hold\" with a \"buy-and-sell\" business model. This balanced approach of combining stable cash-flows from the sale of renewable energy with high-margin profits from the sale of project rights, will create additional value from an ecological and economical viewpoint.  For its IPP business and as a mid-term target, Edisun Power envisages to ramp-up its operating asset base from currently 84 MW to 300-350 MW (c. 1/3 of secured portfolio). For its \"buy-and-sell\" business, Edisun Power plans to sell 600-700 MW of projects (c. 2/3 of secured portfolio) to green infrastructure funds, utilities, pension funds and large corporates. This proportion shall remain as a goal for the business going forward.  Until 2025, Edisun Power targets a revenue CAGR of 20% and an average EBITDA margin of more than 70%, with an equity ratio of more than 40%, while continuously increasing its dividends.  To realize its defined strategy and expansion plan, Edisun Power's Board of Directors proposed an ordinary capital increase for a maximum of 1'200'000 registered shares with a nominal value of CHF 30.00 each, to be fully paid up, which was approved at the Annual General Meeting on April 22, 2022 and is foreseen to be executed by end of July 2022.  The company has initiated a sales process for late stage ready-to-build projects including related add-ons totaling around 185 MW to be executed in 2022. This potential sale may result in a significant increase of net profits for the period.

In 2021, floods accounted for 31% of global economic losses from natural catastrophes, only 2% less than tropical cyclones, according to Swiss Re Institute's latest sigma report, \"Natural catastrophes in 2021: the flood gates are open.\" Zurich, 30 March 2022 - Natural catastrophes in 2021 resulted in a total global economic loss of USD 270 billion and insured losses of USD 111 billion, the fourth highest on sigma records. This continues the long-term trend of insured losses increasing by an average of 5-7% annually worldwide. While Hurricane Ida was the costliest single natural disaster in 2021, secondary peril events once again accounted for the majority of insured losses from natural catastrophes over the year. The flooding in Europe in July, for example, was the costliest natural disaster on record in the region. Despite record-level insured losses from floods, the associated global protection gap remains large.  'Floods affect nearly a third of the world population, more than any other peril. In 2021 alone, we witnessed more than 50 severe flood events across the world,' said Martin Bertogg, Head of Catastrophe Perils at Swiss Re. 'Given the scale of devastation, flood risk deserves the same attention and risk assessment rigour as primary perils such as hurricanes.' Flood losses will keep increasing with climate change and urbanisation Climate change is anticipated to cause more frequent and more extreme weather events. Growing populations, rapid urban development and the accumulation of economic wealth in disaster-prone areas are contributing to the ever-growing catastrophe losses. 2021 was another year of intense natural catastrophe activity, including devastating floods in Europe, China, the US, and other parts of the world. Already in the first quarter of 2022, major flooding in eastern Australia has caused widespread devastation and substantial insured losses.  'Growing losses from floods are becoming ever more apparent,' said J\u00e9r\u00f4me Jean Haegeli, Swiss Re's Group Chief Economist. 'Last year we had another wake-up call. There is a growing urgency for action to increase the resilience of societies worldwide. Together with the public sector, re/insurers are well equipped to steer development away from high-risk areas and invest in protective measures such as green infrastructure. This keeps assets insurable while also improving the growth outlook.' sigma records show that flooding is by far the most frequently occurring natural peril. In the past decade, there were approximately three times as many major flood events as tropical cyclones. Floods were also causing more than a third of all fatalities related to natural catastrophes. Economic losses from floods amounted to 23%, the second highest after tropical cyclones.  Yet Swiss Re Institute finds that over the past decade, only 5% of severe flood losses were insured in emerging markets and 34% in advanced economies, indicating a large global protection gap. The largest gap in flood protection is in Asia, with only 7% of economic losses being covered by insurance. By contrast, in Europe 34% of flood losses are insured.  Notes to editorsThe latest sigma report features mainly global data. Swiss Re's new  provides additional information about the global protection gap and the risk profiles of ten countries (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States of America).

This continues the long-term trend of insured losses increasing by an average of 5-7% annually worldwide. While Hurricane Ida was the costliest single natural disaster in 2021, secondary peril events once again accounted for the majority of insured losses from natural catastrophes over the year. The flooding in Europe in July, for example, was the costliest natural disaster on record in the region. Despite record-level insured losses from floods, the associated global protection gap remains large.  'Floods affect nearly a third of the world population, more than any other peril. In 2021 alone, we witnessed more than 50 severe flood events across the world,' said Martin Bertogg, Head of Catastrophe Perils at Swiss Re. 'Given the scale of devastation, flood risk deserves the same attention and risk assessment rigour as primary perils such as hurricanes.'  Flood losses will keep increasing with climate change and urbanisation Climate change is anticipated to cause more frequent and more extreme weather events. Growing populations, rapid urban development and the accumulation of economic wealth in disaster-prone areas are contributing to the ever-growing catastrophe losses. 2021 was another year of intense natural catastrophe activity, including devastating floods in Europe, China, the US, and other parts of the world. Already in the first quarter of 2022, major flooding in eastern Australia has caused widespread devastation and substantial insured losses.  'Growing losses from floods are becoming ever more apparent,' said J\\xE9r\\xF4me Jean Haegeli, Swiss Re's Group Chief Economist. 'Last year we had another wake-up call. There is a growing urgency for action to increase the resilience of societies worldwide. Together with the public sector, re/insurers are well equipped to steer development away from high-risk areas and invest in protective measures such as green infrastructure. This keeps assets insurable while also improving the growth outlook.'  sigma records show that flooding is by far the most frequently occurring natural peril. In the past decade, there were approximately three times as many major flood events as tropical cyclones. Floods were also causing more than a third of all fatalities related to natural catastrophes. Economic losses from floods amounted to 23%, the second highest after tropical cyclones.  Yet Swiss Re Institute finds that over the past decade, only 5% of severe flood losses were insured in emerging markets and 34% in advanced economies, indicating a large global protection gap. The largest gap in flood protection is in Asia, with only 7% of economic losses being covered by insurance. By contrast, in Europe 34% of flood losses are insured.  Notes to editors The latest sigma report features mainly global data. Swiss Re's new infographic provides additional information about the global protection gap and the risk profiles of ten countries (Australia, Canada, China, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Switzerland, United Kingdom and United States of America).

This is in stark contrast to Europe, which is trying to cut off Russian energy while rallying international opposition to the war. <br/>During his visit, Modi is expected to explain India's Ukraine position to European leaders. Germany will be his first stop, where the Indian prime minister will sit down for his first meeting with Chancellor Olaf Scholz in Berlin. <br/>The two leaders will chair the \"India-Germany Inter-Governmental Consultations (IGC),\" a bilateral dialogue format intended to move forward cooperation on several policy fronts. <br/>Germany seeks closer ties to India<br/>Ahead of the visit, Minister of State at the German Federal Foreign Office Tobias Lindner said, \"no major problem can be solved without India.\" <br/>\"We want to have cooperation in technology, education, security and climate change with India. India is such an important partner,\" Linder told a security meeting in Delhi early this week. <br/>Last year, India and Germany commemorated 70 years since the establishment of diplomatic relations, and the two countries have been strategic partners since 2000. <br/>\"This visit will be an opportunity to enhance and intensify cooperation in a broad range of areas and for the two governments to exchange views on regional and global matters of mutual interest,\" India's Ministry of External affairs said in a statement. <br/>Foreign policy experts said that the meetings will allow Modi to better understand Germany and Europe's perspective on Ukraine. <br/>India seeks the support of Germany and France in pushing through a free trade agreement Delhi is negotiating with Brussels. <br/>\"This is Modi's first meeting with Scholz, and a personal rapport will help propel both bilateral relations and renew EU ties to a new level in the current environment. Both Germany and France are key in this context of staying invested in the Indo-Pacific,\" Veena Sikri, a former Indian diplomat, told DW. <br/>After Berlin, Modi will then travel to Copenhagen at the invitation of the Prime Minister of Denmark Mette Frederiksen to participate in the second India-Nordic Summit with the leaders of Iceland, Norway, Sweden and Finland. <br/>Modi's last stop will be in Paris for talks with French President Emmanuel Macron. These are expected to set a more ambitious agenda for a strategic partnership as the re-elected Macron seeks to put France at the vanguard of European foreign policy. <br/>'No pressure' on India's Ukraine position? <br/>Over the last month, there have been a flurry of visits to India by Western officials, who so far have held back on overtly pressing Modi to condemn Russia's war. <br/>European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen sat down with Modi last week agreeing on new trade and technology cooperation and a promise to \"deepen bilateral cooperation with a focus on upholding the rules-based global order.\" <br/>After Modi met with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson last week, India's Foreign Secretary Harsh Vardhan Shringla said there was \"no pressure\" from the British leader over India's position on the Russian war. <br/>Last month, German Foreign and Security Advisor Jens Pl\u00f6tner met with Indian National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and External Affairs Minister S. Jaishankar and said Germany would not \"preach to India\" on the war in Ukraine. <br/>\"We are not here to lecture or demandWe are working with India on how best to stop this war,\" Pl\u00f6tner said. <br/>What does India want in Europe? <br/>India is a key strategic partner for the EU and is its third largest trading partner, accounting for \u20ac62.8 billion ($66.4 billion) worth of trade in goods in 2020, and the second largest export destination after the US. <br/>\"India's European policy has Germany as an important node, more for economic and technological reasons than a traditional strategic partnership, which France leads,\" Gurjit Singh, India's former ambassador to Germany, told DW. <br/>\"The German Indo-Pacific policy guidelines enunciated in 2021 were a new willingness to engage with India,\" he added. <br/>\"The expansion of trade and value chains out of Indian manufacturing hubs is linked to the nature of German business interests in India. These are largely green and small and they need to expand into larger green infrastructure projects,\" Singh said. <br/>Mohan Kumar, a former Indian ambassador to France, told DW that it is in India's interest that the EU becomes a strong, independent \"pole\" in a multipolar world. <br/>Kumar said the Ukraine crisis may expedite Europe's assertiveness on strategic issues, and Germany's changed position on defense and security is one manifestation of this. <br/>\"Germany has a new Chancellor and Modi believes in 'personal diplomacy,' so this meeting will be key,\" Kumar said. <br/>\"Germany has started pulling its weight in Indo-Pacific matters, which for India is important. Germany is an economic heavyweight and by far the most important partner in that sense,\" he added. <br/>Edited by: Wesley Rahn <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

The EU, now using its green investment as a form of \"green diplomacy,\" has significantly increased its leverage in the region as Southeast Asian states try to hedge against the US and China. <br/>Josh Kurlantzick, senior fellow for Southeast Asia at the Council on Foreign Relations, said cooperation could be difficult because of \"the drift away from China by some EU members, China's increasingly aggressive diplomacy, and the fact that so much of China's investment in Southeast Asia is environmentally unfriendly means.\" <br/>In March, Beijing placed sanctions on several European parliamentarians and think-tanks in retaliation to Brussels who, just hours earlier, sanctioned two Chinese Communist Party officials in Xinjiang over alleged human rights abuses of the Uyghur population. An EU-China investment pact was subsequently put on hold. <br/>Recently, the EU has also taken a more robust stance on the South China Sea and Taiwan. Taiwanese Foreign Minister Joseph Wu also made a secret visit to Brussels in late October, much to Beijing's disappointment. <br/>Working towards a greener economy <br/>EU ambassador to ASEAN Igor Driesmans, however, feels optimistic about upcoming green projects with China. <br/>Under the framework of the International Platform on Sustainable Finance, \"The EU and China are working together on greater convergence of taxonomies of green finance and investments, including identifying and assessing the commonalities and differences in our respective approaches and outcomes,\" Driesmans told DW. <br/>The platform was launched in 2019 by the EU and China, together with six other countries, to coordinate rules and standards on green finance. <br/>Last year, both sides launched a High-Level Environment and Climate Dialogue and their Joint Communique on Climate and Environment published in October extended their commitments to climate cooperation, including on transitions away from coal and fossil fuel subsidies. <br/>The EU and several European development banks have now pledged more than \u20ac780 million to the ASEAN Catalytic Green Finance Facility, Driesmans noted. <br/>Together, with support from other development partners, potentially China, this facility is expected to mobilize \u20ac7 billion for green infrastructure projects in Southeast Asia, he added. <br/>Sameer Kumar, an associate professor at the University of Malaya's Asia-Europe Institute, says there are practical areas where the EU and China can cooperate, such as effective management of solid wastes, a particular concern as 60% of the ASEAN region's population is forecast to live in urban areas by 2025. <br/>\"ASEAN would gain immensely from the long experience and technical expertise of the EU and China\" in this area, Kumar added. <br/>EU-China collaboration 'imperative' <br/>Chinese President Xi Jinping's vow in September to stop his country's funding of new coal-fired power plants abroad, meanwhile, was welcomed by Brussels. <br/>\"This is a good position from which the EU and China can cooperate to fund green initiatives in ASEAN,\" said Nithi Nesadurai, director and regional coordinator of Climate Action Network Southeast Asia. <br/>Their work would also be in parallel, Nesadurai added, with the EU and China funding different projects and different organizations. <br/>Last week saw the formal launch of the Smart Green ASEAN Cities program, an EU-funded initiative. Beijing has engaged in similar projects through the ASEAN-China Partnership for Eco-Friendly Urban Development scheme. <br/>Brussels has typically been reticent about criticizing the environmental policy of China, which was responsible for emitting 27% of the world's greenhouse gases in 2019, according to a recent Rhodium Group report. <br/>\"Europe and China may be economic competitors, but they are not geopolitical rivals in the way that the US and China are,\" said Sophia Kalantzakos, global distinguished professor in Environmental Studies and Public Policy at New York University. \"Climate and biodiversity cannot and should not be sacrificed at the altar of superpower rivalries.\" <br/>EU-China collaboration is \"imperative,\" Kalantzakos added. With just eight years to go until 2030, a global deadline for climate action, \"Southeast Asia will increasingly turn into a climate hotspot,\" she said. <br/>Edited by: Sou-Jie van Brunnersum <br/></p><p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

A the same time, Indians emit about 80?% less carbon per capita than Germans, showing that they consume much less energy.</p><p>Solar power was meant to illuminate India's route to clean-energy self-sufficiency with a generation capacity of 100 gigawatts (GW) by 2022. That would have required $?100 billion worth of investments. That has not quite materialised. The current solar capacity is a mere 32 GW. Multiplication by the factor three is not feasible within two years. One target for 2022 is 40,000 GW of solar roof-top capacity, but India is two to four years behind schedule, according to the IEEFA.</p><p>Nobody questions India's enormous potential, but making grand promises is easier than keeping them. The administrative and financial constraints are worrisome. Trade duties on solar panels from China have slowed down implementation, but they proved ineffective in terms of protecting domestic producers. The introduction of the new goods and services tax was disruptive too. It is basically a value-added tax (VAT) with six different brackets. As far as renewables are concerned, a major problem is that different brackets apply to different components. Intellectual-property rights and access to technology are other hurdles.</p><p>Various delays triggered a downward spiral. Tim Buckley from IEEFA says the lost momentum most likely puts the 2022 targets out of reach. Apart from 100 GW capacity for solar power, they include 60 GW for wind power, ten GW for biomass power and five GW for hydro power from small dams.</p><p>The target for the financial year 2029/30 is 450 GW of renewable generation capacity for the national grid. In principle, that is feasible. Experts see a potential for generating 300 GW of wind power alone at 100 meters above ground level. Late last year, not even 37 GW had been installed.</p><p>The IEEFA points out that suppliers who feed renewable power into the national grid get 2.43 rupees to three rupees per kilowatt hour. That is 25?% to 33?% below the tariff for coal-based power. The financial incentives are thus not set in a way that would accelerate investment in renewables, though those responsible for grid-related expenditure certainly appreciate cheaper power.</p><p>Another critical aspect is energy storage. The sun does not always shine and the wind does not always blow. For the nation to rely on renewables, energy storage will be key. There are emerging options, and costs are declining. However, where there should have been fast-paced action, there is hesitation and even lethargy. Even the national parliament's energy committee has expressed grave concern because targets are not being met. Covid-19 can only worsen the delay.</p><p>For several reasons, India must not mess up the energy transition. With the world's third largest economy (measured in purchasing power parities) and a population of soon 1.4 billion people, its success is of global relevance. According to the BP Energy Outlook 2018, India will overtake China as the largest growth market for energy in the course of this decade. India needs energy - and solutions must be sustainable.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP300420200000503</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXW-HJT1-F00C-60XV-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"718\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

In a brief essay, Jrgen Zattler has spelled out his personal views concerning the matter. He represents Germany on the Bank's executive board. The complete essay was published by the Center for Global Development, a Washington-based think tank, to coincide with this year's virtual spring meetings of World Bank and IMF (14 April to 17 April). The meetings are taking place in a digital format. Here are some of Zattler's important insights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The global Covid-19 crisis teaches us several lessons. According to Zattler, they include that 'human and animal health are interdependent and bound to the health of the ecosystems in which they exist' and that 'a weak health system in one country can threaten the entire world, and pockets of poverty can foster the uncontrolled spread - even in high-income countries'.'That means that 'we are all in this together' and that 'strong public institutions' are essential,both at national and supranational levels.</p><p>Most economists expect the global downturn now to prove more devastating than the one that started in 2008 after the collapse of Lehman Brothers, the investment bank. The impacts on developing countries will most likely be particularly hard, with remittances falling, commodity prices dropping and capital outflows reaching record levels. Zattler warns of 'looming food crisis'. Governments' emergency programmes to reduce the economic impact and stimulate business are important, but they should also serve the achievement of long-term goals, he demands:</p><p>'If companies are not liquidated, workers not fired and business relationships not cut off, the recovery will be stronger after a period of forced 'hibernation'. But this should not be an unconditional life-line. It is important to ensure that this stimulus is 'future-fit' and supports the structural transformation of our economies. As the UN secretary-general put it: 'recover better' - with more inclusive and sustainable models of development, such as tax incentives for green investments (e.g. in energy efficiency) or extending public 'green' infrastructure, as well as supporting local entrepreneurs to pilot innovative ideas.'</p><p>The World Bank's current action, according to Zattler, is organised along 'three lines of defence':</p><p>The first is to boost health care in partner countries.</p><p>The second is economic stabilisation, expanding partner countries' fiscal space, including for social-protection transfers without which the development gains of recent decades may be lost.</p><p>The third is to keep private-sector businesses viable.</p><p>The board member acknowledges in passing that debt problems are making it harder for many governments to respond to the crisis.</p><p>Zattler regrets that an internationally-coordinated global response to the global Covid-19 crisis is made more difficult by weaknesses of the multilateral system: 'Unlike in the security sector with the UN Security Council on top, there is no overarching international governance structure that deals with economic risks.'</p><p>A global panel assessing risks the way the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change does, would be helpful, Zattler writes. It would also make sense to establish something like a World Crisis Committee led by the UN secretary-general. That proposal was made by Gerd Mller, Germany's Federal Minister for Economic Cooperation and Development, to whom Zattler reports.</p><p>A core challenge is that national governmentsshow inadequate interest in making efforts related to global public goods (GPG). For obvious reasons, they want others to take care of these issues. However, the current multilateral system also has only limited incentives to invest in GPG and crisis prevention, Zattler laments. That is true even of the World Bank.</p><p>'The World Bank's business model is based on country programmes and demand from member countries. This is a big strength and should not be changed. However, when crises, as the current one, have spill-over effects - the model of GPG, including crises prevention and reaction, gets challenged.'</p><p>Zattler insists that humanity needs a stronger multilateral architecture:</p><p>'We can be certain that this will not be the last global crisis - with other pandemics looming, climate change accelerating, and biodiversity vanishing; not to speak about local and regional crises such as expanding bushfires and the current locust invasion in East Africa. Just as with coronavirus - there are several other, potentially more disastrous 'curves'' that ought to be 'flattened' - in and beyond our lifetime.'</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP30042020000516</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:5YXW-HJT1-F00C-60Y9-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-05-18</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"760\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"30\" month=\"04\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>April 30, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

With all the world's major economies now committed to cutting emissions, DW looks at what we can expect in 2021.After four years of former US President Donald Trump's pushback on climate change policy, President Joe Biden has lost no time in setting a climate neutral target for the US of 2050. The new president has also announced an international climate change conference for Earth Day, April 22, solidifying his commitment to global cooperation.With Biden in the White House, 2021 \"is likely to be the biggest year ever for climate change policy,\" according to Tim Gore of the Brussels-based green think tank The Institute for European Environmental Policy.Last year already saw big steps forward. By the end of 2020, two thirds of the world's emitters had pledged to cut emissions in the long term. The landmark Paris Agreement signed by 195 countries in 2015, committing to limit global temperature increases to maximum 2 degree Celsius above pre-industrial levels, also came into effect in 2020.As part of the agreement, each country is required to submit a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) every five years   a short-term goal on how this will be achieved. </p><p>After the 2020 United Nations Climate Change Conference, or COP26, was postponed to November 2021 because of the coronavirus pandemic, countries have a little more time to submit updated NDCs   including, now they have rejoined, the United States.\"In terms of NDCs, every country now needs short-term ambitions that are in line with long-term goals,\" climate scientist and founding partner of the German NewClimate Institute Niklas H\u00f6hne told DW.Rachel Cleetus, policy director of the climate and energy program at the US-based Union of Concerned Scientists, agreed that short-term commitments are key.\"By the time we get to COP26, we need major emitters like the US and the EU to have stepped up with new ambitious targets,\" Cleetus said. \"The Biden administration should join hands with the EU to form a highly ambitious coalition of the willing.\"All eyes on Biden's next moveAll parties are curious what goals Biden will set for the next decade to make his long-term targets achievable. His administration has already indicated an aim to make the US power sector climate neutral by 2035. The EU, which submitted an updated NDC in December 2020, aims to cut all emissions by at least 55% by 2030.Cleetus and Gore both singled out transport policy as one vital area for both the US and the EU in achieving their long-term targets.\"Transport is the biggest growing source of emissions in the US and the EU,\" Gore pointed out. \"We can expect some big announcements this year on how both Biden and the EU legislate on CO2 emissions from vehicles.\"\"And we also need governments to encourage and incentivize the private sector to step up,\" Cleetus pointed out. \"Auto manufacturer General Motors has already made an ambitious announcement to make [most of] its vehicles electric by 2035.\"Another key Biden pledge, which has been reflected to various degrees by other major emitters around the world, is the focus on rebuilding communities currently based around fossil fuel economies. Biden has announced a federal work group for economic revitalization of coal and power communities in the US, Cleetus explained.\"We have to make sure we are investing in a fair transition for these communities   and this is just as much of an issue in countries like Germany or China,\" Cleetus added.International contributions must be 'fair'While the US and the EU are single-handedly responsible for a great deal of the world's emissions, domestic green policies alone will not go far enough in tackling the global crisis.In line with the fair share policy outlined in the Paris Agreement, major emitters like the US and the EU must focus more on their international contributions to countries in the Global South, Harjeet Singh, climate change lead for anti-poverty NGO Action Aid, told DW.\"The current US target is actually around one fifth of its fair share,\" Singh said. \"If one country has historically occupied more ecological space, then that country has to do more to help developing countries.\"Singh cited the example of India which, with an economy ravaged by the coronavirus pandemic and Cyclone Amphan in 2020, needs climate finance to achieve green infrastructure goals.\"There are two things that need to be in the NDC: A domestic and an international contribution,\" climate scientist H\u00f6hne explained. \"I don't think it is yet fully understood by some developed countries that the NDC can only be fair if it involves international contributions.\"Cleetus believes that Biden's government is aware of this responsibility and the importance of \"climate justice.\"\"Biden's special envoy on climate change, John Kerry, has talked about the moral imperative of the climate crisis. This shows the Biden administration is willing to pay its fair share,\" she said.What will China do?Aside from the complex issue of climate finance, major emitters can also work on a global scale by setting good examples.\"Lots of countries are holding their cards close to their chest at the moment, waiting to see what the US does with its NDC   none more than China,\" Gore said.China surprised the world in late 2020 by announcing a target to be carbon neutral by 2060. Japan and South Korea quickly followed with their own long-term emissions-cutting pledges.\"The big question in the Chinese context is when they will peak their emissions,\" Gore added. \"It makes all the difference if that happens closer to 2025 or closer to 2030.\"Singh also sees Biden's role as highly influential. \"Biden's administration will push other countries into taking action. They can no longer hide behind the US,\" he said.H\u00f6hne gave the example of Brazil, which under President Jair Bolsonaro has \"gone backwards\" by putting forward an NDC that is less ambitious than its previous target. Bolsonaro, like former US President Trump, has denied the existence of climate change. But with Trump out of the White House, H\u00f6hne suggested that even climate-denying leaders like Bolsonaro may be forced to step up and take action.\"When the US and China put forward their NDCs, all other countries will have to put something ambitious forward too,\" he said.The power of the peopleLeaders like Bolsonaro may also face pressure from home. \"It is no longer possible for a democratic government to go to its voters and say they won't do anything on climate change,\" H\u00f6hne said.A January 2021 survey by the UN Development Agency   the People's Climate Vote   showed that 64% of people around the world believe that climate change is a global emergency, a number that is even higher for those under 18.\"The time for climate denialism is long gone,\" Harjeet Singh said. \"Countries can no longer make excuses.\" </p><p/></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NEWSTX-DEWL109988161234793013525876100145</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DEWL-7826</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61XC-HGD1-JCMN-Y485-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">484235</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-03-31</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1170\"/><timeReceived>10:25 AM EST</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Newstex LLC All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Newstex Blogs <br/>Deutsche Welle World</publicationName><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"02\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>February 3, 2021 Wednesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web Blog</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Web-based Publications</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>English</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"organization\"><classificationItem score=\"56\"><className>INSTITUTE FOR EUROPEAN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"licensor.indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"licensor.subject\"><classificationItem><className>Environment</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>ST000DNUO</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION &amp;

As the market rebounded in 2021 following the impact of Covid-19, we saw demand for STEM skills increase across all of our key markets. Whether it is engineers building green infrastructure, developers aiding digital transformation or the scientists helping to develop the next life-changing drug, we are proud to have placed more than 22,000 skilled people and, combined with our ESG efforts, we impacted over 33,000 lives this financial year. Within our contractor markets, we see particular client demand for our employed contractor model, a market segment where we lead in many countries, and now accounts for 32% of Group net fees. I am confident and excited about the future of SThree. Momentum is strong and demand for the talent we provide is expanding, driving anticipated double-digit growth in 2022. We are well positioned, we demonstrated our ability to navigate through unforeseen challenges, such as Covid-19, and we continue to evolve our delivery model. We will further invest in our infrastructure and our people in 2022, enhancing our Group-wide platform to drive accelerated margins in future years.

Our Group's c.2,700 staff cover the Technology, Life Sciences, Engineering and Banking &amp; Finance sectors. SThree is part of the Industrial Services sector.

A key measure of our performance is how well we lived that purpose. In our 2021 financial year, we placed over 22,000 STEM specialists with companies which need their talents to build a better future. We ran skills development programmes that improved our staff's capabilities, and our environmental, social and governance ('ESG') efforts enhanced lives in the communities where we operate. In total, SThree positively impacted over 33,000 lives in the past year. Everyone at SThree is extremely proud to provide meaningful, decent work and job opportunities to tens of thousands of people around the world.  As the world changed at the outset of the pandemic, and then fuelled by recovery in 2021 and a war for talent, our clients needed STEM talent fast, often on a project basis. We were ready to serve that demand, thanks to our strategy, as set out in our Capital Markets Day presentation in late 2019. Our approach was developed in response to two long-term trends: one, the growing need for STEM skills and two, the increased demand for flexible contract work to deliver time-limited projects, alongside focusing on best-in-class operational execution. As a result, we are pleased to report excellent year-end figures with net fees up 19% in constant currency at \u00a3356 million and adjusted operating profit up 106% in constant currency from \u00a331 million in 2020 to \u00a361 million in 2021. Both net fees and operating profit were also comfortably ahead of 2019 levels, which had been a record year in SThree's history. We took share from competitors in several key markets and our performance compares well to our UK-listed peer group.  \u00a0 Progress in pursuing our strategy \u00a0 Governance One of my priorities as Chair is to move the Group towards FTSE 250 standards of governance and last year, we made good progress towards this goal with many new initiatives including the Board's focus on climate-related disclosures and governance framework to oversee a robust climate change management strategy. \u00a0 Our positioning as leaders in STEM and flexible working We honed our value proposition through the year. The value we deliver for clients is our deep understanding of the STEM skills they need and the ability to supply candidates with those skills. That same deep understanding allows us to build strong relationships with candidates so that we can find the right roles for them and help guide their careers.  In addition to being a leader in STEM, we want to be known as a leader in flexible working. While we remain a full-service business for our clients with around 25% of our net fees from the placement of permanent candidates, largely in leadership roles, the biggest part of our business is now helping our clients' teams with highly skilled, flexible contract workers. That ratio of 75:25 contract to permanent hasn't changed materially during the year but there has been a continued shift within the contract group. Our Employed Contractor Model ('ECM'), where contractors are directly employed by SThree rather than the client, is proving an increasingly compelling proposition alongside freelancing. At the beginning of the year the mix was 46% independent contractors and 30% ECM. Now it is 43% independent contractors and 32% ECM.  \u00a0 ESG and DE&amp;I are central to our business model ESG and delivering on our purpose is a core part of our business. Every economy in which we operate will need to build back better and greener by investing in infrastructure. The COP26 UN climate change conference marked a step forward in global efforts to address climate change, including a material increase in ambitions to reduce emissions across the world.  Within environment, many of our clients are either in the renewable energy sector or navigating the low carbon transition. Social policy is essential to our operation as people are at the heart of our performance. We need our culture to be diverse, equitable and inclusive in order to attract and retain capable talent for our own business but also to source the candidates our clients need. As for governance, clients need assurances we have the legal resources and governance structures to deliver employee contracts that are fully compliant.  In April 2021 we published our first Impact Report, setting out ESG progress, metrics and targets. We are an early adopter of the robust Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') reporting standard, and you will find our first performance data in the Responsible business section of the Annual Report. Also in April 2021, we were delighted to be recognised as a climate leader by the Financial Times, joining the top 300 companies on their European Climate Leaders list. We were placed number 69 and are the only staffing sector company to achieve that distinction. Our DE&amp;I policies are critical to attract and retain talent and help people perform at the top of their game. In November 2021, SThree was awarded Company of the Year at the 2021 European Diversity Awards joining the ranks of best practitioners such as Lego, HSBC and Vivendi. Again, we were the only staffing sector company to be recognised.  We measured our current make-up and set challenging targets for gender, aspiring to increase gender representation at leadership levels to 50/50 by 2024. Our NED representation at the Board level is 50/50, in our Senior Leadership Team it is 40/60 and women currently occupy 31% of leadership roles more widely within the Group.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 Platform and people development We took great strides this year in improving our team members' development. We launched a new learning and development platform that is accessible to all from anywhere. New leadership training programmes were also put in place which achieved 92% participation.\u00a0 We gave bias training to our recruiters so they could reduce its influence in staffing decisions. We have exceeded the target percentage of the Group adjusted operating profit spend on our people development set out in our Capital Markets Day plan, achieving 5.5% in 2021 versus the target of 5.0%. It is critical for us to be hiring the right people in the right places as we increase our headcount. We therefore reviewed our talent acquisition and succession planning processes, refining them before training our recruiters in best practice.  Having culture and values endorsed by our entire business, including every member of the senior management team, is also critically important. Extended parental leave, family leave, support for mental well-being and extended paid volunteering hours for everyone are just a few examples of this year's initiatives to develop an inclusive culture around our people.  All these investments in our culture help us better fulfil our purpose: bringing skilled people together to build a better future. \u00a0 Markets and operating where STEM demand is strongest We made a deliberate shift through the pandemic to adjust our portfolio and focus on the five core markets: US, UK, Netherlands, Germany and Japan. Together, these represent over 75% of the world STEM market and over 86% of our net fees. Our strategy is to aim for leadership in those markets by achieving scale and using that scale to add value to our offer.  \u00a0 Segment recovery in core markets The standout segmental performance during the pandemic was in life sciences in the US, where demand was particularly strong. This was not just a result of Covid-19 programmes as other areas, such as medical devices, also contributed. There was strong adoption of technology, especially amongst some of the more traditional retailers who realised that, with consumers at home, they needed to improve their online business models. Infrastructure investment in Germany was strong and engineering project growth in the Netherlands supported strong demand for technology candidates.  Technology really helped drive a renaissance in the UK business as well, with public sector investment and other industries such as education and healthcare, which had been tech laggards, now rapidly adopting technology. Companies needed new channels to engage with their customers and drive more resilience in their supply chain. They also needed artificial intelligence experts and data analytics to understand their business and customers better.  Both trends drove demand for programmers. Engineers were needed to increase automation as did the energy and other sectors to support their decarbonisation journeys. After elective surgeries and treatment were artificially depressed during lockdowns, backlogs finally began to be addressed, which required health technology and engineering experts. Although certain niche skills that were out of favour, generally the story was one of strong recovery in demand. \u00a0 Our approach to the pandemic Our own response to the pandemic was to establish a framework approach, developing tactics for the three phases of the pandemic. First, there was the 'emergency response' phase, which we referred to in last year's annual report.\u00a0 Our approach here was to revise the way we supported our clients and our candidates, whilst still maintaining capacity for when demand began to return. We shifted to having all our people working from home and provided them with the IT equipment, training and personal support they needed.  The next phase, which we are thankfully emerging from in many of our markets, is the 'ongoing management of a rolling crisis' phase. Until it is fully resolved, we won't get the cross-sector recovery required to say with confidence that we have reached the final phase, 'a new normal'. Throughout the year, we were still in the ongoing management phase and there was always going to be a level of volatility. As all the evidence suggested our strategy remained sound, the questions we focussed on throughout the year were, 'how do we operate in this period?' and, 'how do we implement the strategy given the uncertain background?'. Inevitably, some of the investment priorities we had a year ago changed. We formally changed to a global hybrid working policy for all staff that allows us to flex to uncertain times. It has been well received by our people. Remote working was putting heavier demands on our IT systems, so we further invested in our IT infrastructure. As cyber security is an ongoing issue, we invested in better-quality systems to protect our candidates' and clients' data. In the final quarter of the year, we hired Nick Folkes, a highly skilled technology and transformation leader as our Chief Technology and Information Officer. \u00a0 Management appointments In July we welcomed Andrew Beach as our new Chief Financial Officer and said goodbye to Alex Smith, who had served as CFO for 12 years. I'd like to thank Alex again for his achievements in that time. At the close of the financial year, the Board announced that Mark Dorman would be stepping down from the Board and as CEO of the Group on 31 December 2021. Timo Lehne, who was serving as the Senior Managing Director of SThree's largest and most successful region, DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), was appointed Interim CEO and joined the Board as Executive Director from 1 January 2022. Mark will continue to assist the Group in facilitating a smooth handover and transition until 1 April 2022. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mark for his vision, drive and unique service to the Group over the past three years. \u00a0 A strong team effort I must sincerely thank all of SThree's employees for their exceptional productivity and adaptability throughout 2021, in what have been extremely difficult circumstances. My colleagues on the Board who navigated a situation that was without precedent, also deserve thanks. They provided excellent stewardship of the Company over the year. I would also like to thank our external stakeholders for their support. Candidates trusted us for advice and to guide their career development choices. Clients turned to us to meet their STEM talent requirements as they adapted to new challenges. Investors also showed confidence in us, having the full understanding of our strategy as well as our great operational and financial performance of the Group in 2021. \u00a0 Outlook Our year started with strong forward momentum. We will continue to build sustainable growth and will resume our plans for internal investment during the year, particularly in the infrastructure that will allow us to expertly harness data and efficiencies, for example in further enhanced CRM and ERP platforms. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in net fees and profits in 2022, maintaining our operating conversion ratio at similar levels to 2021 to allow for the impact from investment of between 1% and 2% of net fees to further strengthen our operational and sales platforms. We anticipate payback on the investment, delivering an acceleration of margins from 2023. I believe we have good reason to be confident: we are in the right markets, we are focused on the right sectors, and we have a team that is flexible and resilient enough to seize the opportunities ahead of us.  Group OPERATIONAL REVIEW \u00a0 Overview The Group delivered a very strong performance for the year, driven by the benefits of our business model and our strategy at the centre of two secular, long-term trends: an increasing demand for STEM skills and an accelerating trend towards flexible working.  Overall, Group net fees were up 19%* YoY, primarily attributable to our strategic focus on our Contract business, which now accounts for 75% of the Group net fees and delivered growth in net fees of 17%* YoY. Our contractor order book increased by nearly 43% YoY reflecting the high demand for skilled contractors across our markets. Permanent net fees were up 24%* YoY. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a360.8 million (2020: \u00a331.3 million), up 106%* YoY. Total Group year-end headcount was up 6% YoY with average headcount down 11% YoY. Over the next year we are focussing our strategy for talent attraction and retention where we continue to drive market share gain. We increased productivity per head 31% YoY in the year, although we do expect this to normalise to some extent going into 2022.  This has been a challenging period for our teams. The quality of our management and increasing expertise in our target markets are driving us forward on our journey to become the number one STEM talent provider in the best global STEM markets. We are committed to ensuring that SThree is well positioned over the long term and are confident we can continue to exploit the accelerating secular trends of STEM and flexible working across global markets and deliver our long-term ambitions. 2024 ambitions In 2019, looking ahead to 2024 we set ourselves several ambitions to deliver growth and value for our Company and all stakeholders: to grow Group market share by 50%;  to reach an operating profit conversion ratio in the range of 21-24%; and  to drive a free cash conversion ratio of at least 75%. \u00a0 We also committed to several targets regarding our people and society that reflect the importance we put on being a people-centric and purpose-driven business. For example, we committed to achieve 50/50 gender representation at all leadership levels by 2023, to maintain our Learning &amp; Development ('L&amp;D') spend at 5% of operating profit, to grow productivity per head over the period by 1% to 2% per annum, to reduce our absolute CO2 emissions by 20% and to double the size of our renewable energy business by 2024. We have made good progress taking market share in the USA, Germany and the Netherlands in the year. While the free cash flow conversion declined to 40% (2020: 178%) due to increased demand for contractors, our operating profit conversion ratio rapidly accelerated to 17.1% (2020: 10.1%), driven by our productivity and improved hiring conditions.  Within our People and Society goals we have slightly exceeded the target of the Group spend on people development, being 5.5% in 2021 versus the target of 5.0%, to support our people in their efforts and strategic focus in the post-pandemic times.  In 2021, we have also made a significant contribution towards climate action. We have grown our renewables business net fees by 22%* YoY, delivering nearly 46%* growth since 2019 (the baseline year). We have reduced our CO2 emissions by 44% YoY and have carried out a scenario analysis to provide our stakeholders with more transparency and better understanding of our business's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, and feed into the Group's first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report. \u00a0 * All growth variances expressed in constant currency. \u00a0 Group net fees by division, geography and sector</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"104\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a02021</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a02020</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Variance</entry><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Continuing operations (1)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Adjusted (2)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Reported    \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Adjusted (2)</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Reported    \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">Movement (3)</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">Constant    currency    movement (4)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue (\u00a3 million)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1,330.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">1,330.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,202.6</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1,202.6</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+11%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+14%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net fees (\u00a3 million)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">355.7</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">355.7</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">308.6</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">308.6</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+15%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+19%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Operating profit (\u00a3 million)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">60.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">61.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">31.3</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">31.8</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+94%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+106%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Operating profit conversion ratio %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">17.1%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">17.1%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">10.1%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">10.3%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+7% pts</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+7% pts</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Profit before tax (\u00a3 million)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">60.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">60.2</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">30.1</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">30.6</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+99%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+111%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Basic earnings per share (p)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">31.8</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">31.9</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">13.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">14.2</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+129%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+143%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Proposed final dividend per share (p)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">8.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">5.0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+60%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+60%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total dividend (interim and final) per share (p)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11.0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11.0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">5.0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">5.0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+120%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+120%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net cash (\u00a3 million) (5)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">57.5</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">57.5</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">49.9</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">49.9</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">+15%</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">+15%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 (1) Excluding discontinued operations in Australia.

As the market rebounded in 2021 following the impact of Covid-19, we saw demand for STEM skills increase across all of our key markets. Whether it is engineers building green infrastructure, developers aiding digital transformation or the scientists helping to develop the next life-changing drug, we are proud to have placed more than 22,000 skilled people and, combined with our ESG efforts, we impacted over 33,000 lives this financial year. Within our contractor markets, we see particular client demand for our employed contractor model, a market segment where we lead in many countries, and now accounts for 32% of Group net fees. I am confident and excited about the future of SThree. Momentum is strong and demand for the talent we provide is expanding, driving anticipated double-digit growth in 2022. We are well positioned, we demonstrated our ability to navigate through unforeseen challenges, such as Covid-19, and we continue to evolve our delivery model. We will further invest in our infrastructure and our people in 2022, enhancing our Group-wide platform to drive accelerated margins in future years. We remain positive about our growth prospects as we continue to position ourselves as the leading STEM talent provider in the best global STEM markets.\" \u00a0 \u00a0 Analyst conference call SThree is hosting a webinar for analysts today at 09:30 GMT.

Our Group's c.2,700 staff cover the Technology, Life Sciences, Engineering and Banking &amp; Finance sectors. SThree is part of the Industrial Services sector. We are listed on the Premium Segment of the London Stock Exchange's Main Market, trading with ticker code STEM.  \u00a0 Important notice \u00a0 Certain statements in this announcement are forward looking statements.

A key measure of our performance is how well we lived that purpose. In our 2021 financial year, we placed over 22,000 STEM specialists with companies which need their talents to build a better future. We ran skills development programmes that improved our staff's capabilities, and our environmental, social and governance ('ESG') efforts enhanced lives in the communities where we operate. In total, SThree positively impacted over 33,000 lives in the past year. Everyone at SThree is extremely proud to provide meaningful, decent work and job opportunities to tens of thousands of people around the world.  As the world changed at the outset of the pandemic, and then fuelled by recovery in 2021 and a war for talent, our clients needed STEM talent fast, often on a project basis. We were ready to serve that demand, thanks to our strategy, as set out in our Capital Markets Day presentation in late 2019. Our approach was developed in response to two long-term trends: one, the growing need for STEM skills and two, the increased demand for flexible contract work to deliver time-limited projects, alongside focusing on best-in-class operational execution. As a result, we are pleased to report excellent year-end figures with net fees up 19% in constant currency at \u00a3356 million and adjusted operating profit up 106% in constant currency from \u00a331 million in 2020 to \u00a361 million in 2021. Both net fees and operating profit were also comfortably ahead of 2019 levels, which had been a record year in SThree's history. We took share from competitors in several key markets and our performance compares well to our UK-listed peer group.  \u00a0 Progress in pursuing our strategy \u00a0 Governance One of my priorities as Chair is to move the Group towards FTSE 250 standards of governance and last year, we made good progress towards this goal with many new initiatives including the Board's focus on climate-related disclosures and governance framework to oversee a robust climate change management strategy. \u00a0 Our positioning as leaders in STEM and flexible working We honed our value proposition through the year. The value we deliver for clients is our deep understanding of the STEM skills they need and the ability to supply candidates with those skills. That same deep understanding allows us to build strong relationships with candidates so that we can find the right roles for them and help guide their careers.  In addition to being a leader in STEM, we want to be known as a leader in flexible working. While we remain a full-service business for our clients with around 25% of our net fees from the placement of permanent candidates, largely in leadership roles, the biggest part of our business is now helping our clients' teams with highly skilled, flexible contract workers. That ratio of 75:25 contract to permanent hasn't changed materially during the year but there has been a continued shift within the contract group. Our Employed Contractor Model ('ECM'), where contractors are directly employed by SThree rather than the client, is proving an increasingly compelling proposition alongside freelancing. At the beginning of the year the mix was 46% independent contractors and 30% ECM. Now it is 43% independent contractors and 32% ECM.  \u00a0 ESG and DE&amp;I are central to our business model ESG and delivering on our purpose is a core part of our business. Every economy in which we operate will need to build back better and greener by investing in infrastructure. The COP26 UN climate change conference marked a step forward in global efforts to address climate change, including a material increase in ambitions to reduce emissions across the world.  Within environment, many of our clients are either in the renewable energy sector or navigating the low carbon transition. Social policy is essential to our operation as people are at the heart of our performance. We need our culture to be diverse, equitable and inclusive in order to attract and retain capable talent for our own business but also to source the candidates our clients need. As for governance, clients need assurances we have the legal resources and governance structures to deliver employee contracts that are fully compliant.  In April 2021 we published our first Impact Report, setting out ESG progress, metrics and targets. We are an early adopter of the robust Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures ('TCFD') reporting standard, and you will find our first performance data in the Responsible business section of the Annual Report. Also in April 2021, we were delighted to be recognised as a climate leader by the Financial Times, joining the top 300 companies on their European Climate Leaders list. We were placed number 69 and are the only staffing sector company to achieve that distinction. Our DE&amp;I policies are critical to attract and retain talent and help people perform at the top of their game. In November 2021, SThree was awarded Company of the Year at the 2021 European Diversity Awards joining the ranks of best practitioners such as Lego, HSBC and Vivendi. Again, we were the only staffing sector company to be recognised.  We measured our current make-up and set challenging targets for gender, aspiring to increase gender representation at leadership levels to 50/50 by 2024. Our NED representation at the Board level is 50/50, in our Senior Leadership Team it is 40/60 and women currently occupy 31% of leadership roles more widely within the Group.\u00a0\u00a0  \u00a0 Platform and people development We took great strides this year in improving our team members' development. We launched a new learning and development platform that is accessible to all from anywhere. New leadership training programmes were also put in place which achieved 92% participation.\u00a0 We gave bias training to our recruiters so they could reduce its influence in staffing decisions. We have exceeded the target percentage of the Group adjusted operating profit spend on our people development set out in our Capital Markets Day plan, achieving 5.5% in 2021 versus the target of 5.0%. It is critical for us to be hiring the right people in the right places as we increase our headcount. We therefore reviewed our talent acquisition and succession planning processes, refining them before training our recruiters in best practice.  Having culture and values endorsed by our entire business, including every member of the senior management team, is also critically important. Extended parental leave, family leave, support for mental well-being and extended paid volunteering hours for everyone are just a few examples of this year's initiatives to develop an inclusive culture around our people.  All these investments in our culture help us better fulfil our purpose: bringing skilled people together to build a better future. \u00a0 Markets and operating where STEM demand is strongest We made a deliberate shift through the pandemic to adjust our portfolio and focus on the five core markets: US, UK, Netherlands, Germany and Japan. Together, these represent over 75% of the world STEM market and over 86% of our net fees. Our strategy is to aim for leadership in those markets by achieving scale and using that scale to add value to our offer.  \u00a0 Segment recovery in core markets The standout segmental performance during the pandemic was in life sciences in the US, where demand was particularly strong. This was not just a result of Covid-19 programmes as other areas, such as medical devices, also contributed. There was strong adoption of technology, especially amongst some of the more traditional retailers who realised that, with consumers at home, they needed to improve their online business models. Infrastructure investment in Germany was strong and engineering project growth in the Netherlands supported strong demand for technology candidates.  Technology really helped drive a renaissance in the UK business as well, with public sector investment and other industries such as education and healthcare, which had been tech laggards, now rapidly adopting technology. Companies needed new channels to engage with their customers and drive more resilience in their supply chain. They also needed artificial intelligence experts and data analytics to understand their business and customers better.  Both trends drove demand for programmers. Engineers were needed to increase automation as did the energy and other sectors to support their decarbonisation journeys. After elective surgeries and treatment were artificially depressed during lockdowns, backlogs finally began to be addressed, which required health technology and engineering experts. Although certain niche skills that were out of favour, generally the story was one of strong recovery in demand. \u00a0 Our approach to the pandemic Our own response to the pandemic was to establish a framework approach, developing tactics for the three phases of the pandemic. First, there was the 'emergency response' phase, which we referred to in last year's annual report.\u00a0 Our approach here was to revise the way we supported our clients and our candidates, whilst still maintaining capacity for when demand began to return. We shifted to having all our people working from home and provided them with the IT equipment, training and personal support they needed.  The next phase, which we are thankfully emerging from in many of our markets, is the 'ongoing management of a rolling crisis' phase. Until it is fully resolved, we won't get the cross-sector recovery required to say with confidence that we have reached the final phase, 'a new normal'. Throughout the year, we were still in the ongoing management phase and there was always going to be a level of volatility. As all the evidence suggested our strategy remained sound, the questions we focussed on throughout the year were, 'how do we operate in this period?' and, 'how do we implement the strategy given the uncertain background?'. Inevitably, some of the investment priorities we had a year ago changed. We formally changed to a global hybrid working policy for all staff that allows us to flex to uncertain times. It has been well received by our people. Remote working was putting heavier demands on our IT systems, so we further invested in our IT infrastructure. As cyber security is an ongoing issue, we invested in better-quality systems to protect our candidates' and clients' data. In the final quarter of the year, we hired Nick Folkes, a highly skilled technology and transformation leader as our Chief Technology and Information Officer. \u00a0 Management appointments In July we welcomed Andrew Beach as our new Chief Financial Officer and said goodbye to Alex Smith, who had served as CFO for 12 years. I'd like to thank Alex again for his achievements in that time. At the close of the financial year, the Board announced that Mark Dorman would be stepping down from the Board and as CEO of the Group on 31 December 2021. Timo Lehne, who was serving as the Senior Managing Director of SThree's largest and most successful region, DACH (Germany, Austria and Switzerland), was appointed Interim CEO and joined the Board as Executive Director from 1 January 2022. Mark will continue to assist the Group in facilitating a smooth handover and transition until 1 April 2022. On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Mark for his vision, drive and unique service to the Group over the past three years. \u00a0 A strong team effort I must sincerely thank all of SThree's employees for their exceptional productivity and adaptability throughout 2021, in what have been extremely difficult circumstances. My colleagues on the Board who navigated a situation that was without precedent, also deserve thanks. They provided excellent stewardship of the Company over the year. I would also like to thank our external stakeholders for their support. Candidates trusted us for advice and to guide their career development choices. Clients turned to us to meet their STEM talent requirements as they adapted to new challenges. Investors also showed confidence in us, having the full understanding of our strategy as well as our great operational and financial performance of the Group in 2021. \u00a0 Outlook Our year started with strong forward momentum. We will continue to build sustainable growth and will resume our plans for internal investment during the year, particularly in the infrastructure that will allow us to expertly harness data and efficiencies, for example in further enhanced CRM and ERP platforms. We expect to deliver double-digit growth in net fees and profits in 2022, maintaining our operating conversion ratio at similar levels to 2021 to allow for the impact from investment of between 1% and 2% of net fees to further strengthen our operational and sales platforms. We anticipate payback on the investment, delivering an acceleration of margins from 2023. I believe we have good reason to be confident: we are in the right markets, we are focused on the right sectors, and we have a team that is flexible and resilient enough to seize the opportunities ahead of us.  Group OPERATIONAL REVIEW \u00a0 Overview The Group delivered a very strong performance for the year, driven by the benefits of our business model and our strategy at the centre of two secular, long-term trends: an increasing demand for STEM skills and an accelerating trend towards flexible working.  Overall, Group net fees were up 19%* YoY, primarily attributable to our strategic focus on our Contract business, which now accounts for 75% of the Group net fees and delivered growth in net fees of 17%* YoY. Our contractor order book increased by nearly 43% YoY reflecting the high demand for skilled contractors across our markets. Permanent net fees were up 24%* YoY. Adjusted operating profit was \u00a360.8 million (2020: \u00a331.3 million), up 106%* YoY. Total Group year-end headcount was up 6% YoY with average headcount down 11% YoY. Over the next year we are focussing our strategy for talent attraction and retention where we continue to drive market share gain. We increased productivity per head 31% YoY in the year, although we do expect this to normalise to some extent going into 2022.  This has been a challenging period for our teams. The quality of our management and increasing expertise in our target markets are driving us forward on our journey to become the number one STEM talent provider in the best global STEM markets. We are committed to ensuring that SThree is well positioned over the long term and are confident we can continue to exploit the accelerating secular trends of STEM and flexible working across global markets and deliver our long-term ambitions. 2024 ambitions In 2019, looking ahead to 2024 we set ourselves several ambitions to deliver growth and value for our Company and all stakeholders: to grow Group market share by 50%;  to reach an operating profit conversion ratio in the range of 21-24%; and  to drive a free cash conversion ratio of at least 75%. \u00a0 We also committed to several targets regarding our people and society that reflect the importance we put on being a people-centric and purpose-driven business. For example, we committed to achieve 50/50 gender representation at all leadership levels by 2023, to maintain our Learning &amp; Development ('L&amp;D') spend at 5% of operating profit, to grow productivity per head over the period by 1% to 2% per annum, to reduce our absolute CO2 emissions by 20% and to double the size of our renewable energy business by 2024. We have made good progress taking market share in the USA, Germany and the Netherlands in the year. While the free cash flow conversion declined to 40% (2020: 178%) due to increased demand for contractors, our operating profit conversion ratio rapidly accelerated to 17.1% (2020: 10.1%), driven by our productivity and improved hiring conditions.  Within our People and Society goals we have slightly exceeded the target of the Group spend on people development, being 5.5% in 2021 versus the target of 5.0%, to support our people in their efforts and strategic focus in the post-pandemic times.  In 2021, we have also made a significant contribution towards climate action. We have grown our renewables business net fees by 22%* YoY, delivering nearly 46%* growth since 2019 (the baseline year). We have reduced our CO2 emissions by 44% YoY and have carried out a scenario analysis to provide our stakeholders with more transparency and better understanding of our business's exposure to climate-related risks and opportunities, and feed into the Group's first Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures Report. \u00a0 * All growth variances expressed in constant currency. \u00a0 Group net fees by division, geography and sector</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"288\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Growth year-on-year (In constant currency)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2021 mix</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Contract</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Permanent</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Total</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Contract</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Permanent</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">17%</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">19%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">75%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">25%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"552\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"32\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Breakdown of net fees</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2020</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Geographical split</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EMEA excluding DACH</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">36%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">38%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">DACH</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">36%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">34%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">USA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">25%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">25%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">APAC</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">3%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sector split</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Technology</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">47%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">45%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Life Sciences</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">23%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Engineering</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">22%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Banking &amp; Finance</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">8%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Other sectors</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 The Group is well diversified both geographically and by sector.

More detail is provided in the section that follows.  Our largest sector, Technology was up by 23%* YoY, driven by increased demand for infrastructure and software development roles across all major geographies, followed closely by the Life Sciences sector, which was up by 25%* YoY, driven by USA and Germany with increased demand for laboratory staff and quality assurance roles. Within our regions, USA and DACH are our two largest Permanent markets, and were up 53%* and 15%* YoY respectively.

A key feature of the year was the growth in ECM revenue, which now accounts for 18% of net fees, up nine percentage points versus 2019. ECM will continue to be strategically important going into 2022 due to the growth in customer demand for this solution, coupled with the higher margins it delivers. Technology, our largest sector in the region, was up 34%*, driven by demand for infrastructure and open-source software development roles, while Life Sciences was up 25%*, with demand for laboratory staff and quality assurance roles continuing to increase. Germany, our largest country in the region, delivered strong net fee growth of 23%*, with the Contract business growing 28%* and Permanent up 15%*. Switzerland and Austria also grew strongly up 28%* and 43%* YoY respectively, both driven by the Technology sector. \u00a0 Outlook The prospects for the DACH market are very encouraging. We believe that the shortage of skilled workers, especially in STEM professions, will ensure an increasing demand for the talent we provide. As one of the top three STEM providers in the region, we have an excellent platform to continue to grow, addressing market demand and delivering sustainable value for candidates and clients. Our strong investment focus on ECM will also allow us to meet increased market demand for flexible workers and strengthen our drive to be the leader in these markets.  * In constant currency \u00a0 \u00a0 EMEA excluding DACH, representing 36% of Group net fees EMEA excluding DACH is the joint largest region of the Group and comprises businesses in Belgium, Dubai.

The segment saw net fees grow by 9%* YoY, as a result of a significant recovery in trading in the second half of 2021. There has been a growing demand for STEM talent within all the geographies and markets that it serves, particularly within the Technology and Life Sciences sectors.  Strong demand for Technology skills in both the private and public sectors was mainly attributable to accelerating investments in technology transformation by our clients. Within Life Sciences demand across pharmaceuticals, as well as medical devices, provided an 18%* growth versus 2020 and 14%* growth versus 2019.  The Netherlands, our largest country in the region, finished the year strongly with net fees up 19%*, due to solid performances in Technology, up 15%*, which was driven by demand for SAP and ERP specialists, as well as cybersecurity experts. Engineering was up 28%* YoY, mainly due to demand for project management and quality assurance skills, as well as health, safety and environment roles. Net fees in the UK were up 8%* YoY reflecting strong sequential quarter-on-quarter improvement throughout the year. This was driven by Technology, up 11%*, as demand increased for skills such as business analysts, project managers and product owners. We also saw net fee growth of 12%* in Ireland, driven by Life Sciences, and 14%* in Dubai, driven by Banking &amp; Finance. \u00a0 Outlook We have set strong foundations in 2021 to continue our growth, despite the pandemic and we aim to continue our momentum into 2022. STEM talent is critical across our core sectors in the region and is in short supply. Whilst competition is fierce and STEM talent is hotly contested, we expect demand for talent to accelerate across core STEM verticals and geographies and underpins our growth prospects across the region.  * In constant currency USA, representing 25% of Group net fees The USA is the world's largest specialist STEM staffing market and our third-largest region. It remains a key area of focus for the Group, and we will continue to invest strategically in the region as we align our resources with the best long-term opportunities. \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"6\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_7\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"312\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"96\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"40\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"8\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net fees by division</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Growth year-on-year (in constant currency)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 2021 mix</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Contract</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Permanent</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Total</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Contract</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Permanent</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">16%</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">53%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">24%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">75%</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">25%</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/><entry colname=\"col5\"/><entry colname=\"col6\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 The USA delivered an excellent performance in 2021 with net fees up 24%* YoY. There was good growth in Contract of 16%* driven by Technology, and a very strong performance in Permanent, up 53%*. The ever-increasing demand for technology and for e-commerce, as well being a partner for Salesforce, drove the growth of the segment's client base within the sector, with growth of 35%*.\u00a0 2021 saw a significant increase in the demand for clinical research and quality assurance personnel, driving the 25%* growth in the Life Sciences sector. With the surge in medicines and devices that have approvals to enter the manufacturing phase, we expect this trend to continue through 2022. Engineering was up 11%*, driven by an increase in roles in renewables sectors such as wind and solar farms as well as battery storage. Power infrastructure and gas distribution saw record levels of investment in 2021 to minimise environmental impacts as well as maximise safety and efficiency. This gave us a strong pipeline of demand, which is expected to continue into 2022. \u00a0 Outlook The focus in 2022 will be to capture market share through continued growth within our target vertical markets of Technology, Engineering and Life Sciences.

The Group saw an encouraging performance in the first half, which was followed by a further strengthening in the second half across all sectors and regions. Our strong balance sheet and immediately accessible liquidity of \u00a3112.5 million positions us well for the future. \u00a0 Income statement Revenue for the year was up 14%(1) to \u00a31.3 billion (2020: \u00a31.2 billion) while net fees increased by 19% to \u00a3355.7 million (2020: \u00a3308.6 million). The weakening of our two main trading currencies, US Dollar and Euro, against Sterling during the year, reduced total net fees by \u00a311.3 million.  The Group's performance in 2020 was impacted by the Covid-19 health crisis but during the current year demand for staffing regained momentum and excellent progress was made with the Group surpassing 2019 levels. The increase was led by strong growth in net fees in our three largest countries: Germany up 23% YoY, USA up 24% and Netherlands up 19% which was driven by growth in the Technology, Life Sciences and Engineering sectors. The contractor order book was up by 43% at the end of the year, reflecting the ongoing high demand for skilled contractors across our markets and underpinning our positive outlook. Permanent net fee income was up 24% which was largely driven by DACH and USA, our two largest Permanent regions which were up 17% and 53% respectively.  At the end of the year, Contract represented 75% of the Group net fees in the year (2020: 76%). Overall, the Group Contract margin(2) increased marginally to 21.5% (2020: 20.7%).  Operating expenses saw an increase of 6% YoY on a reported basis. The increase was mainly attributable to personnel costs as a result of higher average salaries, bonuses, commissions, share-based payment charges and temporary personnel costs across the organisation. Technology costs also increased mainly to drive innovation and reduce operational risk, by moving towards improved systems in support of the SThree strategy. The Group's financial results were impacted by the following two items of other income which are unusual because of their nature and incidence: The Group took advantage of the job retention scheme launched by the national governments of France and Singapore, whereby it was reimbursed for a portion of salaries of furloughed personnel. A benefit of \u00a30.3 million (2020: \u00a31.2 million from the national governments in a number of our smaller markets) was recognised and presented as a deduction in reporting the related staff expense.  The Group also recognised a net exceptional income of \u00a30.2 million (2020: \u00a30.5 million) in relation to a legacy restructuring programme partially funded by a grant receivable from Scottish Enterprise. The Group was entitled to the grant and remained fully compliant with the terms of the grant until the end of 2021. \u00a0 The adjusted operating profit was \u00a360.8 million (2020: \u00a331.3 million), up 106% YoY in constant currency. The reported operating profit of \u00a361.0 million (2020: \u00a331.8 million) included a small exceptional income of \u00a30.2 million as described above. The Group operating profit conversion ratio increased to 17.1% (2020: 10.1%) which reflects the recovery in the Group trading activity as the impact of the pandemic eased, partially offset by higher personnel costs and technology spend. The conversion ratio was also favourably affected by elevated contractor working hours that improved productivity. The discontinued Australian operations have been excluded from the results presented above for both the current and prior year. In 2021, these discontinued operations incurred a loss of \u00a30.3 million (2020: operating loss \u00a31.8 million) mainly reflecting a true-up of exit costs/redundancy costs of gradually reduced staff following the business closure and the reclassification of accumulated foreign exchange differences from the Group currency reserve to the Group income statement. \u00a0 Net finance costs Net finance costs, which predominantly related to lease interest, decreased to \u00a30.8 million (2020: \u00a31.2 million). The higher cost in the previous year was a result of the drawdown of the RCF in the course of 2020 to ensure strong liquidity in the face of the global health crisis. The RCF was subsequently repaid and remains available for future drawdowns. Foreign exchange exposure In 2021, the net currency movements versus Sterling provided a significant net headwind to the reported performance of the Group, reducing net fees by \u00a311.3 million and operating profit by \u00a33.6 million. This was mainly attributable to Sterling strengthening against the Euro and the US Dollar, the two main trading currencies of the Group. Fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates remain a material sensitivity to the Group's reported results. By way of illustration, each 1% movement in annual exchange rates of the Euro and US Dollar against Sterling impacts the Group's net fees by \u00a32.1 million and \u00a30.9 million respectively per annum, and operating profit by \u00a30.7 million and \u00a30.3 million respectively per annum. Our foreign exchange risk management strategy involves using certain derivative financial instruments to minimise the transactional exposure arising from currency fluctuations. \u00a0 Income tax The tax charge for the year on the Group's profit before tax was \u00a317.9 million (2020: \u00a311.7 million), representing a full year effective tax rate ('ETR') on continuing operations of 30%. In the prior year, the reported ETR on continuing operations was 39%, significantly above the current year due to higher losses in certain jurisdictions not recognised for deferred tax purposes. The Group's ETR primarily varies depending on the mix of taxable profits by territory, non-deductibility of the accounting charge for LTIPs and other one-off tax items. \u00a0 Overall, the reported profit before tax from continuing operations was \u00a360.2 million (2020: \u00a330.6 million), up 109% YoY in constant currency and up 97% on a reported basis. The reported profit after tax from continuing operations was \u00a342.3 million (2020: \u00a318.8 million), up 139% YoY in constant currency and up 125% on a reported basis. \u00a0 Earnings per share ('EPS') The reported EPS was 31.9 pence (2020: 14.2 pence) on continuing operations, up 138% YoY in constant currency and up 125% YoY in reported currency. The YoY growth reflects higher operating profit given the significant improvement in trading performance post the pandemic, and a decrease in the Group's ETR. This was partially offset by an increase of 0.2 million in the weighted average number of shares. Exceptional items had an immaterial impact on the reported EPS (further information is provided in note 6 to the Group Consolidated Financial Statements). The reported diluted EPS was 30.9 pence (2020: 13.8 pence) on continuing operations. Share dilution mainly results from various share options in place and expected future settlement of certain tracker shares. The dilutive effect on EPS from tracker shares will vary in future periods depending on the profitability of the underlying tracker businesses and the settlement of vested arrangements. \u00a0 Dividends The Board aims to maintain a sustainable dividend, within the range of 2.5x and 3.0x earnings cover(2). The Board has proposed to pay a final dividend at 8.0 pence (2020: 5.0 pence) per share. Taken together with the interim dividend of 3.0 pence (2020: nil pence) per share, this gives a total dividend for the year of 11.0 pence (2020: 5.0 pence) per share. The final dividend, which amounts to approximately \u00a310.7 million, will be subject to shareholder approval at the 2022 Annual General Meeting. It will be paid on 10 June 2022 to shareholders on the register on 6 May 2022. \u00a0 Balance sheet Total Group net assets increased to \u00a3158.2 million (2020: \u00a3128.5 million), driven by the excess of net profit over the dividend payments, partially offset by unfavourable foreign currency movements and share buy-backs. Net working capital, including contract assets, increased by \u00a322.4 million on the prior year, driven mainly by the accelerated growth in revenue, due to continued growth of the contractor order book increasing our working capital, partially offset by our continued focus on credit risk management and normalisation in client payment times post the pandemic. Our days sales outstanding remained stable YoY at 44 days (2020: 44 days), following significant improvement last year. Our business model remains highly cash generative, and we have no undue concentration of repayment obligations in respect of trade payables or borrowings. Investment in subsidiaries During the year, the Group's businesses delivered a very strong financial performance, ahead of market and management's expectations. With candidate and client confidence improving across most of our global footprint, significant growth rates were reported in contractor order books among most of the Group's businesses to levels not seen since the peak of 2019. Accordingly, no significant indicators of impairment were identified when reviewing recoverable amounts of the Company's investment portfolio. For comparison, in the prior year the Company recognised an impairment loss of \u00a312.9 million mainly in respect of the UK operations which were affected by heightened uncertainty and reduced economic activity caused by the pandemic. Tracker shares The Group settled certain vested tracker shares during the year for a total consideration of \u00a34.6 million which was determined using a formula set out in the Articles of Association underpinning the tracker share businesses. The consideration was settled in SThree plc shares; 200,372 new shares were issued and 672,157 of shares held by the EBT were utilised. The arrangement is deemed to be an equity-settled share-based payment arrangement under IFRS 2 Share-based payments. There was no charge to the income statement as initially the tracker shareholders subscribed to the tracker shares at their fair value.  In 2021 the Directors decided to close the tracker share scheme for any new entrants/investments. All current tracker share businesses remaining in existence will continue to be reviewed for settlement based on the pre-agreed criteria each year, until the full closure of the scheme in the next few years. We expect all future tracker share settlements to be between \u00a32.0 million to \u00a310.0 million per annum. These settlements may either dilute the earnings of SThree plc's existing ordinary shareholders if funded by a new issue of shares or result in a cash outflow if funded via treasury shares or shares held in the EBT. \u00a0 Liquidity management In 2021, cash generated from operations was \u00a354.5 million (2020: \u00a376.9 million). It represented the improved adjusted EBITDA (2) offset by the continued growth of the contractor order book increasing our working capital and having fully repaid \u00a32.3 million in VAT deferrals from the prior year. Income tax paid increased to \u00a316.7 million (2020: \u00a310.5 million) reflecting the improved underlying trading performance across our markets and sectors. Capital expenditure decreased to \u00a32.6 million (2020: \u00a35.3 million), the majority of which related to IT equipment and digitisation of our internal processes, with emphasis on greater automation and tools to improve efficiency, speed and effectiveness. The Group paid \u00a313.1 million in rent (principal and interest portion) (2020: \u00a313.6 million). Net interest cost (excluding interest on lease payments) was \u00a30.2 million (2020: \u00a30.4 million) in the year. The Group spent \u00a35.2 million (2020: \u00a32.0 million) for the purchase of its own shares to satisfy vesting employee share incentive schemes. Cash inflows of \u00a30.2 million (2020: \u00a30.9 million) were generated from the Save As You Earn employee scheme.  Dividend payments were \u00a36.6 million (2020: \u00a36.7 million, being the interim dividend paid in December 2019) and there was a small cash outflow of \u00a30.1 million (2020: \u00a3nil) representing distributions to tracker shareholders. Foreign exchange had a significant negative impact of \u00a32.6 million (2020: \u00a30.3 million). Overall, the underlying cash performance in 2021 was solid with 40% conversion of operating profit into operating cash flow (2) (2020: 175%), primarily reflecting very strong trading performance across the Group offset by increased working capital. We started the year with net cash of \u00a349.9 million and closed the year with net cash of \u00a357.5 million. \u00a0 Capital allocation and accessible funding SThree remains disciplined in its approach to allocating capital, with the core objective at all times being to maximise shareholder value: Balance sheet - our intention is to maintain a strong balance sheet at all times.  Organic growth - our top priority is to invest in the organic growth of the business. We will actively invest in delivering scalable growth in net fees and margins - focusing on our people, systems and processes to improve operational efficiencies as well as developing new business opportunities.  Acquisitions - we will seek to accelerate our growth by acquiring businesses that complement our strategy as well as offer value-enhancing financial profiles.  Dividends - we aim to pay a dividend which is sustainable through the cycle, and which will be driven by long-term earnings growth.  Surplus cash - whilst unlikely in the foreseeable future, we will consider returning excess capital to shareholders by way of special dividends and/or share repurchases in the event of there not being suitable organic or inorganic opportunities. The Group's capital allocation priorities are financed mainly by retained earnings, cash generated from operations, a \u00a350.0 million Revolving Credit Facility ('RCF') which is committed to 2023, and a \u00a35.0 million overdraft. The Group also maintains a \u00a320.0 million accordion facility as well as a substantial working capital position reflecting net cash due to SThree for placements already undertaken. On 30 November 2021, the Group had total accessible liquidity of \u00a3112.5 million. This was made up of \u00a357.5 million net cash, \u00a350.0 million in RCF and \u00a35.0 million overdraft (both undrawn at the year-end). The increased net cash balance, achieved despite the growth in Contract placements made, reflects the Group's strong focus on cash management. Any funds borrowed under the RCF bear a minimum annual interest rate of 1.3% above three-month Sterling LIBOR. During the year, the Group did not draw down any of these facilities. In the prior year, the average interest rate paid on drawdown was 1.3%. The Group remains in a strong financial position and has sufficient cash reserves to meet its obligations as they fall due for a period of at least 12 months from the date of signing of these financial statements. \u00a0 [1] Unless specifically stated, all growth rates in revenue and net fees are expressed in constant currency and exclude Australia, which the Group exited in Q4 2020. [2] The Group has identified and defined certain alternative performance measures ('APM'). These are the key measures the Directors use to assess the SThree's underlying operational and financial performance. The APMs are fully explained and reconciled to IFRS line items in note 15. \u00a0 \u00a0 PRINCIPAL AND EMERGING RISKS Principal risks and uncertainties affecting the business activities of the Group are detailed within the Strategic Report section of the Group's 2021 Annual Report, a copy of which will be available on the Group's website . Delivering on our strategy requires all parts of our business to work together. In isolation risk mitigation helps SThree manage specific subjects and areas of the business. However, when brought into our day-to-day activities successful risk management has helped us to maximise our competitive advantage and deliver on our strategic pillars in 2021. While the ultimate responsibility for risk management rests with the Board, the effective day-to-day management of risk is in the way we do business and our culture. Aligning risks and strategy by using risk to help make the right strategic decisions - in order to deliver our strategy and competitive advantage throughout the business we must ensure that we maintain a balance between safeguarding against potential risks and taking advantage of all potential opportunities. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 consolidated income statement for the year ended 30

notes form an integral part of these Consolidated Financial Statements. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0 Notes to the Financial information for the year ended 30 November 2021 \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Basis of preparation\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 The financial information in this preliminary announcement has been extracted from the Group audited financial statements for the year ended 30 November 2021 and does not constitute statutory accounts within the meaning of section 434 of the Companies Act 2006. The Group financial statements and this preliminary announcement were approved by the Board of Directors on 28 January 2022. The auditors have reported on the Group's financial statements for the years ended 30 November 2021 and 30 November 2020 under s495 of the Companies Act 2006. The auditors' reports are unqualified and do not contain a statement under section 498(2) or (3) of the Companies Act 2006. The Group's statutory financial statements for the year ended 30 November 2020 were filed with the Registrar of Companies and those for the year ended 30 November 2021 will be filed following the Company's Annual General Meeting. In 2021, selected UK subsidiaries were exempt from the requirements of the UK Companies Act 2006 ('the Act') relating to the audit of individual accounts by virtue of s479A of the Act. The Company provides a guarantee concerning the outstanding liabilities of these subsidiaries under section 479C of the Act.\u00a0  The Group's financial statements have been prepared in accordance with international accounting standards in conformity with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and the international financial reporting standards adopted pursuant to Regulation (EC) No 1606/2002 as it applies in the European Union.  Going concern In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of this year's financial statements, the Directors are required to assess whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors have undertaken a review of the Group's forecasts and associated risks and sensitivities for at least 12 months from the date of approval of this year's financial statements. Although the global pandemic and its aftermath continue to create a moderate degree of uncertainty to economic conditions across all of our markets, the Group's business model has proven to be effective and resilient. In 2021 the Group delivered a very strong performance across key markets and sectors, with profit before tax surpassing the pre-pandemic levels of 2019, reflecting the continued strength of demand for the exceptional candidates we work with, their STEM skills and the growth trajectory of our business.  In the assessment of the going concern basis of preparation, the Directors considered the future financial performance based on current trading and its growth trajectory, expected operating cash flows, as well as people and capital resources required to implement strategic initiatives in response to identified market opportunities and emerging risks. The Directors also assessed the Group's financial position, including accessible liquidity with committed borrowing facilities.  At 30 November 2021, the Group had \u00a357.5 million of cash, with no debt except for IFRS 16 lease liabilities of \u00a335.1 million. As set out in note 10 to the financial statements, debt facilities relevant to the review period comprise a committed \u00a350.0 million RCF (facility expiring in May 2023 with all covenants met) and an uncommitted \u00a320.0 million accordion facility, both jointly provided by HSBC and Citibank. A further uncommitted \u00a35.0 million bank overdraft facility is also held with HSBC. The RCF is subject to covenants that are measured biannually in May and November, on a trailing 12-month basis, being (i) net debt to EBITDA of a maximum of 3.0x and (ii) interest cover of a minimum of 4.0x, based on measures as defined in the facilities agreements which are adjusted from the equivalent IFRS amounts. The ratio of net debt to EBITDA at 30 November 2021 was nil, as no debt was drawn at the year end, and interest cover was 92.4 times. The Group developed a base case that demonstrates the Board's best estimate for the review period (to the end of Q1 2023), as well as a range of downside scenarios which may occur, either through further Covid-19 related impacts, general economic uncertainty or any of the Group's principal risks. This assessment considered the Group's potential responses to changing market conditions and business risks, resilience of its business model and overall level of Group funding and covenant requirements. The key assumptions of the downside scenarios linked to certain principal risks are shown below. \u00a0 Scenario 1 Downside scenario - economic downturn The first scenario considers the downside impact of economic uncertainty triggered by the new Covid-19 variants over the review period, reflected in reduced sales activity for the remainder of 2022 and into Q1 2023. Under this plausible scenario, productivity is forecast to decline between 14% and 18% against the base case over 2022.\u00a0 While variable costs are forecast to reduce in line with net fees, all other costs are assumed to remain in line with the base case. Link to risk:  Risk 1: Macro-economic environment/cyclicality risk Risk 3: Commercial relationship/client risk \u00a0 Scenario 2 Severe but plausible scenario - demand/operational shock The second scenario, considered severe but plausible, includes further potential Covid-19 outbreaks and restrictions in all key markets throughout 2022 and into 2023, leading to demand at similar levels to that experienced in 2020 over that period.  Under this severe but plausible scenario, the productivity is forecast to decline between 21% and 24% against the base case over 2022 and in Q1 2023. The impact of this severe but plausible downside is mitigated by the reduction in variable costs in line with net fees, together with further reductions in overheads resulting from the postponement of investment in additional headcount. Link to risk:  Risk 1: Macro-economic environment/cyclicality risk Risk 3: Commercial relationship/client risk \u00a0 Under both scenarios, the Group's day-to-day working capital requirements are expected to be met through existing cash resources and cash equivalents and receipts from its continuing business activities, with sufficient cash headroom for the Group to continue trading throughout 2022 and into 2023. In each of these scenarios the Group is also forecast to be compliant with all covenants throughout the review period, with no requirement to utilise the existing credit facilities. \u00a0 Through this process, together with their knowledge and experience of the recruitment services industry, STEM markets and the principal risks, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months, and therefore the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements for the year ended 30 November 2021. \u00a0 Climate change consideration Climate change is a significant issue for the world and the transition to a low-carbon economy will create both risks and opportunities for the Group. The climate change scenario analyses conducted in line with TCFD recommendations undertaken this year did not identify any material financial impact. The Group also constantly monitors the latest government legislation in relation to climate-related matters.  The following considerations were also made in respect of the financial statements: - The impact of climate-related risks as well as opportunities on the long-term viability of the Group. In line with the Group long-term commitment to the environment and society the Directors refreshed the ESG strategy. The Directors carried out a detailed assessment of how climate change may emerge across SThree's operations and impact its business model. Having identified risks and opportunities relating to the transitional impact of climate change and using three scenarios of global energy pathways for 2021-2040, SThree's strategic resilience was tested as well as its flexibility to adapt operations and drive continued growth.  - The impact of the potential introduction of emission-reduction legislation in different jurisdictions may increase manufacturing costs among the Group's clients, which in turn could negatively affect their ability to pay debts, resulting in higher expected credit losses for trade and other receivables recognised by the Group. Management identified the need to enhance the Group's existing tools and techniques to monitor and mitigate any potential deterioration in clients' credit risk, in particular for a small proportion of the Group's clients within the Oil &amp; Gas sector (circa 6% of Group net fees) whose operations are heavily exposed to climate-related risks. At present management continue to monitor this sector and provide guidelines to sales teams in line with climate change strategy. At present, the impact of climate-related matters is not material to the Group's financial statements. Accounting policies \u00a0 The accounting policies used in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial Statements are consistent with those applied in the previous financial year, except for the adoption of new and amended standards effective as of 1 December 2020 as set out below. New and amended standards effective in 2021 and adopted by the Group A number of amended standards became applicable as of 1 December 2020 and were adopted by the Group. The Group did not have to change its accounting policies or make retrospective adjustments as a result of adopting these amended standards. -\u00a0 Amendments to references to conceptual framework in IFRS standards; -\u00a0 Amendments to IFRS 3, Definition of a business; -\u00a0 Amendments to IAS 1 and IAS 8, definition of material; -\u00a0 Extension of the temporary exemption from applying IFRS 9 (amendments to IFRS 4); and -\u00a0 Amendments to IFRS 16, Covid-19 rent related concessions. New and amended standards that are applicable to the Group but not yet effective The following other amendments and interpretations were issued by the IASB but are effective from 1 January 2022. These amendments are not expected to have a material impact on the Group in the current or future periods. -\u00a0 Amendments to IFRS 7, IFRS 9, IFRS 16 and IAS 39, Interest Rate Benchmark Reform - phase 2. The replacement of Interbank Offered Rates ('IBORs') with Alternative Reference Rates ('ARRs') will begin from December 2021. Where floating interest-bearing receivables and payables exist (currently based on IBORs) the Group will apply suitable replacement benchmark rates and account for the instruments in accordance with the amendments to IFRS 9 Financial Instruments published in 2019 (Phase 1) and 2020 (Phase 2). The adoption of these amendments and the transition to ARRs are expected to have an immaterial financial impact. The implications on the trading results of our segments of IBOR reform have also been assessed and the expected impact is immaterial. The Group is preparing to move to the new benchmark rates in accordance with timelines as per regulatory guidelines. The Group has not early adopted any standard, interpretation or amendment that has been issued but is not yet effective. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Segmental analysis\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 The Group's operating segments are established on the basis of those components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the Group's chief operating decision maker, in deciding how to allocate resources and in assessing performance. The Group's business is considered primarily from a geographical perspective. The Directors have determined the chief operating decision maker to be the Executive Committee made up of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Operating Officer and the Chief People Officer, with other senior management attending via invitation.  The Group segments the business into the following reportable regions: DACH, EMEA excluding DACH, USA and APAC, as well as presents an analysis of net fees by its five key markets: Germany, the Netherlands, USA, the UK and Japan. DACH region comprises Germany, Switzerland and Austria. 'EMEA excluding DACH' region comprises primarily Belgium, France, the Netherlands, Spain, the UK, Ireland, and Dubai. All these sub-regions were aggregated into two separate reportable segments based on the possession of similar economic characteristics.  Countries aggregated into DACH and separately into 'EMEA excluding DACH' generate a similar average net fee margin together with long-term growth rates, and are similar in each of the following areas: -\u00a0 the nature of the services (recruitment/candidate placement); - the methods used in which they provide services to clients (independent contractors, employed contractors, and permanent candidates); -\u00a0 the class of candidates (candidates, who we place with our clients, represent skillsets in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics disciplines). The Group's management reporting and controlling systems use accounting policies that are the same as those described in these financial statements and the accompanying notes. Revenue and net fees by reportable segment\u00a0 The Group measures the performance of its operating segments through a measure of segment profit or loss which is referred to as 'net fees' in the management reporting and controlling systems. Net fees is the measure of segment profit comprising revenue less cost of sales.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  Intersegment revenue is recorded at values which approximate third party selling prices and is not significant. \u00a0 \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/><entry colname=\"col4\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"7\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_14\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"152\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col6\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col7\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Net fees</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">2020</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">2020</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a3'000</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a3'000</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a3'000</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a3'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">EMEA excluding DACH</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">606,248</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">588,787</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">127,197</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">117,629</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">DACH</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">452,456</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 371,915</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">129,420</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">105,764</entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">USA</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">254,338</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">227,523</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">89,260</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">77,243</entry><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">APAC</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">17,684</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">14,397</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">9,836</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">7,939</entry><entry colname=\"col6\"/><entry colname=\"col7\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">1,330,726</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1,202,622</entry><entry colname=\"col6\">355,713</entry><entry colname=\"col7\">308,575</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 EMEA excluding DACH includes Belgium, Dubai, France, Ireland, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Spain and the UK.

recognised a net exceptional income of \u00a30.2 million (2020: \u00a30.5 million) in relation to a legacy restructuring programme partially funded by a grant receivable from Scottish Enterprise. The Group was entitled to the grant until the end of 2021 and complied with all terms of the grant. The grant has now been fully utilised and no further income is due. Impact of Covid-19 The Covid-19 health crisis had implications on certain items of income in the Group Consolidated Financial Statements, affecting the profit before tax for the current and prior year. These items were not treated as exceptional. Government assistance income The Group took advantage of job retention schemes launched by the national governments of France and Singapore, whereby it was reimbursed for a portion of salaries of furloughed personnel. A benefit of \u00a30.3 million (2020: \u00a31.2 million from local national governments of Belgium, France, Hong Kong, Japan, Luxembourg, Singapore and Spain) was recognised and presented as a deduction in reporting the related staff expense. Business optimisation expense In the prior year, in response to the significantly changed economic environment and increased risk and uncertainty caused by Covid-19, the Directors took relevant steps to right-size the structure and strategy of certain local businesses.

Under IFRS, the Group is required to provide for deferred tax on all unexercised share options. Where the amount of the tax deduction (or estimated future tax deduction) exceeds the amount of the related cumulative remuneration expense, this indicates that the tax deduction relates not only to remuneration expense but also to an equity item. In this situation, the excess of the current or deferred tax should be recognised in equity. At 30 November 2021, a deferred tax asset of \u00a31.5 million (2020: \u00a30.7 million) was recognised in respect of these options. On transition to IFRS 16 an adjustment to retained earnings was made at 1 December 2019, and a corresponding tax credit was booked to equity of \u00a30.3 million. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 Discontinued operations \u00a0 On 1 September 2020, the Group announced its intention to liquidate the Australian subsidiary ('SThree Australia'), the operations of which represented a separate major line of business for SThree. As a result, SThree Australia was treated as discontinued operations for the year ended 30 November 2021 and 30 November 2020. A single amount was shown on the face of the Consolidated Income Statement comprising the post-tax result of discontinued operations. That is, the income and expenses of SThree Australia were reported separately from the continuing operations of the Group. With SThree Australia being classified as discontinued operations, the APAC segment no longer includes its results in the segmental note. Financial information for SThree Australia operations after intra-group eliminations is presented below. \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_25\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"456\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2021</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2020</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a3'000</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a3'000</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">11,538</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cost of sales</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(20)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(9,361)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Administrative expenses</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(13)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(3,972)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Operating loss</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(33)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(1,795)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net finance cost</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(14)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss before and after income tax from discontinued operations</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(33)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(1,809)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Reclassification of foreign currency translation reserve</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(236)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss on liquidation of the subsidiary before and after income tax</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(236)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss from discontinued operations</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(269)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(1,809)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Exchange differences on translation of discontinued operations</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(228)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Total comprehensive loss from discontinued operations</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(269)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(2,037)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">\u00a0</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net cash flows (used)/generated by discontinued operations are as follows:</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">\u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Operating activities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(848)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">291</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Investing activities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(16)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Financing activities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(343)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net cash outflow</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(848)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(68)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">\u00a0 Closure-related costs In the current year, the discontinued operations incurred a total comprehensive loss of \u00a30.3 million (2020: total comprehensive loss of \u00a32.0 million) primarily reflecting a true-up of exit costs/redundancy costs of rolling off staff following the business closure and the reclassification of accumulated foreign exchange differences from the Group currency reserve to the Group Consolidated Income Statement.

For diluted EPS, the weighted average number of shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of dilutive potential shares. Potential dilution resulting from tracker shares takes into account profitability of the underlying tracker businesses and SThree plc's earnings. Therefore, the dilutive effect on EPS will vary in future periods depending on any changes in these factors. The following table reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted EPS calculations. \u00a0</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry

The Group has an uncommitted \u00a35.0 million overdraft facility with HSBC. The Group also had access to the Bank of England's Covid-19 Corporate Financing Facility, a \u00a350.0 million committed Commercial Paper facility. While this provided the Group with access to an additional short-term form of financing up to March 2021, it was never utilised.  Any funds borrowed under the RCF bear a minimum annual interest rate of 1.3% above the three-month Sterling LIBOR. At the year end, the Group and the Company did not draw down under these facilities (2020: \u00a3nil). Accordingly, the net finance costs decreased to \u00a30.8 million (2020: \u00a31.2 million) and were mainly related to lease interest. In the prior year, the average interest rate paid on drawdown was 1.3%.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0  The RCF is subject to certain covenants requiring the Group to maintain financial ratios over interest cover, leverage and guarantor cover. The Group has complied with these covenants throughout the year. The RCF facility is available under these terms and conditions until May 2023.

The EBT is funded entirely by the Company and acquires shares in SThree plc to satisfy future requirements of the employee share-based payment schemes. For accounting purposes, shares held in the EBT are treated in the same manner as shares held in the treasury reserve by the Company and are, therefore, included in the financial statements as part of the treasury reserve for the Group  During the year, the EBT purchased 1,220,854 (2020: 645,122) of SThree plc shares. The average price paid per share was 422 pence (2020: 315 pence). In addition, SThree plc gifted 54,054 shares to the EBT. The total acquisition cost of the purchased and gifted shares was \u00a35.3 million (2020: \u00a32.0 million), for which the treasury reserve was reduced. During the year, the EBT utilised 985,932 (2020: 1,723,288) shares on settlement of vested tracker shares and LTIP awards. At the year end, the EBT held 923,362 (2020: 634,386) shares. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 CONTINGENT LIABILITIES \u00a0 Legal The Group is involved in various disputes and claims which arise from time to time in the course of its business. These are reviewed on a regular basis and, where possible, an estimate is made of the potential financial impact on the Group. The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of these claims. In appropriate cases a provision is recognised based on advice, best estimates and management judgement.  The Directors currently believe the likelihood of any material liabilities to be low, and that such liabilities, if any, will not have a material adverse effect on its financial position. \u00a0 \u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES \u00a0 The Group's significant related parties are as disclosed in the Group's 2021 annual financial statements.

Restructuring income Support function relocation This category comprised government grant income arising from a strategic relocation of SThree's central support functions away from the London headquarters to the Centre of Excellence located in Glasgow in 2018, further explained in note 3. The Group discloses comparable performance measures to enable users to focus on the underlying performance of the business on a basis which is common to both periods for which these measures are presented. The reconciliation of comparable measures to the directly related measures calculated in accordance with IFRS is as follows.

we are operating in 14 countries and with many different currencies, we are affected by foreign exchange movements, and we report our financial results to reflect this. However, we manage the business against targets which are set to be comparable between years and within them, for otherwise foreign currency movements would undermine our ability to drive the business forward and control it. Within this announcement, we highlighted comparable results on a constant currency basis as well as the audited results ('on a reported basis') which reflect the actual foreign currency effects experienced.  The Group evaluates its operating and financial performance on a constant currency basis (i.e. without giving effect to the impact of variation of foreign currency exchange rates from year to year). Constant currency APMs are calculated by applying the prior year foreign exchange rates to the current and prior financial year results to remove the impact of exchange rate. Measures on a constant currency basis enable users to focus on the performance of the business on a basis which is not affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates applicable to the Group's operating activities from period to period.  The calculations of the APMs on a constant currency basis and the reconciliation to the most directly related measures calculated in accordance with IFRS are as follows. \u00a0 \u00a0

It is calculated by adding back to the reported operating profit for the Group operating non-cash items such as the depreciation and impairment of property, plant and equipment ('PPE'), the amortisation and impairment of intangible assets, and the employee share options. The Group also discloses adjusted EBITDA which is intended to provide useful information to analyse the Group's operating performance excluding the impact of operating non?cash items as defined above and net exceptional items. Where relevant, the Group also uses adjusted EBITDA to measure the level of financial leverage of the Group by comparing adjusted EBITDA to net debt. A reconciliation of reported operating profit for the year, the most directly comparable IFRS measure, to EBITDA and adjusted EBITDA is set out below.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry
