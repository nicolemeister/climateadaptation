PepsiCo is updating its packaging goals to focus on key markets where it believes its efforts can make the most positive impact. By prioritizing efforts in key packaging markets, continuing work to reduce its use of virgin plastic and improve the design of its packaging, PepsiCo plans to focus on investments that aim to improve the packaging lifecycle. The company is also sunsetting its reuse target.  PepsiCo has refreshed its water goals. The company is refining its focus on high-risk areas and maintaining its goal to become net water positive by 2030.  The company has updated its Scope 1, 2, and 3 targets and fully aligned them to a 1.5\\xB0C trajectory by 2050, reflecting SBTi sectoral guidance on Forests, Land, and Agriculture and Energy and Industry emissions, and now aims to achieve net zero emissions by 2050.   PepsiCo has now increased its regenerative agriculture goal, aiming to drive the adoption of regenerative, restorative, or protective practices across 10 million acres by 2030. This is an expansion of the original 7-million-acre regenerative agriculture goal. As of 2024, against the newly released goal, PepsiCo has already delivered approximately 3.5 million acres.

This transformative project marks a new chapter in sustainable development and climate resilience for both the Kurdistan region and Iraq as a whole.</p><p>The village, being inaugurated today, Tuesday, May 20, stands as a model of innovation-integrating renewable energy systems, sustainable agriculture, and climate adaptation practices. The initiative arrives at a critical time, as the region is facing escalating environmental challenges, including extreme heatwaves, water scarcity, and rapid desertification.</p><p>\"This project proves that we can protect our environment, empower our people, and build a future rooted in resilience, dignity, and hope. Our vision is to see this model grow across Iraq-one village at a time-until sustainability becomes the standard, not the exception.\"-Idris Nechirvan Barzani, founder and president of the Rwanga Foundation</p><p>The Kulak Solar Village is powered entirely by solar energy, which provides round-the-clock electricity. Solar-driven irrigation might also be possible, and there are plans to provide hands-on training programs in regenerative agriculture. The project serves as a replicable model designed to empower communities facing the harsh realities of climate change with the tools needed for energy independence, food security, and ecological restoration.</p><p>With Iraq recently ranked by the United Nations as the country that is fifth most vulnerable to climate change, this project represents a scalable solution to the urgent environmental and humanitarian crises facing the region.</p><p>The Kulak Solar Village is now fully operational, with plans underway to expand the model across Kurdistan and central Iraq by 2030. This effort will be implemented in partnership with regional authorities and international organizations, forming the cornerstone of Rwanga's broader Green Kurdistan campaign.</p><p>This milestone builds on Rwanga's long-standing environmental work, which includes the planting of over 200,000 trees across the region in the past five years, alongside ongoing investments in education, youth empowerment, and climate resilience.</p><p>Pressekontakt:</p><p>Rwanga Foundation 00447527444447 <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:ruwayda.mail@gmail.com\">ruwayda.mail@gmail.com</email><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.rwanga.org\">https://www.rwanga.org</url></p><p><pre xml:space=\"preserve\">Additional content: <url normalizedValue=\"http://presseportal.de/pm/179844/6038361\">http://presseportal.de/pm/179844/6038361</url><br/> OTS:                Rwanga Foundation<br/></pre></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">NAEN-ZW2PWP5</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">NAEN2025</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6FVH-PH93-RT54-K564-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">222519</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2025-05-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"411\"/><timeReceived>1:27 PM CET</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright  2025 <br/><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"41326\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo>News aktuell GmbH - Ein Unternehmen der dpa-Gruppe All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>OTS Deutschland (Englisch)</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"41325\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"20\" month=\"05\" year=\"2025\"><dateText>May 20, 2025 Tuesday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"95\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000A7IS</classCode><className>ASSOCIATIONS &amp;

LONDON, April 04, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Mars Incorporated, a global leader in pet care products and services, released new research through its James Wellbeloved brand which uncovers that UK dog owners care deeply about their pets' nutrition, but many don't realise that the journey of their dog's food begins long before it reaches their bowl.(2) 8 in 10 UK dog owners (79%) say they put as much thought into their pet's diet as their own, yet only a quarter (26%) say they have a high level of understanding as to where their dog's food comes from. The new research, surveying UK dog owners, revealed:   * Half (51%) say their pets love playing in soil, yet the same number (49%)     don't realise that     \"healthy soil is critical for growing high-quality ingredients(3) \"   * Over half (51%) say they have limited or no understanding of the connection     between farming practices and the food their dog eats   * Over a quarter (26%) don't view soil as important to the quality of their     pet's food   * 7 in 10 (72%) want to better understand where their dog's food comes from Despite this, almost all UK dog owners (91%) say the ingredients are an important factor in influencing them to purchase food for their pet, and 8 in 10 are more likely to buy food if they know it contains natural ingredients - 52% even research ingredients before purchasing. Nutritional value is another top priority for 39% of dog owners when shopping for pet food, followed by a trusted brand (25%). With experts estimating that 90% of soil could be degraded globally by 2050(4), meaning a deterioration in the soil's quality and diminished capacity to support life such as plants. This deep interest from dog owners in their pet's nutrition can play a key role in raising awareness around soil health. ________________________ To highlight the critical role of soil, James Wellbeloved unveiled a 15-foot giant mucky pup sculpture named Ellie in central London - with Ellie's playful stance reflecting how soil makes dogs happy on the outside while also representing the four football fields of healthy soil degraded every second globally\\xB3. The sculpture follows the launch of James Wellbeloved's Beloved Soil Initiative earlier this year, a regenerative agriculture pilot developed in collaboration with experts, Agrii and Soil Association Exchange, which in its first year will partner with three farmers forming part of our supply chain producing oats and barley. Through financial incentives, education programmes and tailored training the pilot aims to help the farmers to adopt regenerative farming practices, such as crop diversification and restoring hedgerows which can contribute to improved soil health and provide shelter for wildlife. Melodie Nye, Chief Growth Officer, Mars Pet Nutrition Europe commented: \"We're proud to be building on the launch of our Beloved Soil Initiative -we know pet parents care deeply about their pets' well-being, and we want to use this passion to help inspire more awareness and consideration for the essential role of soil. By embarking on our regenerative agriculture pilot, we are beginning to help support farmers to restore and protect soil and highlighting this initiative is an important part of our journey.\" Joseph Gridley, Chief Executive Officer, Soil Association Exchange, added: \"At Soil Association Exchange, we know that the health of our soil underpins the quality of our food - whether it's feeding people or our pets. Through the Beloved Soil Initiative, we're proud to support farmers in adopting regenerative practices and verifying the impact of these changes on soil health, biodiversity, and resilience. It's great to see James Wellbeloved using its platform to raise awareness of soil's vital role, and we're excited to collaborate on this journey towards a healthier future for our soils and our food systems.\" For more information on the mucky pup sculpture and James Wellbeloved's Beloved Soil Initiative and regenerative agriculture journey, please visit here.

LONDON, April 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Today, Mars, Incorporated a global leader in pet care products and services, releases new research through its James Wellbeloved brand which uncovers that UK dog owners care deeply about their pets' nutrition, but many don't realise that the journey of their dog's food begins long before it reaches their bowl.(2) 8 in 10 UK dog owners (79%) say they put as much thought into their pet's diet as their own, yet only a quarter (26%) say they have a high level of understanding as to where their dog's food comes from. The new research, surveying UK dog owners, revealed:   * Half (51%) say their pets love playing in soil, yet the same number (49%)     don't realise that \"healthy soil is critical for growing high-quality     ingredients(3)\"   * Over half (51%) say they have limited or no understanding of the connection     between farming practices and the food their dog eats   * Over a quarter (26%) don't view soil as important to the quality of their     pet's food   * 7 in 10 (72%) want to better understand where their dog's food comes from Despite this, almost all UK dog owners (91%) say the ingredients are an important factor in influencing them to purchase food for their pet, and 8 in 10 are more likely to buy food if they know it contains natural ingredients - 52% even research ingredients before purchasing. Nutritional value is another top priority for 39% of dog owners when shopping for pet food, followed by a trusted brand (25%). With experts estimating that 90% of soil could be degraded globally by 2050(4), meaning a deterioration in the soil's quality and diminished capacity to support life such as plants. This deep interest from dog owners in their pet's nutrition can play a key role in raising awareness around soil health. To highlight the critical role of soil, James Wellbeloved unveiled a 15-foot giant mucky pup sculpture named Ellie in central London - with Ellie's playful stance reflecting how soil makes dogs happy on the outside while also representing the four football fields of healthy soil degraded every second globally\\xB3. The sculpture follows the launch of James Wellbeloved's Beloved Soil Initiative earlier this year, a regenerative agriculture pilot developed in collaboration with experts, Agrii and Soil Association Exchange, which in its first year will partner with three farmers forming part of our supply chain producing oats and barley. Through financial incentives, education programmes and tailored training the pilot aims to help the farmers to adopt regenerative farming practices, such as crop diversification and restoring hedgerows which can contribute to improved soil health and provide shelter for wildlife. Melodie Nye, Chief Growth Officer, Mars Pet Nutrition Europe commented: \"We're proud to be building on the launch of our Beloved Soil Initiative - we know pet parents care deeply about their pets' well-being, and we want to use this passion to help inspire more awareness and consideration for the essential role of soil. By embarking on our regenerative agriculture pilot, we are beginning to help support farmers to restore and protect soil and highlighting this initiative is an important part of our journey.\" Joseph Gridley, Chief Executive Officer, Soil Association Exchange, added: \"At Soil Association Exchange, we know that the health of our soil underpins the quality of our food - whether it's feeding people or our pets. Through the Beloved Soil Initiative, we're proud to support farmers in adopting regenerative practices and verifying the impact of these changes on soil health, biodiversity, and resilience. It's great to see James Wellbeloved using its platform to raise awareness of soil's vital role, and we're excited to collaborate on this journey towards a healthier future for our soils and our food systems.\" For more information on the mucky pup sculpture and James Wellbeloved's Beloved Soil Initiative and regenerative agriculture journey, please visit here.

Agventure was established in 2010 with the mission of enabling Kenyan farmers to develop more sustainable farming practices. Agventure consists of a collective of farmers, researchers, educators, and entrepreneurs working to model, promote, and share regenerative production methods throughout the food system. Today the group supplies over 45,000 tonnes of food crops into the local market, across a range of crops including wheat, barley, maize, canola, sunflower, green peas, chickpeas, lupins, fava beans and others. Through its Centre of Excellence, the company reaches and trains over 700 small and medium sized farmers across the country, encouraging them to introduce rotational crops including canola, into their farming system to help promote soil health. Agventure then provides a guaranteed offtake for the canola seed, which it processes and sells to the Kenyan market. AgDevCo's mezzanine loan of $9.5 million will enable the company to continue to develop its canola oil production capabilities - it sells oil under the Pure Mountain brand in Kenya - allowing the company to increase its volumes purchased from outgrower farmers. It will also help to build Agventure Seed's platform to supply high quality certified seed to farmers. AgDevCo's Managing Director for East Africa, Rebecca Sankar, said, \"We are excited to be supporting Agventure in its journey to add more value commodity crops, which increases the availability of high quality, locally produced food for the domestic market and reduces reliance on imports.\" Agventure's CEO, Don White, said, \"Agventure is looking forward to working with AgDevCo to expand and strengthen our business and in doing so expand availability of regenerative agriculture solutions to many more farmers.\" AgDevCo is a specialist investor in African agriculture, growing sustainable and impactful agribusiness, with USD 280m under management. Its vision is a thriving commercial agriculture sector, which benefits both people and planet by investing in and supporting agribusinesses to grow, create jobs, produce, and process food and link farmers to markets.

The facility received an overwhelmingly positive response    from the banking community, being oversubscribed 2.6 times from    its initial amount of USD 3,000 million by more than 40 banks.     As a sustainability-linked term loan, it is the same size as the    Borrower's debut syndicated loan facility closed in 2022 and is    the largest of its kind in the Asia Pacific loan market this year    (according to LSEG LPC.).     The loan facility will be used for refinancing and general working    capital purposes and is linked to two targets from Syngenta's new    sustainability priorities. Launched in April 2024, the priorities    place sustainability at the core of the company's strategy and    demonstrate the company's continued commitment to sustainable    innovation whilst creating long-term value.     Syngenta Group's global credit ratings are \"A\" from Fitch, \"Baa1\"    from Moody's and \"BBB+\" from S&amp;P.

Through a debt-asset securitisation deal, Multitude Bank will invest EUR 14 million in loans to small and medium-sized agricultural businesses to support their transition to sustainable practices. The investment is secured by a first-of-its-kind portfolio guarantee of up to EUR 10.5 million provided by the European Investment Fund (EIF). The funds will be distributed among more than 500 European agricultural businesses, enabling them to adopt and expand sustainable practices.  \"We are proud to announce a landmark partnership with HeavyFinance, which underscores our commitment to delivering innovative, solution-oriented financial services. This initiative is a testament to our dedication to addressing climate change and supporting impactful sustainability efforts,\" said Alain Nydegger, CEO of Wholesale Banking at Multitude. \"We want to illustrate here very clearly that sustainability can be defined through profitable business practices.\"  Multitude Bank plans to begin investing in loans originated by HeavyFinance in December 2024, with full deployment of the EUR 14 million expected by the end of 2025.  \"Farmers are at the forefront of the fight against climate change, yet their ability to adopt sustainable practices often depends on access to capital. By providing the financial tools they need, we can accelerate the transition to regenerative agriculture, empowering farmers to nurture one of the planet's largest natural carbon sinks-our soil-and preserve its health for generations. This partnership between HeavyFinance and Multitude Bank will help hundreds of small and medium-sized farms advance their sustainability journey,\" said Laimonas Noreika, CEO of HeavyFinance.  \"We are honoured to partner with HeavyFinance, a purpose-driven climate tech company dedicated to transforming agriculture and achieving their ambitious goal of removing one gigaton of CO2 emissions by 2050. This collaboration not only furthers HeavyFinance's growth in customer base and geographic reach but also amplifies awareness of ESG priorities,\" said Antti Kumpulainen, CEO of Multitude Bank.

In the US the focus lies in enhancing climate        resilience of crop land      * Collaboration and innovation drive the transformation of        agriculture into a climate solution that regenerates soil and        nature.     23 May 2024, Basel, Switzerland / Arlington, Virginia, USA     Syngenta Group, the leading global agriculture technology    company, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a world-wide    conservation organization with the mission to conserve the lands    and waters on which all life depends, today renewed their    successful collaboration that links conservation goals with    economic potential and addresses societal issues like    deforestation and land degradation. The two partners have been    collaborating since 2009 and entered into a global collaboration    in 2018.     The new three-year collaboration builds on successful projects    and focuses on further advancing business practices with the    goals to scale up regenerative agriculture, improve resource    efficiency to minimize impact of agriculture on climate, improve    soil health, and promote habitat protection in major agricultural    regions worldwide including the Cerrado region of Brazil, China,    and the United States.     The collaboration embodies Syngenta's commitment to regenerate    soil and nature, core to its new Group-wide sustainability    priorities announced in April 2024.     Petra Laux, Chief Sustainability Officer of Syngenta Group: \"We    are very proud to continue our collaboration with TNC and our    partnership for impact. We want to further leverage our efforts    towards a climate solution-oriented agriculture fueled by    innovation and partnerships that regenerate soil and protect    nature. Agriculture must not only feed a growing global    population over the coming decades, but it also needs to fight    climate change and safeguard natural resources.\"     Restoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China    and the US     Syngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million    hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant    portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with    the company.     The goal of the initiative is to make the restoration of degraded    land the profitable option sought by farmers in Brazil when    expanding their production, instead of clearing native    vegetation. The REVERTE\\xAE program, originally designed by Syngenta    and TNC for the Cerrado due to its significant potential,    includes Ita\\xFA BBA bank as the organization offering a line of    credit for the growers following socio-environmental criteria.     Michael Doane, Global Managing Director Food &amp; Freshwater    Systems, TNC: \"REVERTE\\xAE aims to demonstrate, through an    integrated solution involving good agricultural practices,    financial tools, policy, and business models, the economic    viability of restoring degraded pastures instead of opening new    cultivation areas and avoiding deforestation. Restoring land in    the Cerrado delivers soil and water conservation benefits,    increases carbon sequestration, and can increase the resilience    of the production systems to extreme climate events. The program    aims to support the transformation of agribusiness in the    Cerrado, generating social, economic, and environmental benefits    today and in the future.\"     As of March 2024, REVERTE\\xAE has garnered commitments from over 263    farms, encompassing a total of 202 thousand hectares of degraded    land, with 137 thousand in the Cerrado biome.     China: The Run Tian project has already regenerated 2400 hectares    of agricultural soils in the North China Plain, the largest wheat    producing area in China. It has also trained more than 17    thousand farmers on regenerative agricultural practices, leading    to increases in yields by 4%, soil moisture storage 300m^3 per    hectare and net benefit USD 360 per hectare. Moving forward, Run    Tian will develop new business strategies to further improve soil    health to empower and support frontline producers to protect the    soil ecosystem. It will also leverage Syngenta Group's    fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers    that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering    helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting    crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta    Group's recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company    has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to    1000 by 2028.     United States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and    launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing    cropland's climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on    water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with    regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the    collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture    practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader    global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative    agriculture in seed production. The collaboration with TNC will    bring new business value to farmers, while reducing the    environmental footprint of the seeds supply chain and preserving    the quality of seeds delivered to Syngenta Group customers.    Syngenta Group supports a broad range of sustainability projects    and partners with academia and industry around the world -    demonstrating its commitment to a collaborative approach.     Syngenta Group and TNC will hold a LinkedIn Live event on the    partnership progress. Tzutzuy Ramirez and Roberto Castro,    Syngenta, and Michael Wironen and Rodrigo Spuri, TNC, will    discuss how the partners will continue to develop their unique    NGO-corporation collaboration model and what the plans are for    the future. The event will be hosted on the Syngenta LinkedIn    page on Wednesday, May 29 at 14.30 CET      About Syngenta Group     Syngenta Group is one of the world's biggest agricultural    technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.

This year, COP15 needs to have as much attention as it focuses on restoring global biodiversity. The European Outdoor Conservation Association (EOCA) team came up with a good explanation when they described the urgency of both topics as an overflowing bathtub \u2013 you should both turn off the taps plus pull out the plug to tackle the problem. Textiles have gained a (false) reputation as the second most polluting industry in the world (apparel is bad, but not that bad). Whatever the numbers, it is common knowledge that there is room for improvement not just for man-made, but in natural materials as well, like cotton. </p><p>In this ongoing discussion, one of the incoming buzzwords involves ReGenerative Agriculture \u2013 but what is it? ReGenerative Agriculture (ReGenAg) is the new way of growing cotton and other crops, but it is just the practice used a century ago. The method is based on four main principles around soil health, irrigation, carbon sequestration and restoring biodiversity. ReGenAg practice could be used immediately; unlike qualification for Global Organic Textile Standards (GOTS), which takes three years to swap over from regular farming, a ReGenAg tag can be valid after just a year of better husbandry of the soils. The North Face was the first to use ReGenAg materials when they introduced their Cali wool beanie four years ago. Last year, Timberland (also a VF Corp. brand like TNF) introduced its Earthkeeper range of footwear using ReGenAg leather. The latter is worthy of more attention because cows are seen as almost evil in this world \u2013 they provide a meat diet, they graze inefficiently on pastureland, and rainforests are cleared to grow their winter food-stock of soybeans. There has been a verified study, audited by Quantis, on the White Oaks Pasture farm in the U.S. that has revealed that rather than the usual 33 factor (kgs of CO2 produced per 1 kg of meat) \u2013 ReGenAg beef farming absorbs 3 \u00bd kg of carbon into the soil more than is emitted. It follows that sheep get an endorsement, too, for their wool. Arable crops are even better. Clever herding pays off to more carbon being stored The key aspect is the change of agricultural practice. Everything is focused on the roots of the crop (or the grass for livestock). The science bit is the other side of photosynthesis: we all know that plants take in carbon dioxide and return oxygen, that carbon is sequestered as the foliage or roots of the plant. Hence, the longer the roots, the more carbon is stored. The more growth above the ground, the longer the roots \u2013 so the trick is to move the animals onto fresh pasture before they eat the plant down to soil level. Extra herding equals more labor, but these additional costs break even (reduction in fertilizer, pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals) after four years. For arable crops like cotton, the route is following regular organic cultivation. To use the ReGenAg label, there needs to be an improvement in soil health shown year-to-year; applied correctly, the endorsement can happen after 12 months of the change of technique. Soil health (microbes) is vital for a healthy planet. A good root network will absorb and thus feed the plant with moisture for 30 times longer than rain falling on worn-out soil. The rainwater will also take up to 100 days to reach the river\u2019s flow, rather than the three days it takes to reach it during a flood. Both factors also reduce wind and water erosion \u2013 currently recorded as up to 5 cm each year. Restoring biodiversity also means creating a habitat for arable crop predators so that natural control can take place, in line with the EU Green Deal recommendations. There are many examples of how local networks reward the small farmers, as opposed to money going only to super farms; whereas sequestration (converted to the wool in a jacket) is equivalent to 100 kg of carbon stored in the ground. For manufacturers, this means that for every 10 product units, one ton is saved from the company\u2019s total carbon footprint. It is common knowledge that there is room for improvement not just for man-made, but in natural materials as well. As in so many other areas of the apparel industry, there are several different standards used by the brands. Patagonia has opted for the Rodale Institute, TNF uses Indigo, while Timberland follows the Savory Institute guidelines. The latter audit is also the one chosen by HDWool, as it is the only third-party certified system \u2013 based on the yearly Ecological Outcome Verification of the farms. With the rise in direct B2C communication channels, it is expected that end consumers will opt for carbon-balanced (or even negative) fabrics to facilitate their concern for the environment. Some industry stakeholders see regenerative agriculture as the answer to many (if not all) problems. To quote Rose Marcario when she was Patagonia\u2019s CEO: \u201cAgriculture really represents the best chance that we have of mitigating and ending the climate crisis. The science is saying that if we converted all industrialized agriculture to regenerative organic practices, we could sequester all the world\u2019s carbon\u201d.

Extension of multi-year agreement that started in 2018, focusing on five strategic projects across the globe.   By 2026, ambitious target to recover over 300 thousand hectares of degraded land in Cerrado Brazil and regenerate agricultural soils in China with a focus to impact the agricultural sector for the adaption of sustainable farming practices. In the US the focus lies in enhancing climate resilience of crop land  Collaboration and innovation drive the transformation of agriculture into a climate solution that regenerates soil and nature.  23 May 2024, Basel, Switzerland / Arlington, Virginia, USA Syngenta Group, the leading global agriculture technology company, and The Nature Conservancy (TNC), a world-wide conservation organization with the mission to conserve the lands and waters on which all life depends, today renewed their successful collaboration that links conservation goals with economic potential and addresses societal issues like deforestation and land degradation. The two partners have been collaborating since 2009 and entered into a global collaboration in 2018.  The new three-year collaboration builds on successful projects and focuses on further advancing business practices with the goals to scale up regenerative agriculture, improve resource efficiency to minimize impact of agriculture on climate, improve soil health, and promote habitat protection in major agricultural regions worldwide including the Cerrado region of Brazil, China, and the United States.  The collaboration embodies Syngenta?s commitment to regenerate soil and nature, core to its new Group-wide  announced in April 2024. Petra Laux, Chief Sustainability Officer of Syngenta Group: ?We are very proud to continue our collaboration with TNC and our partnership for impact. We want to further leverage our efforts towards a climate solution-oriented agriculture fueled by innovation and partnerships that regenerate soil and protect nature. Agriculture must not only feed a growing global population over the coming decades, but it also needs to fight climate change and safeguard natural resources.? Restoring millions of hectares of degraded land in Brazil, China and the US Syngenta has set an ambitious target to recover 1 million hectares of degraded land throughout Brazil, with a significant portion focused on the Cerrado where the TNC collaborates with the company.  The goal of the initiative is to make the restoration of degraded land the profitable option sought by farmers in Brazil when expanding their production, instead of clearing native vegetation. The REVERTE\u00ae program, originally designed by Syngenta and TNC for the Cerrado due to its significant potential, includes Ita\u00fa BBA bank as the organization offering a line of credit for the growers following socio-environmental criteria. Michael Doane, Global Managing Director Food &amp; Freshwater Systems, TNC: ?REVERTE\u00ae aims to demonstrate, through an integrated solution involving good agricultural practices, financial tools, policy, and business models, the economic viability of\u00a0restoring degraded pastures instead of opening new cultivation areas and avoiding deforestation. Restoring land in the Cerrado delivers soil and water conservation benefits, increases carbon sequestration, and can increase the resilience of the production systems to extreme climate events. The program aims to support the transformation of agribusiness in the Cerrado, generating social, economic, and environmental benefits today and in the future.?  As of March 2024, REVERTE\u00ae has garnered commitments from over 263 farms, encompassing a total of 202 thousand hectares of degraded land, with 137 thousand in the Cerrado biome. China: The Run Tian project has already regenerated 2400 hectares of agricultural soils in the North China Plain, the largest wheat producing area in China. It has also trained more than 17 thousand farmers on regenerative agricultural practices, leading to increases in yields by 4%, soil moisture storage 300m3 per hectare and net benefit USD 360 per hectare. Moving forward, Run Tian will develop new business strategies to further improve soil health to empower and support frontline producers to protect the soil ecosystem. It will also leverage Syngenta Group?s fast-growing network of Modern Agriculture Platform (MAP) centers that promote sustainable farming practices. The MAP offering helps farmers modernize their farms sustainably, while boosting crop quality, yield and farm profitability. As part of Syngenta Group?s recently published Sustainability Priorities, the company has a target to expand the number of farmer service centers to 1000 by 2028. United States: In the US, the collaboration will develop and launch two new projects. The first will focus on enhancing cropland?s climate resilience and reducing farming pressure on water resources by unlocking diverse crop rotations with regenerative sorghum production. In a parallel effort, the collaboration will also look to scale regenerative agriculture practices with seeds producers in the US, as part of the broader global Syngenta Seeds effort to implement regenerative agriculture in seed production. The collaboration with TNC will bring new business value to farmers, while reducing the environmental footprint of the seeds supply chain and preserving the quality of seeds delivered to Syngenta Group customers. Syngenta Group supports a broad range of sustainability projects and partners with academia and industry around the world ? demonstrating its commitment to a collaborative approach.

The Global Alliance, one of the hallmarks of the Brazil's G20 presidency, aims to quickly channel resources towards effective programs that reduce poverty and hunger - two Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) that are currently offtrack. As part of its membership, The Rockefeller Foundation is committing its financial and knowledge support to member countries in their expansion of school meal programs - one of the most beneficial investments countries can make to achieve SDG 1 and 2.</p><p>\"When I say that, I get emotional, because hunger is not a natural thing. Hunger is something that requires political decision. We leaders cannot look only - and all the time - at those who are close to us. We need to be able to take an X-ray and look at those who are far away, those who cannot get close to palaces, those who cannot get close to ministers,\" said Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, President of the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty and President of Brazil, in a speech at the pre-launch of the Global Alliance in July .</p><p>\"Programs such as Bolsa Fam\u00edlia, Food Acquisition and School Meals allow healthy meals to reach the most vulnerable, encourage agricultural production and promote local development. The Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty was born out of this political will and spirit of solidarity. It will be the most important legacy of Brazil's G20 presidency,\" President Lula da Silva said in his speech.</p><p>School meal programs make a critical impact on the educational outcomes and quality of life for vulnerable children around the world, especially for girls. The World Food Program indicates that school feeding programs can increase enrolment by an average of nine percent while decreasing dropout rates and significantly increasing children's attendance. Research also shows (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.wfp.org/publications/state-school-feeding-worldwide-2022\">https://www.wfp.org/publications/state-school-feeding-worldwide-2022</url>) that school feeding programs can have beneficial effects on agriculture, education, health and nutrition, and social protection, with US$ 9 in returns for every US$ 1 invested. As the most extensive social safety net globally, benefiting 418 million children in 2022, school meal programs feed 20 percent of the population one meal per day, and can also be a powerful demand driver for climate-resilient, regeneratively produced agriculture.</p><p>\"Everyone deserves access to healthy food and economic opportunity. That's why we invite other institutions to join The Rockefeller Foundation in supporting the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty,\" said Dr. Rajiv J. Shah, President of The Rockefeller Foundation. \"As part of the Alliance, we hope to help countries expand their school meal programs, which can help improve nutrition for millions of children while driving demand for more locally grown, regenerative agriculture,\" said The Rockefeller Foundation President Rajiv Shah.</p><p>The Rockefeller Foundation is comitted to supporting a healthier way to produce, purchase, and consume what it calls \"good food\" that is accessible by all and good for the planet. Since 2021 it has focused on generating support and building momentum for expanding climate-resilient school meal programs, alongside the World Food Program, The School Meals Coalition and other partners. The Rockefeller Foundation is working to support countries to improve their school meal programs to achieve climate impacts. Working with producers, corporations, investors, philanthropy and governments, The Rockefeller Foundation aims to align incentives and investment opportunities that support farmers in underserved markets through their regenerative transitions.</p><p>The Permanent Representative of Brazil to FAO, IFAD and WFP, Ambassador Carla Barroso Carneiro, on behalf of the Brazilian Government, expressed her gratitude to The Rockefeller Foundation for its commitment to the Global Alliance.</p><p>\"The Rockefeller Foundation's leadership in advancing sustainable solutions for vulnerable populations, especially in the realm of nutritious school meals, strengthens Brazil's efforts to fight these global challenges and to ensure that effective, long-term, evidence-based solutions reach those most in need,\" said Carla Barroso Carneiro, Ambassador and Permanent Representative of Brazil to the UN Rome Based Agencies.</p><p>As part of the Global Alliance, The Rockefeller Foundation expects to provide financial resources, technical assistance, capacity building support, as well as knowledge and data with member countries that are implementing school meal programs. In partnership with others, The Rockefeller Foundation will also work towards supporting large scale, country-owned implementation of policies and programs.</p><p>The Food and Agriculture Organization states, \"FAO is pleased to welcome The Rockefeller Foundation as the first philanthropic entity to join the Global Alliance Against Hunger and Poverty. The Rockefeller Foundation support for climate-resilient regenerative school meals through the Global Alliance will increase the implementation of this policy instrument at scale, directly reducing hunger and malnutrition while promoting the transformation of agrifood systems, building resilience to climate change and strengthening smallholder family farmers. FAO is keen to work with Brazil, The Rockefeller Foundation and all other members of the Alliance to end poverty and achieve Zero Hunger.\"</p><p>Open to all interested stakeholders, the Global Alliance will strive to generate collective action and mobilize resources to eradicate hunger and poverty, aligning efforts and financing from both public and private sources.</p><p>About The Rockefeller Foundation:</p><p>The Rockefeller Foundation is a pioneering philanthropy built on collaborative partnerships at the frontiers of science, technology, and innovation that enable individuals, families, and communities to flourish.

Organic growth was 2.2%, with a return to positive real internal growth of 0.8%, and both strengthened in the second half. Free cash flow improved to CHF 10.7 billion, and the Board proposes an increase in the dividend per share to CHF 3.05. We have a clear roadmap to accelerate performance and transform for the future. Increasing investment to drive growth is central to our plan. This means delivering superior product taste and quality with unbeatable value, scaling our winning platforms and brands, accelerating the rollout of our innovation 'big bets' and addressing underperformers. We are creating the fuel for these growth investments through our new CHF 2.5 billion three-year cost savings program. We are making good progress and have already secured over CHF 300 million of these savings for 2025. From 2025, we expect our actions to drive an improvement in organic sales growth, with a lower underlying trading operating profit margin in the short term as we invest for growth. While there is macroeconomic uncertainty, we have lots of opportunities ahead of us, and we have the strategy, the resources and the people and team to deliver.\"  In millions of CHF                          2024   2023  Reported change  - Real internal growth (RIG)                0.8%  - 0.3%  - Pricing                                   1.5%   7.5%  Organic growth                              2.2%   7.2%  Net acquisitions/(disposals)               - 0.3% - 0.9%  Foreign exchange movements                 - 3.7% - 7.8%  Reported sales growth                      - 1.8% - 1.5%  Sales                                      91,354 92,998     - 1.8%  Underlying trading operating profit        15,704 16,053     - 2.2%  Gross profit margin                        46.7%  45.9%      80 bps  Underlying trading operating profit margin 17.2%  17.3%     - 10 bps  Net profit(1)                              10,884 11,209     - 2.9%  Basic EPS                                   4.19   4.24      - 1.0%  Underlying EPS                              4.77   4.80      - 0.8%  Dividend per share (proposed for 2024)      3.05   3.00       1.7%  Free cash flow                             10,666 10,403      2.5% (1) Profit for the year attributable to shareholders of the parent Financial highlights Broad-based organic growth despite soft consumer demand, with a return to positive RIG   * Organic sales growth of 2.2%, with real internal growth (RIG) of 0.8% and     pricing of 1.5%.   * Growth strengthened during the year; organic growth was 2.1% in H1 and 2.3%     in H2, with RIG improving from 0.1% in H1 to 1.4% in H2.   * Growth was led by coffee, confectionery and PetCare; by geography, growth     was driven by emerging markets and Europe.

This return to positive RIG came despite soft consumer demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to geopolitical tensions, as well as actions taken to reduce customer inventory. Organic growth was 2.1% in the first half (H1) and 2.3% in the second half (H2), with RIG of 0.1% in H1, improving to 1.4% in H2. Organic growth of 2.2% was impacted by a slowdown in category growth and our own below-market development. We have a clear focus on accelerating category growth and improving our market share performance in 2025 and over the medium term. An important part of how we deliver this is focusing our resource allocation behind our strongest growth drivers: scaling existing winning platforms and brands; accelerating the rollout of our innovation 'big bets'; and building new growth engines that capture emerging consumer trends. On market share performance, in 2024 we gained or held share in approximately half of our business cells by number, but in less than half of our business cells by sales value. The majority of the Group's market share loss is driven by 18 key underperforming business cells, which together account for approximately 21% of Group sales. We are executing our action plans at pace for each cell and are seeing some early signs of improvement. A key element of improving our performance is strengthening our value propositions to consumers and customers. We are increasing investment to deliver superior product taste and quality, unbeatable value, unmissable visibility and compelling brand communication. Price competitiveness is a priority in the context of the high inflationary environment for certain commodities, most notably coffee and cocoa. We are taking an agile approach to passing on input cost increases, selectively investing in price as we focus on restoring competitiveness. To strengthen brand communication, we are stepping up investment and improving efficiency and effectiveness. Advertising and marketing spend as a percentage of sales fell from 9.0% in 2019 to a low of 6.6% in H2- 2022; in 2024, this recovered to 8.1% and is planned to increase further to 9% by the end of 2025. Efficiency and productivity At our Capital Markets Day in November 2024, we announced a new three-year cost reduction program we have called Fuel for Growth, which is in addition to existing cost efficiency initiatives. We target CHF 2.5 billion run-rate cost savings from the new program by the end of 2027, and these savings will be used to fund increased investment in growth. The Fuel for Growth program is expected to drive in-year savings of CHF 0.7 billion in 2025, CHF 1.4 billion in 2026 and CHF 2.3 billion in 2027. By the end of 2027, we expect to have reached the full run-rate savings of CHF 2.5 billion. In 2025, CHF 300 million of the savings impact this year only, with the further CHF 400 million being recurring savings that reduce the cost base on an ongoing basis. Over CHF 300 million of the expected CHF 0.7 billion cost savings for 2025 have already been secured. Approximately three-quarters of the total savings in Fuel for Growth will come in procurement, with the remainder coming from operational efficiencies and commercial investments. Within procurement, the most significant savings will come from AI-powered procurement and supplier management, spend consolidation and aggregation, and e-sourcing expansion and automation. Within operational efficiencies and commercial investments, key initiatives include reviewing operating models as well as opportunities in manufacturing and logistics. The savings in procurement and commercial investments are expected to have limited costs to achieve; operational efficiencies will typically incur one-off costs of approximately 2 times the annual savings. These Fuel for Growth savings are in addition to over CHF 1 billion per annum of ongoing efficiencies from existing Nestl\\xE9 Continuous Excellence initiatives. Expected phasing of Fuel for Growth cost savings program:   In CHF billion                    2025   2026   2027   2025 non-recurring                0.3   2025 recurring savings            0.4    0.4    0.4   2026 recurring savings                   1.0    1.0   2027 recurring savings                          0.9   Total in-year savings             0.7    1.4    2.3   Run-rate savings at end of 2027                 2.5 Strengthening foundations Nestl\\xE9's success depends on alignment and in-market execution, and people are critical to that. 2024 was an important year of change in our leadership. Our new leadership team moved quickly to align and refocus the organization. We have simplified the Group's structure and reorganized Nestl\\xE9 Waters and premium beverages into a global, standalone business. This is complemented by the introduction of a more aligned performance management framework - our 'Operational Master Plan' - to increase Group-wide performance and drive pace of execution across the organization. We have also accelerated our digital transformation as we move to becoming a real-time, end-to-end connected enterprise, powered by data and artificial intelligence. Operating sustainably is an important foundation for Nestl\\xE9, and we made progress across multiple areas. In particular, we delivered our 2025 greenhouse gas emission reduction target one year ahead of plan and made strong progress with our regenerative agriculture agenda. Guidance Our 2025 guidance is in line with the outlook we provided at the Capital Markets Day, with accelerated delivery of cost efficiencies offsetting recent increases in key commodity prices, especially in coffee and cocoa. In 2025, organic sales growth is expected to improve compared to 2024, strengthening through the year as we continue to deliver on our growth plans. UTOP margin is expected to be at or above 16.0% as we invest for growth. Guidance assumes no significant change in key macroeconomic variables. Our objective remains to deliver superior, sustainable and profitable growth. In the medium term, we continue to expect organic sales growth to be at 4% plus in a normal operating environment, with an underlying operating profit margin at 17.0% plus. Financial review Sales Total reported sales decreased by 1.8% to CHF 91.4 billion, including negative impacts of 3.7% from foreign exchange movements and 0.3% from net divestitures. Organic growth was 2.2%. Pricing was 1.5%, reflecting a reduction in inflation across most categories after two years of high input cost and price increases. RIG returned to positive growth at 0.8% and was still impacted by soft consumer demand in many markets, including consumer hesitancy towards global brands in certain markets. Additionally, actions taken to reduce customer inventory in the second half of the year reduced full-year RIG by approximately 20 basis points. By geography, organic growth was driven by emerging markets and Europe, which together more than offset a decrease in North America. In developed markets, organic growth was 1.2%, with positive pricing and RIG. In emerging markets, organic growth was 3.7%, led by pricing with positive RIG. Organic growth by product category was as follows:   * Coffee was the largest growth contributor with mid single-digit growth,     supported by the three leading coffee brands: Nescaf\\xE9, Nespresso and     Starbucks.   * Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, led by KitKat and     key local brands.   * PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, driven by continued momentum for     science-based premium brands Purina ProPlan, Purina ONE and Friskies.   * Nestl\\xE9 Health Science achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit     growth in the second half of the year.   * Water reported low single-digit growth, with solid growth for S.Pellegrino     and supported by the successful launch of Maison Perrier.   * Infant Nutrition sales grew at a low single-digit rate, supported by     continued momentum for NAN and Lactogen.   * Dairy posted negative growth, as a decline in coffee creamers and ambient     dairy more than offset growth for affordable milks and dairy culinary     solutions.   * Culinary reported negative growth, with mid single-digit growth in Maggi     more than offset by a decline in frozen food in North America. By channel, organic growth in retail sales was 2.1%. Organic growth of out-of- home channels was 3.2%. E-commerce sales grew organically by 11.3%, reaching 18.9% of total Group sales. Gross profit and operating profit Gross profit was flat at CHF 42.7 billion, and the gross profit margin increased by 80 bps to 46.7%. The gross profit margin reached 47.2% in H1, then declined 90 bps sequentially to 46.3% in H2, driven by higher input costs in coffee and cocoa. Distribution expenses as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at 8.3%. Marketing and administration expenses as a percentage of sales increased by 90 bps to 19.8%. This comprised: advertising and marketing expenses as a percentage of sales up 40 bps to 8.1%, as we began to step up investment; and administration expenses as a percentage of sales up 50 bps to 11.7% of sales, largely reflecting higher labor costs, the appreciation of the Swiss Franc and one-off items. Research and development costs as a percentage of sales was flat versus the prior year at 1.8%. Underlying trading operating profit was CHF 15.7 billion, a decrease of 2.2% on a reported basis and an increase of 1.3% in constant currency. The underlying trading operating profit margin was 17.2%, a decrease of 10 bps on a reported basis and flat in constant currency. Restructuring and net other trading items was CHF 1.1 billion compared with CHF 1.5 billion in the prior year, with the reduction mainly due to lower restructuring costs. Trading operating profit increased by 0.8% to CHF 14.6 billion. The trading operating profit margin reached 16.0%, an increase of 40 bps on a reported basis and 50 bps in constant currency.

The average cost of net debt was 2.6% compared to 2.5% in 2023. The Group reported tax rate was 25.0%, compared to 18.2% in the prior year. The increase was mainly due to a write-off in deferred tax assets from changes in utilization projections and the absence of the favorable one-off items that positively impacted 2023. The underlying tax rate increased by 70 basis points to 21.9%, driven by higher corporate and withholding tax rates in some jurisdictions, as well as changes in the geographical and business mix of profits. Net profit and earnings per share Net profit decreased by 2.9% to CHF 10.9 billion. Basic earnings per share decreased by 1.0% to CHF 4.19, reflecting the movement in net profit and the impact of the share buyback program. Underlying net profit was CHF 12.4 billion, a decrease of 2.6%, and an increase of 0.6% in constant currency. Underlying earnings per share was CHF 4.77, a decrease of 0.8%, and an increase of 2.5% in constant currency. The share buyback program contributed 1.1% to the underlying earnings per share change, net of finance costs. Cash flow Cash generated from operations increased to CHF 19.6 billion from CHF 19.2 billion in 2023. Free cash flow was CHF 10.7 billion compared to the prior year free cash flow of CHF 10.4 billion, which included CHF 0.6 billion proceeds from the disposal of a financial asset, with the increase primarily due to lower taxes paid and lower cash restructuring costs, as well as reduced capital expenditure. Dividend At the Annual General Meeting on April 16, 2025, the Board of Directors will propose a dividend of CHF 3.05 per share, an increase of 5 centimes. Nestl\\xE9 has maintained or increased the dividend in Swiss francs over the last 65 years. We remain committed to the long-held practice of increasing the dividend in Swiss francs every year. The last trading day with entitlement to receive the dividend will be April 17, 2025. The net dividend will be payable as from April 24, 2025. Shareholders entered in the share register with voting rights on April 9, 2025, at 12:00 noon (CEST) will be entitled to exercise their voting rights. Share buyback program In 2024, the Group repurchased 48.2 million Nestl\\xE9 S.A. shares for CHF 4.4 billion under the CHF 20.0 billion share buyback program that began in January 2022 and was completed as planned in December 2024. Under the program, 187.4 million shares were repurchased in the three-year period, of which 143.9 million have so far been cancelled. At the upcoming Annual General Meeting, the Board of Directors will propose the cancellation of the remaining 43.5 million repurchased shares, reducing the share capital of Nestl\\xE9 S.A. from CHF 262,000,000 to CHF 257,652,000. We do not currently anticipate initiating a new share buyback program in 2025. Net debt Net debt was CHF 56.0 billion as at December 31, 2024, compared to CHF 49.6 billion at December 31, 2023. The increase largely reflected cash outflows for the dividend payment of CHF 7.8 billion and share buybacks of CHF 4.5 billion as well as the impact of foreign exchange movements. The ratio of net debt to Adjusted EBITDA was 2.90 times at December 31, 2024, compared to 2.54 times at December 31, 2023. This is towards the top of our target range of 2 to 3 times for net debt to Adjusted EBITDA. Return on invested capital Return on invested capital was 14.1%, compared to 13.9% in 2023. This improvement reflects a lower base of average invested capital, mainly linked to working capital, and a reduction in restructuring costs. Minority participations In late 2024, we established Nestl\\xE9 Equity Holdings to consolidate ownership of many of our minority participations, enhancing governance and allowing for a more consistent and efficient approach to managing these interests.

Organic sales growth of -0.5% reflects mixed delivery across the portfolio, in the context of a challenging consumer environment. We delivered RIG-led positive organic growth in approximately two-thirds of the business by sales. This was offset by weak performance in frozen food and coffee creamers. Turnaround plans are underway in both businesses. In Zone North America, UTOP margin increased modestly, which was the result of an improvement in gross profit margin and a step-up in growth investments. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was -0.5%, with -0.8% RIG and 0.4% pricing. Pricing was     negative in H2, driven by competitive dynamics in PetCare and price     adjustments in frozen food and coffee creamers.   * Reported sales decreased by 2.5% to CHF 25.3 billion, including a -2.0%     impact from foreign exchange movements and -0.1% from net divestitures.   * Market share gains were achieved in coffee, while we lost market share in     frozen pizza and coffee creamers.   * UTOP margin increased by 10 bps to 22.3%. Gross profit margin expanded,     supported by pricing, price pack architecture and mix management, and     structural cost control was strong. Advertising and marketing investment was     increased significantly to support future growth. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * PetCare was the largest growth contributor, with low single-digit growth     driven by premium brands, particularly in the cat and therapeutic diets     segments.   * Confectionery grew at a double-digit pace, driven by Tollhouse baking     products and pricing actions particularly in the second half of the year.   * Beverages (including coffee and coffee creamers) delivered positive growth     overall, with new product launches supporting continued strong momentum for     Nescaf\\xE9 and Starbucks, offsetting a decrease in Coffee mate.   * Infant Nutrition saw a sales decrease, with a decline in Gerber in the     context of a category slowdown in baby food.   * Frozen food posted negative growth, primarily reflecting the impact of price     competition in pizza and the winding down of the frozen meals business in     Canada. Zone Europe In Zone Europe, our sales growth was broad-based, with improved market share trends in a number of categories. Growth was mainly pricing led, reflecting the inflationary environment for coffee and confectionery, supported by positive RIG in coffee and PetCare. Growth was impacted by temporary delistings in the third quarter, but recovered in the fourth quarter, driven by coffee and confectionery. UTOP margin increased, with improved gross profit margin and portfolio optimization helping fund the step-up in growth investment. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 3.3%, comprising 0.8% RIG and 2.5% pricing.   * Reported sales decreased by 1.0% to CHF 18.9 billion, including -2.5% impact     from foreign exchange movements and -1.9% from net divestitures.   * Market share gains were achieved in coffee and PetCare, with losses in     confectionery and water.   * UTOP margin increased by 50 basis points to 16.9%, driven by strong gross     profit margin improvement and supported by portfolio optimization. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by Nescaf\\xE9 soluble coffee and     Starbucks products.   * Sales in confectionery grew at a mid single-digit pace, driven by KitKat and     key local brands.   * PetCare delivered low single-digit growth, led by Purina ONE, Gourmet and     ProPlan.   * Nestl\\xE9 Professional achieved mid single-digit growth, driven by beverage     solutions.   * Water saw low single-digit growth, impacted by supply constraints in the     second half of the year.   * Infant Nutrition posted negative growth, reflecting a category slowdown. Zone Asia, Oceania and Africa We achieved solid organic sales growth in Zone AOA, with most categories and regions reporting positive RIG. We improved market share trends, particularly for key global brands like KitKat, reignited growth momentum in PetCare and significantly stepped up e-commerce growth. Several macroeconomic headwinds weighed on growth, with consumer hesitancy towards global brands linked to geopolitical tensions persisting throughout the year. In the fourth quarter, we took action to reduce customer inventories in our infant nutrition and dairy categories. For the year, UTOP margin declined, driven by increased investment in advertising and marketing. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 3.4%, with 0.6% RIG and 2.8% pricing.   * Reported sales decreased by 4.1% to CHF 16.8 billion, strongly impacted by     foreign exchange movements, which reduced sales by 7.5%.   * Key markets driving growth were Central and West Africa, the Middle East and     North Africa, and the Philippines.   * Key market share developments were gains in PetCare and losses in dairy and     culinary.   * UTOP margin decreased by 20 basis points to 23.3%, driven by increased     investment in advertising and marketing. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by Nescaf\\xE9 soluble and ready-     to-drink offerings.   * Culinary delivered high single-digit growth fueled by strong sales momentum     for Maggi.   * Nestl\\xE9 Professional achieved high single-digit growth, with strong     contributions from most geographies and categories.   * Confectionery grew at a mid single-digit pace, driven by KitKat and     supported by new product launches.   * PetCare achieved high single-digit growth, led by key brands Felix and     Purina ONE.   * Infant Nutrition posted low single-digit growth following actions to reduce     customer inventories.   * Dairy saw a sales decline, impacted by the introduction of a sales tax in     Pakistan as well as actions to reduce customer inventories and reshape the     portfolio. Zone Latin America Sales growth in Zone Latin America was pricing-led growth, with RIG declining slightly. During the year, consumer demand softened and financial pressure on customers increased in several markets due to higher borrowing costs. These headwinds led to actions to reduce customer inventories, which weighed on RIG in Q3. Improved growth in Q4 was driven by confectionery and coffee, with new price increase measures being taken in both categories. UTOP margin for the year declined due to increased investments in growth as well as higher costs linked to the acquisition of the Grupo CRM confectionery business. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 2.5%, with -0.3% RIG and 2.7% pricing.   * Reported sales decreased by 2.2% to CHF 11.9 billion, with a negative impact     of 4.9% from foreign exchange movements.   * Key markets driving growth were Brazil and Mexico; weaker performance in     smaller markets such as Peru and Colombia.   * Market share developments included gains in portioned coffee and culinary,     with losses in dairy and soluble coffee.   * UTOP margin decreased by 30 basis points to 20.4%. The reduction follows     increased advertising and marketing investments. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * Confectionery delivered high single-digit growth, driven by key local     brands, particularly Garoto, and supported by new product launches in     chocobakery.   * Nestl\\xE9 Professional grew at a double-digit pace, underpinned by customer     acquisition.   * Coffee saw mid single-digit growth, led by Nescaf\\xE9, with strong growth for     Nescaf\\xE9 Dolce Gusto.   * Culinary reported low single-digit growth supported by strong sales momentum     for Maggi.   * PetCare posted flat growth, supported by Felix and Friskies.   * Infant Nutrition and dairy reported sales declines as robust demand for NAN     infant formula was more than offset by a sales decline in Nido. Zone Greater China In Zone Greater China, growth was underpinned by positive RIG delivery in every quarter despite soft consumer demand and intense price competition in several categories. This performance was achieved by driving faster innovation in key categories and adapting route-to-market and channel strategies to capture new growth opportunities. The decline in UTOP margin reflects increased commodity costs and higher growth investments. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 2.1%, with 4.3% RIG and -2.1% pricing.   * Reported sales decreased by 1.3% to CHF 5.0 billion, as foreign exchange     reduced sales by 3.5%.   * Market share developments included gains in Infant Nutrition and     confectionery, with losses in culinary and dairy.   * UTOP margin decreased by 40 basis points to 16.1%, reflecting higher input     costs and increased advertising and marketing investments. Key sales growth drivers by product category   * Infant Nutrition was the largest contributor to organic growth, with high     single-digit growth, driven by NAN and supported by improved sales momentum     for illuma.   * Coffee posted mid single-digit growth, driven by distribution expansion and     new innovations, particularly in Nescaf\\xE9 ready-to-drink offerings.   * Confectionery grew at a mid single-digit rate, with solid growth for Hsu Fu     Chi and Shark Wafer, supported by new product launches and e-commerce     growth.   * Nestl\\xE9 Professional delivered low single-digit growth in challenging market     conditions, while culinary and dairy-related categories reported negative     growth. Nestl\\xE9 Health Science Nestl\\xE9 Health Science delivered a significant step-up in growth and margin in 2024, with all segments contributing to the improved performance. Organic growth recovered through the year, with double-digit growth in the second half. A key driver of the improved performance was the resolution of supply constraints for our U.S. vitamins, minerals and supplements (VMS) business. UTOP margin increased strongly, driven by growth leverage, mix improvement and cost efficiencies. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 6.2%, with 5.5% RIG and 0.7% pricing.   * Reported sales increased by 3.7% to CHF 6.7 billion, including a foreign     exchange impact reducing sales by -2.8%.   * Market share increased in Medical Nutrition and stabilized in VMS after     declining in the second half of 2023.   * UTOP margin improved by 200 basis points to 14.0%. The increase was driven     by growth leverage, mix improvement and cost efficiencies. Key sales growth drivers   * By geography, North America posted mid single-digit growth, Europe delivered     double-digit growth and other regions combined saw positive growth.   * VMS achieved mid single-digit growth, with double-digit growth in the second     half and an improvement in market share trends.   * Active Nutrition posted mid single-digit growth, supported by strong     momentum for Orgain, Vital Proteins and healthy aging products.   * Medical Nutrition delivered double-digit growth, with continued market share     gains. Growth was driven by strong sales momentum for adult medical care     products, particularly Peptamen and Resource, as well as Vitaflo. Sales for     gastrointestinal products continued to grow at a double-digit rate. Nespresso Nespresso delivered solid RIG-led growth, driven by the continued rollout of Vertuo, particularly in the U.S. and continued good growth in out-of-home channels. Q4 saw the highest quarterly growth of the year, supported by strong seasonal campaigns and the impact of pricing actions. UTOP margin decreased as we invested behind the expansion of Vertuo and structural costs increased. Segment performance summary   * Organic growth was 2.2%, with 1.6% RIG and 0.6% pricing.   * Reported sales increased by 0.1% to CHF 6.4 billion, including -2.4% impact     from foreign exchange movements.   * We achieved market share gains in the U.S., but lost some share in Europe.   * UTOP margin was down 30 bps to 20.0%, driven by increased advertising and     marketing investments as well as higher structural costs. Key sales growth drivers   * By geography, sales in North America grew at a mid single-digit rate with     continued market share gains. In Europe, sales posted close to flat growth.   * By system, growth was driven by the Vertuo system, with strong sales     momentum across all geographies. Sales for out-of-home channels grew at a     mid single-digit rate backed by the continued rollout of the Momento system.

In India, they are facing a triple attack. The prices they get are very low, so masses are stuck in poverty. Food-price inflation is a hot topic in India, so the government wants to depress prices. Its response is therefore to import cheap food. As a result, farm-gate prices don't rise, leaving the farmers worse off. At the same time, farmers are exposed to increasing - and increasingly worse - extreme weather events. Some are hit hard by crop losses. But when poor harvests increase food prices, yet more cheap food is imported. This distortion is possible due to the global trade system, which allows India to import agricultural commodities that are subsidised by other governments. This system rewards industrial-scale farming with massive inputs, and the result is that smallholders are squeezed and cannot prosper. At the same time, industrial-scale farming is harming the climate and thus compounding the extreme-weather risks.</p><p>So, what needs to happen?</p><p>We need to turn the global agriculture system upside down. It must become less input intensive, more rewarding and less risky for farmers. The supposedly modern farming system that you have in Europe, North America and other places is plainly unsustainable. It is harming the climate and depleting biodiversity. India is not so far at that point. EU subsidies are atrocious. You have made farmers depend on state aid, but only the largest farms really thrive. Even in Europe, smaller ones are being crowded out. Only the big farms get enough subsidies to thrive. When the EU decided to modify the system to make it less environmentally damaging, all farmers rose up in protest because they were set to lose money. The reforms were half-hearted to begin with, and now your policymakers have further slowed them down.</p><p>In what sense were reforms half-hearted?</p><p>Well, consider the organic sector as an example. EU policies have created a high-cost niche market for prosperous consumers. Low-income households cannot afford those goods. For farmers too, however, organic production basically means higher costs. To some extent, additional subsidies cover them, but organic farming still requires more labour and is more expensive. Pesticides are comparatively cheap if you consider how much work weeding requires. All in all, the subsidy system is still geared to maximising high-input production on large land holdings. That benefits the agrichemical industry as well as the food-processing multinationals, which like homogenous commodities.</p><p>So, we need regenerative agriculture instead.</p><p>Yes, we do, but the trouble is that multinationals keep hijacking terms like this. They modify their destructive patterns slightly and then claim they are now regenerative. The global food system is incredibly destructive. It is not only exacerbating the global environmental crisis, but also compounding poverty in the rural areas of emerging markets and developing countries because farms there become uncompetitive in view of heavily subsidised products from more prosperous nations.</p><p>Who can make change happen?</p><p>Change is happening where farmers see the benefits of taking a different approach and then opt for more sustainable practices.</p><p>My impression is that this is happening mainly on subsistence farms, which are highly diversified, but hardly allow families to produce enough goods to sell, so they stay trapped in poverty.</p><p>No, I don't agree. I am thinking of things like the Andhra Pradesh Community Managed Natural Farming programme. Andhra Pradesh is a state in South India, and the programme is based on science. It is designed to invest in soil capacities in order to make farms more productive. The results are excellent. </p><p>Farm productivity has stayed the same, but farmers' returns have improved. We need this kind of project to take off in many places. Eco-friendly approaches must reduce farmers' costs and allow their financial situation to improve.</p><p>What would that mean in terms of consumer choices?</p><p>It may surprise you, but as an Indian environmentalist I am not advocating vegetarianism or veganism. Both are quite popular in our country which has a long tradition of vegetarianism. However, we need to consider farmers' livelihoods. In this regard, cows are very important in India. The farmers need the milk, the dung and the meat. India is the world's largest milk producer, but we do not have huge ranches. Typically, a farming family will have one or two cattle and 10 at most. Without these animals, they would be even poorer, so it wouldn't help them if everyone became vegetarian in India.</p><p>But the international scenario is totally different.</p><p>Yes, indeed. At the global level, meat production has become very destructive. It is a driver of deforestation. Huge holdings use antibiotics not to cure, but to prevent diseases - and the result is an increase of drug-resistances, and that can make the treatment of human diseases unviable too. Ranches are using growth hormones and consuming enormous amounts of fodder, especially maize and soya. </p><p>Indeed, humankind is now using more land to grow animal feed than to grow food for human beings. No doubt, high-income countries are consuming too much meat, thus setting the wrong example internationally. But let me emphasise, the question is not do we eat meat at all, but how is the meat that we eat produced. Human diets must include protein, and meat is protein rich. If you want to become vegetarian for personal reasons, that is your choice, and your government shouldn't force it on you. What governments must do, however, is regulate agriculture businesses in ways that prevent environmental harm.</p><p>The topic of what people should and should not eat is very controversial.</p><p>Yes, I know. Your Green party in Germany once fared poorly in elections because it had spoken out in favour of one vegetarian day per week in company canteens. As far as I know, right-wing populists are now agitating for the right to eat meat as though that right was under threat. They deny that consuming too much meat is unhealthy, not only for an individual human being, but for the planet as a whole. We only have one planet, and we must look at diets from the eco-perspective.</p><p>What is your take on sugar?</p><p>I would say it is the new tobacco. Medical science shows that eating too much of it has serious health impacts, but the major food-processing industries do not want people to be aware of it. In fact, salt and fat should be seen in the same light. Consumers should be informed precisely of just how much sugar, salt and fat they can eat and at what point they start putting their health at risk. They should be told that, if they drink this large Coca-Cola bottle, that will be their sugar quota for three days, and if they have this helping of Maggi noodles along with it, that will be their salt quota for one day. Unfortunately, the lobbying power of food multinationals is great, and they oppose appropriate labelling. Therefore, people don't get this kind of information in many countries. That is a tragedy because people do make changes once they really understand the issues.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP2308202400001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6CSY-FM11-F00C-64M6-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-08-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"1281\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"08\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>August 23, 2024 Friday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

If going to market for alternative proteins is unsuccessful, the Paris Climate Agreement goals are probably impossible to achieve. Yet, like with most other transformative changes, there are always unforeseen developments in which reality turns out to be different from the initial idea. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Companies engaged in the research and production of cell-cultivated meat like to portray the dependence on intensive animal agriculture as a broken system that negatively impacts the environment, causes animal suffering, and denigrates human health. However, to achieve the next agricultural revolution, including solving complex bioengineering, economic and legislative challenges, full consumer acceptance, trust, and support will be paramount to the transformation's success. </p><p> The finite amount of agricultural land and the availability of clean water, combined with resource depletion, will force government policymakers to rebalance diets towards more plant-based foods. In other words, they will accept the need to reduce the consumption of foods with higher environmental impact, such as slaughtered animals for meat consumption and dairy cows for milk production. In the meantime, policymakers support increasing the consumption of lower-impact foods like cultivated meat and enriching the diet with plant proteins derived from cereal grains, legumes, potatoes, vegetables, and fruits.  </p><p> Investor disillusionment and financial struggles  </p><p> About 150 startup companies are involved in unraveling the challenges of cultivated meat production. The oldest startup company started in 2016, and none of the startups have ever been profitable. It is almost inconceivable that venture capital companies and large meatpackers like JBS, Tyson, and Cargill poured billions of dollars into cultivated meat startups based on little substantiated scientific information. Startups went out of their way claiming that the commercial market introduction of cultivated meat was just around the corner. This illusion was kept alive, knowing that many technological solutions were still waiting to be solved. </p><p> The reality in 2024 is that only a small fraction of the grand visions articulated in 2013-when the first US$300,000 Mosa Meat burger was unveiled-have been realized. Even with a massive US$1.6 billion in venture capital investments in 2021 and 2022, the anticipated market breakthroughs have not materialized. Instead, many of the more than 150 global cultured meat startups are facing contraction or even going out of business, casting doubt on the initial dreams of growing meat and fish from cells. In 2024, and likely in the years to come, venture capital is not something cultured meat companies can take for granted.  </p><p> In 2024, very little real progress is made, and only a very few restaurants have limited amounts of cultivated meat on their menu at astronomically high prices. Moreover, the authentic-looking pieces of whole-cut chicken breast or chicken tenders are hybrid, i.e., a mix of pea and soy protein used as a scaffolding material for the tiny meat cell strands to grow on. Quantitively speaking, at scale, the market introduction of cultivated meat isn't going to happen anytime soon. Anything before 2035 is simply wishful thinking. No wonder that some capital venture companies have become disillusioned about the exaggerated and missed timelines. </p><p> The slow progress-or better said, the no progress-of commercial market introduction has made quite a few capital venture companies realize that there will be no quick fix for the return on investment. Compared to the venture capital boom of 2021 and 2022, it is estimated that 2024 will generate only a meager US$36 million in new capital. This shift reflects changing sentiments in the world's food security landscape, which will not be as easily navigable as the founders of cultured meat companies initially preached. They are now looking elsewhere to make their investment dollars grow. This has caused a few cultivated meat startup companies to close their doors while many others scramble to get new capital. </p><p> The total global meat market stands at slightly over 50 billion kilograms (as of 2024). Even if all currently available cultured meat production facilities operate at full capacity, they would generate a maximum of 15 million kilograms-an extremely small fraction of what is required.  </p><p> Transformative technology seldom follows a linear pathway, and real setbacks get in the way before actual advancements or solutions can be applied. At this point, manufacturing cultivated meat is similar to making the impossible possible. Perhaps the true lesson that needs to be learned is for the startup companies to become more modest and stop making unsubstantiated claims about imminent commercial market introduction, selling at par with animal-grown meat, and toning down the environmental claims. Only then will there be a chance to change the current pessimism into a more positive outlook. </p><p> The need for a unified sustainable meat ecosystem  </p><p> The legislative authorities, the food industry, and its customers need an inclusive solution to unite and drive the world toward a more sustainable meat ecosystem. Cultivated meat is here to stay and is projected to break the monopoly of the traditional slaughter-based farming industry. Yet, in the cultured meat arena, hype and reality don't always see eye to eye simply because there are still many unknowns, with major engineering and technology challenges still needing to be resolved. </p><p> In many publications, cellular agriculture is positioned around the peak of inflated and lofty expectations or doom-scenario viewpoints that cultured meat will eventually blow up in a major disillusionment. Eventually, the outcome will probably be a plateau of scientific and technological progress when lasting infrastructure will become a sound supply for food security. Many stakeholders and consumers  argue that plant-based meat alternatives, as well as cultivated meat, will be transitioning into market domination over conventionally raised and slaughtered meat. In the long run, these innovative foods are expected to perfectly fit the dietary lifestyle preferences of the young generations of consumers who also enjoy consuming plant-based meat products.  </p><p> Cultivated meat is not \"fake meat,\" but rather real meat made from real cells from real animals. Cell-cultivated meat allows the manufacturing of high-quality protein without the need to feed, raise, and slaughter animals.  </p><p> Global rise in conventional livestock production  </p><p> Conventional livestock production is increasing exponentially globally as more countries become more prosperous. Intensive livestock farming continues to lower costs, making meat more affordable. Yet, the downside is the carbon footprint, which contributes to diverting crops to animal feed and climate change.  </p><p> Although many world cultures and social traditions universally enjoy meat, UN and government policymakers believe it is time to switch from conventional slaughtered meat -which increasingly creates challenges for the environment- to a more humane method of meat production. The world's overreliance on factory-farmed livestock to feed the burgeoning demand for protein will be ecologically and environmentally difficult to sustain. There is also the misery of intensive meat production, often associated with chemical fertilizer, hormones, antibiotics, energy, land, and water required to keep the outgrowing cycle of animals at pace for an early arrival at the slaughterhouse. Suppose the technology-driven cultivated meat mission succeeds in displacing part of animal agriculture. In that case, it will significantly improve the environmental impact of food production, public health, animal ethics, and above all, food security in a world negatively affected by climate irregularities. </p><p> In a few words, cultivated meat is an emerging development with biotechnology, which aspires to grow meat from cells, preventing animal husbandry and slaughter. Growing steaks and coarse meat particles directly from non-genetically engineered animal cells makes the world  better positioned to overcome food-related challenges and offer solutions to bring agricultural systems back into balance. Initially, the first entries of cell-cultivated meat started by using biomedical tissue-engineering technology to grow real animal cells without the animal. These slaughter-free meat products use around 90% less land, water, feed, and energy than conventional raised meat.  </p><p> Infrastructure needs for cultivated meat production  </p><p> Looking at the current state of cultivated meat investments, it can be concluded that venture capitalists strongly believe that cultivated meat will be transformative and profitable as the world comes to grip with possible food insecurity and climate change. The regionalization or localization of cultivated meat is itself a way of carbon reduction. Especially venture capitalist companies and startups are making bold pronouncements about the bright future of cell-cultivated meat. There are still many unanswered questions about cultivated meat technology. </p><p> To date, quite a few of the predictions seem to be based on wishful thinking. The uncertainty about the commercial launch of cultivated meat is related to the unknown technical challenges at the manufacturing scale and the intertwined cost-competitive nature. Some of these barriers are cell metabolism, sterility issues, thermodynamics, bioreactor design, medium costs, and optimum bioreactor volume capacity. All these variables ultimately need to be harmonized before cultivated meat can be produced to partly displace traditional slaughtered meat. </p><p> Many full-scale facilities need to be built if the production of cultivated meat is ever to become economical and technically feasible. Many thousand bioreactors will be needed to replace a small portion of the projected meat consumption. The estimated cost of these cultivation facilities and the cost of the growth media can be seen as a make-or-break issue for the future of the cultivated meat industry. As it stands now, venture capital companies will likely need to patiently wait for a meaningful return on investment, if ever. A more appropriate approach would be to consider these investments in relation to environmental and animal ethical or social considerations and financially supported by governments, for which return on investment is of secondary importance. </p><p> Food security, which most people living in developed countries take for granted, might only survive if a paradigm shift in next-generation technology is implemented. </p><p> Biomanufacturing of traditional foods such as meat and milk that are resource-intensive and expensive shows real potential to emerge as a lifesaver for future generations. Cheap and accessible cultivated protein -including mycelium or fungi varieties- will need forward-thinking implementation based on science and entrepreneurial spirit. To be frank and honest, like with any other revolutionary concept, only time will tell if these technologies rise as a salvation or sink as an expensive financial disaster. </p><p> The investor's perspective on cellular agriculture  </p><p> It is incredible to see that the very first cell ag companies, which were founded in 2014, have already reached an astounding 150+ startups in 2024, employing thousands of cell ag scientists around the globe. Cultivated meat startup companies are still quite far from actively displacing animal agriculture. Unfortunately, the downside of this emerging industry is that most, if not all of these companies are working within their own confinement with minimal sharing of ideas. These attitudes inevitably slow down speed-to-market due to a lack of foundational knowledge and common interest frameworks that may trigger new ideas for researchers, such as-for example-accessible cell-line banks.  </p><p> The best method to grow cultured meat cells is still surrounded by company proprietary information and secrecy. There are still quite a few unanswered questions, especially regarding information about cell density, cell lines, and technical bottlenecks that need to be overcome. Bacteria and viruses may present issues of their own. Cultured cells have no immune system. Thus, there is a risk that both bacteria and viruses can spoil or contaminate the biomass. </p><p> The due diligence trajectory for investors should focus on five critical topics: </p><p> - The selection of the growth media </p><p> - Hardware for optimized capacity bioreactors and scalability </p><p> - R&amp;D: internal or open-source </p><p> - Commercial speed to market </p><p> - Return on Investment for venture capital companies </p><p> In principle, all types of meat can be cultivated: beef, pork, turkey, chicken, and fish. As a matter of fact, once the cultivated-meat science and engineering technology is ready for large up-scaling, cost efficiencies will hopefully become economically competitive, allowing the production of a nutritionally superior lean and tasty protein source. Before that happens, the road to success will be difficult to navigate, with many foreseen and unforeseen obstacles. It is fair to say that the true cost of traditional meat is estimated to be far higher than retail store pricing if the hidden costs of farm subsidy programs and greenhouse gas emissions are taken into consideration. In terms of sustainability, cultivated meat has the potential to significantly reduce the environmental footprint of meat production. </p><p> The technical challenges of scaling cultivated meat  </p><p> Muscle and fat cell maturation will take a combination of advanced cell sources, serum-free culture media formulations, and edible (gelatin or soy protein or pea protein) scaffolds to form the network for growing cells, as well as engineering advances in a bioreactor design technology. Making tissue-engineered cultivated meat and cultivated fish at scale is now considered the biggest roadblock hindering a rapid introduction of commercial quantities. The biopharmaceutical industry's largest designed bioreactors tend to peak at around 25,000 liters. Anything larger than that takes the engineering of these vats in unchartered territory, the biggest problem of which will be to provide all the cells with the same amount of nutrients and oxygen. The slow-stirring blades may potentially damage the fragile cells, which will make them useless. As it stands today, a 25,000-liter capacity bioreactor seems the most efficient equipment to commercially grow meat. However, the size of bioreactors will ultimately need to reach a minimum 100,000-liter capacity, though the industry already talks about 250,000-liter sizes. The engineering of these gigantic bioreactors will go into unchartered territory without any experience to fall back on. </p><p> Driving down the costs of the media nutrient ingredients used to cultivate meat is the main challenge to make the new industry profitable. For that to happen, the key is to continually find more efficient cells and specially formulated growth medium to jump-start cell growth. This medium is a nutrient-dense broth of purified water, glucose, salts, amino acids, and growth factors such as recombinant proteins, cytokines, hormones, and some other additives that regulate cell development and metabolism. (All substances present in the medium can be compared to the function of blood that provides nutrients and hormones to the living cells in a body.) </p><p> Once the initial inoculation phase is completed, the cells will slowly start to multiply, and the activated cells are transferred to a small donor 50-liter bioreactor. After a 10-day growing time, the substrates are transferred to a large bioreactor while maintaining a specific ratio of fluid to cells to optimize metabolic requirements. </p><p> In cultured meat production, sterility is of utmost importance. Bacterial infection or contamination can happen in just a few hours, which renders the entire batch useless. To avoid these potential weak hurdles, it will be essential to design and operate pharmaceutical-grade cultivated-meat clean processing rooms. These aseptic production methods are another cost that comes into play to calculate the real costs of cultured meat production. </p><p> Balancing ambition with reality in the alt protein space  </p><p> Alternatives to animal protein products and ingredients, whether through plant-based formulations or cellular agriculture, including precision fermentation, continue to attract investors. The stakes are astronomically high. For example, cell-cultured meat will have a shot to capture a yet undefined share of the US$1.4 trillion animal meat market. The hypothesis is no longer a fantasy when looking at the US milk market, where some 15% of milk products are already captured by plant milk. It is plausible that the same will happen to the cell-cultivated meat and -fish market. </p><p> Since 2011, the Eat Just startup company has raised about US$850 million, making it one of the best financially backed in plant-based alternatives like vegan mayonnaise as well as cultivated chicken via their Good Meat subsidiary. Eat Just has backing from, among others, Qatar Investment Authority, UBS, and Charlesbank Capital Partners. The verdict is still out, but either strategic financial mismanagement or too aggressive and unproven technology growing projections have become a major wake-up call for the many other startups that are embarking on commercializing cultivated meat. </p><p> For example, engineering solutions provider ABEC was appointed by Good Meat (the cultivated meat division of Eat Just) to design, manufacture, install, and commission a gigantic 250,000-liter bioreactor in the US and Singapore. The capacity of this bioreactor to produce avian and mammalian cell-based meat will be about 15,000 metric tons of slaughter-free meat. This decision was probably based on wishful thinking rather than developing bioreactors that hold just hundreds or thousands of liters to grow animal cells. It would have been a smarter idea to gradually grow the cultivated meat technology using a bioreactor that is priced somewhere between US$150 million and US$200 million. Such a strategy looks more viable long-term.  </p><p> A reality check for the cultivated meat industry  </p><p> The first commercially operated bioreactor started production in 2023 by Upside Foods (Emeryville, CA) and Eat Just (Singapore). However, the Upside Foods EPIC facility is in 2024 still being used as an experimental pilot plant with little real quantities of cultivated meat to show for.  </p><p> JBS, the Brazilian powerhouse and largest protein producer in the world, is constructing a cultivated beef facility in San Sebastian, Spain. Reportedly, the facility will be fully operational by mid-2024. The necessary technology impetus will be provided by BioTech Foods, in which JBS holds a 53% ownership stake. The new Sebastian production facility will cover an area of 20,000 square meters. </p><p> Financial backing by venture capitalists and legacy food companies is now allowing many startups to transition into pilot scale-up and even commercialization of cell-based meat. For cultured meat startups and investors alike, the successful outcome is still based on taking informed bets to make the technology work and pay off. For 2024, a certain hesitance is developing into further financing or investing in cultivated meat startups. Perhaps venture capital companies are now in a wait-and-see mode, and/or a saturation point has been reached. </p><p> The first signs of a significant market contraction among startups are not encouraging. SCiFi Foods in San Francisco, CA, permanently closed its doors in June 2024. New Age Meat closed earlier, and Berkeley, CA-based Upside Foods laid off research and equipment specialists. Aleph Farms in Israel also laid off about 30% of its workforce. These companies, along with several others, cited the challenging funding environment as the primary reason for their struggles, making it difficult to stay afloat, let alone build a commercial facility for cultured meat production.  </p><p> It is plausible that many of the cultivated meat startups will be entering the road of consolidation. It is no secret that biotechnology food startups are increasingly challenged in 2024 to generate new funding opportunities. Of the many cultivated meat startups, the top five account for almost 50% of the total venture capital investments: Upside Foods, Mosa Meat, Believer Meats, Aleph Farms, and Wildtype. Cultivated meat startups raised 34% less capital in 2022 and 2021.  </p><p> 2024 is proving to be a tough year for most biotech food startups to raise capital, turning the once-promising dreams into a frustratingly difficult reality. </p><p> Cultured meat startups are still grappling with the complexities of growing meat in a bioreactor, particularly with overcoming massive technological and engineering challenges. A major issue remains the search to increase cell density per unit of bioreactor volume. Companies like Upside Foods, Eat Just, and Mosa Meat are working on improving the efficiency of growth media and choosing the right engineering systems. These are critical concerns since producing growth media is expensive.  </p><p> Overcoming consumer perception and adoption  </p><p> The consumers' minds about food are unpredictable, and logic fails at times. Food is different from everything else because it is surrounded by much subjectivity and irrational behavior. Justifying behavior is often easier than changing behavior. Despite all the publicity around the need to reduce meat consumption, it is weird to conclude that overall, consumers do not eat less meat and fish even if they have increasing concerns over animal welfare and health issues. Eating meat is thoroughly ingrained in most cultures. When moral standards and self-serving desires come into conflict, the consumers' self-interest often wins to justify their lifestyle. Psychologically speaking, people tend to justify their behavior rather than change it when they feel guilty. </p><p> Hopefully, prices of cultured meat and fish will be at par or even better than traditionally farmed animal meat or ocean-caught fish and crustaceans like lobster. As these technologies progress with scale and high-volume output bioreactors, prices will continue to drop, and cultivated meat and fish will become more affordable. It is also likely that cultivated meat or -fish will team up with plant protein components as true hybrid foods to further reduce costs and improve its environmental status while perfectly mimicking its meat- or fish-eating experience. </p><p> The under-30-year-old generation of customers takes more responsibility for factory farming and slaughtering. The Western world has clearly come to a T-junction where it is being pushed to decide on which way to go --either stay the course of conventional meat production or embrace sustainable cultivated meat. </p><p> For consumers to accept cultivated meat, branding will be key, and reframing words and explaining the science will be essential. Sustainability issues will play an important role in changing the perception from traditional killed animals for meat procurement to \"bio-fabricated synthetic\" or \"cell-cultivated\" meat. The idea of growing animal cells at scale inside a bioreactor is still something that ordinary people will find hard to grasp. Mainstream acceptance of cell-cultivated meat is still mainly based on assumptions and hypothetical arguments. Going forward, it is a long shot but certainly plausible that sustainable consumption of cell-cultivated meat will be the main competitor to livestock-harvested products, creating a balance that slowly but surely tilts in favor of cell-cultivated meat as new generations of consumers adapt to the new paradigms.  </p><p> The main drivers for cost reductions </p><p> The cultured meat race toward achieving price parity with conventional meat may begin as soon as 2035. However, it is not unlikely that parity pricing will be reached until 2040. The three main technological drivers of cultured meat cost reductions are: </p><p> - Large scale bioreactor vessels </p><p> - Growth media </p><p> - Cell density </p><p> Going forward, it is expected that innovative single-cell fermentation-based growth medium proteins will significantly reduce costs for cultured meat production. The goal is to produce cultivated meat by using a cell-feed that is a completely animal-free component. In principle, cell feed is the nutrient component that cells need to multiply in a similar fashion to how they would inside an animal. Animal-free component cells are a major departure from using fetal bovine serum, and its elimination brings emotional and ethical benefits for consumers. </p><p> Although there is still a long journey from research to the plate, the global debate on many simultaneously driven issues like the reduction of greenhouse gases and loss of biodiversity will work as a favorable perfect storm for cultivated meat, a journey that will not be entirely smooth sailing. For example, ramping up cultivated meat production will also mean ramping up the global production of individual amino acids to support medium components needed by the cultivated meat industry. Surely, these amino acids can be extracted from soy or pea crops, though that would stress the destructive mono-crop culture even further into negative territory. After all, the massive production of grains and pulses is one of the primary drivers of deforestation and biodiversity loss in the world. Soy is often seen as one of the most destructive monoculture crops in agriculture, contributing to climate change because of tropical deforestation, water pollution, and eradication of wildlife. </p><p> Regulatory challenges and legislative pushback  </p><p> Traditional livestock farmers do not have to worry about competition from cell-cultured meat companies. There are clear FAO forecasts that global meat production needs to increase by 50% to provide quality protein for the 10 billion people living on planet Earth by 2050. If 100% of that growth were cell-based meat, it would not impact a single livestock producer anywhere on the planet. </p><p> Like with any other disrupting innovation, there is a measured pushback from the legacy industry for fear that their \"monopoly\" business model might be threatened. Eventually, the implementation of new technology needed by the global market will win due to the numerous socioeconomic, health, and food security issues. History has always shown that progress can be temporarily slowed down, but it ultimately will succeed. Hence, the big-name traditional meat processors will eventually embrace cell-cultivated meat and -fish, whether as acquirers, licensees, customers, or investors. </p><p> It is not surprising that the traditional and legacy meat producers seem to \"fight\" a war on two fronts simultaneously: the emerging cultivated meat and cultivated fish products finding themselves cornered or even wasted by the huge influence of plant meat products. As a strategy, the traditional meat industry stresses the fact that meat has a \"clean deck\", meaning that it contains only one ingredient. For reference, they compare it with the plant-based meat alternative products that are formulated using a long list of ingredients, including chemical-sounding names like methylcellulose and many more. Expectedly, the companies of plant meat foods will rightfully answer by stating that meat is also a combination of many individual components to grow to the point that it can be eaten. </p><p> Even though the FDA / USDA has approved cultivated meat to be sold by Upside Foods and Good Meat, there is still (unexpected) major opposition by a US State going so far as to criminalize the production, sale, or consumption of cultivated meat. A case in point is Florida, which introduced two legislative bills in February 2024 that could significantly impact the availability of cultivated meat within the State. Arizona might be the next state to require strict legislation on product labeling. The verdict is still out, though by means of restrictive legislation, these actions have a direct impact on protein biotech research, which will be needed to feed and nourish the growing world population. </p><p> Startups lead the charge in cultivated meat innovation  </p><p> There is nothing unreal about cell-cultured meat. Cultured meat is analogous to \"clean energy\" and will help the food industry avoid not only ballooning costs of grain and water but also waste disposal associated with livestock while significantly reducing emissions of greenhouse gases.  </p><p> Several startups claim that they are in the final stages of scaling up their slaughter-free meat and catch-free seafood while offering precision fermentation capabilities and technologies. The future is approaching faster than many people like to think. Aleph Farms, Upside Foods, Mosa Meat, and Shiok Meat are planning to start the initial commercial sales of cultivated meat and cultivated fish.  </p><p> Mosa Meat (Netherlands) opened in May 2023 their first 2750 sq/mt pilot production facility for cultivated burgers. Singapore is their first export market because sales of cultivated meat are already cleared. The \"Mosa burger\" is a true hybrid food containing about 65% cell-cultivated lean beef and beef fat, and the remaining 35% is made up of soy protein components. </p><p>Switzerland's largest supermarket, Migros, signed an agreement with SuperMeat (Israel) in August 2022 to develop a European infrastructure to produce and market cell-based meat. It is likely that Migros will likely be the first European supermarket to sell its own brand of cultivated meat on a broad commercial scale. </p><p> Pending USDA-FSIS regulatory review and approval, Upside Foods is planning to introduce  cell-based cultured chicken in 2025. This move will showcase its innovative meat cultivation abilities at its Emeryville, CA EPIC Center (Engineering, Production, and Innovation Center), with a projected annual capacity of about 180 metric tons. Upside Foods is more than cultured beef. Its January 2022 acquisition of Cultured Decadence (Madison, WI) was dedicated to cultivated seafood products such as lobsters and other crustaceans.  </p><p> Cultivated meat producer Believer Meats (previously known as Future Meat Technologies) will open its first full-scale production facility in Wilson, North Carolina, in the first quarter of 2024. The 20,500 sqm facility will be designed to process at least 10,000 metric tons of cultivated meat per year. </p><p> Not to be outdone, the idea is taking root that Aleph Farms (Israel) and Fermbox Bio plan to build their first cell-based meat production facility in Thailand. The reason is that, most likely, the EMEA and APAC countries will initially become the largest markets for cultivated meat. Both regions project a continuation of increasing demand for animal-based proteins and fat, whose products ensure short and predictable value chains. </p><p> The Eat Just company is committed to building a large-scale cultivated meat facility in Singapore and Qatar. For reference, the Singapore-based pilot facility of the Eat Just Food company currently uses a 1,200-liter reactor capable of producing a few hundred kilos of cultured chicken meat per year. The products will be commercially available in small quantities at select restaurants under the GOOD meat label. Singapore has already been given regulatory approval, and it is likely that the Ministry of Public Health in Qatar will grant regulatory approval soon. Clearly, countries that traditionally rely on food imports now choose to go through a rapid transition to achieving self-sufficiency across many food sectors, including animal-free precision fermented dairy protein ingredients such as whey protein and casein protein. </p><p> Startup Believer Meat (Wilson NC) has teamed up with global powerhouse Nestle Research with all signs showing \"Go\" and hopefully will speed up the time to market at par or lower prices than conventionally slaughtered meat. In the meantime, authentic-looking 3D bioprinted plant-based meat will likely be infused with cultivated meat and, hence, can be considered a true hybrid food product. </p><p> MeaTech 3D, a startup from Israel- is creating alternatives to industrialized animal farming by developing its proprietary cell-based meat products made by 3D tissue engineering and bio-printing principles, as well as various types of cultured fat for plant meat or hybrid meat alternatives. </p><p> A pragmatic solution for cultivated meat  </p><p> Making larger volumes of cultivated meat at low cost is one of the remaining hurdles for the emerging industry. How much can affordable cultivated meat make a dent in the more than US$1.4 trillion global meat market? At best, the current outlook for cultivated meat is going the hybrid route, i.e., mixing animal meat and fat cells with plant protein ingredients-most of which are extruded-into tasty and nutritious food products. Meat hybrids can be defined as blends combining traditional animal-raised meat and/or cultivated meat, as well as plant protein sources. Blending familiar sources with unfamiliar sources will help create a lower barrier of entry for consumers and thus support the expanding alt-protein markets. </p><p> These products are easier to make because the cultivated cells grown in a bioreactor can be made as a slurry that is easy to blend with plant protein ingredients. Combining cultivated meat with plant protein ingredients will create hybrid products to draw consumers to the preferred taste and texture of these alternative food products made available at competitive pricing. Hybrid-formulated approaches could move the alternative protein category forward faster. Using plant-based ingredients generally allows lower-end food costs when integrated with fermentation-derived or cultivated meat components. </p><p> For example, a burger or chicken nugget formulation containing as little as 5% cultivated meat can significantly enhance all organoleptic properties while boosting the value of plant protein sources beyond what they can achieve alone. These types of hybrid products are already commercially available and are being produced in small quantities by Eat Just at select restaurants in Singapore.  </p><p> These combinations of plant-based and cultured meat will most likely become available as beef burgers and chicken nuggets, then gradually diversify into incremental, more premium products that are able to mimic the meat-eating experience. These hybrid products will be significantly more affordable than cultivated meat alone. Especially battered and breaded products such as chicken nuggets can be produced at considerably low costs. </p><p> Cultured meat embedded in a blend of plant protein, fat, and water, surrounded by hydrated extruded plant protein, should not be viewed as a compromise of the early cultured meat visionaries. Instead, it represents a significant step forward in marketing hybrid meat products as an essential part of making nutritious, healthy, affordable, and great-tasting food options available and sustainable.  </p><p> When you think of it, hybrid products are really nothing new. Cultivated meat only replaces the animal meat source in these products, whereas all other inclusions like textured plant protein are used to mimic traditional meat products like chicken nuggets while significantly reducing costs. These hybrid products have been hugely successful for many years, and many millions of them are sold by the world's largest fast-food companies. One could think about the McDo Burger, a fixture on the McDonald's menu board in the Philippines since 1994. This best-selling hybrid burger contains only some 30% beef and many more spin-off products formulated using chicken, pork, or fish. </p><p> Protein migration-cultivated meat going forward </p><p> Looking at all cultivated meat activities, one might wonder if most press announcements are based on reality or wishful thinking. Can consumers indeed eat their way out of climate change, or is the cultivated meat industry a fantasy that is doomed to fail? The fact is that the speed of market introduction will be very slow and at high prices that only the happy few can afford. Realistically speaking, not much will happen before 2030, and only then when the emerging cultivated meat business is financially supported by either steep government subsidies or a continuation of venture capital investments. At the time of this writing, dark clouds have appeared, and the wait is for unbiased information on when the meat-protein transition will happen.  </p><p> Most likely, kilo-for-kilo cultivated meat is probably too expensive and initially will only displace a modest, very small percentage of the trillion-dollar global meat industry. It can also be assumed that future meat prices-especially for beef-will eventually become higher as resources like feed, land, and water become more scarce. Relatively speaking, as the price of animal meat goes up, the relative price of cultured meat will come down. </p><p> Henk Hoogenkamp works as an author and Protein Application Specialist. </p><p> Contact  </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Hoogenkamp1@gmail.com\">Hoogenkamp1@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content><nitf:body.end><graphic><nitf:media><caption><p><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"20241122109439\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"41665\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject><br/>Greenhouse gas emissions for meat produced with conventional vs. renewable energy</p></caption></nitf:media><nitf:media><caption><p><br/></p></caption></nitf:media></graphic></nitf:body.end></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLEINT-20241122682887</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLEINT2024</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:6DG5-P441-DYG1-P009-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">280767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2024-11-21</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"6338\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2024 Deutscher Fachverlag GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fleischwirtschaft International</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24142\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"22\" month=\"11\" year=\"2024\"><dateText>November 22, 2024</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"94\"><className>Business &amp;

Sales for the third    quarter 2024 were $6.8 billion, flat compared to the prior year    period (up 4 percent at CER). In Q3 2024, EBITDA more than    doubled to $0.7 billion (159% at CER), compared to a lower    baseline in Q3 2023.      Sales for the first nine months of 2024 were $21.4 billion, down    $3.0 billion or 12 percent year-on-year, compared to a strong    first nine months in 2023. Sales were down 9 percent at constant    exchange rates (CER).      EBITDA for the first nine months of the year was $2.7 billion, 23    percent lower (-12% at CER) year-on-year. The Group's EBITDA    margin for the first nine months of 2024 was 12.9 percent, down    1.7 percentage points compared to 14.6 percent in the same period    last year.      Adverse weather conditions across key markets affected    applications of crop protection products. Sustained price    pressure, particularly in the commoditized segments of the crop    protection portfolio (and notably in Latin America), and reduced    grower profitability had an impact on demand. Crop commodity    prices have continued to decline, reducing farmer income and    hampering demand for input materials.      The crop protection market is showing initial signs of recovery    with channel inventories now closer to normal levels. Syngenta    Group expects the market to further recover after the first half    of 2025 with a market also less impacted by lower crop prices and    overcapacity.      Syngenta Group has continued to implement further initiatives to    drive profitability improvements, streamlining operations and    improving cash flow, including optimizing working capital.

At a    constant exchange rate sales were up 3 percent in the quarter.    Biologicals delivered further growth. Customer buying behavior is    shifting more towards a pre-pandemic pattern, which means    products are being ordered closer to the time of application than    in previous years where products were ordered earlier to account    for extended delivery times.      ADAMA experienced a weaker Q3 of 2024, with a sales decrease of    10 percent amid a challenging environment for suppliers of    post-patent active ingredients. Despite the decline in sales,    ADAMA successfully improved its margins thanks to its ongoing    business improvements and transformation plan.      The Seeds business delivered 3 percent year-on-year sales growth    in the third quarter of 2024 (4% at CER). Growth was partially    offset by lower sales in Argentina where the market was affected    by weather and disease pressure.      In Q3 2024, Syngenta Group China sales increased 11 percent    compared to the same period last year. Sales growth was boosted    by the market introduction of new seeds varieties and a strong    growth momentum for biologicals. In the first nine months of the    year, sales declined 10 percent due to price headwinds in active    ingredients and the proactive reduction of low-margin business.      The Group will continue to leverage its industry-leading R&amp;D    pipeline for sustainable innovation and focus on expanding its    digital platforms to help growers manage weather changes and make    better, data-based decisions.

Europe sales were 1 percent    lower; Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa down 24 percent; and LATAM    sales 26 percent lower. Sales of Vegetable Seeds increased by 9    percent and sales of Flowers were 2 percent higher.     Brazil received record approval of the critical Corn Lep 2.1    trait by CTNBio. In China, Syngenta continued with accelerated    product launches, especially in corn and rice, resulting in a    number one position on the National Registered Varieties list    with 54 new corn products. North America benefitted from share    growth in its branded and licensed soybean business. Europe    trials showing strong performance of new products in the early    corn silage market, and the sunflower herbicide tolerant A.I.R.    trait is leading to several licensing agreements. Asia, Middle    East &amp; Africa saw high double-digit corn volume increase Q3 24    versus Q3 23 despite a very challenging regulatory environment.    LATAM is working closely with farmers on last-minute decision    making due to economic uncertainty and acreage shift due to corn    stunt disease.     Syngenta Vegetable Seeds opened a new world-class small seed    processing facility in the U.S., increasing the processing volume    of this business with up to 30 percent more capacity to meet    growing demand for high-quality vegetable seeds.

Unless otherwise mentioned, comparisons are to the same period in    2023. Certain amounts, including components of change (%), may    not add up due to rounding. The results presented in this release    are unaudited and a consolidation of the business units in the    Syngenta Group which includes Syngenta AG, Syngenta Group China,    ADAMA Ltd., Sinofert Holdings, Winall Hi-tech Seed and Yangnong    Chemical.      As a change to previous reporting, Yangnong Chemical sales have    been fully included within the Syngenta Group China results,    including exports, rather than partially appended in the Group's    Crop Protection units as previously presented. In addition, the    regional split of Syngenta Crop Protection, Syngenta Seeds, and    the sub business unit split of Syngenta Group China have been    amended to reflect a revised management structure and operating    model within these units. Comparative figures for 2023 have been    amended to reflect these changes on a consistent basis; total    sales are unchanged.      Results in this report from one period to another period are,    where appropriate, compared using constant exchange rates (CER).    To present that information, current period results for entities    reporting in currencies other than US dollars are converted into    US dollars at the prior period's exchange rates, rather than at    the exchange rates for the current year. The CER presentation    indicates the business performance before taking into account    currency exchange fluctuations.

The event, held both in-person and online, was attended by more than 350 industry stakeholders from 38 countries around the world who addressed four key themes: climate action, sustainable livelihoods, data &amp;amp; traceability and regenerative agriculture. On the opening day, following a members\u2019 meeting to introduce the upcoming release of Better Cotton\u2019s India Impact Report, Nisha Onta, regional coordinator for Asia at WOCAN, and Antonie Fountain, CEO of the VOICE Network, kicked off discussions on climate action and sustainable livelihoods. </p><p>The former explored both the extent of climate change impacts on cotton-growing communities and opportunities for collaboration. Breakout sessions focused on the potential of localized primary data and carbon finance projects to achieve farm-level improvements. On the topic of sustainable livelihoods, Fountain\u2019s presentation segued into a lively discussion on income, which he led with the assistance of Ashlee Tuttleman, Senior Innovation Manager at IDH. Together, they led a quiz that focused on agricultural myths that circulate throughout the commodity sectors before the winners were invited on stage to participate in an impromptu panel discussion. Later sessions on the topic delved into the concept of \u201cwell-being\u201d and \u201csustainable livelihoods.\u201d Julia Felipe, a Better Cotton farmer from Mozambique, shared her experiences, as did Jyoti Macwan, secretary general of SEWA, a women\u2019s employment association that helps millions of Indian women earn a living through local social enterprises. The second day began with a keynote presentation by Maxine B\u00e9dat, founder and Director of the New Standard Institute, on the important role of data and traceability in a sector that is increasingly regulated. Jacky Broomhead, Better Cotton\u2019s Senior Traceability Manager, took the stage shortly after to explain the potential of the organization\u2019s traceability system as a solution. They were joined by Erin Klett, Senior Director, Research &amp; Policy at Verit\u00e9, and Sarah Solomon, International Relations Officer at the U.S. Department of Labor, to discuss the upcoming rollout of the system and how it aligns with increasing legislation. A series of panel discussions followed, covering a variety of topics, from traceability pilot projects in India and the value of increased transparency for farmers to greenwashing and methods for measuring impact. A look at regenerative agriculture rounded out the event, beginning with a keynote from Felipe Villela, founder of reNature. Nathalie Ernst, Farm Sustainability Standards Manager at Better Cotton, and Emma Dennis, Senior Manager Sustainable Agricultural Practices, presented how this approach can benefit nature and society. Earlier, delegates heard from a group of farmers from India, Pakistan and the U.S. about how adopting regenerative practices has impacted their farms and misconceptions about their applicability. Alan McClay, Better Cotton\u2019s CEO, said, \u201cThis year\u2019s conference has been a resounding success. We\u2019ve heard from experts throughout fashion supply chains, from valued cotton farmers in our network right through to the brands and retailers that source their product. Discussions have reiterated the urgent action required to tackle the worst effects of the climate crisis, but there was also a clear consensus around the need to deliver profound impact at farm level. With a regenerative approach and this group of changemakers, we can push for social and environmental transformation.\u201d</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">OICOM-103497</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">OICOM2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:68JP-MWC1-DYSC-R37N-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">477070</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-23</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"606\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 EDM Publications GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>The Outdoor Industry Compass</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30681\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>Issue 4</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"26\" month=\"06\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>June 26, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DSD8</classCode><className>CLIMATE ACTION</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000310</classCode><className>CLIMATE CHANGE</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>STX000365</classCode><className>CONFERENCES &amp;

This calls for increasing agricultural productivity which is traditionally defined as producing more output (harvest) with the same input (area, soil, capital, labour) or the same output with less input. Economists refer to this as 'total factor productivity' (TFP), a widely employed metric for comparing agricultural efficiency among nations and measuring progress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, TFP fails to consider the long-term effects of current agricultural practices on soil, biodiversity, health and people. This is a massive flaw, as increasing short-term productivity may jeopardise conditions for future productivity in many ways. For example, the current use of intensive tilling methods can harm the soil; fertilisers may cause health issues; and the humus layer may deteriorate due to insufficient regeneration periods. By neglecting these concerns, TFP presents an incomplete picture.</p><p>For example, in the 1960s, India initiated the 'green revolution' in response to two famines. Geneticist M. S. Swaminathan spearheaded this effort, introducing high-yielding wheat and rice varieties in the western region of Punjab. This aimed to boost productivity, resulting in record-high output. India's 'green revolution' is praised for successfully feeding the growing population and reducing rural poverty.</p><p>Negative consequences of India's green revolution Decades later, however, the adverse effects are increasingly evident. Punjab, once known as the 'land of five rivers' is projected to transform into a desert within 25 years due to the water-intensive cultivation of rice. Continued soil degradation, declining health and reduced seed variety pose persistent challenges. Moreover, the climate crisis is making wet and dry seasons less predictable.</p><p>Severe social consequences ensued too. Farmers are forced to buy expensive genetically modified seeds and fertilisers from major corporations to grow crops on depleted soil. As a result, many of them have incurred substantial debts, leading to tens of thousands of suicides every year. Additionally, Punjab has gained notoriety as India's 'cancer capital' due to the widespread use of hazardous agrochemicals.</p><p>Despite all this, metrics such as TFP suggest that India's productivity increased following the green revolution. They focus on short-term economic output rather than long-term net gain for the planet and people and fail to take into account potential long-term destruction. However, if agricultural practices undermine the sustained productivity of nature or people, hindering people's ability to lead fulfilled and healthy lives, they should not be labelled as productive.</p><p>Productivity versus reproductivity</p><p>There is a growing consensus that a shift in perspective on agricultural productivity is necessary. Instead of focusing solely on short-term surpluses, we should assess how agricultural practices can be reproduced in the future. Therefore, it is more appropriate to consider the term 'reproductivity' rather than 'productivity'.</p><p>The conversation around agricultural productivity is shifting towards more sustainability. There is a growing interest in re-designing agricultural systems in the name of agroecology, permaculture, agroforestry and regenerative agriculture. Moreover, there is a strong emphasis on involving local communities in decision-making processes.</p><p>Measuring ecological and social sustainability</p><p>The challenging question is how to measure agricultural (re)productivity, regenerativity or sustainability. Obviously, it requires a much broader time frame, but quantifying long-term consequences is difficult due to the inaccuracy of current climate models. The complexity increases when considering long-term ecological and socio-economic effects.</p><p>However, farmers adopting more sustainable methods need to monitor progress. Data providers use modern technology to quantify soil functional biodiversity and the potential to store water and carbon. While quantifying soil biodiversity is rather complex, measuring above-ground biodiversity effects is even more difficult. It requires various data points, such as satellite data, bio-acoustics and samples from environmental DNA (eDNA). Making assumptions about future developments is also necessary.</p><p>Financing is crucial</p><p>Quantifying sustainable agriculture is essential for attracting financial rewards from political schemes, customers and investors. This is crucial because agricultural (re)productivity needs to be sustainable regarding finance too. Simply telling a farmer that a change in practices will start paying out in ten years, but will decrease yields for the next five years, is not a compelling argument without schemes guaranteeing compensation in the meantime.</p><p>Recent developments in the debate on payments for ecosystem services provide hope for innovative rewards for farmers adopting reproductive practices. However, we are still at the very beginning of a new productivity regime, and there is much work ahead. We can start by redefining India's green revolution not merely as a period of productivity gain but as a lesson on how not to measure agricultural productivity in the future.</p><p>Literature</p><p>Schragmann, H., 2024: Produktivit\u00e4t neu denken.

Through CRISPR gene-editing, it is possible to    deliver an improved plant that does not include DNA from a    different species - more quickly and efficiently than otherwise    possible in nature or through conventional breeding methods.     \"The power of CRISPR technology has incredible potential to    enable crop innovation to deliver value to farmers,\" says Gusui    Wu, Head of Global Seeds Research at Syngenta. \"The increased use    of CRISPR in agriculture can transform the way we approach plant    breeding, accelerating the discovery and deployment of    innovations that provide growers more productive and resilient    crops. We are inviting universities and academic institutions    from around the world to help us drive innovation to improve the    sustainability of agriculture.\"     As a leader in this wave of technological innovation, Syngenta    scientists have been continuously innovating to improve    CRISPR-Cas genome editing technologies. Syngenta's scientists    have engineered CRISPR Cas12a to increase both its efficiency as    well as utility, significantly optimizing it as a tool for crop    improvement.     Syngenta has long been open to sharing technology with public and    private entities, enabling straightforward, quick, and easy    access to its proprietary technologies for academic and    non-profit research use. One example is Syngenta's vegetable    licensing platform, which allows breeding companies and academic    institutes to access and breed with Syngenta germplasm.     The Shoots by Syngenta global innovation collaboration platform    was created in 2023 with a goal to create partnerships aimed at    finding solutions to some of the most complex challenges in food    and agriculture. It brings together the external innovation    ecosystem - comprising academics, research institutes, and other    entities - together with Syngenta's global network of more than    6,000 scientists, to develop solutions that mitigate climate    change, enhance biodiversity, and better serve smallholder as    well as large-scale farmers. The platform is built upon the    values of openness and transparency.     \"At Syngenta, we truly believe that collaboration accelerates    innovation,\" says Stuart Harrison, Head of Global Seeds R&amp;D    Partnerships. \"This new initiative has tremendous potential to    not only result in exciting technology innovations, but to also    drive critical crop solutions that will support farmers    worldwide.\"     Adrian Percy, Executive Director of the North Carolina Plant    Sciences Initiative, states: \"By accessing these innovative    technologies from Syngenta, the North Carolina Plant Sciences    Initiative and North Carolina State University can more broadly    accelerate its capabilities in genome editing.  We are excited    about the application of these technologies in our research    programs as they will certainly enable improvement to a variety    of crops to the benefit of the grower community.\"     A simple, streamlined process has been established for licensing    the technologies.

Sales for the first quarter 2024 were $7.4    billion, down $1.8 billion or 20 percent (-18% at CER), compared    to a strong first quarter 2023. First quarter 2024 EBITDA    decreased 34 percent (-26% at CER) from prior year to $1.2    billion.     Sales in the first quarter of 2024 continued to be impacted by    industry-wide channel destocking in Crop Protection as    distributors and retailers further reduced inventories in    response to the pressure to lower working capital in the higher    interest rate environment.     Given the current market environment, the Group remained focused    on measures to improve operational efficiency and productivity to    offset lower volumes and prices. EBITDA margin for the Group was    16.7 percent versus 20.2 percent in the first quarter 2023.

ADAMA also recorded a weaker first quarter compared to Q1 2023 in    a challenging environment for suppliers of post patent active    ingredients, with the business downturn in Asia Pacific    (excluding China) and Europe greatly affecting the comparison.     Syngenta Seeds overall was 8 percent lower than in the first    quarter last year but showed strong growth in Vegetables Seeds,    Flowers and in China.     Syngenta Group China saw a sales decline of 18 percent versus    last year's record first quarter. Its Seeds business maintained    its growth and the branded formulation crop protection business    showed further growth on the back of recently launched products.    The sales decline was partially offset by a better business mix    and cost reductions.

Syngenta Group China     Syngenta Group China sales were $2.7 billion, 18 percent lower.

In 2013,    Syngenta was one of the first companies in the industry to launch    a comprehensive sustainability plan. The \"Good Growth Plan\"    successfully served as the organization's sustainability compass.     The new priorities place sustainability at the core of the    company's strategy and demonstrate continued commitment to    sustainable innovation. This approach and clear targets help    integrate sustainability on a strategic and operational level    whilst creating long-term value:       * Priority 1: \"Higher yields, lower impact\" through the        acceleration of crop productivity in the agricultural sector,        while reducing the impact on the planet through more        sustainable technologies.      * Priority 2: \"Regenerate soil and nature\" by enabling the        adoption of regenerative agriculture practices to help        farmers improve productivity, soil health, biodiversity and        climate.      * Priority 3: \"Improve rural prosperity\" by focusing on the        prosperity of low-income and under-served farmers and their        access to inputs, knowledge, finance and markets.      * Priority 4: \"Sustainable operations\" by the means of reducing        the environmental impact of Syngenta Group's own operations        and the supply chain; strengthening a diverse and inclusive        culture and ensuring the health and safety of its employees.     The new priorities leverage the power of innovation, guide    investments and collaboration as well as add a new level of    transparency through a Portfolio Sustainability Framework (PSF).    To find out more about Syngenta Group's new sustainability    priorities, the specific targets and the PSF, please visit the    website Sustainability Priorities.     Today Syngenta Group also published the Syngenta Group and    Syngenta AG ESG reports for the year ended 31 December 2023.      Endnotes     For further information, see the reporting of financial results    for ADAMA Ltd. (SHE: 000553), Sinofert Holdings (SEHK: 0297),    Winall Hi-tech Seed (SHE: 300087), Yangnong Chemical (SHA:    600486) and Syngenta AG.     Unless otherwise mentioned, comparisons are to the same period in    2023. Certain amounts, including components of change (%), may    not add up due to rounding. The results presented in this release    are unaudited and a consolidation of the business units in the    Syngenta Group which includes Syngenta AG, Syngenta Group China,    ADAMA Ltd., Sinofert Holdings, Winall Hi-tech Seed and Yangnong    Chemical.     As a change to previous reporting, Yangnong Chemical sales have    been fully included within the Syngenta Group China results,    including exports, rather than partially appended in the Group's    Crop Protection units as previously presented. In addition, the    regional split of Syngenta Crop Protection, Syngenta Seeds, and    the sub business unit split of Syngenta Group China have been    amended to reflect a revised management structure and operating    model within these units. Comparative figures for 2023 have been    amended to reflect these changes on a consistent basis; total    sales are unchanged.     Results in this report from one period to another period are,    where appropriate, compared using constant exchange rates (CER).    To present that information, current period results for entities    reporting in currencies other than US dollars are converted into    US dollars at the prior period's exchange rates, rather than at    the exchange rates for the current year. The CER presentation    indicates the business performance before taking into account    currency exchange fluctuations.     EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and EBITDA as defined by Syngenta    Group may not be comparable to similarly described measures at    other companies. Syngenta Group has defined EBITDA as earnings    before interest, tax, non-controlling interests, depreciation,    amortization, restructuring and impairment. Information    concerning EBITDA has been included as it is used by management    and by investors as a supplementary measure of operating    performance. Syngenta Group excludes restructuring and impairment    from EBITDA to focus on results excluding items affecting    comparability from one period to the next.     EBITDA as used in this press release excludes one-time events;    other documents may treat this as an underlying or adjusted    EBITDA. EBITDA excludes other one-off or non-cash/non-operational    items that do not impact the ongoing performance of the business,    as well as the impact of a time-bound, Group launch long-term    incentive scheme for leadership.     When referred to as such, \"the Group\" implies Syngenta Group.

As we continuously track consumers and their evolving meat and poultry purchasing habits, it's important to remember consumers are managing these disruptions, too. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Midan Marketing, is a full-service U.S. marketing agency with clients around the world. Much of its work is focused on the meat industry and U.S. meat consumers. Drawing upon insights from the proprietary research and industry trends, it has identified key learnings vital to understanding consumers, their relationship with meat, and how marketing impacts their meat and poultry purchases. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> There's no question that meat continues to play a vital role in consumers' lives globally. So, as Midan continues to support animal production, it's also imperative to track consumer needs and sentiments to show that meat offers a healthy, nutritious solution to justify keeping meat front and center in consumers' choices and lives. </p><p> The Global Food and Agriculture Network in Switzerland has concluded that meat plays a vital role in health, environmental, and socioeconomic relationships. Reducing meat consumption may put nutrient security at risk, especially in underdeveloped regions. Livestock remains the most viable option for producing high-quality human-edible food, while ruminants optimize crop agriculture and return captured nutrients to the natural cycle. They also found that as recently as 2017, 40% of the world couldn't afford the cheapest basket that meets individual nutrition requirements, including animal-sourced protein (1). </p><p> Globally, an average of 86% of most major populated countries eat meat as part of their diet (2). As the population is expected to grow by 11% by 2030, the UN Food and Agriculture Organization projects a 14% increase in global meat protein consumption, with poultry representing 41%, followed by beef at 20% (3). The most growth will be in Africa, Asia, the Pacific, and Latin America. Developing regions will see increased meat consumption, with higher-income areas leaning into higher-valued cuts and proteins. In high-income countries, meat consumption will stabilize due to consumer preferences and slowing population growth.  </p><p> Expanding animal production and human-managed livestock systems must be part of the solution for environmental sustainability and feeding the growing global population despite increasing concerns about meat consumption and production worldwide.  </p><p> The value of meat consumer segmentation in the USA</p><p> Consumer segmentation involves surveying a representative sample of consumers to create distinct groups with common attitudes and habits. These groupings help tailor products and marketing that cater to consumers' specific needs and preferences. By dividing the market into segments based on demographics, psychographics and behaviors, the company gains deeper insights into customer motivations and purchasing decisions. </p><p> Midan conducted its first U.S. meat consumer segmentation study in 2016, regularly updating it to adapt to the evolving meat industry. The latest update, Meat Consumer Segmentation 3.0, released in August 2023, revealed the following meat consumer groups: </p><p> - Connected Trendsetters (14%): Meat is their main dish, but they have eclectic tastes. They are interested in all types of proteins, appreciate novelty, and are willing to experiment with different proteins and specialty meat attributes. </p><p> - Claim Seekers (24%): They pay careful attention to what they eat. They want meat and poultry that is healthy for their bodies but also deliver on animal welfare and come from brands/companies that protect the environment and practice sustainable agriculture. </p><p> - Convenience Cravers (17%): Due to their busy and active lives, they prefer food that is convenient and can be cooked quickly, affordably, and on the go.  </p><p> - Committed Carnivores (23%): They enjoy the taste of meat and poultry and take pride in cooking from scratch and preparing home-cooked meals but aren't interested in claims. </p><p> - Classic Palates (22%): Meat is the staple of their mealtime routine, and they cannot imagine ever giving up its unique taste. Habit drives their purchase behavior, and they are unwilling to take chances on new cuts or products. </p><p> The emerging importance of Millennials and younger Generation Z </p><p> Along with identifying meat consumer segments, our recent research helped us highlight key learnings about two important generations of meat eaters: Millennials and Gen Zs.  </p><p> Millennials (27-43 years of age) consume more protein than the general meat eater, with meat and poultry as their primary proteins. They spend $8,463 on food at home and $1,000 on meat per household annually but are more budget-conscious due to high debt (4). </p><p> About half of Gen Z (12-26 years of age) are in adulthood and making their own meat purchasing decisions. Spending $5,529 on food at home and $729 on meat per household annually, they are adventurous eaters who explore vegetables and plant proteins (4). </p><p> While this gap in spending between Millennials and Gen Zs is significant, the life stages of these two generations are quite different, which accounts for the higher spending among Millennials. However, despite their generational differences, both cohorts share similar concerns about animal care, nutrition and the environment, and prefer online shopping. </p><p> What today's U.S. consumers look for at the meat case </p><p> Despite inflation raising price consciousness and preference for more affordable alternatives, our proprietary research and market trends indicate U.S. consumers still find value in quality, claims, brands, and nutrition/health. U.S. consumers identify these as the most important factors when choosing packaged beef (5): </p><p> - Price and quality: More than half report price as a top influencer. </p><p> - Brands and raising claims: About a quarter value brands and claims related to raising practices, such as no antibiotics ever, animal welfare, organic or grass-fed. </p><p> - Nutrition: Consumers find value in meat cuts that fit health-focused lifestyles. </p><p> - Environmental claims: While only 8% prioritize it, 3 in 10 look for sustainability-related claims when buying meat. For Connected Trendsetters, 2 in 3 seek climate-friendly claims. </p><p> To balance cost and value, 76% of American consumers are changing their meat shopping habits, including the amount, type (beef, pork, chicken), cuts, brands, and purchase locations (6). U.S. consumers also trust brands and their transparency: 68% of consumers and 75% of 18 to 34-year-olds say brand trust is more important today. Additionally, 94% are more likely to stay loyal to brands with complete transparency (8). </p><p> Despite lower U.S. beef inflation compared to the overall food category, consumers still feel the pinch when buying meat. Over the past year, the gap between quality and price at the meat case closed. In 2022, 60% said quality was most important, while 48% said price. By 2023, the gap narrowed with 53% naming quality and 50% price per pound (6). </p><p> Transparency on origin and claims shapes consumer choices </p><p> Today's consumers seek transparency to make better choices. More than ever, U.S. consumers want the production story behind their meat and state they will pay a premium for it. In 2022, 72% considered transparency extremely important or important, up from 69% in 2018. In the U.S., 63% of meat consumers want to know where their food comes from (6). Globally, 55% value more transparency about food safety (9), and 73% would pay more for products that are completely transparent (8). Specifically, 64% look for products that are \"better for\" themselves, farmers, the planet, and animals, seeking claims related to health, sustainability, and animal welfare (6). Consumers also factor raising claims into value equations, with 21% considering them a top influencer when purchasing beef (5). These claims detail how the animal was raised, what it ate, and how it was cared for, and include grass-fed, organic, humanely raised, and antibiotic- or hormone-related claims. </p><p> In the U.S., more consumers are embracing meat's role in their diets (6). We also see this trend globally, as 79% of consumers believe wellness is important, and 45% consider meat a top priority. Globally, consumers define wellness as better health, fitness, nutrition, appearance, sleep, and mindfulness. They will also spend more on products and services that promote better health (7). </p><p> Unlike plant-based alternatives, meat provides a single, whole ingredient without processing or fillers. To tell this story, marketing messages and packaging should highlight meat's nutritional benefits. Four in ten adults want more protein in their diets (9). Consumers also associate meat as a good protein source compared to other proteins (10). On average, 63% try to eat balanced, healthy meals - this number jumps to 80% in health-focused segments like Connected Trendsetters and Claim Seekers. </p><p>U.S. consumers link sustainability to health and animal welfare </p><p> Sustainability is a top-of-mind issue for many consumers, influencing 54% of meat purchases and 68% of non-grocery item purchases (11). When buying meat, 32% of consumers specifically seek sustainability claims (6).  </p><p> Some consumers who associate sustainability with health are shifting from Flexitarian to Regeneratarian diets. A Flexitarian diet reduces animal protein consumption for environmental reasons. Regeneratarians (or \"Regenivores\") focus on foods that heal the planet through carbon-reduction farming, increased animal welfare, and understanding food provenance. While only 19% of Americans are familiar with regenerative agriculture, more than one in three view regeneratively grown food as more nutritious than conventionally grown (12).  </p><p> Consumers want to know their meat is sourced from well-treated animals and connect animal welfare to factors like living conditions and diet. Four in 10 look for animal welfare claims and associate them with quality. Also, 31% specifically seek packaging claims related to better animal treatment, and 30% view \"humanely raised\" as a quality indicator (6). </p><p> In a Midan survey about sustainably raised meat labels, U.S. consumers' top responses were about animal welfare. Nearly half associated it with being raised without antibiotics/hormones and better animal welfare. A third connected the claim to meat's carbon footprint and waste reduction (11). These results emphasize the importance of including animal welfare in consumer sustainability messaging. </p><p> In 2018, California passed Prop 12, which mandates minimum space requirements for veal calves, breeding pigs, and laying hens and bans the use of gestation crates (13). The law, which went into full effect at the end of 2023, applies not only to pork producers within the state but also to pork products sold in California. This puts consumer and economic pressure on producers, grocers, and brands nationwide to adopt Prop 12 standards. Massachusetts, Ohio, Minnesota, Maine, Rhode Island, and Colorado are making similar moves. For example, Denver, Colorado, faces a proposed ballot initiative to ban slaughterhouses within city limits, potentially affecting the main U.S. lamb-packing facility if the ballot is passed. </p><p> How consumers are responding to meat alternatives </p><p> From 2018 to 2020, volume sales of refrigerated plant-based meat alternative proteins in the U.S. fell by 14.5%, and dollar sales fell by 13.5% year-over-year (6). Only 31% of consumers have tried plant-based meat alternatives, and just 10% eat it regularly. Connected Trendsetters (25%) are more likely to eat it regularly, followed by Convenience Cravers (14%) and Claim Seekers (12%) (14). </p><p> While their novelty and sales growth have faded, we can learn from Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods' well-executed branding, and focus consumer messaging on sustainability and nutrition. </p><p> Recently, Upside Foods became the first U.S. company to receive clearance for cell-based chicken meat. It's now available at select restaurants and is anticipated to hit grocery store shelves soon. Consumer sentiment reveals that 26% are aware of cell-based meat, 16% would probably or definitely buy it, and 49% of Connected Trendsetters are likely to try it. However, those open to trying it have concerns associated with the health, animal welfare, or sustainability of eating authentic meat (14). </p><p> Based on the indications of these trends and insights, it appears that both U.S. and global meat consumers are evolving as different needs and priorities rise to the forefront. Understanding consumers and their purchase drivers is the only way for the protein industry to compete with and win against emerging meat alternatives and keep consumers buying and enjoying meat as an everyday part of their plates and their lives. </p><p> References: </p><p> 1.

Following its recent    registration in Great Britain, farmers in more than 55 countries    globally are now able to access this powerful fungicide, with    strong sales across continents reflecting farmer demand for    effective control of a broad range of crop diseases. The company    is on track to achieve one billion US dollars in sales of    products containing ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology, marking the first time    its active ingredient achieves this milestone in only eight    years.     \"ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology is a game-changer for modern agriculture    and enables farmers to grow crops more sustainably,\" said Ioana    Tudor, Global Head of Marketing at Syngenta Crop Protection. \"It    represents a significant milestone in our efforts to secure high    yields with low impact to the planet and is exciting because of    its high levels of consistency and effectiveness. We're very    proud that our innovation is delivering such impact.\"     Worldwide, farmers lose an estimated 10-23 percent of their crops    to fungal diseases each year. An additional 10-20 percent is lost    post-harvest. In the top five most important calorie crops -    rice, wheat, corn, soybeans and potatoes - fungal infections have    been estimated to cause yield losses that could feed at least 600    million people every day for a year.     ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology offers a new solution that effectively    fights fusarium head blight in wheat, which produces mycotoxins    that contaminate harvests and threaten human and animal health.    In addition, it offers a step-change in performance against a    wide spectrum of other important diseases, such as septoria in    wheat and net blotch in barley. ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology is    registered in more than 100 crops including corn, soybean,    peanuts, vegetables, potatoes, grapes, tomatoes and fruit crops.     ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology embodies Syngenta's commitment to    sustainable innovation, core to its new Group-wide sustainability    priorities announced in April. The effectiveness and long-lasting    activity of the^technology enable low use rates and potentially    fewer sprays especially in leaf spot diseases, while safeguarding    beneficial organisms. It is also an important tool for resistance    management. The technology works by inhibiting the activity of an    enzyme that is essential for fungal respiration, starving the    fungi from the energy they need to survive. It is designed to    adhere to the plant surface and to penetrate rapidly through the    leaf surface - creating a reservoir of active ingredient in the    waxy layer of the plant tissue that enables even distribution and    long-lasting protection as the plant grows.     The technology further highlights Syngenta's success with the    SDHI (Succinate dehydrogenase inhibitor) mode of action and the    company's ability to effectively design active ingredients that    address various farmer challenges. Following its first SDHI seed    treatment sedaxane, Syngenta launched its SDHI fungicide    isopyrazam which transformed farmers' ability to control sheath    blight in rice, and later SOLATENOL^\\xAE technology to protect crops    against septoria and rusts. In Brazil, SOLATENOL^\\xAE technology is    today regarded as crucial in farmers' fight against soybean pod    anomaly - a new fungal disease which spread within just three    years to 12 states across the country since it was first    identified.     Beyond innovation in research and development, Syngenta's success    is underpinned by its commitment to invest in cutting-edge    manufacturing operations. Strong global demand has fueled    investments aimed at increasing the efficiency of manufacturing    of ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology. These set the foundation for the    production of a growing portfolio of formulations containing    ADEPIDYN^\\xAE technology that target specific grower needs in    different markets.     The latest Syngenta innovation in the SDHI family is TYMIRIUM^\\xAE    technology, which was launched globally in 2022. In addition to    protecting crops against key fungal diseases, TYMIRIUM^\\xAE    technology provides broad-spectrum protection against    plant-parasitic nematodes that reduce global crop yield by an    estimated 12 percent a year.

The Prime Minister is a strong supporter. Here, cell cultivation is a key pillar in the transition to alternative proteins. It is a new agricultural sector that allows animal proteins and fats to be produced outside the animal. This new sector will complement conventional animal farming based on whole animals. Optimizing the food system by farming with fewer animals but with better management and based on regenerative agriculture and the farm to fork strategy in Europe is at the heart of what the cultivators are doing. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The government understands the importance of developing cellular agriculture, which has arisen for two main reasons. First and most obviously: sustainability. We have reached the maximum capacity for agriculture based on the farming of whole animals - in terms of land usage, water impact, ethics, public health, zoonotic diseases, antibiotics, and antimicrobial resistance. These factors are being discussed and evaluated globally, and provide the framework for bringing cultivated products to consumers' plates. But there is more to it than mere food production and the oft-discussed benefits for our environment. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Beyond sustainability </p><p> Growing cells outside the animal and in a controlled environment is also a means to diversify the supply of animal proteins and fats. In Israel, 88% of beef is imported because we have neither the land nor the water required. That's a challenge we share with our neighbors in the Middle East and North Africa. We suffer from the same lack of water and arable land - which makes us extensive importers of beef and other foodstuffs. </p><p> Let\u00b4s look at it from another angle: When the war in Ukraine started, wheat was used as a weapon to put pressure on Western countries. We saw similar food-related geopolitical issues between the US and China concerning beef. In June 2022, Malaysian authorities banned the export of chicken to Singapore. I was there and experienced the impact of these dependencies. They are global in scale and represent a perpetual threat. </p><p> Independence way </p><p> Food dependency is a major security issue. It is becoming more and more relevant in terms of food sovereignty and food security. Countries that mainly rely on importing food are trying to play a bigger role on the production side. They want to gain more sovereignty over the food they consume by diversifying and controlling the supply. That is true for the Middle East and for Asia. </p><p> Collaboration around food security will be one of the main topics at COP28 in Dubai and it will play a role in better structuring the geopolitical bonds and the regional collaboration between the countries. Soon this evolving form of collaboration will play the same role for security within countries as military security does at present. </p><p> European limitations </p><p> Europe has always been an agricultural superpower which produces a great deal of products for the global market. This is a key factor behind the decision to prioritize the development of alternative proteins. Other regions such as the Middle East and some parts of Asia have historically only had scarce resources. But a change is under way in western regions. Take the resource of water, for instance. Spain has become the largest dessert in Europe. One fifth of the country today is a \"dry\" area. 80 per cent of the country's water is used for agriculture. Limits have been imposed on the export of fruits from Spain to France, as growing them consumes so much water. Hence, Spain is exporting the water it badly needs itself. </p><p> Agriculturally powerful countries are increasingly discussing restricting the export of certain products to avoid these kinds of \"outflows\". The lack of water and the change in climate patterns in France, for instance, have made it increasingly difficult to continue normal agricultural activity there. Furthermore, France does not have enough animal feed for its cattle. The Netherlands has started to reduce its numbers of cattle. In Europe, there is an increasing need to find other ways to make food which requires less water and uses less land. Cellular agriculture, which consumes 78 per cent less water and 95 per cent less land, represents a solution which has not been given enough consideration to date. </p><p> Soil for food </p><p> But we are not only talking about the lack of water and issues arising from climate change in general. We are also talking about soil conservation - and the establishment of regenerative agriculture. Soil is a primary basis for food in the world. The Farm to Fork Strategy is calling for the use of fewer resources in agriculture. The aim is to create lower-input forms of agriculture and achieve a 25 per cent share of organic farming within agricultural production. Farmers need to use less fertilizer, less insecticide and so on. At the same time there are discussions about lowering agricultural output and the need to substitute areas of production by importing food. This discussion could lead to reduced crop production levels in the European Union. </p><p> Regenerative animal Ag </p><p> Luckily, it is possible to retain more or less the same output if we move to regenerative fruits, vegetables and crops cultivated using certain techniques and certain alternatives. But there is no good solution for regenerative animal agriculture. If we wanted to achieve this, we would need to use up to 80 times more land per animal. Hence, regenerative animal ag will not feed the world. We need to find other solutions for making alternative animal proteins and fats. What we must keep in mind is that this will not be a threat to agriculture. Especially not within the next decade or two. The idea is to complement conventional agriculture rather than replace it. We will probably start with facilities which are not based on farms. This will give us better control, as we need to optimize the process, reduce the costs, and make sure we improve the technologies. As we continue to standardize the production processes, this will make it replicable at smaller scales. But livestock farmers will certainly be involved in the longer-term vision. They should not fear the new technologies. Growing cells is not too different from making yogurt. Many farmers will definitely be able to contribute to cellular agriculture. But cultivated meat is a long-term venture. It will take time to see the impact. Innovation will not change the whole system overnight. We need to be patient. </p><p> \"Food dependency is becoming an ever more sensitive issue in terms of food sovereignty and food security.\" </p><p> \"There is no good solution which could help regenerative animal ag to feed the world.\" </p><h>Didier Toubia</h><p>Didier Toubia is is the CEO and Co-Founder of Aleph Farms.

Its aims are to enhance the sustainability, food security and animal welfare of food systems. It does so by diversifying the supply and decentralizing the production of quality animal proteins and fats as a complement to sustainable animal agriculture. The company is working on different applications for cells, with cultivated meat being one of them. There are additional products, including a platform for making collagen from cells. This can then be used in food and cosmetics for pharmaceutical purposes or in the production of leather. Aleph Farms has filed dossiers for regulatory approval in Singapore, the UK, Switzerland, and Israel, where they recently acquired an existing production facility and where they are planning to transfer their production at the beginning of 2024. Another facility in Singapore will follow at the end of this year. They hope to receive regulatory approval in both Israel and Singapore this year and are in contact with the FDA in the United States to start the approval process there in the near future. </p><p> Foundation: 2017 </p><p> Founders: Didier Toubia, Shulamit Levenberg </p><p> Products: cultivated thin-cut beef steak in 2018, cultivated ribeye steak in 2021, and cultivated collagen in 2022 </p><p> Brands: Aleph Cuts (Black Angus cow) </p><p> Registered office: Rehovot, HaMerkaz, Israel</p><p> Investors and capital: Six founding rounds with 22 investors and 5 lead investors (amongst others: Markus Samuelsson or Leonardo DiCaprio) </p><p> Total funding: 119,4 Mio.

Its makers explain that regenerative agriculture can stop global warming and even fuel a process of global cooling. The project not only includes a film and a book; it is also backed by a civil society movement. This item is the sixth in this year's summer special with reviews of artists' works with developmental relevance.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Industrial agriculture has been a credo of most rich industrialised countries since the 1950s. In North and South America, it accounts for the vast majority of farms. Agricultural areas there typically feature farms geared to mass production, with thousands of animals kept indoors and sprawling mono\u00adcultures maintained by chemicals. Even among development policymakers, there are still some who advocate this method as a model for agriculture in Africa or Latin America - although it should be common knowledge by now that industrial agriculture is harmful to the environment, the climate and human health.</p><p>But one of the main arguments still rolled out is that industrial agriculture is the only way to feed the growing world population. The documentary 'Kiss the ground' dispels this myth once and for all. The filmmakers point out that industrial agriculture destroys valuable humus, which acts as a natural carbon sink. In the long run, they explain, that leads to dead soil - soil that can only produce a crop with the help of agricultural chemicals.</p><p>The devastating consequences are already apparent. Two-thirds of the Earth's land area has already turned into desert. Although the film presents horrifying images of dry, dusty fields and parched land, its message is by no means all doom and gloom. It gives plenty of hope - and astonishes the viewer. Desertification can be reversed by a different approach to farming: regenerative agriculture. The film shows examples in many parts of the world where it has worked. The most impressive involves a programme in China where an area the size of Belgium has been regenerated.</p><p>Footage from 1994 shows a hilly desert-like landscape and a desperately poor local population with precious little to eat and no educational opportunities for their children. Within 15 years, the area was transformed into a verdant landscape with a huge diversity of plants and trees. Millions of people have been lifted out of poverty, and local communities can now live on the crops they grow. And - the film points out - their children today attend the best universities in the country.</p><p>According to the filmmakers, all this is possible with the help of regenerative agriculture. The approach is based on a set of four principles:</p><p>no tilling to avoid erosion,</p><p>maintenance of a permanent green cover of diverse plants and trees,</p><p>green manuring, using cover crops that are incorporated into the soil as shallowly as possible and as deeply as necessary to 'feed' soil life and 'rejuvenate' the substrate, and</p><p>controlled grazing by hoofed animals, because grazing is vital to maintain and preserve grasses.</p><p>Advocates claim that regenerative agriculture restores the microbial processes - and thus the life - in the soil that tilling and chemicals destroyed. The soil is restored to health. Crops grown in it have a high nutrient content. Another fantastic effect, according to the makers of 'Kiss the ground', is that regenerative farming takes CO2 out of the atmosphere and stores it in soil and vegetation. This makes it possible, they say, to stop global warming within a relatively short time and even start cooling the climate down again within around 20 years. Climate activists also support the regenerative approach - which, among other things, is part of 'Drawdown', a project founded by American environmentalist Paul Hawken to identify and promote the most substantive carbon-reduction solutions.</p><p>In typical American style, the documentary 'Kiss the ground' couches its message in simple, emotive language - which may not appeal to all viewers. But this fact - and the choice of well-known US actor Woody Harrelson as narrator - will help the filmmakers reach a broad and perhaps less aware audience. And that is absolutely necessary and important.</p><p>Film</p><p>Kiss the ground, 2020, USA, directed by Rebecca Harrell Tickell and Joshua Tickell.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://kissthegroundmovie.com\">https://kissthegroundmovie.com</url></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://kisstheground.comA\">https://kisstheground.comA</url></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1908202100001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:63DK-4801-F00C-62MR-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2021-08-20</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"757\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"19\" month=\"08\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>August 19, 2021 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

Syngenta is the only company within the    agricultural sector to be included in the latest EPA's National    Top 100 List of top users of green power from the Green Power    Partnership.      This recognition marks the latest milestone in the company's    actions to decarbonize its operations globally. Dr. Tom Gray,    Head of Active Ingredient Strategy and Operations at Syngenta    Group, said: \"We are proud to be recognized by the U.S.    Environmental Protection Agency for being a leader in the green    power market. The implementation of our global strategy for    sourcing renewable electricity is well underway, and we are    working hard to decarbonize further and improve the energy    efficiency of our operations. We are also collaborating closely    with our partners throughout our global supply chain to decrease    our entire carbon footprint.\"      The St. Gabriel production site is one of Syngenta's global    manufacturing centers of excellence equipped to handle highly    complex processes and meet the most stringent production and    quality standards. The site consumes more than 150 million kWh of    energy annually - equivalent to the annual electricity use of    14,000 homes in the country. Through the purchase of Renewable    Energy Certificates, Syngenta's site demonstrates that it sources    100 percent of its electrical energy from renewable sources such    as wind and solar - fully offsetting its electricity consumption    from fossil fuel-based sources.      Program Manager of EPA's Green Power Partnership James    Critchfield said: \"This list of the largest users of green power    across the nation is proof that good business practices can also    benefit the environment. EPA applauds the leading organizations    in the Green Power Partnership's Top Partner Rankings for their    notable commitment to expanding their use of green power and    protecting the environment.\"      Globally, Syngenta has also invested significantly at its other    production sites, as part of its published commitment to reduce    carbon emissions by 2030. In Switzerland, Syngenta's production    site in Monthey uses hydropower for a sizeable portion of the    site's electricity needs and generates the equivalent of half its    steam consumption by recovering heat from household waste    incineration. In 2023, Syngenta's Monthey site was awarded the    \"Go Carbon Free\" label by the Carbon Free Valais Foundation, in    recognition of its efforts to reduce its carbon footprint.      In Brazil, Syngenta's R&amp;D and manufacturing sites for its crop    protection and seeds businesses - also source 100 percent of    their electricity needs from renewable sources. This was achieved    alongside comprehensive efforts aimed at reducing water    consumption and waste generation, and at long-term net-zero    energy sourcing.      In China, the Kunshan manufacturing site emerged as Syngenta    Group China's first carbon-neutral facility after Beijing Green    Exchange, a platform for carbon emission trading in China,    awarded it in July for fully offsetting its carbon emissions    generated from its operations. The site is implementing    continuous improvements such as real-time monitoring of    electricity usage, alongside upgrading equipment to be more    energy efficient.      \"Syngenta is fully committed to a long-term journey to reduce    greenhouse gas emissions in the running of our operations,\" said    Gray. \"This is a key focus area for us, even as we drive    innovation to enable farmers to adapt to climate change and    increase the sustainability of agriculture. To this end, we have    invested in building an internal function focused solely on    Sustainable Operations, which will drive these and other    initiatives designed to reduce both our own emissions and those    of our value chain.\"      About Syngenta Group     Syngenta Group is one of the world's biggest agricultural    technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.

These collaborations, which connect    expertise across industries and sectors, are aimed at making    possible novel solutions to agricultural challenges more quickly    and efficiently.     Two collaborations - with IBM Research and with US    biotech Maxygen - brought their respective pioneering approaches    in data-based predictions modelling, and in the directed    evolution of proteins more commonly leveraged in the    pharmaceutical industry, together with Syngenta's world-leading    agricultural research and proprietary data sets.     \"Helping growers sustainably feed a rapidly growing human    population requires a strong collaboration focus, not just across    agriculture but across industries,\" said Gusui Wu, Global Head of    Seeds Research. \"Collaboration is at the heart of how our    scientists approach innovation every day. It is embedded in our    scientific culture, and we are continually seeking out different    technologies, solutions, and partners to help us better serve    farmers.\"      IBM Research and Syngenta accelerate optimization of chemical    compound synthesis with language models.     Syngenta Group, in collaboration with IBM Research, has enhanced    productivity in chemical synthesis using IBM-RXN - a software    developed to enable the use of language models for the synthesis    of new molecules and materials. IBM-RXN encodes, models, and    predicts chemical reactivity. By combining Syngenta's    world-leading chemistry research and proprietary data sets with    IBM's world-class reactivity modelling capabilities and    leveraging Natural Language Processing (NLP), IBM's pioneering    modelling approach, enables the partners to deliver scalable,    accurate, and data-based predictions modelling. This enables    Syngenta to investigate multiple related compounds simultaneously    and prioritize routes that offer compounds with the most    desirable commercial attributes.     Syngenta is closing the data loop by connecting the IBM-RXN    platform to the synthesis platform. Reactivity predictions are    now an integral part of the design of synthetic procedures. The    models' outcomes are fully integrated with synthesis planning and    execution, establishing a virtual loop where high-quality data    generate more relevant models that, in turn, inspire better    synthetic procedures. The digitalization of synthetic workflows    and the adoption of predictive reactivity modelling are    increasing the efficiency and the effectiveness of the synthetic    process. Both teams worked on extending reactivity modelling to    include bio-catalyzed reactions and metabolic transformations, to    support the design of more sustainable synthetic procedures that    have a better safety and environmental footprint.     As the predictive power of reactivity models increases,    scientists may become increasingly confident in delegating part    of their work to AI-enabled automation. This should allow    shifting the focus to the synthesis strategy and overall chemical    design.      Syngenta collaborates with Maxygen to optimize molecular enabling    technology.     US biotech, Maxygen, which specializes in the directed evolution    of proteins, is collaborating with Syngenta Seeds to optimize its    enabling technologies.     Since the collaboration launched, one of the success factors has    been the consistent and robust level of scientific engagement on    both sides. Both Maxygen and Syngenta adopted an open collegiate    approach from the start, with Syngenta giving the collaboration a    high-priority status as part of its core portfolio, enabling the    project to progress swiftly.     The teams from Syngenta and Maxygen met frequently to review    results, manage decision-making, adjust plans, and mark progress    milestones. This approach has delivered success resulting in    protein variants with highly improved attributes and the subject    of novel intellectual property.     Seeking new collaborators to six challenges     Shoots by Syngenta spotlights specific innovation needs from    across the Syngenta Crop Protection and Seeds businesses.    Science-based innovation challenges are posted on its website    (ShootsBySyngenta.com), inviting anyone with a scientific    interest to submit proposals in response. Proposals are quickly    evaluated, and if there is a mutual fit, progressed to a    collaboration partnership to take forward the research or    technology that might eventually be licensed.     Currently, Shoots by Syngenta lists six challenges, ranging from    identifying new chemical building blocks derived from biomass    waste streams, to developing diagnostic tools for detecting    non-visible indicators of poor crop growth.     \"We're looking forward to connecting with new partners from    academia, research institutes, start-ups, and cross-industry    sectors, to work with our extensive global network of scientists    and to push the boundaries of what is known today in science,\"    said Camilla Corsi, Syngenta's Global Head of Crop Protection    Research. \"We're proud of our strong reputation as a collaborator    of choice and are excited about the potential of the Shoots by    Syngenta platform to generate new possibilities to benefit    farmers and agriculture.\"     About Syngenta Group     Syngenta Group is one of the world's biggest agricultural    technology companies, with roots going back more than 250 years.

See Endnotes for further information.  Syngenta Crop Protection  Syngenta Crop Protection sales in the first quarter 2024 fell by 24 percent to $3.2 billion compared with a very strong first quarter 2023. All regions saw a decline in sales, except China, where sales grew 14 percent, mainly driven by strong momentum in Biologicals, continued outstanding performance of the ADEPIDYN\u00ae technology and the launch of TYMIRIUM\u00ae technology. North America sales were 44% lower as customers delayed purchasing towards the start of the planting season. Sales in Asia, the Middle East &amp; Africa were 24 percent lower; Europe sales were 28 percent lower. In Latin America, sales were 1 percent lower. In Q1 2024, Syngenta received the re-registration for 15 years in EU for trinexapac, offering farmers long-lasting growth regulation as well as best storage protection for cereal crops. Generally, in Europe, issues in farmer profitability drove cautious purchasing behavior.  ADAMA ADAMA sales declined 16 percent to $1.1 billion in the first quarter 2024. \u00a0 Sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle East were 15 percent lower; Latin America declined 18 percent. North America decreased by 9 percent; Asia Pacific (excluding China) decreased 24 percent; sales in China were 16 percent lower. In the first quarter of 2024, ADAMA launched an innovative herbicide solution to control glyphosate-tolerant Palmer amaranth in the US states Nebraska and Colorado. The product received an emergency exemption from the US Environmental Protection Agency following the pressing need for a sugar beet herbicide solution. Syngenta Seeds  First quarter sales of Syngenta Seeds were $1.4 billion, 8 percent lower, with sales and earnings growth in China and Vegetables and Flowers offsetting particularly lower sales in Asia, the Middle East and Africa. Field crop sales in Europe declined 5 percent; North America fell 7 percent; Brazil Region grew 2 percent, while sales in Latin America North &amp; South were 18 percent lower; Asia, Middle East &amp; Africa decreased 51 percent, while sales in China grew 25 percent. Sales of Vegetable Seeds increased by 10 percent and sales of Flowers were 5 percent higher. In the first quarter of 2024, Syngenta completed the acquisition of Dafeng Seed in China, greatly enhancing its corn portfolio. In Brazil, Syngenta Seeds Field Crops announced the acceleration of its franchise model, thereby creating a more direct, demand-generating presence in the field with farmers. In Europe, the company launched the first Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus resistant barley hybrid, helping farmers to control the disease without the need for neonic seed treatments. Syngenta Vegetable Seeds inaugurated an expanded R&amp;D facility in El Ejido, Spain, and a new state-of-the-art Seed Health Lab in Hyderabad, India. These strategic facilities enhance Syngenta?s ability to respond faster to the needs of farmers with innovative, high-quality vegetable seeds. Syngenta Vegetable Seeds also signed an exclusive global licensing partnership with Emerald Seed Company, strengthening Syngenta?s portfolio in onion seeds, one of the most important crops globally. Syngenta Group China  Syngenta Group China sales were $2.7 billion, 18 percent lower. The robust growth in branded formulations, seeds, and bio-fertilizers was offset by a significant year-on-year price decline and a strategic scaling back of grain trading operations. Sales of Seeds grew 25 percent. Sales of Branded Formulation were 3 percent higher. Sinofert sales were 4 percent lower. Yangnong Chemical was 32 percent lower. MAP sales declined 8 percent, while the farm service business continued its upward trajectory. Grain trading business sales were 55% lower. Based on the 2023 TYMIRIUM\u00ae technology approval in China, the company continued the roll-out of innovative and highly effective nematicides and fungicides containing this ingredient. It offers a soil-applied solution that will provide early protection in a wide range of crops and is compatible with multiple application methods. Sinofert also launched three new bio-fertilizer products with bio-fertilizer sales increasing 19% year-on-year.

In 2013, Syngenta was one of the first companies in the industry to launch a comprehensive sustainability plan. The \"Good Growth Plan\" successfully served as the organization?s sustainability compass.

(SHE: 000553), Sinofert Holdings (SEHK: 0297), Winall Hi-tech Seed (SHE: 300087), Yangnong Chemical (SHA: 600486) and Syngenta AG. Unless otherwise mentioned, comparisons are to the same period in 2023. Certain amounts, including components of change (%), may not add up due to rounding. The results presented in this release are unaudited and a consolidation of the business units in the Syngenta Group which includes Syngenta AG, Syngenta Group China, ADAMA Ltd., Sinofert Holdings, Winall Hi-tech Seed and Yangnong Chemical.  As a change to previous reporting, Yangnong Chemical sales have been fully included within the Syngenta Group China results, including exports, rather than partially appended in the Group?s Crop Protection units as previously presented. In addition, the regional split of Syngenta Crop Protection, Syngenta Seeds, and the sub business unit split of Syngenta Group China have been amended to reflect a revised management structure and operating model within these units. Comparative figures for 2023 have been amended to reflect these changes on a consistent basis; total sales are unchanged. Results in this report from one period to another period are, where appropriate, compared using constant exchange rates (CER). To present that information, current period results for entities reporting in currencies other than US dollars are converted into US dollars at the prior period's exchange rates, rather than at the exchange rates for the current year. The CER presentation indicates the business performance before taking into account currency exchange fluctuations. EBITDA is a non-GAAP measure and EBITDA as defined by Syngenta Group may not be comparable to similarly described measures at other companies.

Information concerning EBITDA has been included as it is used by management and by investors as a supplementary measure of operating performance. Syngenta Group excludes restructuring and impairment from EBITDA to focus on results excluding items affecting comparability from one period to the next.

Liesl Truscott, director of industry accountability and insights at Textile Exchange, assesses the agreement for the fashion, textile and apparel industries in a statement on the Textile Exchange website. Textile Exchange sees the COP15 agreement as the second pillar of a complete transformation of the global economy, which interacts and is mutually dependent on the CO2 reductions agreed upon in Paris: to achieve net-zero climate targets, it is essential to work for biodiversity and net-zero in turn opens the door for nature. For many companies, climate risk has permeated the boardroom and has become part of the conversation with shareholders, investors and other stakeholders. </p><p>This emphasis on climate may have led to \u201ccarbon tunnel vision,\u201d but it has gotten things moving for nature in general, Truscott says. The task now is to advance corporate disclosure frameworks and financing tools for nature, taking into account the lessons of climate change. Accordingly, the space devoted to financing at COP15 was also large. An entire day was dedicated to biodiversity and finance, with 150 financial institutions representing $24 trillion calling on world leaders to adopt an ambitious global biodiversity framework. Not surprisingly, one of the delegates\u2019 biggest concerns is the need for sufficient resources in developing countries to truly mobilize action on the ground. An important element of this is the decision to redirect environmentally harmful subsidies (amounting to over $1.8 trillion per year) toward regenerative approaches. Textile Exchange, in its statement on COP15, welcomes the presence and relevant voice of indigenous peoples, who play a major role in implementing the decisions on the ground. Here, for example, we are talking about the shift to regenerative agriculture: when agricultural land and production activities come up against sensitive biodiversity hotspots in the landscape or where they impede wildlife movements. According to Textile Exchange, it is necessary to take advantage of the wealth of tools and technologies available to make the most of the enormous amount of innovation in this area. Wrapping up, the Textile Exchange statement says: Although the negotiations took some time and developing countries left at the midterm break, the final version of the GBF is ambitious enough that most participants feel they can work with it.

The supply system will eventually be open to other brands across and outside the industry, \u201caiming to significantly scale regenerative sourcing of rubber,\u201d it said. Regenerative rubber farming incorporates multiple tree species to mimic a natural forest ecosystem. This revitalizes biodiversity and enhances ecosystem services such as soil health, water cycling, carbon sequestration and the creation of favorable microclimates, Timberland explained. The approach provides a diversity of yields that farmers can rely on for multiple streams of income, leading to increased resiliency and long-lasting positive impacts for the community. By supporting \u201ctrain the trainer\u201d programs, Timberland and VF will help to scale local indigenous knowledge and transition more plantations to regenerative systems, the brand added. The brand has also expanded its offering of footwear using regenerative leather to include the Greenstride Solar Wave EK+ collection. In addition to regenerative leather in the uppers, Greenstride comfort soles are made of 75 percent renewable materials deriving from a combination of sugar cane and natural rubber from trees. Later this summer, the Timberland PRO line will introduce its first regenerative leather boot, the Gridworks EK+. With the expansion of its regenerative leather supply chain, the brand hopes to incentivize the transition of more farmers to regenerative agriculture. Timberland has set a goal for 100 percent of its natural materials to be sourced from regenerative agriculture by 2030.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata

Syngenta Group sales for full year 2023 were $32.2 billion, down    $1.2 billion or 4 percent year-on-year (-1% CER). Full year    EBITDA decreased 18 percent from the Group's all-time high in    2022 (-14% CER). Sales in 2023 were impacted by continued    industry-wide channel destocking in Crop Protection, with    distributors and retailers actively reducing inventories    previously accumulated in reaction to the supply chain    disturbances of the prior years, while under pressure to lower    working capital due to prolonged higher interest rates.     Fourth quarter sales were $7.9 billion, up 5 percent (+6% CER),    driven by Syngenta Crop Protection and by strong growth of    Syngenta Group China. This compares with a fourth quarter of    2022, when industry-wide destocking began. EBITDA for the fourth    quarter grew 15% (+10% CER), exceeding the record-setting fourth    quarter EBITDA of $0.9 billion in Q4 2022.

The    resulting contraction in demand led to global volume and price    reductions, particularly in Latin America and commoditised parts    of the portfolio. These factors weighed on the comparison with    2022, when Syngenta Group achieved record sales and profits.     Syngenta Crop Protection sales in FY 2023 experienced a modest 5    percent decrease in comparison to the previous year, totalling    $15.5 billion. Syngenta Group's biological solutions grew 11    percent in sales to $0.4 billion compared to last year.     The seeds market continued to be strong and resilient in 2023    despite softer commodity prices towards the  end of the year. The    Seeds business grew 2 percent to $4.8 billion in 2023.     Syngenta Group China maintained its momentum. In 2023, sales of    Syngenta Group China increased by 11 percent (+18% CER) to $9.6    billion, with fourth quarter sales growing as much as 19 percent    (+28% CER) to $1.9 billion.     Full year sales of Syngenta Group China's Modern Agriculture    Platform (MAP) grew 26 percent to $3.9 billion as the number of    MAP centers increased by 113 to a total of 741 centers.     In 2023, Syngenta Group remained focused on measures to improve    operational efficiency and productivity to offset lower volumes    and prices.     Sales from synergy effects amounted to $1.2 billion for the full    year, with a profit contribution of almost $0.5 billion.     EBITDA margin for 2023 was 14.2 percent, 2.5 percentage points    lower than in 2022.

They provide food for their families and do the work on the fields. They account for 67% of the labour force in small scale agriculture. At the same time, females are often excluded from land ownership. A non-governmental organisation (NGO) aims to empower women in Mexico and supports the females of a rural community to learn agroecological practices.</p><p>The town of Miguel Hidalgo is in a rural area in the south of Mexico and has 826 inhabitants. Here, women are not allowed to own land. Many residents cannot afford basic needs such as food, access to water, health and education, which have increased families' economic precariousness and food insecurity. An earthquake in 2017 and the Covid-19 pandemic have made life even harder.</p><p>The NGO Proyecto ConcentrArte has partnered with a community foundation to work with the community of Miguel Hidalgo to promote food sovereignty. The two organisations seek to use agroecology to provide food, increase household income, foster community cohesion, regenerate the soil and enhance ecosystem biodiversity.</p><p>In 2019, Proyecto ConcentrArte was able to bring together 35 women who named themselves 'Women of the Orchard' to start a garden that relies on regenerative agriculture and agroforestry systems to harvest various species of plants. In two years, they have managed to strengthen the community fabric by sharing the work and the harvest equally. The Women of the Orchard have also succeeded in generating their own seeds, which can be reused, consumed and used to build seed banks, allowing them to maintain seed diversification and traditional knowledge.</p><p>The community project has achieved a major mindset change in Miguel Hidalgo, also because the people realised that not only the women benefit, but also the husbands, children and family members of the women. According to Fernanda Cano from Proyecto ConcentrArte's, 'the community recognised the role of women in the wellbeing of their community and families, so the council of land holders met and decided to give them a plot of land on loan so they could continue planting for the next 15 years.'</p><p>Currently, the garden space has gone from being a plot of land with only three crops, corn, beans and squash, to an agroforestry garden with 36 species, each of which fulfils a function in the agroecosystem. Additionally, income from the sale of surplus harvest has inspired the women to consider the formation of a cooperative society through which they can have more sustainable income sources.</p><p>Pamela Cruz is the Special Projects Coordinator at Comunalia, a network of community foundations in Mexico and Strategic Advisor at MY World Mexico.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DECOOP-DEVCOOP1212202200001</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DECOOP2022</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:672P-HWB1-JCH9-G1P3-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">433701</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2022-12-12</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"454\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2022 Frankfurter Societats-Medien GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName><br/>Development and Cooperation</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"28355\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"12\" month=\"12\" year=\"2022\"><dateText>December 12, 2022 Monday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazines &amp;

It is one of several incentives the company announced on Thursday that aim to \"improve the livelihoods of cocoa-farming families, while also advancing regenerative agriculture practices and gender equality.\"  Nestl\\xE9 said cocoa farmers will also receive financial rewards for switching to more sustainable agricultural practices, such as pruning and planting shade trees.  Farmers are also encouraged to grow other crops alongside cocoa, or raise livestock, to generate more diversified incomes to protect them from market risks.  Nestl\\xE9 new \"income accelerator programme\" is to include 10,000 families in Ivory Coast this year and, from 2024, also cocoa growers in Ghana. These two countries are the largest cocoa producers in the world.  Families can earn up to 500 francs (537 dollars) annually for the first two years by implementing the practices, the Switzerland-based company said, adding that the payments were not dependent based on the volume of cocoa sold.  According to estimates by the Make Chocolate Fair action alliance, 1.5 million minors work \"under exploitative conditions\" on cocoa plantations in the two West African countries.

It is one of several incentives the company announced on Thursday that aim to \"improve the livelihoods of cocoa-farming families, while also advancing regenerative agriculture practices and gender equality.\"  Nestl\\xE9 said cocoa farmers will also receive financial rewards for switching to more sustainable agricultural practices, such as pruning and planting shade trees.  Farmers are also encouraged to grow other crops alongside cocoa, or raise livestock, to generate more diversified incomes to protect them from market risks.  Nestl\\xE9 new \"income accelerator programme\" is to include 10,000 families in Ivory Coast this year and, from 2024, also cocoa growers in Ghana. These two countries are the largest cocoa producers in the world.  Families can earn up to 500 francs (537 dollars) annually for the first two years by implementing the practices, the Switzerland-based company said, adding that the payments were not dependent based on the volume of cocoa sold.  According to estimates by the Make Chocolate Fair action alliance, 1.5 million minors work \"under exploitative conditions\" on cocoa plantations in the two West African countries.

Fresh analysis by Systemiq has revealed that regenerative farming - whilst expanding its footprint over recent years - must triple its rate of growth to deliver against the world's need to limit climate change to 1.5 degrees. It needs to make up at least 40% of global cropland by 2030, up from around 15% today.</p><p>The Task Force calls for common metrics and market-based financial incentives for environmental outcomes, targeted government policy and an overhaul of food sourcing - all to make regenerative agriculture a 'no brainer' business decision for farmers.</p><p>The Task Force is comprised of executives from many of the world's largest and most influential agribusiness companies and organisations, united by a common ambition to enable regenerative farming to become mainstream: Bayer, HowGood, Indigo Agriculture, Mars, McCain Foods, McDonald's, Mondelez, Olam, PepsiCo, Sustainable Food Trust, Waitrose &amp;

The MoU envisions a collaboration in which ADM and Syngenta would    leverage their existing capabilities to accelerate the research,    processing, and commercialization of new, low carbon-intensity    oilseeds, such as Camelina, that are typically grown in the    fallow period of a crop rotation. The companies have broad    capabilities including:      * Syngenta's R&amp;D engine, which offers biotechnology support,        seed treatments, and biologicals that further reduce the        carbon intensity of crops, and agronomic knowledge from a        network of local, field experts combined with excellent        farmer relationships.      * ADM's global scale and logistical expertise, including        unparalleled production and storage capabilities, a vast        logistical network, and relationships with growers and        customers spanning food, feed, fuel, industrial and consumer        products.     ADM and Syngenta envision fostering partnerships with additional    companies to support the creation, commercialization and    processing of next-generation oilseeds.     \"This exciting MoU with Syngenta demonstrates how we are working    with partners to bring the full value chain together to support    new seed technologies,\" said Greg Morris, president of ADM's Ag    Services &amp; Oilseeds business. \"It builds on our unique    capabilities by creating a path to scale the processing of cover    crops, a process we've already successfully piloted. We look    forward to working with Syngenta to advance this work and    continue to meet demand for sustainably sourced fuels and other    products.\"     \"Syngenta is excited to join forces with ADM to bring more    sustainable and profitable solutions to farmers,\" said Justin    Wolfe, President of Syngenta Global Seeds.  \"Sustainability is a    core enabler of our business strategy.  We believe    collaborations, such as this one, are important ways to drive    quicker innovation that delivers higher yield potential while    carrying a lower impact to our environment. Work will begin in    North America.\"     Global demand for biofuels - such as sustainable aviation fuel,    which can be made from a wide variety of feedstocks, including    oilseeds such as the ones envisioned in this MoU - is expected to    grow by 35 billion litres per year, or 22%, over the 2022-2027    period, according to the International Energy Association.     \"Farmers have always been stewards of the land,\" said Alison    Taylor, ADM's chief sustainability officer. \"We're already    expanding our partnerships with farmers through our    re:generations(TM) regen ag program; this MoU represents another    pathway for us to help them drive value by positioning their    businesses to meet global demand for sustainably-sourced    products.\"     \"Transforming agriculture will be fueled by innovation, but it    must be achieved at scale,\" said Daniel Vennard, Syngenta Group's    Chief Sustainability Officer.  \"This cannot be done alone. The    whole food and agriculture system needs to work in partnership    with farmers at the center.  Our collaboration with ADM is a    perfect example of our continued commitment and we are excited to    see what we will do together and how we can inspire the    industry.\"     The companies expect to sign definitive agreements by the end of    the year and are already advancing important work together around    growing and processing next-generation varieties.

Group sales for the first    nine months of 2023 were $24.3 billion, down 6 percent    year-on-year (-3% CER) and EBITDA was 22% lower (-20% CER) when    compared to an exceptionally strong 2022.      In the first nine months of 2023, the industry-wide channel    destocking continued as distributors and retailers further    reduced inventories they built up in response to the supply chain    disruptions of 2022. Overall farmer income and use of    agricultural products, solutions and services remain robust.    However, high working capital costs for customers due to    sustained higher interest rates prompted many channel partners    and farmers to order closer to application. These factors weighed    on the comparison with the same period last year, when the Group    achieved record sales and profits.      Sales of the Group for the third quarter were $6.8 billion, down    13 percent (-13% CER) and EBITDA was $0.3 billion, down 68    percent from prior year. The EBITDA was significantly impacted by    a softer market in Brazil versus a record high in 2022 and a    one-time seed inventory correction in Brazil, in addition to the    timing of a royalty receipt, which was advanced to Q2 as noted in    the H1 earnings release.        9M 2023       9M 2023     9M 2022     Change     Change (CER)      $bn     $bn     %     %     Sales     24.3     25.9     -6     -3     EBITDA     3.5     4.6     -22     -20       Q3 2023       Q3 2023     Q3 2022     Change     Change (CER)      $bn     $bn     %     %     Sales     6.8     7.9     -13     -13     EBITDA     0.3     1.0     -68     -76       Sales of Syngenta Crop Protection and ADAMA were lower compared    to the exceptionally strong first three quarters of the prior    year. Crop Protection in China continued to see strong growth in    the first nine months of 2023, with sales up 16 percent    year-on-year, benefiting from launch of new technologies.    Syngenta Group's biological solutions grew 14 percent in sales    compared to the first nine months of the previous year.      The Seeds business grew 3 percent to $3.3 billion sales in the    first nine of months of 2023. Year-on-year comparison of Q3 was    distorted by an earlier phasing of royalty income, realized in Q2    this year, while being recorded in Q3 last year. The Seeds    business in Latin America saw lower sales and profit due to a    one-time inventory adjustment.      Syngenta Group China grew by 9 percent in the first nine months    of 2023, with total sales of $7.7 billion. MAP, Syngenta Group's    Modern Agriculture Platform grew in the same period by 25 percent    to $3.3 billion, while the number of MAP centers further    increased by 162 to a total of 727.      Syngenta Group continued its productivity improvements, cost    containment and, where applicable, price adjustments to help    mitigate the impact of higher cost incurred in 2022. Syngenta    Group's EBITDA margin for the first nine months of 2023 was 14.6    percent, which is lower than the record high EBITDA during the    same period last year.

In the first nine months, sales in North America grew 2 percent;    sales were 3 percent lower in Europe, Africa and the Middle East    and 5 percent lower in Asia Pacific (excluding China). Sales in    China were up 16 percent. Sales in Latin America were 20 percent    lower as distributors reduced stocks and prices for some products    decreased. At CER, the business grew in all regions except for    Latin America.      Syngenta Crop Protection continued to launch its innovative    technologies across markets globally, with insect-control    products containing PLINAZOLIN\\xAE technology achieving particularly    strong sales across Asia Pacific and Brazil.       ADAMA      ADAMA sales were 18 percent lower at $4.2 billion in the first    nine months of 2023, significantly impacted by channel    destocking.      In the first nine months, sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle    East were 5 percent lower; sales in Latin America were 21 percent    lower impacted by the overall contraction of the crop protection    market in Brazil following channel destocking and softening    pricing. North America sales were 23 percent lower; Asia Pacific    sales (excluding China) were 16 percent lower. Sales in China    were 25 percent lower, largely due to soft demand of    non-agricultural products.      ADAMA launched Almada\\xAE, a triple-mode fungicide based on ADAMA's    proprietary formulation technology against major soybean    diseases. Almada\\xAE is the first ADAMA product containing    Fluxapyroxad for use in soybean.       Syngenta Seeds      Syngenta Seeds sales grew 3 percent to $3.3 billion in the first    nine months of 2023, driven by robust pricing to cover higher    costs.      Field crop sales in Europe, Africa and the Middle East grew 12    percent; North America 5 percent; Asia Pacific (excluding China)    19 percent; and China 8 percent. Latin America was 15 percent    lower predominantly due to a one-time inventory adjustment in    Brazil. Sales of Vegetable Seeds grew 3 percent.      Syngenta Vegetable Seeds launched 15 commercial tomato varieties    with Tomato Brown Rugose Fruit Virus resistance, a devastating    virus impacting greenhouse tomato producers across the world, and    the business is preparing to introduce 30 similarly resistant    varieties in 2024 to bring significant value to growers.       Syngenta Group China      Syngenta Group China, consisting of the Group's Seeds, Crop    Protection, Crop Nutrition, MAP and digital activities in China,    achieved sales of $7.7 billion, up 9 percent, in the first nine    months of 2023.      Syngenta Group China's Crop Protection sales increased 3 percent    in the first three quarters of the year, with robust agriculture    sales compensating for lower non-agricultural by-product sales.    Sales of Seeds grew 7 percent. Crop Nutrition sales were 3    percent lower, while maintaining robust profits.      In the first nine months of the year, MAP sales grew 25 percent    to $3.3 billion. The number of MAP centers increased by 162 from    a year earlier to a total of 727. MAP digital applications    achieved 2.5 million registered users, providing online tools    that help modernize farms across China.

New thinking will be necessary to allow the global food industry to transform and revolutionize the way food is produced by creating an environment-friendly supply chain that takes no more than what planet Earth can give. </p></bodyText></abstract></nitf:body.head><nitf:body.content><bodyText><h>FULL TEXT:</h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Around 33% of all the carbon dioxide released is absorbed by forests. One of the world's most effective \"carbon sinks\" is lost by removing valuable forests. Despite all the good intentions of the major agri-companies, their commitment of pledging to net zero has little or no chance of meeting the objectives by 2025. Around 60% of the global deforestation is caused by agricultural commodities production. So far, most agri-companies that have committed to net-zero carbon emissions are at risk of missing their climate targets. The primary drivers of deforestation are beef, soy, and palm oil, with coffee, rubber, cacao, and sugar not far behind. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Transformative pathways of behavioral and structural changes will be needed to embark on a diversified agroecological production system that aims to increase access to healthy and sustainable diets. Increasingly, younger affluent consumers prefer food products that care about sustainable agricultural practices and are minimally processed while maintaining a natural status. Decoding these preferences translates into health, convenience, and taste. In other words, if the taste does not meet the expectations, consumers tend to think less about the health of the planet. </p><p> Whatever transformative pathway is chosen, it is important to remember that the most crucial factor influencing the enjoyment of consumers is still their sensory appeal in spite of all the green messaging. In affluent societies, one out of three consumers will not consider buying 100% plant-based foods because of poor taste and texture. The technological reasons are clear: besides the lack of flavor and color of most plant ingredients, the proteins neither perform in the same way nor provide the same favorable organoleptic properties like taste and texture. </p><p> Democratization </p><p> The plant-forward movement has clearly captured the mainstream and continues expanding in new territories and applications in multiple product offerings. Driven by a combination of more health, environmental, and ethical awareness, consumer demand for plant protein-formulated foods continues to grow, albeit not as fast as projected. The looks of plant-based meat, bakery, snacks, and dairy-like products are set to become an enduring part of the food landscape. In most developed countries, the market for plant-based proteins, as well as alternative meat and milk, continues to grow. For both milk- and meat alternatives, it is important to place these in the same supermarket aisles as the traditional products. This branding and positioning strategy significantly increases the likelihood that consumers are tempted to choose these foods. </p><p> Many angles to consider </p><p> Even though industrial livestock continues to generate an increase in the environmental footprint, alternative meat and dairy will not be the complete answer. Instead of just focusing on a protein transition, there must be a democracy to hear what small-scale farmers and food-insecure populations have to say. The reason is that multinational companies - including their acquisition activities of successful startups - tend to reinforce the reliance on plant protein and over-processed food choices that dominate and polarize public debate about the traditional consumption of meat and dairy. The key element in making a global sustainable food transition will be support for farmers in developing regions to move away from industrialized animal-harvest farming toward sustainable and ecologically sound livestock farming and plant-based alternatives. </p><p> Ecological and environmental footprints </p><p> Globalization is partly responsible for the increase in the volume of grain and pulse crops traded. There is often a correlation between export demand and countries reducing their stockpiles to the point of possibly reducing food security. Weather conditions such as dry spells or heavy rainfall can cause a string of poor production years, as well as provide above-average high-volume harvest numbers.  </p><p> Although plant protein can play a key role in reducing the ecological and environmental footprints of global food production, there is still a risk that over-reliance on a few crops can lead to further reduction of biodiversity. Therefore, care should be taken so that the drive for more plant protein consumption does not cause harm or issues like deforestation and loss of wildlife and biodiversity. </p><p> The global ecosystems need a reimagining of food systems to operate within nature's boundaries. Conventional agriculture is strained to the point that it is unsustainable, especially since the world might possibly run out of farmable land to feed the fast-rising population by 2050. To be compliant, food companies need to develop a vision of an economic system that prioritizes the biodiversity of nature's assets. Preferably, these objectives need to be accomplished in such a manner that capital, health, and affordability are harmonized on a platform of corporate sustainable environmentalism. </p><p> The overall amount of protein available for human consumption may decline with rising atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Elevated levels of carbon dioxide can block plants' absorption (=assimilation) of nitrates, resulting in foods and crops with reduced nutritional quality. Studies have indicated that protein and nitrogen concentrations in plants decline under elevated levels of carbon dioxide -indicating that the nutritional quality of food crops is at risk as climate change intensifies.  </p><p> Clean disruption? </p><p> There is real change when a levy or tax is enforced on foods such as beef and dairy or shutting down active farms to forcefully achieve deep cuts in emissions by adopting circular economy strategies that reduce demand or limit exports. Much to the chagrin of farmers, these government strategies are already being implemented in the Netherlands and even creating social unrest, as well as major political parliament voting upsets. </p><p> To be fair, it should be noted that the shift to higher levels of ultra-processed foods in the last decennia also significantly contributed to greenhouse gas emissions as well as the destruction of wildlife habitat and monoculture, causing a debilitating ecological footprint. These ultra-processed foods are, for example, heavy additive-loaded ready-to-eat meals, margarine, and sodas. </p><p> When all these variables are implemented, only time will tell if the doom-say assumptions of the climate experts are correct in their assumptions that increased plant-based \"cleaner food\" consumption will indeed meet the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C. </p><p> Zero deforestation  </p><p> It is estimated that the demand for crops like soybeans is expected to increase by 80% in 2050. Most of the soybean is widely used as animal feed. For instance, some 60% of soy grown across the world is shipped to China and mainly used for animal feed that ultimately ends up as slaughtered meat. </p><p> Soy agriculture requires large amounts of water and is increasingly associated with driving deforestation, leading to catastrophic environmental damage, including the eradication of wildlife habitat. With the demand for soy protein and soy oil increasing, as well as land and water issues of the crop becoming unsustainable, the global population needs to find alternative protein sources. These alternatives are now being developed using sources like microalgae and cellular agriculture, including molecular farming. </p><p> Due to agricultural expansion, deforestation and forest degradation continue to take place at alarming rates. Hence, it is imperative that new agricultural production methods are implemented without destroying valuable forest and wildlife areas. Ideally, whenever possible, reforestation should be made within the framework of transformative solutions for climate change, biodiversity, and much-needed food security. </p><p> Legacy and startup companies should both accomplish their mission to end deforestation within the forest reserve and restore degraded forests and wildlife. Companies like these and the premier global plant protein companies should work together to accomplish these lofty goals by promoting regenerative agriculture and striving to become resource-positive companies by sourcing only sustainable crops like soybeans to accelerate the transition to a net-zero global economy. </p><p> Furthermore, it is expected that effective diligence across supply chains will ultimately be introduced and that all food sold will be mandated as guaranteed deforestation-free. Supermarkets that are in the first line of consumer defense will likely drive these transitional changes needed to ensure that food systems deliver affordable, healthy, and ecologically sustainable foods. </p><p> Challenging times prompt new solutions </p><p> A fundamental shift in how food is produced is needed. This includes the practices of over 500 million smallholder farms and the consumption patterns of the global population, with special emphasis on the developed countries and the huge waste of valuable food. To minimize environmental degradation while still feeding some 10 billion people by 2050, a drastic cut in the consumption of meat, dairy, and eggs will be needed. However, will these goals be attainable knowing that the world production of both dairy and meat is still upward trending? </p><p> The meat eaten today in record-consumed quantities overwhelmingly comes from genetically uniform and pharmaceutically treated animals, often stacked in confined spaces. Unfortunately for most consumers, the present and future of animal farming are low on the list of priorities, mainly due to the lack of public understanding. However, the continuation of factory-farmed animals should be a top priority on the agenda to determine the limits of this huge industrially powered supply chain. </p><p> Consumer demands </p><p> An increasing number of consumers living in affluent societies believe that vegetarian or vegan food choices are more sustainable than slaughtered food options such as beef, pork, and chicken. To keep up with the plant-based phenomenon and the shifting consumer attitudes from trend to food (r)evolution status, legacy brands are now forced to closely monitor market changes. This is especially the case as more consumers adapt to increased plant-based eating, though for diverse reasons, with more plant protein or fiber in their diets and eating more healthfully while feeling good about their proactive attitude toward helping the environment. </p><p> Clearly, consumers in affluent countries are giving more support to plant-based dietary choices that not only help manage weight but also address underlying conditions like well-being and reduce the risk of degenerative diseases such as cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. </p><p> It is evident that the younger consumers under the age of 30 are the early adopters of a vegetarian dietary preference. In contrast, consumers under the age of 50 are most likely to adopt a flexitarian-style diet as a meaningful compromise. These trends do seem to transcend both demographic and generational groups. For these groups of consumers, clean label and transparency is not a passing trend but a movement that is here to stay. </p><p> There are also subtle protein consumption differences between men and women: women are mostly interested in protein for lifestyle, satiety, and body-weight control, whereas men see protein nutrition in relation to their increased muscle strength, physical (sport) performance, and energy level. </p><p> Plant equivalency </p><p> There is a clear relationship between the willingness of consumers to purchase plant milk and plant-meat alternatives or animal-based equivalents. Most consumers believe that plant milk and plant meat are too expensive, and they would prefer to see similar pricing, suggesting that price is a key barrier to plant protein food consumption. </p><p> The latter is especially true to capture or win over the flexitarian consumer, particularly during times when the cost of living goes up. Perhaps the answer lies in the fact that margins on animal meat and dairy milk are historically low at around 10%, whereas margins on plant-based protein foods are typically at 30% to as much as 50%. Besides these differences, there is growing evidence that the increase in living costs does indeed challenge ethical and ecologically driven buying decisions. </p><p> Environmental and human health degradation </p><p> The overriding question is if plant-based meat and plant-milk beverages lead to sustained change in purchasing behaviors. For now, the answer is a resounding yes! However, it is appropriate to ask if a vegetarian-based diet loaded with wheat, corn, soy, and rice is sustainable for long-lasting human preferences. After all, wrong were the nutritional (pseudo) scientists and self-appointed gurus some 30 years ago when they were pushing the ultimate healthy diet high in carbohydrates and low in fat! A skyrocketing global obesity and diabetes type 2 epidemic is presently affecting both affluent and developing countries alike. It only shows how incredibly hard it is to make dietary changes last. </p><p> A more balanced approach to the ideal human nutrition guidelines will be needed. Perhaps it is now safe to conclude that optimal human health, in fact, clashes with the \"health\" of the planet Earth. </p><p> It is a fact that it takes more than just calories to nourish humans. Over the last 50 years, legacy food companies have continuously removed essential natural components from crops - especially roughage and fiber - to make food taste better. Most of these companies spend lots of energy in finding the bliss point - the stage of continually eating food. Quite a bit of compulsive eating resulted, and many people are on autopilot when eating these \"great-tasting, empty-calorie\" foods. This is good for marketing and sales but bad for the nutritive status of the human body.  </p><p> In the developing world, diets high in dairy and meat are expected to rise exponentially due to the growing number of people who have the means to afford these much-beloved foods as their primary source of nutrition, even though the increase in animal protein consumption will mean a real setback in reducing greenhouse gas emissions. </p><p> As a side note, consumption of fluid milk in North America declined by 25% between 2006 and 2022, along with a triple-digit increase in dairy alternatives within the same time frame. However, to put it into perspective, this decline in cow's milk consumption is more than compensated by the sharp increase in dairy sales in developing countries. Subsequently, the net greenhouse gas savings do not always reflect what special interest groups make the consumer believe. </p><p> Transformative changes </p><p> The growing number of transformative changes with increasing meat and dairy consumption, as well as the rising demand for food and nutritional quality, will put additional pressure on the agricultural ecosystems. To meet world needs by 2050, an estimated 70% more food must be produced from less land and fewer inputs like chemical pest control, less water and fertilizer, as well as less or no antibiotics for raising slaughtered animals. In addition, the inequities between developing and affluent societies must be solved to improve the economic and societal imbalances. </p><p> Henk Hoogenkamp works as an author and Protein Application Specialist. </p><p> Author's adress </p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:Hoogenkamp1@gmail.com\">Hoogenkamp1@gmail.com</email></p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">FLEINT-20231123651100</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">FLEINT2023</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:69PB-CFX1-JC10-0014-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">280767</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-11-22</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"2619\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2023 Deutscher Fachverlag GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>Fleischwirtschaft International</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"24142\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><issueNumber>No. 4</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"11\" year=\"2023\"><dateText>November 23, 2023</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Magazine</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Industry Trade Press</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>Environmental Law</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6NzFDRDYyNkI2QjhBNDg3NTkyRjRDRkZEQjlCRkRBQzM7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD0</classCode><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>General Overview</className><classCode>Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6OTJBMTAyQURGQ0Y3NEEzNkIyQjRERjQzQTVBNDdBMDI7cGFyZW50Z3VpZD11cm46dG9waWM6MUE3OUU5MDM1NjFGNDdBOEIxMDVCOUEyQTQ3QzcyOUQ</classCode></classificationItem></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"subject\"><classificationItem score=\"91\"><classCode>ST000DJQC</classCode><className>CONSUMERS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"90\"><classCode>ST000DAJV</classCode><className>CARBON CAPTURE &amp;

A six-week open consultation on the thematic areas and sequencing was held in which stakeholders were invited to submit feedback - the first such approach taken by a COP Presidency.</p><p>Kicking off with a two-day World Climate Action Summit, during which the first-ever Global Stocktake response will be presented to world leaders with the COP Presidency seeking commitments and accountability, the program also features new individual thematic days that respond to global challenges.</p><p>For the first time at a COP forum, COP28 will dedicate a day to Health, Relief, Recovery, and Peace, with a high level climate health ministerial, among other thematic activities. COP28 will also be the first to focus on the role of trade in tandem with finance and it will be the COP that brings leaders together from across all levels of government and society - from the local mayors to global leaders- to work towards cleaner, greener, safer cities for current and future generations.</p><p>All thematic days throughout the two weeks will be underpinned with an inclusive approach that prioritizes frontline communities and focuses on how finance, technology and innovation can drive solutions.</p><p>More detailed information about each thematic day will be released in the weeks and months ahead, as the COP28 Presidency continues to ramp up preparations for this year's meeting at Expo City Dubai.</p><p>Below are the key themes and events for each day:</p><p>- 30 November: COP28 UAE opens to the world at Expo City, Dubai. - 1-2 December: World Climate Action Summit - These two days will see heads of   state and world leaders come together to tackle the most pressing climate   issues in dialogue with leaders from civil society, business, youth,   Indigenous Peoples' organizations and others. Typically, the summit helps to   firm up the ambition for the remainder of the COP. For COP28, it will go   further; it is where the first-ever Global Stocktake response and the urgency   of the situation faced will be presented, and the COP Presidency will seek   accountability from the highest levels of global governance on a way forward. - 3 December: Health/Relief, Recovery, and Peace - Climate change is already   impacting human health across the planet, from the quality of the air we   breathe to the water we drink and the places that provide us with shelter. It   is also a major cause for displacement of vulnerable communities, leading to   increased fragility which can compromise peace. This day, a first for COPs,   will explore ways to provide relief to those affected while strengthening   resilience and recovery leading to increased stability. - 4 December: Finance/Trade/Gender Equality/Accountability - Neither global   financial systems that control and impact access and affordability of climate   finance nor international trade networks, are working effectively and   equitably. It is widely acknowledged that leaders of the global institutions   and countries that govern these systems must accelerate and be accountable for   an overhaul. An example of this is freeing up access to international finance   and trade to support the implementation of adaptation and mitigation solutions   without restrictions such as high interest rates that the poorest countries   cannot afford. This is necessary to create fairer and more equal conditions   for the world - and especially the most climate vulnerable countries from the   Global South - to meet collective climate targets. This day will focus on   moving this work forward while championing the importance of gender equality   across the full climate spectrum. - 5 December: Energy and Industry / Just Transition / Indigenous Peoples - The   world needs to decarbonize rapidly while continuing to progress economically.   It is critical that this development happens sustainably and inclusively to   support lives and livelihoods while protecting the planet. This day will focus   on how the world can accelerate the energy transition while ensuring it is   just. The energy needed for day-to-day life must remain affordable but become   cleaner, and jobs must be retained but expand as green technologies emerge and   provide increased and equitable access to opportunities. The day will look at   the broad spectrum of solutions from deploying renewable energy at scale and   how hydrogen can support this, to decarbonizing the energy of today through   carbon capture technologies and rapidly reducing methane emissions from oil   and gas. It will also focus on heavy-emitting industry including steel,   cement, and aluminium. Indigenous Peoples are stewards of 80% of our planet's   biodiversity and Indigenous Peoples Day will recognize the importance of their   intergenerational knowledge, practices, and leadership in climate action. The   day will also strengthen their role in the just transition, reinforcing the   urgency of a fully inclusive, all-of-society approach. - 6 December: Multilevel Action, Urbanization, and Built Environment/Transport -   It is not often that leaders representing all levels of governance, from the   local to the global, come together. This day will provide a rare opportunity   for mayors and governors, ministers and parliamentarians, and global business   and civil society leaders to work together to accelerate climate action   solutions across society in every form . This will include exploring how   greener urban mobility systems can be designed to withstand and adapt to   climate change while supporting the transition to low carbon built   environments and infrastructure, and redesigning our systems of production and   consumption to minimize waste. In addition, this day will showcase how all of   these solutions contribute to safer, healthier and greener cities for current   and future generations. - 7 December: Rest Day - 8 December: Youth, Children, Education, and Skills - Children and youth are   facing disproportionate risks and impacts from climate change as the   generation who will inherit a planet with tougher conditions in which to live   and prosper but which was not responsible for contributing to the problem.   This day seeks to empower children and youth to shape the outcomes of COP28   and beyond and provide them with clear, defined, accessible opportunities to   be a leading part of the solutions proposed at every level. - 9 December: Nature, Land Use, and Oceans - Our world's climate and its   biodiversity are inextricably interconnected, one cannot exist without the   other. Mitigating both crises must therefore be integrated. In a landmark win   for nature, a 30 x 30 biodiversity goal was adopted by world leaders at the   CBD COP15 - to protect at least 30 percent of the planet's land and water by   2030. Contributing to the goal, this day will focus on delivering climate and   nature co-benefits. This includes co-designing approaches to land use and   oceans conservation with local and Indigenous Peoples to protect and manage   biodiversity hotspots and natural carbon sinks. - 10 December: Food, Agriculture, and Water - Climate change is creating severe   pressure and risks for the food, agricultural and water systems that ensure   human wellbeing. At the same time, these systems are also key contributors to   climate change: one third of all human-made GHG emissions derive from   agri-food systems, and 70% of fresh water consumed worldwide is used for   agricultural production. This day will focus on how to fix this, from scaling   up regenerative agriculture and water-food systems that support habitat   restoration and conservation and increase food security, to implementing   stronger, fairer integrated governance between states and corporations,   farmers and producers. - 11-12 December: Final Negotiations - On the final two days of COP28, there   will be no thematic days to avoid extensive programming when the negotiation   text is often being closed.</p><p>For more information on the thematic program, please visit COP28.com here (<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.cop28.com/en/thematic-program\">https://www.cop28.com/en/thematic-program</url>) .</p><p>Notes to Editors COP28 UAE:</p><p>- COP28 UAE will take place at Expo City Dubai from November 30-December 12, 2023.

The company expects to invest a total of 3.2 billion Swiss francs over the next five years for the initiatives.  The company plans to complete its transition to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2025. Additionally, Nestl\\xE9 is continuously increasing the number of 'carbon neutral' brands.  Under its reforestation program, Nestle would plant 20 million trees every year for the next 10 years in the areas where it sources ingredients. The company's primary supply chains of key commodities, like palm oil and soy, will be deforestation-free by 2022.  Nestl\\xE9 expects to complete the transition of its 800 sites in the 187 countries where it operates to 100% renewable electricity within the next five years. The company is switching its global fleet of vehicles to lower emission options and will reduce and offset business travel by 2022.  Magdi Batato, Executive Vice President and Head of Operations, said, \"With nearly two-thirds of our emissions coming from agriculture, it is clear that regenerative agriculture and reforestation are the focal points of our path to net zero. These efforts will reduce emissions and improve biodive\"      </p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">DPAENG-160698386400227AFU0227</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">DPAENG2020</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:61F7-1BN1-J9XT-N027-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">400568</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2020-12-03</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"215\"/><timeReceived>9:24 AM GMT</timeReceived><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2020 dpa-AFX Wirtschaftsnachrichten GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>dpa-AFX International ProFeed</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"0503\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><publicationDate day=\"03\" month=\"12\" year=\"2020\"><dateText>December 3, 2020 Thursday</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswire</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newswires &amp;

The brand is committing to making 100 percent of its core materials\u00a0\u2013 rubber, cotton, leather, and polyester\u00a0\u2013 regenerative, responsibly sourced, renewable or recycled by 2030. In addition, by 2025, the company wants to achieve a 43 percent carbon reduction by cutting the average impact of materials by 35 percent, by sourcing 100 percent sustainably grown cotton, and by utilizing 50 percent recycled polyester by then. </p><p>Vans will pilot and scale regenerative agriculture practices on farms and ranches that produce cotton, rubber and leather, and will then use these materials in its products. It will also explore bio-based alternatives to traditional petroleum-based synthetic materials, while converting virgin polyester used in its footwear, apparel and accessories to recycled resources. The brand has also committed to eliminating all single-use plastic packaging and reducing waste at every point of its business model by 2025. Plastic shopping bags will be eliminated from its retail spaces by the end of 2021. The remaining packaging will be minimized, originating it from sustainable sources and designing it for recyclability. Vans is also working toward converting all its directly owned or partner facilities to the use of 100 percent renewable energy by 2025. The company began this transition in 2017, when it installed a 1MW solar array at its headquarters, achieving LEED platinum certification for the building. In order to achieve its sustainability commitments, Vans will also work closely with Terra Genesi, which supplies\u00a0 regenerative rubber, and with a producer of sustainable cotton, Indigo Ag.</p></bodyText></nitf:body.content></nitf:body><metadata><dc:metadata xmlns:dc=\"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/\"><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"DOC-ID\">SGIEU-88828</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"royaltyReportingKey\">SGIEU2021</dc:source><dc:identifier identifierScheme=\"PGUID\">urn:contentItem:639D-D9V1-JC9B-14WJ-00000-00</dc:identifier><dc:source sourceScheme=\"productContentSetIdentifier\">477069</dc:source><dc:date dateType=\"last-updated\">2023-12-09</dc:date></dc:metadata><wordCount number=\"299\"/><publicationInfo><copyright>Copyright 2021 EDM Publications GmbH All Rights Reserved</copyright><publicationName>SGI Europe</publicationName><publicationLogo><logo><inlineObject><locator><locatorKey><keyName name=\"object-key\"/><keyValue value=\"30679\"/></locatorKey><locatorParameters><parameter name=\"object-type\" value=\"201\"/><parameter name=\"object-smi\" value=\"LOGOS\"/><parameter name=\"componentseq\" value=\"1\"/></locatorParameters></locator></inlineObject></logo></publicationLogo><volume>Vol. 32</volume><issueNumber>Issue 17-18</issueNumber><publicationDate day=\"23\" month=\"04\" year=\"2021\"><dateText>April 23, 2021</dateText></publicationDate><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspaper</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"publicationtype\"><classificationItem><className>Newspapers</className></classificationItem></classification></publicationInfo><classification classificationScheme=\"language\"><classificationItem classificationScheme=\"lang.english\"><className>ENGLISH</className></classificationItem></classification><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"company\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><classCode>CC0002EIT</classCode><className>VF CORP</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"industry\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS315120 APPAREL KNITTING MILLS</className></classificationItem><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>NAICS315250 CUT AND SEW APPAREL MANUFACTURING (EXCEPT CONTRACTORS)</className></classificationItem></classification><classification classificationScheme=\"ticker\"><classificationItem score=\"92\"><className>VFC (NYSE)</className></classificationItem></classification></classificationGroup><classificationGroup classificationScheme=\"indexing-terms\"><classification classificationScheme=\"legal\"><classificationItem score=\"59\"><className>Business &amp;
