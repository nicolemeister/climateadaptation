Now that's doubled to an area the size of the island of Ireland. And there is at least another month of summer, or fire season, to go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">So how did we get here?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When you go beyond the terrifying, primal images of these blazes, you discover that this issue is surprisingly complex, especially for people who live in Europe where wildfires are relatively rare (although that is changing). Global warming is a key factor - but not the only one.</p><p>Wildfires are a feature of life in Australia, which is not surprising when you consider that it is the driest inhabited continent in the world.</p><p>Major fires often occur at this time of year, but they have not been as destructive as we are seeing now.</p><p>There have been many massive wildfire outbreaks since records began in 1851, and more than 800 people are known to have died. Arson has often been a factor.</p><p>Throughout the 20th century these conflagrations grew ever more destructive. In 1939, bushfires on 13 January (\"Black Friday\"), thought to be deliberately set, killed 71 people.</p><p>That death toll was surpassed in 1983, when 75 people lost their lives on Ash Wednesday; again, arson was believed to have played a role.</p><p>In 2009, on \"Black Saturday\", 400 fires killed 178 people. This time the firestarter was caught and jailed.</p><p>During this latest crisis, police in New South Wales and Queensland have charged a number of people with deliberately starting fires, but have rejected as misleading the figure of 183 arrests which has been promoted by social media accounts associated with climate change deniers.</p><p>Police in Victoria also rejected that figure, saying they have made no arrests since September.</p><p> Bushfires have ravaged parts of Kangaroo Island in South Australia</p><p>Aside from these massive wildfires, the Australian government notes that \"(fire) has been an elemental part of the Australian environment for as long as the continent has existed\" and that much of the country's vegetation has, in fact, \"evolved to survive, thrive in and even promote frequent exposure to fire.\"</p><p>The seeds of the eucalyptus simply will not pop and germinate without fire (the Australian wildflower banksia is another of these \"pyrophytic plants\").</p><p>The eucalyptus has been identified as a key contributor to uncontrolled blazes. It is pervasive not only in Australia, but also in California and - thanks to reforestation programmes - Portugal.</p><p>Eucalyptus leaves produce highly combustible oils, and do not easily decompose, enabling fire to spread rapidly up in the canopy and on the ground.</p><p>The scientifically endorsed position of many governments - including in Australia - is that controlled burns are essential, in order to destroy \"fuel loads\", such as dead trees and grass, fallen branches and thick undergrowth, which a wildfire might otherwise consume in order to spread.</p><p> Eucalyptus leaves are eaten by koalas, many of whom have died or been injured in the fires </p><p>Andrew Cunningham Scott, Distinguished Research Professor at the Department of Earth Sciences in the Royal Holloway University of London, says this is an issue the UK and Ireland have to face up to, as \"if you have fuel to burn - then it will burn ... We just allow vegetation to grow up anywhere, and some of this might be quite flammable.\" He also notes many fires are started by portable barbeques.</p><p>Global warming and bushfires around the world</p><p>The global average temperature has increased by 0.8C since 1880, but this is not evenly distributed, and is worse the closer to the poles you get. The increase in Australia (since 1910) has been more than 1C, and this is leading to an increase in the frequency of extreme heat events, such as the record-breaking temperatures last month.</p><p>On December 17th a record national average of 40.9C was measured. Just one day later, that record was smashed when the mercury hit 41.9C.</p><p>Stefan Doerr, Professor of Wildland Fire Science at Swansea University, notes that temperatures in western Canada and Alaska have risen by up to 4C. Forest fires in those northern extremes are well documented, but we are seeing disturbing changes.</p><p>\"Wildfires now burn more frequently, and the average annual area burned has more than doubled since the 1960s\", he says. \"The current rate, extent and severity of fires is beyond anything the ecosystem has evolved with\".</p><p>This also applies to the US, Australia and Europe. None of this is unexpected.</p><p>More than a decade ago, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change warned that climate change was almost certain to increase the intensity and frequency of fires, and made specific reference to Australia; that conclusion that has been endorsed in many subsequent reports.</p><p>Globally, wildfires are actually down.</p><p>The vast majority (70%) occur on grasslands which have little direct impact on humans. These have been declining, in part because grasslands are being developed, which has contributed to a gradual overall decline in the total area destroyed by wildfires. Each year this can still reach a staggering five million square kilometres, an area larger than the European Union.</p><p>However, we are seeing an increase in the size and intensity of fires in forested areas (as we have already noted in Alaska and Canada). And those fires are spreading ever faster, as seen in Portugal in 2017, California in 2018 and south eastern Australia now.</p><p>Andrew Cunningham Scott explains that this is partly because we are seeing more droughts, which cause the fire season to start earlier, and - as vegetation is drier - this causes fires to become larger and more intense.</p><p>Another factor is the generation of firestorms, such as the one currently raging in Australia.</p><p>These occur when the extreme heat and smoke spewed out by a bush fire rise, combining with moisture to create a cloud. This climbs high enough so that water and ice particles collide, creating an electrical charge which is then released as lightning. Firestorms produce little rain, so when this lightning strikes dry earth - it creates new fires.</p><p> Smoke from Australian bushfires blankets Auckland in New Zealand </p><p>Unusual weather events</p><p>Meteorologists have observed that the heatwave in Australia has also been in part caused by unusual - but not unheard of - weather factors. This is a bit technical - but well worth understanding.</p><p>The Indian Ocean Dipole is a periodic shift in the surface temperature of the western part of the Indian Ocean, either up (positive) or down (negative).</p><p>The Australian Bureau of Meteorology says we have been in a period of an almost unprecedentedly aggressive positive phase (higher sea temperatures).</p><p>Why is this important? Because it has the effect of drawing moisture away from the continent and so worsening drought conditions - which are already being exacerbated by global warming.</p><p>Now let\u2019s go roughly 20km straight up, to the stratosphere. Scientists have only recently begun to understand how this part of the atmosphere shapes weather events.</p><p>Last October, meteorologists warned of \"a rare atmospheric phenomenon ... brewing above Antarctica, raising temperatures in the upper atmosphere by 40 degrees.</p><p>\"Such shifts happen roughly every second year above the North Pole, but are rare in the South Pole; scientists don\u2019t know why.</p><p>They predicted that \"the warming above Antarctica will drive hot, dry winds across eastern Australia over the next three months.\"</p><p>Turns out they were right.

The events have coincided with extreme acts of nature hitting the planet globally, making it plain that our footprint on Earth is more and more visible. The IPCC report makes for sobering reading and carries the message that we must act now.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But what we call the Anthropocene - the proposed ecological era that dates humanity's significant impact on Earth and its ecosystems, including climate change - could also be called something else, something darker. Listening to the radio this week, I came across Stephen J Pyne and his research into fire. Professor Pyne is a specialist in environmental history and, most interestingly, the history of fire. He has written more than a dozen books on fire and its history.</p><p>Fire is our most intimate of resources on Earth: we cook our meals with it, heat our homes and make our tools with it. We are the fire ape and the holder of the flame, as Pyne puts it. Fire is unique to our planet, occurring nowhere else in the solar system. It can only exist in nature from the natural presence of life on the continents, so it too has a birth date some 500 million years ago. It was only with the emergence of ourselves that fire began to be harnessed for personal use.</p><p>That personal use allowed us to eat a cooked, meat-rich diet and then turn our attention to clearing landscapes. Fire was the tool that allowed us to mould the Earth as we saw fit. Fire-stick farming, such as that practised by Aboriginal Australians, created great grass plains where animals could graze and be hunted at ease.</p><p>Indeed, when the first British settlers went to Australia, they likened the fire-shaped landscape to England's countryside and parkland.</p><p>However, in shaping the landscape, in changing the setting and surroundings, we unwittingly started the next phase of our climate story: the Pyrocene, a term coined by Pyne.</p><p>The Pyrocene, or fire age, started in small ways, in its first epoch, with the clearing of terrain for agricultural needs. In our own nation, we can look at the ancient and regular setting of gorse fires to clear land for animal grazing.</p><p>This Pyrocene origin did interact with the world around it: it changed landscapes, but it also allowed humanity to go to the top of the food chain. We cooked the animals, but, as Pyne says, we are now cooking the planet.</p><p>The Pyrocene started its second epoch with the emergence of the Industrial Revolution, when our fossil fuels were burned day and night, leading to the eventual tipping point we now find ourselves in ecologically.</p><p>From being the custodian of fire, we have so changed our world that fire is now, as a result of our actions, out of control: 2019/2020 was a unique six-month window in that two major fires types burned on the globe. On one hand, we have the man-made fires of the Amazon, where land was cleared to make way for agricultural grazing, while on the opposite side of the world, climate-induced fires ripped through the Australian bush, burning 18.6 million hectares.</p><p>The Brazilian wildfires were the direct result of human actions, with 80,000 fires set across Brazil in August 2019. The smoke from these Amazonian fires could be seen in Sao Paulo on the opposite side of the country. The Brazilian wildfires were the result of a pro-business approach to opening up the interior of the Amazon. Fire is not an adaptation of the Amazonian forests, and so rather than bring on new life it ended it.</p><p>The climate-induced fires of the Australian bush, on the other hand, point to a worrying trend around the world. These bushfires or wildfires are now a factor of life in many regions of the world. The scale of the Australian bushfires, while not the biggest in Australian history, were the worst in the modern era, eclipsing the 2009 Black Saturday fires, a period I lived through in that land.</p><p>Indeed, nearly 80pc of Australians were affected in some way by the 2019/2020 fires, to the tune of tens of billions of dollars in costs.</p><p>The Pyrocene is not limited to the southern hemisphere. North of the Equator, fires have raged. After all, California, say, has seen wildfire after wildfire rip through the state. Closer to home, one only has to look to the fires in Greece of recent days.</p><p>More than 2,000 people on the Greek island of Evia were forced to evacuate by boat as wildfires raged through the region. July, as reported in this paper, was the worst month for wildfires since records began in 2003.</p><p>In our small nation, we have experienced mini-droughts and record-breaking temperatures in recent years. One only has to think of the recent heatwave that saw the mercury hit 31.4C in Northern Ireland. The authors of the IPCC report stated that, since 1970, global surface temperatures have risen faster than in any other 50-year period in the past 2,000 years. The Pyrocene is now not just a term coined by Pyne, it is a fact of life. We must act now in this Code Red for humanity. We cannot allow the planet to burn. The IPCC report comes in the light of the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015, when we committed as a species to prevent the global temperature rise.</p><p>If we cannot achieve those goals, fire will become all too common a facet of our yearly news cycle. This fire will not bring new life in its long train; ultimately, it will destroy everything. It's not too late to act, but zero hour is nearing. The world-ending fire is but an ember now; it's time to quench it and bring an end to this devastating Pyrocene age.</p>", "publisher": "Irish Independent", "instances": ["The smoke from these Amazonian fires could be seen in Sao Paulo on the opposite side of the country.

There is no doubt climate change must be tackled as an urgent priority but it is equally clear that, despite our best efforts, progress will be slow and gradual. However, other factors that exacerbate these bushfires can be effectively tackled immediately. In particular, I believe, more action should be taken to reduce the fuel load in the bush and forests. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Millions of hectares of bush were burned in the recent fires and 28 lives were lost. Annual bushfires in Australia are an unavoidable natural phenomenon. The explorer Captain James Cook (1728 - 1779) sailing along the east Australian coast in 1770 remarked: \"Smoke by day and fires in the night.\" Particularly bad bushfires in terms of lives lost, homes destroyed and areas of land burned occurred in 1851, 1926, 1939, 1967, 1983 and 2009. The worst fire to date was in 2009 in Victoria where 173 people died and more than 2,000 homes were lost. </p><p>Global warming is exacerbating the bushfire situation, but so are several other factors that are also completely amenable to reform in the immediate term. These factors include: (a) failure to regularly reduce \"fuel load\" in bush and forests; (b) the growing lack of skilled firefighters (most firefighting is voluntary but the firefighters are ageing and fewer volunteers are coming forward); (c) zoning laws allowing greater penetration of housing into the bush; and (d) arson. </p><h>Undergrowth</h><p> Many experts such as Vic Jurskis, a fellow of the Institute of Foresters of Australia identify fuel load as the biggest factor exacerbating the bushfire problem. Fuel load refers to accumulation in the bush of undergrowth, fallen trees and grass killed by previous fires, fallen branches and leaves, etc. This accumulation provides much extra fuel for the next fires. Doubling the available fuel doubles the rate of fire spread and quadruples the intensity. </p><p>In the 1950s and 1960s the Australian Government regularly reduced this fuel load by controlled use of hazard-reduction fires in winter. This precautionary burning is smokey and uncomfortable for nearby suburban areas and also imposes a burden on wildlife. </p><p>And so, under pressure from the Greens, such precautionary prescribed burning has significantly reduced in recent decades. Fuel loads now increase greatly in unburned areas and then erupt into intense summer fires. The 2009 Victorian Bushfires Royal Commission Report identified the failure to reduce fuel load as a factor that intensified the huge 2009 fires. But all that said, it must be acknowledged also that climate change accelerates the danger of bush fires. Australia experienced both its hottest-ever and driest-ever year in 2019 - the next hottest years were 2013, 2000 and 2018 and 2017 in that order. </p><p>Two oscillating meteorological patterns helped to generate Australia's recent extreme conditions as outlined by Graham Redfearn in the Guardian last month. The Indian Ocean Dipole (IOD) was in a positive phase, meaning the Indian Ocean off Australia's northwestern side was colder than normal while the western Indian Ocean off Africa was warmer. </p><p>This condition draws moisture and rainfall away from Australia. And a 2018 Nature Communications paper reported that global warming increases the frequency of extreme IOD events. Global warming also affects another meteorological phenomenon called the Southern Annular Mode in a manner that tends to dry Australia during the winter. </p><h>'Hell for leather' </h><p>There is a distinct preponderance of media opinion that the Australian bushfires confirm our worst fears about the consequences of climate change. Greta Thunberg tweeted: \"We still fail to make the connection between the climate crisis and increased extreme weather events and natural disasters like the Australian fires. That's what has to change. Now.\" </p><p>That's fine, but even if the entire world immediately went \"hell for leather\" at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, which is unlikely to happen, slowing down and reversing global warming would still be a slow process akin to stopping a fast moving ocean super-tanker. </p><p>We must of course acknowledge the role played by climate change and make every effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, but, in the meantime, measures known to directly reduce the extent and severity of the annual Australian bush fires, such as reducing fuel loads, should be implemented now.

This meant that every government department bought into the crusade, so there were nudges and restrictions operating across all areas of life. And it came from the top down, with Putin making his healthy lifestyle a big part of his public image. There is also a crusade against smoking going on. Life expectancy in Russia has increased by five years in that 10-year period, and as the crusade continues it is expected it will also impact massively on crime.</p><p>As we face the usual annual health crisis in this country, and as we reflect once again on a year of record trolley figures, it might make sense to look at scarce health resources in a different way. Rather than increasing supply all the time by pumping more and more money into the system, why not focus a bit more on reducing the demand for healthcare? While we have many well-meaning health promotion programmes in this country, we should consider incentivising people to be healthier. Living a healthy lifestyle is complex. It is bound up with class and privilege and opportunity, and also with a person's physical and genetic ability to exercise. What we can say is there is no doubt that many people who end up in hospital with certain common illnesses might not be there if they had made different choices. And we should make it easier for people to make good choices. One simple example: Why are nicotine products so expensive? Considering how much someone is likely to save the health service by giving up smoking, why don't we, within reason, offer free nicotine patches or gum or spray to anyone who wants it? In general, there hasn't been enough conclusive research to show that external motivators and inducements, like giving people free gym membership or cheaper health insurance if they exercise, absolutely works for everyone. But there's no doubt we should look at making it easier and cheaper to have a healthy lifestyle, and we should look at paying people to get healthier. It will likely save hugely on resources in the longer term.</p><p>THE ENVIRONMENT In a similar vein, we should also make it easier and cheaper for people to live more sustainable lives. The conversation around becoming environmentally friendly has tended to feel quite penal so far.</p><p>Farmers and other groups feel victimised. Excessive carbon taxes can lead to violent protest, as in France. Individuals, in general, also feel that they are being penalised for what is, in reality, a much bigger issue. We shame individuals taking flights while China and Australia increase their massive coal use. We introduce policies to penalise people for using petrol and diesel cars instead of making it cheaper for people to own EVs, currently only something the well-off can afford. Our approach needs to be reframed.</p><p>Maybe we need to reframe how we present the argument, too. Pictures of melting icebergs can seem a bit remote for many people. Look at how the story of the Australian bushfires has brought climate change home to us. We all have friends and relations in Australia, and we can relate to cities and beach resorts being destroyed. Of course, we should care about polar bears but the reality is many people relate better to things that seem closer to home.</p><p>When we talk about the environment, why don't we talk more about the Irish children who have breathing problems exacerbated by pollution here, or about the 800,000 people who die prematurely in Europe every year due to air pollution? CYCLING Now let's combine those two issues of health and environment. Cycling is a no-brainer. It helps the environment and it helps keep people out of our health system by reducing obesity and increasing fitness. So why do we make cycling so difficult? I am a motorist, a cyclist and, most often, a pedestrian.</p><p>I walk a lot of places around Dublin that I wouldn't dare to cycle, because, as everyone says, sometimes you are taking your life in your hands on a bike. I am also on both sides of the angry and aggressive behaviour of some cyclists and motorists.</p><p>There is a heightened air of aggravation on the roads around Dublin, motorists getting furious, cyclists kicking and banging on cars, everyone going too fast, screaming obscenities, and little patience or respect much of the time. This is partly because motorists and cyclists are sharing a space that is unsuitable for sharing.</p><p>Making our towns and cities, and indeed country roads, cycling friendly should be far more of a priority for the Government. And we should also have a conversation about how to foster a bit more mutual respect on our roads.</p><p>TECHNOLOGY This might be stating the obvious, but we should all become much more mindful about our tech use in 2020. There is no doubt now that technology and specifically social media are adding hugely to mental health issues among young people. On top of that, most of us pay no attention to how we and our data are being used by surveillance capitalists.</p><p>On one hand we are told that 2020 will be the year that governments finally start clamping down on big tech, but still nothing happens, so in the meantime we probably need to start taking some more responsibility ourselves. But on we go, blithely clicking through privacy policies without reading them or thinking about them. It sounds as if the next big issue in tech is going to be location data.</p><p>Just two weeks ago, The New York Times was presented with a trove of location data with more than 50bn location pings from the phones of more than 12m Americans. This kind of information is available to bad actors, without your knowledge. While many 'It's not safe for anyone to access this much information about you' young people say they are not too concerned about privacy because they have nothing to hide, and you may agree with them, whether you have a secret life or not it's not safe for anyone to be able to access this much information about your life and the lives of your children. Would you willingly wear a location tracker that allowed everyone from paedophiles to kidnappers to blackmailers to access information about your every move?

I think a great intention all of us could set, going into 2020, is to mind our connections - to each other, to elderly neighbours, to the soft contacts who are part of your daily life in shops and cafes and on the bus, to nature, to our families, friends and colleagues, to some sense of values, and to those who need connection themselves, whether they be homeless, lonely, vulnerable, in a bad place.</p><p>Let's feed our souls and make ourselves a bit happier in 2020 by taking time in our busy lives to feed and water those connections.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Independent (Ireland)", "instances": ["We shame individuals taking flights while China and Australia increase their massive coal use.

A BBC spokesman said Mosley will \"systematically infect himself with some of the most extraordinary, powerful and surprising parasites of them all\" including tapeworms, leeches, and lice for the show, which examines their possible medical benefits. It is part of a season of science shows on BBC Two and Four, including a five-part series called Human Universe and a two-part show about Australian bushfires. &lt;strong&gt;Police chief to be shot with Taser to raise moneyUSA: &lt;/strong&gt; Knightstown police chief Danny Baker has used pig roasts and golf tournaments to augment his department's shrinking budget, but badly in need of $9,000 ( 6,600) for a squad car, he's reprising his most shocking fundraising approach to date: Getting shot by a stun gun. The jocular 63-year-old and another Knightstown official were planning to have a detective shoot them with a Taser at a free event last night in the middle school gym in their small eastern Indiana town. Spectators - who Baker hopes will feel compelled to donate - will get a firsthand look at how 50,000 volts of low-amp electricity affects the human body. It's a shame we have to go to the extent of having fundraisers and getting electrified and so forth, but with small-town budgets you have to do something to get by,\" said Baker, a lifelong Knightstown resident who has been a police official for 35 years. While Baker concedes his fundraisier is extreme, he says it will also educate the crowd, which will also get to see a police dog demonstration."]}, {"relevance_score": 20, "title": "Inferno victims return to razed homes after looting reports", "published": "2009-02-12", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">AS some of the victims of the Australian bushfires were being allowed back to sift through the remains of their razed homes yesterday, policewarned about the possibility of looters targeting properties in the disaster zone.  </p><p>Many evacuated residents were discovering that they were now homeless after the weekend's devastating bushfires, which killed 181 people.

Temperatures were expected to hit 45C with gusts of 50kph predicted. </p><p>Tommy pulled back the curtains and looked out on the postcard-pretty views of brooding Mount Disappointment in the distance. On the horizon, miles from their home, he could see black smoke rising over the hills. He went outdoors to check the land around his 26-acre farm. </p><p>Under the searing February sky, his parched fields shimmered in the dead air. In a nearby field, his pony Dan whinnied and trotted up and down the side of the fence sensing danger in the air. </p><p>But the smoke was still so far away Tommy had no concerns for their safety and carried on with his day. </p><p>When he went back indoors, Fran was on the telephone. A local neighbour had called,advising them to take precautions in case the fires came closer. They filled the baths and sinks with water, scattered soaked towels around the house, and connected up hoses around the yard. </p><p>By early afternoon, Fran decided to head into town. With the fires still miles from their home, Tommy would stay behind with Dan and secure the property. He loaded the pony into a trailer attached to his Toyota pick-up and went back indoors. </p><p>Just as the clock hit 4pm, the sky turned black with smoke as a thick blanket of ash blotted out the sun. Tommy stepped outdoors. Seconds later, blazing balls of fire, fanned by violent gusts, started tearing through the air, engulfing the house. </p><p>\"I turned around to run and then bang, the roof came flying off the house,\" he says. \"There were flames everywhere. It happened so quickly. One minute it was miles away, then it was on us, before you could say \"Jack Robinson\". </p><p>\"The noise was ferocious. Imagine the sound of a massive jet taking off from an airport. It was that only worse. The roars were deafening. </p><p>\"I jumped into the jeep and put the foot down, with the pony behind me. The fire was chasing us, and on either side of the road, the trees were lit up like Christmas trees, with flames leaping from their branches. I couldn't see a thing.\" </p><p>Tommy drove and drove hrough a torrent of flying debris, past charred corpses, melting cars and exploding trees. After travelling forfour kilometres, he finally reached the safety of a nearby village having escaped what some survivors likened to a \"terrifying nuclear attack\". Miraculously, he walked away with nothing more than a bump on his head. Even his pony Dan escaped intact. </p><p>\"I should have listened more carefully to him,\" he says. \"Horses have a sixth sense. They're a wee bit smarter than we are. He knew something was very wrong and the air was getting way too hot. </p><p>\"When I think back now, I should have left earlier. I was going around the house, grabbing passports and house deeds, doing stupid things. It took me completely by surprise because one minute it was so far away and the next it was on us.\" </p><p>Yesterday, Tommy and Fran returned to the once-idyllic hilltop where their home used to stand. Today it is a place of horror and desecration, where grief-stricken refugees -- mothers, fathers, son and daughters -- howl in agony when they imagine the torturous deaths endured by their loved ones. </p><p>There is nothing left of the Doherty's house, but amid the rubble of a burnt-out barn, Tommy foundthe family'smost cherished heirloom in perfect condition, his father's old sidecar which he had shipped to Australia from Donegal. \"I couldn't believe it was standing there, barely touched, when everything else is destroyed.  </p><p>\"The old boy must have been watching over it. I lost all my old pictures from Ireland, and my tapes of Niall Toibin and Gay Byrne. Even the phone numbers of my 10 sisters back home have been burned but we have managed to let them know we are OK. </p><p>\"But we don't give a monkeys about the material things. How could you when you see all those lives that have been lost around you' Our neighbours were burned to death and we know lots of people who have lost their children.\" </p><p>This weekend, a massive police inquiry is still underway to establish whether Australia's worst-ever bush fires were started by arsonists. </p><p>But, Tommy, a father of four grown-up children, is not certain anybody is to blame.  </p><p>\"The rumours are spreading nearly as quickly as the fires themselves but a lot of it is hearsay. We know there are sick people out there but the heat in this country has been so intense these last few weeks, you could drop a can on the ground and it would melt.

People always play the blame game in situations like this but we just don't have answers and maybe we never will.\" </p><p>Staying with their daughter, the Dohertys have vowed to put their lives back together and rebuild their home. </p><p>\"Financially we will be OK. The house was insured. Mentally, the scars will be there for a long time. When you come so close to death, it feels very strange to be alive. But we are alive and we have to be very grateful for that. </p><p>\"We wouldn't move back to Ireland at this stage of our lives. This is home now.
