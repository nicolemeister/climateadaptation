Reports that administrators are considering the claims of streaming services such as Amazon Prime as candidates for future World Cup bidding would have sent tremors through the marketplace.

It's hard to find fault in what the likes of Prime have produced in terms of quality of presentation, as was also the case with Sky or BT and now TNT as far as the UK market is concerned.

This perspective is all formed via social media which can be prone to a hysterical edge but, at the same time, nor can it be discounted as it does offer an insight into realities on the ground. There have been access and exit glitches reported in Marseille, Nice, and Bordeaux, teething issues in some regard but there have also been reports of water bottles being confiscated and over-the-top officiousness.

Last year provided a fascinating study in how everything can go wrong when a sports team is unequipped to handle the psychological rigours of life on the mountain top. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Japan's victory can be traced back to a February morning in leafy Surrey where Japan coaches Jamie Joseph and Tony Brown stood alongside Eddie Jones at Pennyhill Park, gratefully devouring the English game plan that would expose Joe Schmidt's Ireland. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">England's destructive display in Dublin a few days later was the beginning of a tortuous downward spiral that became the sixth and final year of Schmidt's ground breaking watch over Irish rugby. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Afterwards, amidst a transcendent night for the host nation, Joseph entered the media room to further twist the knife. </p><p>\"We've been preparing for this game for a hell of a lot longer than the Irish have,\" said the Kiwi. \"I said to the players: 'We've been focusing on today basically for the last year and probably subconsciously for the last three years, and Ireland have been thinking about us since Monday.'\" </p><p>Eventually the clich\u00e9 will catch you cold. The Ireland camp fed the press the same line ad nauseam. Everyone knows the 'one game at a time' mantra is a straight bat, a boring answer to avoid controversy, but Joseph allowed the platitude to get lost in translation and flipped it into a motivational tool. </p><p>\"When we got ahead the Irish tried to take us on physically and I think emotionally we were prepared for that,\" he added, telling no word of a lie. </p><p>The narrative cannot be rewritten; brittle Ireland came unstuck, unable to recover from a six-day turnaround after beating Scotland in typically attritional manner. Johnny Sexton and Joey Carbery were not fit enough to start with Carbery unleashed for the last 20 minutes but, one year later, his ankle has still not healed. </p><p>In the mixed zone the 23-year-old was asked about the shock ending when he kicked the ball dead from behind Ireland's try line: 'Not think the pack could march 100 metres down field and secure a draw?' </p><h>Flushed faces </h><p>\"I definitely thought we could have but when the ball came to me they were up in my face,\" Carbery replied. \"I didn't want to risk it with a short kick or anything like that and concede [possession]. I haven't looked back at it yet but at the time I thought it was the right option.\" </p><p>The subtext was Carlos Spencer - the legendary Auckland Blue once ran from his dead ball area before finishing an insane sequence 100 metres down field - but when Carbery glanced around he only saw flushed faces and dark green jerseys drenched by sweat inside a stadium up a steep hill overlooking the Shizuoka prefecture. </p><p>Ireland were camped on their own line ever since Jordan Larmour's loose pass was intercepted by Kenki Fukuoka - the giant killer himself - who hared off on a 60-metre dash for glory. The hounds gave chase. Larmour began tightening up as Fukuoka accelerated but a dramatic lunge by Keith Earls saw all three men tumble over each other, landing in a heap five metres out. </p><p>With 79.55 on the clock Tadhg Beirne grabbed back possession and Dave Kilcoyne charged into contact as the gong sounded. Conor Murray zipped a pass to Carbery but none of his options - a speculative right to left punt pass, a risky chip - would deliver victory. </p><p>That he saw no alternative to protecting a bonus point defeat to Japan reflected how far the pre-tournament number one team in the world had fallen. </p><p>Calamity reigned. On 57 minutes, with Ireland clinging to a 12-9 lead, CJ Stander spun off a scrum and popped a pass for Chris Farrell who turned into his Munster teammate. Angus Gardner signalled for accidental offside and a Japan put-in deep in the Irish 22. </p><p>Everyone could sense what was coming. This was their Italia '90 moment happening in real time. Fumiaki Tanaka arrived at scrumhalf to send Ryoto Nakamura barrelling into Garry Ringrose and Farrell, who did not recover. Another charge, by Lomano Lemeki, forced the green line of defenders onto their whitewash. </p><p>Tadhg Furlong, Iain Henderson and Rhys Ruddock were dragged into desperate resistance to halt Michael Leitch. The light footed Tanaka switched the point of attack once more as Kazuki Himeno was somehow stopped by Earls. The winger instantly hopped up and onside without touching or impeding anyone. </p><p>\"Advantage. Offside. Number 14,\" said Gardner somehow fingering Earls. </p><p>It did not matter but the advantage prompted Nakamura's skip pass, which took out Murray and Earls, forcing Rob Kearney into a man and ball tackle on Tim Lafaele, who offloaded for Fukuoka to scamper over. Yu Tamura's clean strike from the far left made it 16-12. There was 30 minutes remaining but Ireland were visibly shattered while the Brave Blossoms surged from the waves of energy rolling down from their delirious crowd. </p><h>Politely retreated </h><p>It was a scrum on 34 minutes that turned the usually reserved locals into a weapon. Inside the Ecopa you knew something magical was happening. Ireland led 12-6 when Murray fed the ball in and his pack got the initial surge but all the Australian referee saw was the Japanese frontrow emerging from beneath a disengaged Cian Healy. </p><p>\"Their loosehead prop steps out, so they try to attack from the side,\" the Japan camp had warned, planting a seed in Gardner's brain. </p><p>Penalty. The scene ended with Leitch and Lappies Labuschange, the Fijian and Afrikaner co-captains, wrestling the ball from an isolated CJ Stander. The rest of the Irish pack had politely retreated. The rout still seemed impossible but the mood had irrevocably changed as both Japanese props were embraced by turbocharged teammates. </p><p>Japan had found their mojo. Understandably, it took Jack Carty several months to rediscover his. The 27-year-old's first ever competitive Test start began as well as he could have hoped with flashes of his natural footballing ability creating tries for Ringrose and Kearney. </p><p>It was the great unknown that exposed him; Carty had never sat in the commander's chair for such a big game. He was not alone. Every weakness showed as desperation became a disease that spread like wildfire. With Rory Best and Peter O'Mahony focusing on survival in the trenches, the officer class went missing on a night that Japanese sport can cherish forever. </p><p>Being on the receiving end of a sporting upset that reverberated around the globe would make you want to hop on a bullet train to anywhere.

It is hard to quantify any activity related to Olympic competition as essential, if the opportunity exists to reschedule it in the calendar.</p><p>The one note of disquiet in yesterday's postponement, then, came in the unnecessary deadline applied to when the Games will be held. 'A date beyond 2020, but not later than summer 2021, to safeguard the health of the athletes, everybody involved in the Olympic Games and the international community,' read the statement from the IOC and the Tokyo 2020 Organising Committee.

We do not know how the world will look then, what its priorities will be, or how best it will be able to safeguard the health of athletes or spectators.</p><p>So the IOC statement was something more than shoganai. It was arrogance and posturing by administrators who cannot comprehend that coronavirus does not care for their egos or best-laid plans, for the money they have spent, for the edifices they have constructed. It is they who must now accept and move on, they who must rationalise their new reality.</p><p>The Tokyo Games will take place when it is ready, when we are ready, when coronavirus is ready.

France were playing Italy in Rome on the Sunday - why were they in Dublin? \"Le craic!\" A game with a little bit of bite, two Celtic teams going at each other, some real atmosphere (ahem) at the Aviva and then a shed load of beers with the natives afterwards. They needed four tickets to add to the eight they already had - maybe the IRFU or Ticketmaster had a few Row Z singles still floating around. When I got out of the IRFU offices, they had gone but there were five Italian men walking by. A left onto Shelbourne Road and a German couple decked out in rugby paraphernalia were handing their tickets to the guys at the turnstile.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dublin gives up a lot to Paris, London and Rome but as a sports or blow-out destination, we are in a league of our own. People come here from all over Europe for whatever reason.</p><p>Of course, most of the 5,000 Italians who had tickets for this weekend's postponed match will still travel to Dublin from today on. And if you know your Italian rugby - the Italian game's heartland is in the north of the country where the coronavirus has taken hold. There is a good chance that several of them could have the coronavirus. That 5,000, though, is more or less the same amount of Irish people who came back from skiing in the Italian Alps over the last few weeks.</p><p>Did the Government jump the gun a bit? All other games are still going ahead at the time of writing, including the France-Ireland game. The French government's stipulation of a ban on 5,000 people in a confined space was peculiar.</p><p>A full soccer programme went ahead and Ireland will, it seems, play there next Saturday week.</p><p>I think that the general population realise the response to the coronavirus has been disproportionate to the risks involved. In a bad year, there could be as many as 650,000 who die worldwide from 'flu.</p><p>This current situation is unprecedented due to the speed and the rise in infection, particularly in China.</p><p>I, like many people in this country, have no real fear of catching the virus much less dying from it, but I do however have loved ones and people connected to me who would be vulnerable and at risk. On that basis, I accept the over-reaction and if that is what is required to stop it, well then so be it.</p><p>The reasoning behind the strict measures are obvious. The human toll is prime amongst all. The health services of every country could be thrown into the abyss if the situation escalates. Then there is industry, commerce and trade - nobody escapes here.</p><p>Gritted The IRFU stated that they were \"perfectly happy\" to comply with Government advice and postpone the Ireland-Italy game this Saturday. If they had said \"happy\" to comply that would have conveyed the message, \"perfectly happy\" and you get a sense of gritted teeth.</p><p>Even though there is a lot going on this year, the (EURO)20m cost to the Dublin economy due to the postponement is a big hit and even waiting until September might not fully recoup expenditure already paid out.</p><p>Despite the lowly nature of the Italian team, the match was a 51,700 sellout. Work the figures on an average of (EURO)100 per ticket and the gate stands at (EURO)5 million. Anyone suggesting that you play the match behind closed doors obviously comes from the Sinn F\u00e9in school of mathematics.</p><p>Handing back (EURO)5m in gate receipts is bad for business. Being unable to fulfil your broadcasting obligations is bad for business. Having to forego all the corporate hospitality and beer sales on site is bad for business.</p><p>The IRFU posted net income of (EURO)87.5m for their June 2019 accounts. Taking out exceptional items, the Union posted a surplus of (EURO)3.2m. It is hard to know what the IRFU will do with the gate receipts. How much will they refund to patrons? The hope is that the game will be played in September but, you can be guaranteed, the match will be played.</p><p>The IRFU could lose up to (EURO)5m if the match is played in September - twice that figure if it is not played at all. If the Union only posted a trading surplus of (EURO)3.2m last year and the Italy game is proposed for September it would leave them running a significant loss for year end June 2020. Let's look a little deeper at the Six Nations and the financial rewards.

France were playing Italy in Rome on the Sunday - why were they in Dublin? \"Le craic!\" A game with a little bit of bite, two Celtic teams going at each other, some real atmosphere (ahem) at the Aviva and then a shed load of beers with the natives afterwards. They needed four tickets to add to the eight they already had - maybe the IRFU or Ticketmaster had a few Row Z singles still floating around.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When I got out of the IRFU offices they had gone, but there were five Italian men walking by. A left onto Shelbourne Road and a German couple decked out in rugby paraphernalia were handing their tickets to the guys at the turnstile.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dublin gives up a lot to Paris, London and Rome, but as a sports or blow-out destination, we are in a league of our own. People come here from all over Europe for whatever reason.</p><p>Of course, most of the 5,000 Italians who had tickets for this weekend's postponed match will still travel to Dublin from today on. And if you know your Italian rugby - the Italian game's heartland is in the north of the country where the coronavirus has taken hold. There is a good chance that several of them could have the coronavirus. That 5,000, though, is more or less the same amount of Irish people who came back from skiing in the Italian Alps over the last few weeks.</p><p>Did the government jump the gun a bit? All other games are still going ahead, including the France-Ireland game. The French government's stipulation of a ban on 5,000 people in a confined space was peculiar. A full soccer programme went ahead and Ireland will, it seems, play there next Saturday week.</p><p>I think that the general population realise that the response to the coronavirus has been disproportionate to the risks involved. In a bad year, there could be as many as 650,000 who die worldwide from flu.</p><p>This current situation is unprecedented due to the speed and the rise in infection, particularly in China.</p><p>I, like many people in this country, have no real fear of catching the virus, much less dying from it, but I do however have loved ones and people connected to me who would be vulnerable and at risk. On that basis, I accept the over-reaction and if that is what is required to stop it, well then so be it.</p><p>The reasoning behind the strict measures are obvious. The human toll is prime amongst all. The health services of every country could be thrown into the abyss if the situation escalates. Then there is industry, commerce and trade - nobody escapes here.</p><p>The IRFU stated that they were \"perfectly happy\" to comply with government advice and postpone the Ireland-Italy game this Saturday. If they had said \"happy\" to comply, that would have conveyed the message. \"Perfectly happy\" and you get a sense of gritted teeth.</p><p>Even though there is a lot going on this year, the (EURO)20m cost to the Dublin economy due to the postponement is a big hit, and even waiting until September might not fully recoup expenditure already paid out.</p><p>Despite the lowly nature of the Italian team, the match was a 51,700 sell-out. Work the figures on an average of (EURO)100 per ticket and the gate stands at (EURO)5m. Anyone suggesting that you play the match behind closed doors obviously comes from the Sinn Fein school of mathematics.</p><p>Handing back (EURO)5m in gate receipts is bad for business. Being unable to fulfil your broadcasting obligations is bad for business. Having to forego all the corporate hospitality and beer sales on site is bad for business.</p><p>The IRFU posted net income of (EURO)87.5m for their June 2019 accounts. Taking out exceptional items, the Union posted a surplus of (EURO)3.2m. It is hard to know what the IRFU will do with the gate receipts. How much will they refund to patrons? The hope is that the game will be played in September but, you can be guaranteed, the match will be played.</p><p>The IRFU could lose up to (EURO)5m if the match is played in September - twice that figure if it is not played at all. If the Union only posted a trading surplus of (EURO)3.2m last year and the Italy game is proposed for September, it would leave them running a significant loss for year end June 2020.</p><p>Let's look a little deeper at the Six Nations and the financial rewards.

It's more likely Laidlaw's ambition was to be a star first with Jed-Forest and then Scotland. And the fact that he saw service across 245 first class games with Edinburgh, Gloucester and Clermont in between the two was no harm. Pile on 75 caps for his country and that's more than the average man could manage in his wildest dreams. He deserves a spin in Japan. Laidlaw looked happy enough last week to be making the announcement. So did Beauden Barrett who will be squeezing Suntory Sungoliath into his match plan between finishing the Super Rugby season in Auckland and picking up his All Black career again next year. He will be able to catch up with Brodie Retallick, and a growing band of Europeans.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A week may not pass these days without another kite being flown about the global season and how it will be financed, but the one near certainty is that yet another high profile player will be packing his bags for Japan.</p><p>It is remarkable that while the rest of the world is busy tightening belts, straitened by Covid, Japan is stuffing its face and expanding its waistline. Wondering about what draws players to that country is a throwback to asking the then 59-year-old former supermodel Jerry Hall what first attracted her to the 86-year-old billionaire Rupert Murdoch. So how can Japan keep reeling off fat salaries for short term contracts? Is this a glamourous little sideshow or does it have any merit? And how is it that Ireland - a country that spews out a decent number of high quality players into rugby's stratosphere - hardly features? Japan is unique in the world game, a sport driven essentially by big business for which the team becomes part of the brand. So it's the company employees who support the team, not the folks who happen to live in the neighbourhood. And the players are employees as well. In times of economic strife the company can cut wages or jobs or whatever they want, without the influence of the outside forces that affect the rest of the professional sports world. And clearly they are slow to chop off the hand that feeds their ego: the success of the company team.</p><p>So what happens when the game genuinely moves onto a professional footing in two years' time? As it stands the shape of that new pro game is shifting. Originally it was supposed to be 12 new franchises based in the World Cup cities. Each is expected to have a stadium with a minimum 15,000 capacity. But by the time it's actually up and running we might find that the companies have not given up their control of the product, and instead it looks like a different shade of what they have now.</p><p>\"I was chatting to my Japanese teacher about this,\" says Cashel man Paddy Butler, who swapped Pau in France for Yamaha Jubilo in Japan earlier this year. \"For the average Japanese person the focus is to get into one of those companies, to work for one of those big outfits in the Top League because they know that's a job for life. That's the way their mindset is. And if you leave you have no chance of ever getting back in - that's the way the loyalty thing is with them.</p><p>\"So I wonder what's going to happen with that move to professionalise it (the game)? Will players be turning down the company job in favour of becoming a professional player and how that will correlate? It's a completely different culture between the two.\"</p><p>Not for the first time, World Rugby needs Japan to deliver. In summer 2017 when Ireland toured there, we were struck not just by the lack of readiness on the ground for the 2019 World Cup but the mindset that went with it. Rugby in Japan is so hierarchical and set in its ways it makes the IRFU of the mid-1990s - the lads faced with the overnight advent of a professional game - look like wild things with revolution on their minds and adventure in their hearts.</p><p>So when World Rugby were recently busy telling us of the surge in interest in the game in Asia on the back of the World Cup, we were a little dubious. Not about the numbers tuning in to the event itself, rather the numbers who will have a 'rashers' what's going on in the game within a couple of seasons of the show leaving town.</p><p>The Rugby World Cup last autumn created a false picture of the game in Japan. Even World Cups in long established countries will do that. This time around however everyone was struck by the stoicism of a nation whose observance of 'the show must go on' motto was unique. World Rugby went from sweating buckets over the carnage caused by Typhoon Hagibis to singing and dancing over the quality of the run-in to the finish - which was first class. Now they need some follow-on. They need the game in that country to look like it can catch on.</p><p>The flow of talent from the Northern Hemisphere might help. Hadleigh Parkes from Wales, England's Freddie Burns and George Kruis, are all joining Laidlaw. Previously the fact that Japan's financial year kicked off on April 1 was a problem in contracting players from the Northern Hemisphere. The company teams needed players on site by then but contracts on this side of the equator ran beyond that date. Japan seemingly is loosening up on that. Now they need the locals to get on board.</p><p>\"With our team there's only seven or eight professional Japanese players, but the club asked a few more and a lot turned them down because they felt that if they left (the company) they wouldn't get back in,\" Butler says. \"It could be a weird dynamic with that. Soccer here is professional and they don't work in companies so maybe it will be ok, but I know the rugby players have a very strong relationship with the company. Your main objective from university is to get into one of these companies. And that's it, sorted.\"</p><p>But is the playing experience useful for those who are stopping a while before moving back to bigger leagues? Like Munster's new boys Damian de Allende and RG Snyman? Dave Dillon, coach at champion club KobelcoSteelers, sounds like he could be Irish, played a bit of club rugby for Armagh and Blackrock and taught PE in St Michael's in Dublin. Like a great big chunk of the world's rugby coaching and playing fraternity, he's a Kiwi. He maintains the J League is not a sleepover.</p><p>\"Both of those boys made a big impact here and I'd say they'll be the better for it going to Munster,\" he says. \"I think it depends on the individual. I'd like to think we play a fast brand of rugby but it's physical in Japan. And it's a good standard. A lot of people seem to think rugby here is a pretty new sport but in Kobe they've been playing it for 95 years. It was an outlet for the steel workers and the guys have a very strong bond with the company.\"</p><p>Dillon's vision for the future of the new professional regime sounds like it won't move too far away from the existing base of the business and the team being joined at the hip. And you'd expect that will have an influence on the influx of players who might not be marquee names.</p><p>\"That will be interesting,\" Dillon says. \"On the back of the World Cup the players that are coming over are well established internationals and it just happens that they are from the Northern Hemisphere but how does that look moving forward? Normally there's a big Southern Hemisphere influence in Japan.</p><p>\"I guess with Covid-19 and how the global calendar looks, and what competitions are in what spaces - that will have an influence.</p><p>\"But if you look at Greig Laidlaw, he's not just a quality player but, knowing him, he's a good man and he'll have a real ability to lead. Recruitment is above my pay scale but we have a good set up here and in any organisation it's about many heads getting together and making the right decision.\"</p><p>The reality is that largely you stick to what you know. So if Japan has been dominated by coaches from Australia, New Zealand and South Africa then the imports will be coming from there as well.</p><p>\"I think as a coaching group you want to have affiliation or you want to really know the person that's coming in.

This time around however everyone was struck by the stoicism of a nation whose observance of 'the show must go on' motto was unique. World Rugby went from sweating buckets over the carnage caused by Typhoon Hagibis to singing and dancing over the quality of the run-in to the finish - which was first class.

Fabien Galthie, an icon of the French game, had been appointed as head coach and the former scrumhalf set out his stall by placing his faith in a youthful squad with a new captain in 26-yearold Toulon flanker Charles Ollivon, who had only 11 caps to his name prior to this championship.</p><p>That sense of excitement could be felt in the Stade de France in the hours before kick-off on that opening weekend.

Having built a 28-10 lead on the hour mark, this France side once again went off the boil, conceding two late tries as the Azzurri mounted a late fightback.</p><p>France have looked awesome at times but they have also looked vulnerable and there is a nagging suspicion that for all the talents of Bernard le Roux, Gregory Alldritt, Dupont, Romain Ntamack, Virimi Vakatawa and Teddy Thomas, they still don't look fit enough to go the distance.

We have reduced player and staff salaries across all of Irish Rugby [the largest overhead] and we are now looking at how to further cut our spend across all programmes and elements of the game that we support. </p><p>\"No decisions have yet been made, but as Philip said, everything is under review. Our aim will be to cut costs rather than discontinue any programme, but some tough decisions may need to be taken.\" </p><p>Browne has also stated that no organisation this reliant on clicking turnstiles will survive another six months performing to an empty gallery. </p><p>Player salaries are in for a second hefty dent after Christmas. The IRFU and Keogh - a rapid Harlequins winger in between two stints with Leinster - ironed out a fair deal during the summer, certainly in comparison to what players in other nations had to swallow (see panel). </p><p>\"We operate a lot differently from England,\" says Keogh. \"We rely on the international game to support the provinces and the community game whereas the English clubs almost compete against the international game.\" </p><h>Full houses </h><p>Different models are equally reliant on full houses. Hopley states \"irrevocable damage\" has already been inflicted upon the English clubs while Mick Dawson, the Leinster chief executive, revealed losses of EUR 9 million. </p><p>\"At the moment our income streams are slashed, cut in half,\" Dawson told the Inside Business podcast. \"We normally have about 12,500 season tickets so we decided not to do that [this season] for the simple reason that we don't know when people will get through the turnstiles again. So we formed a Leinster club and about 6,000 people signed up for that. Those people are buying the right to get first crack at any tickets that do become available.

However, from the moment the game's governing body scheduled the tournament for Japan in September and October there was always a strong chance it would be affected by the weather. This is typhoon season after all.</p><p>Hagibis is something of a freak and its rates of expansion have left meteorologists in awe, but it is typhoon No 19 of 2019. Climate scientists have found that typhoons are reaching their maximum intensities further north than they used to and that puts Japan right in the firing line.</p><p>Even before the tournament, organisers were speaking about having contingency plans in place to deal with extreme weather events. They told us they were prepared.</p><p>When the time came, the curtain was pulled back and revealed nothing.</p><p>France v England and New Zealand v Italy were cancelled, Scotland v Japan might follow next.</p><p>One team has been eliminated as a result of the decision, another could follow. Italy might have had a slim chance of making the quarter-finals, but they were entitled to the on-pitch opportunity to qualify.</p><p>The odds on Scotland progressing were much shorter, but Gregor Townsend and his players could be heading home without ever getting a chance to progress.</p><p>In the context of a storm that will cost the Japanese economy tens of billions and probably lead to death and destruction, the World Cup is small beer. But for those involved it is the culmination of at least four years' work, for many it is a once-in-a-lifetime shot.</p><p>For Leonardo Ghiraldini, it was a chance to sign off with his 105th cap against the world's best. The Italian hooker had worked slavishly to return from injury in time, but yesterday the rug was pulled from under him.</p><p>Sergio Parisse will never play at a World Cup again. It was he, perhaps, who voiced the frustration of the players best yesterday when he opined that the game would have gone ahead if it was the All Blacks who needed four or five points to progress. More importantly, he pointed his finger at the organisers and their lack of a contingency plan.</p><p>\"It is ridiculous that a decision of this nature has been made because it isn't like the fans arrived yesterday. It is ridiculous that there was no plan B, because it isn't news that typhoons hit Japan.</p><p>\"Sure everyone might think that Italy versus New Zealand being cancelled counts for nothing because we'd have lost anyway, but we deserved to be respected as a team. We had the chance to play in a big stadium, against a great team.</p><p>\"The alternative is plan B. When you organise a World Cup you should have one in place.\"</p><p>World Rugby said all four unions were on board with the decision, but it's clear there is some discord in the dressing-rooms. Supporters, who have shelled out thousands to be here, will be reimbursed but the players can never get the blood, sweat and tears expended to get here back.</p><p>And the Rugby World Cup's integrity will be on the floor if the Scots are eliminated without getting a chance to face the hosts. Despite the social media theories, there is no grand conspiracy at work to get Japan into the last eight or give New Zealand a break. This just looks like grand incompetence.</p><p>World Rugby says the game will be on Sunday or not at all, Scotland coach Townsend is citing force majeure in calling for it to be moved to Monday if it can't be played in Yokohama on Sunday.</p><p>There are alternative venues being lined up within the city and the likelihood is it will be played behind closed doors if it's played at all. A call will be made on Sunday morning.</p><p>If it doesn't go ahead, it will be a scandal. The World Cup is already under pressure from outside forces, it could struggle to recover from this one. Already, the quarter-finals are imbalanced. Joe Schmidt has conceded that Ireland will be at a disadvantage to New Zealand if they play next Saturday or Sunday, given the opposition will have a weekend off. England have gone for a mini-camp while Australia are taking on Georgia, France can recharge the batteries before they meet Wales.</p><p>Like life, sport is not fair and it's about how you adapt. But while public safety is paramount, World Rugby should have done more to ensure the tournament is beyond reproach.</p><p>\"We looked pretty exhaustively at all the options. What is important to note is that where we are is in accordance with what we said we would do before the tournament,\" said tournament director Alan Gilpin.</p><p>\"Doing that on this scale, with so many teams to move around, and to be able to deliver safely the exit of 12 teams after the pool stage, we couldn't guarantee contingency plans consistently. If we can't do it for all, we can't do it for any.</p><p>\"We have looked again at the potential to apply some consistency to our contingency plan across all the games and we treat all the matches fairly.</p><p>\"Italy are in the same position as Scotland are in. It is a huge match and we would love to play that game. But we won't treat that match any differently.\"</p><p>The Italians are right to feel hard done by. If they are eliminated, the Scots are correct to kick up a fuss.

Earlier in the week, it seemed as if they could be the team pondering whether their tournament was over without a tackle being made in anger but, thanks to the changing course of Typhoon Hagibis, instead it's Scotland anxiously waiting to find out if their deciding fixture is to be cancelled and they've seen the back of this competition after only three games played.

Furthermore Super Typhoon Hagibis, the biggest of the 19 to have hit Japan in their rainy season, is estimated to be three times as fierce as the typhoon which caused the loss of three lives and massive disruption across the greater Tokyo area the week before the World Cup started. This World Cup has also been unlucky in that the typhoons have continued later into October than is normally the case. However, given the inherent risks in hosting the tournament at this time of year, and that World Rugby and the organising committee have had near on a decade to plan for this, their supposedly \"robust contingency plans\" appear to have consisted of saying another mass. Relocating matches to other venues or deferring them for 24 or 48 hours are options which appear to have been ruled out entirely, on the basis that this would be logistically too difficult.

South Africa were already due a helpful 12-day turnaround between beating Canada and their quarter-final, while the All Blacks will now enjoy a free weekend and a 13-day build-up to their quarter-final.

Torrential rain caused flooding throughout the country. In Toyko, the Sumida river overflowed and cars were submerged totally in some towns. The death toll tragically is around 80 but thousands are stranded, wet, cold, with no electricity and many with homes that have been washed away. But the Irish fans are still there and so our love affair with the Land of the Rising Sun shows no sign of abating.</p><p>Such natural disasters are called \"acts of God\" to distinguish them from man-made disasters like the Omagh bombings, the Bhopal gas leak, Chernobyl and others.</p><p>Research suggests that man-made disasters are more likely to disturb the human equilibrium and cause mental health problems than are naturally occurring events like earthquakes, mudslides and hurricanes. This is surprising since the unpredictability of natural disasters and the sense of helplessness against the elements could lead to an overwhelming feeling of powerlessness and helplessness. On the other hand, man-made disasters at least have a known cause and perhaps there is some hope that such catastrophes can be prevented. So the reality that natural disasters are more traumatic is counter-intuitive.</p><p>Yet the needs of communities trying to cope are broadly similar. These mainly include getting accurate information about what is happening, receiving practical assistance such as food supplies, medicines, clothes and being kept warm. And safety is a priority whether it be from radioactive emissions or a violent tornado.</p><p>Repeated studies show that reaching out for general support from others can be a major factor in responding positively, and being allowed, and able, to help others when we have been brought to safety also assists emotionally. If people are displaced, these newly formed connections will help build a new social bond.</p><p>Myriad psychiatrists or counsellors on site are of little or no assistance in the acute phase, although in the later stages, after the initial shock wears off, their availability for those who need help is important. For individuals, having a daily routine in an ongoing disaster, such as a typhoon, helps bring order to chaos.</p><p>But humans are resilient and, contrary to popular opinion, most do not develop post-traumatic stress disorder. However, for some there is trauma after the storm. While more than 70pc are resilient and do not need any mental health assistance, what about the remaining 30pc? There is now firm evidence that providing for the financial needs of those affected by natural disasters reduces the frequency of mental health problems significantly. For this reason, economists have an interest in natural disasters and the factors that ameliorate the impact of \"acts of God\". Confronted with a major disaster the question can properly be asked: \"How could a God, that brings us the beauty of nature, cause humans to suffer as a consequence of nature?\" Philosophers and theologians struggle to provide a convincing answer. And this is where God and economics connect. If money is one factor that affects the struggle of victims of natural disasters, what other factors play a role, positive or negative? A recent study by Jeanet Bentzen, from the University of Copenhagen, was published in 'The Economic Journal' on October 10, the day before Hagibis struck. It showed that after a major natural disaster, people turn to God. The findings of an increase in religiousness are very surprising, since one would anticipate that the questioning of a good God would do the opposite. The results were based on data from historical as well as recent disasters. For example, more people converted to religion in Christchurch, New Zealand, after the 2011 earthquake than in the whole of New Zealand that year. Bentzen found that people were more religious in areas at high risk of earthquakes or tsunamis, and this was even higher if there was a risk of both. Volcanic areas also have inhabitants who were more religious, and this extends to spatial areas within 1,000km but not further.</p><p>Most surprisingly, the heightened religiousness in all of the areas identified lasted six to 12 years, and it was also transmitted to the next generation.</p><p>Bentzen speculated that it was the unpredictability of many natural disasters that drove the inhabitants to religion, since it was not identified in places where typhoons and hurricanes were common, as these can largely be predicted.</p><p>As Karl Marx said, \"religion is the opium of the people\". He may be correct. This study shows clearly that there is a positive role for religious coping along with the multitude of adaptive coping strategies extolled by psychologists.</p><p>Again, in the area of trauma and stress, here is another finding that is counter-intuitive. We may not understand why a good God has allowed bad things to happen, but we certainly believe He is there to help us manage them. As Bentzen explained: \"Religious coping provides a stable reason why people believe in God. Coping, therefore, may be one reason why religion has not vanished as some scholars have theorised.\"</p>", "publisher": "Irish Independent", "instances": ["This fascination with all that is Japanese has nothing to do with the ancient tea ceremonies, Japanese literature or its imperial www. history.

Yet there is hardly a peep outside of those worried what it means for the World Cup. Those rather sinister storm graphics on the weather forecast given no more status than the usual sun or light cloud. As the rain starts to come down heavily in Seoul, South Korea, just across the bay from us here in Fukuoka, there is a quickly changing picture of just where it will land in Japan but there seems to be a consensus on when - Saturday.

For all the politicking going on behind the scenes about the fairness of playing or not playing decisive games, there was little argument that with super-typhoon Hagibis barrelling towards Japan's eastern seaboard safety concerns were paramount in the minds of organisers with more than just the teams and their qualification aspirations among their duty of care requirements. The bottom line is that when Ireland face New Zealand on Saturday at Tokyo Stadium, the former will have had seven days between games while the latter will have had 13 days following the cancellation of the defending champions' final pool game against Italy, which had been scheduled for City of Toyota Stadium on Saturday just as Hagibis was at its peak on the Japanese mainland. Likewise, England's Pool C clash with France in Yokohoma was also set for Saturday but cancelled, giving Eddie Jones's side a 14-day turnaround to their quarter-final clash with Australia, the Wallabies having played their final pool game against Georgia last Friday. Yet while it seems an advantage to have a longer lead-in to the knockout stages, not every coach will have welcomed a weekend off and chief of those has to be Ireland's Joe Schmidt, whose side were out of the typhoon's firing line in sunny Fukuoka and benefited enormously from the opportunity to gather some momentum with a return to form in the 47-5 victory over Samoa. Head coach Schmidt saw both sides of the argument over whether it is better to play or not play as he balanced getting a weekend off against gearing up for a World Cup quarter-final by getting a game under his players' belts.
