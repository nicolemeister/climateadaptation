All Irish major cities and many regional cities and towns are located by the sea, while 20 per cent of the coastline is already exposed to erosion. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The frequency and intensity of extreme precipitation events will increase. Estimated sea-level rise could lead to a quadrupling in the number of properties affected by flooding in coastal locations. For Limerick city alone, the EPA estimates the cost of extreme floods under a high-end scenario of sea-level rise may increase up to 12.5-fold, amounting to over EUR 1 billion for a single event. </p><p>But there is still an air of magical thinking about our response to flooding. The public and political discourse continues to focus on quick-fix solutions and State interventions that, in the long-term, are neither financially nor socially sustainable. </p><p>This is not to underestimate the impact of flooding. The damage that flooding causes to property is devastating, but the stress is compounded by insurance difficulties. </p><p>There is no State-backed obligation on insurers to provide cover, leaving property owners acutely vulnerable in the event of another flooding episode. This problem is affecting a growing number of buildings, with as many as one in twenty buildings struggling to get any insurance according to a recent study by the Central Bank. Flood risk is also a barrier to new housing development, again driving up the political pressure for engineered solutions.</p><p>In turn, communities at risk put pressure on the political system to deliver engineering solutions to flood risk that will be acceptable to insurers, all of which tends to sideline the potential for transformative adaptation. </p><p>Interventions such as dredging, sea walls and river realignment are hugely expensive, often very damaging to ecosystems and wildlife, and tend to wear out or depreciate over time. The current investment programme by the Office of Public Works (OPW) only covers 21 projects, yet will cost an estimated EUR 1.3 billion by 2030. </p><p>In a 2020 journal article, Trinity College Dublin researchers, Marcus Collier and Mary Bourke, argue for more consideration of green infrastructure solutions such as constructed wetlands, afforestation and riparian buffers, and peatland restoration. They also suggest the construction of  leaky dams  to hold flood water and slow its movement or divert it away from at-risk areas. </p><p>They observe the OPW is confined in its actions by the immediate political and societal demand for protection of property and that this is a significant barrier to the adoption of nature-based solutions. </p><h>Nature-based solutions </h><p/><h>Short-term thinking and a lack of appreciation of the social and environmental costs of hard engineering mean that nature-based solutions are rarely given a chance to work. This happens even though green infrastructure, unlike grey infrastructure, appreciates over time and provides multiple societal and environmental co-benefits. </h><p>Complicating matters further is the fact that nature-based solutions, even in one area, tend to involve a mosaic of interventions from wetland restoration to sustainable drainage schemes for roads, afforestation and constructed reed beds on a patchwork of land parcels involving numerous landowners. All of this requires patient dialogue, lots of time and an attitude of co-operation and trust. </p><p>This is why the River Trusts have so much potential as they harness the multiple stakeholders and local expertise that is needed to protect rivers in their natural state. </p><p>We should be much better prepared for flooding, but hard engineering solutions will not provide all the answers.

A deep understanding of the engineering, ecology, governance, finance and social acceptance is needed to be woven together for the effective development of nature-based solutions. nYvonne Buckley is co-director of the Co-Centre for Climate + Biodiversity + Water and professor of zoology at Trinity College Dublin"]}, {"relevance_score": 56, "title": "Coastal erosion and what we can do about it", "published": "2025-08-11", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">IRELAND'S 7,500km coastline is one of our country's greatest natural treasures - an ever-changing ribbon of cliffs, beaches, dunes, and estuaries - and islands - that shapes not only our geography but also our cultural identity. Yet, from Donegal to Dingle, an invisible enemy is chipping away at the edges: coastal erosion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Every winter storm, every rising tide, is part of a slow but persistent process of transformation. Entire sections of coast are disappearing into the sea. And while erosion is a natural process, it's now accelerating due to human activity and climate change. The question we face is no longer if we should act, but how.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Nature on the move</emphasis></h><p>Coastal erosion refers to the wearing away of land by the sea. Waves, currents, and winds gradually remove the shoreline's soil, sand, and rock. In places where natural buffers such as sand dunes, saltmarshes, or wetlands are intact, erosion is usually slow and cyclical. But when these protective features are damaged, or when sea levels rise and storms intensify, erosion speeds up dramatically.</p><p>In Ireland, we are already seeing the impacts. Some of the most high-profile cases have made headlines in recent years. At Portrane in north County Dublin, residents have seen their gardens, and in some cases entire homes, fall into the sea. In Lahinch, County Clare, and Rosslare Strand, Wexford, beaches have narrowed significantly, impacting tourism and local livelihoods. County Kerry's Inch Strand, famous for its long sandy spit, is now being monitored closely after major storm damage.</p><p>The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) estimates that 20-30% of Ireland's soft (non-rocky) coastline, such as sandy beaches and dunes, is vulnerable to erosion. Sea level around our coasts has risen by roughly 3-4 mm per year over the past three decades, and future projections suggest that this rate will accelerate. More extreme and frequent storm surges, such as Storms Emma, Barra, and Ophelia, compound the problem.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Coastal Development</emphasis></h><p>One major challenge is how we've developed the coast. Holiday homes, caravan parks, golf courses, and roads are often built just metres from the shoreline, leaving little room for natural systems to adapt. Concrete sea walls and rock armour are used as defences, but they can sometimes worsen erosion elsewhere, disrupting the natural flow of sediment.</p><p>Traditional 'hard' coastal protection measures are expensive and not always long-term effective.. For example, when waves crash against a sea wall, the energy is reflected downward and sideways, often eroding the base or neighbouring shorelines. As the sea keeps rising, defences have to be raised or reinforced, creating a costly cycle of maintenance.</p><p>It's time for a smarter approach - one that works with nature, not against it.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Solutions on the horizon</emphasis></h><p>Nature-Based Solutions (NbS) offer a promising way forward. Instead of trying to outbuild the ocean, we can restore and strengthen natural coastal defences. This includes:</p><p>* Dune restoration - stabilising sand dunes using native grasses and fencing to trap sand can buffer wave energy and provide critical habitats.</p><p>* Saltmarsh and wetland protection - these act as natural sponges, absorbing storm surges and reducing flooding inland. Rewetting drained marshes helps them recover.</p><p>* Managed retreat - in some places, the most sustainable option is to allow the coastline shift naturally by relocating vulnerable infrastructure inland.</p><p>* Living shorelines - these hybrid systems use a mix of biodegradable materials, vegetation, and oyster reefs, to reduce erosion while supporting marine biodiversity.</p><p>Projects like the OPW's Coastal Monitoring Programme, and local authorities such as Wexford County Council, are beginning to integrate these softer engineering techniques. At the European level, Ireland is part of coastal adaptation programmes under the Climate Action Plan and Horizon Europe projects.</p><p>But more investment and coordination are needed. A recent report by the Climate Change Advisory Council noted the lack of a comprehensive, national coastal adaptation strategy. Without one, responses remain piecemeal and reactive.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Communities on the front line</emphasis></h><p>Coastal erosion is not just a scientific issue, it's a social one. People living in vulnerable coastal areas often feel ignored or unsupported. Insurance may not cover erosion damage. Planning policies may restrict rebuilding after loss but offer little support for relocation. Emotional ties to place, such as family homes, heritage, livelihoods, are difficult to let go of. Public engagement is crucial. We need open conversations about trade-offs and priorities. Some areas require robust defences; others need to be given back to the sea. Local knowledge and citizen science play a key role in shaping fair and resilient responses.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Holding the line or letting go</emphasis></h><p>We must accept we cannot 'hold the line' everywhere. The coast has always moved. But the added stress of climate change, and the pace of change now outstrip our capacity to respond.</p><p>Adapting to coastal erosion means rethinking how we value and use our coast, not just as a boundary, but as a living, transient system. To live with erosion is to let go of the illusion of permanence. With science to guide us, communities to ground us, and leadership to drive us, we can respond not with fear, but with foresight.</p><p>Ireland's story has always been written at the edge of the sea.

Summer has just begun and we're already seeing record-breaking heatwaves sweep the continent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Temperatures have surged past 44C in parts of Spain, Portugal, Italy, and France. Portugal and Spain both recorded their hottest June ever. What's causing this escalation in extreme heat? The short answer is human-induced climate change. But the full picture reveals how human-driven warming, shifting atmospheric patterns, and parched landscapes are combining to produce longer, hotter, and more dangerous heatwaves than Europe has ever seen.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">The warming continent</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Earth has already warmed by around 1.2C since pre-industrial times, but Europe is heating up faster than the global average. According to the European Environment Agency, Europe's temperature has increased by around 2.2C, making it the fastest-warming continent on the planet.</p><p>This increase is not just an abstract statistic. It dramatically raises the odds of extreme heat. Every heatwave we experience today has been made more intense by climate change. It's not a future problem, but a presentday reality. When natural heatwaves occur, they now start from a warmer baseline, meaning they're hotter, last longer, and occur more frequently than they did just a few decades ago.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stuck in a hot loop</emphasis></h><p>The atmosphere is a key player in Europe's heatwaves. A high-pressure system, often called an omega block for its O-shaped jet stream pattern, traps hot air under a heat dome, blocking cooler, wetter weather for weeks. The current heatwave scorching southern Europe appears to be driven by such a system. The jet stream, a fast-moving ribbon of air in the atmosphere, normally pushes weather along. But one hypothesis suggests that Arctic amplification, where the Arctic warms up to four times faster than the global average, can weaken and wobble the jet stream, stalling weather patterns. This creates persistent heat domes, amplifying extreme temperatures across Europe.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">When the soil can't sweat</emphasis></h><p>A lesser-known but crucial factor behind extreme heat is soil moisture, or the lack of it. During hot weather, moist soils act like natural air conditioners. As water evaporates, it cools the land surface, much like how sweating cools our bodies. But when soils are dry, that cooling mechanism is not working. The result is a feedback loop: dry soils mean less evaporation, which means hotter temperatures, which in turn dry the soil even further. This phenomenon has likely played a major role in intensifying Europe's recent heatwaves, particularly in drought-stricken regions of the Mediterranean and central Europe.</p><p>In 2022 and 2023, vast swathes of farmland across southern and western Europe wilted under scorching heat. In France and Italy, crop yields tumbled. Water levels in rivers like the Rhine and Po plummeted, disrupting transport and irrigation. Wildfires, fanned by dry vegetation and intense heat, spread across Greece, Portugal, and Spain with devastating speed.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Cities on the boil</emphasis></h><p>Urban areas are especially vulnerable during heatwaves due to the urban heat island effect. Concrete, asphalt, and rooftops absorb and retain heat, making cities several degrees warmer than the surrounding countryside, especially at night, when retained heat prevents buildings from cooling.</p><p>In places like Rome, Paris, Milan, and Madrid, overnight temperatures have often failed to drop below 25\u00b0C, which is a threshold considered dangerous to health, particularly for older people, infants, and those with pre-existing conditions.</p><p>These warm nights, exacerbated by urban heat islands and climate change, increase risks of heatstroke and mortality. The summer of 2022 is estimated to have caused more than 60,000 excess deaths across Europe due to heat-related illnesses, a toll that highlights the silent lethality of extreme heat. In many cities, heatwaves now pose a bigger public health threat than cold snaps.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What can be done?</emphasis></h><p>There's no doubt that Europe's summers are changing.

How is it conceivable that humanity will come together to draw down carbon dioxide at vast scales, while running the global economy on carbon-free energy and food? </p><p>Nevertheless, a recent article in Science made the case that the 1.5 degree goal must endure as both a legal and ethical imperative, arguing that  exceedance of 1.5 degrees is a wake-up call alerting parties [Paris agreement signatory countries] to redouble their efforts to bring emissions down and thereby halt or even reverse the increase in global warming . </p><p>Regardless of whether climate leaders reaffirm the 1.5 degree goal or accept another interpretation of the Paris Agreement, stabilising global temperatures requires that emissions of carbon dioxide fall rapidly and reach net-zero.

This is frequently backed by provenance, indicating where food was grown, caught or raised with a priority for the local. </p><p>Prof Buckley says there is considerable support for sustainable transport in public places and around schools.

Yet this is how the State plans to treat some of our most treasured rivers, lakes and estuaries. According to a proposal from the Department of Housing, stretches of the Shannon, Boyne and Blackwater rivers will no longer be viewed as needing restoration. Instead, they face a future as engineered channels.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the 1980s and  90s, Europeans began to recognise that their rivers were in severe decline due to decades of neglect. Naturally meandering waterways were straightened, drained and dammed; chemicals, pesticides and untreated sewage poured into them unchecked. The problem was cross-border: the Danube, which flows through 10 countries, became saturated with pollution. In 1986, a fire at a warehouse near Basle, Switzerland, caused the Rhine to turn red with mercury and dyes, as vast amounts of toxic waste flowed downstream into Germany and the Netherlands. Drinking water supplies were shut off, and aquatic life, such as European eels, was decimated.</p><p>What was clear was that Europe needed a unified, legally binding approach to water protection that set out common rules, clear responsibilities and shared goals. By 2000, a plan was in place that aimed to safeguard waterways not only for aquatic life but also as a source of drinking water, transport and leisure for humans. This law, known as the Water Framework Directive, has a clear objective: to ensure all waterbodies reach at least  good status , meaning they are clean, healthy and safe for swimming and drinking.</p><p>Built into the plan is a legal recognition that some waterbodies, especially in highly industrialised countries such as Germany, have been altered so extensively that returning them to their natural state would be impossible or harmful to human interests. These are placed in a special category, called  heavily modified water bodies , and are legally exempt from the requirement to achieve  good  status. They include reservoirs supplying drinking water, canals designed for navigation or drainage, urban rivers confined within concrete channels or culverts, ports, harbours and rivers drained for agricultural use. </p><p>While they cannot be used as dumping grounds for pollutants, the law accepts that these waters will never be restored. For that reason, the principle guiding  heavily modified  designation should be balanced and factor in whether it serves the widest possible interest: their number should be kept to a minimum, and where ongoing engineering and management is necessary, they must deliver significant benefit to the public.</p><p>Ireland has 33 heavily modified water bodies, including Poulaphouca reservoir, which provides drinking water to Dublin; Cork Harbour for industrial activity; and New Ross Port in Wexford. But under the department s proposal, released in March, this number will increase by 1,312 per cent. It includes 122 waterbodies through some of our unique natural areas. It includes stretches of the Nore, Brosna, Maigue, Liffey, Fergus, Mulkear and Carrowbeg rivers; lakes such as Lough Corrib and Lough Derg; and estuaries like Lower Suir.</p><p>Why does the State want to all  but give up on these waters? The problem stems from a law dating back to 1945, the Arterial Drainage Act, which gives the State sweeping powers to carry out large-scale drainage works, such as deepening, widening, dredging and straightening. Eighty years ago the law  was viewed as progressive; today, it clashes with the Water Framework Directive because this extent of drainage causes severe damage, irreversibly stripping rivers of their natural life and course. Ireland cannot abide by one law with the other. As long as these waters are drained, they will never meet standards set by EU water law. </p><p>Reservoirs, ports, canals and harbours must be operational, and designating them  heavily modified  is in the public interest, as their functional demands cannot be fulfilled while attempting restoration. But who ll benefit from the continual dredging of the Clare river in Galway, once one of our most natural rivers and now, in many parts, a canalised channel?  Or the river Brosna, whose waters followed a meandering course through Offaly before its curves were straightened and its channel deepened? And how is it justified  in the public interest, given that drainage makes towns and cities more vulnerable to flash flooding?</p><p>Instead of reshaping drainage policy so that it s fit for the critical challenges we face, what s proposed is simply remove these waters from any hope of being restored. Never before have our waterways needed climate and nature-proofed policies more.  Our waters are warming at levels never seen before. Sea temperatures have soared. This is the  future for which we need to rapidly prepare. </p><p>Under the Nature Restoration Law, we re required to restore at least 20 per cent of our land and sea areas by 2030, increasing to 90 per cent by 2050. That includes rewetting organic soils, like those at the headwaters of the Boyne, which are currently drained. Instead of giving up on our waters now is the time to put energy into nature-based solutions proven to be effective and cheap as a way to reduce flood risk, improve soil health and meet climate, nature and water goals without abandoning the land. </p><p>We can t ignore the facts: our waterways are facing immense pressure, and some are critically ill. Even if our only concern was water security, the urgent need for restoration is clear. This proposal to weaken their legal protections will only speed up their deterioration.</p><p>Across Ireland, communities are volunteering to revive their waters.

Scientists use the term to refer to areas with the climate and geographical conditions to be deemed highly vulnerable to global warming-related disasters. </p><p>Sitting-duck cities are informally classified on the basis  they ve got lucky so far . The Financial Times has identified big cities across the planet, the places yet to experience a Valencia moment (devastating flash floods) or a Los Angeles engulfment (wildfires raging through neighbourhoods). </p><p>The four extremes analysed were flooding, wildfires, rainfall and storm surge   that is, abnormal water-level rise generated by a storm over and above predicted tides. The so-called sitting ducks have been  lucky  to avoid a combination of conditions that will lead to the next disaster. The odds against them are worsening because of accelerating warming. </p><p>Although Irish cities are not deemed to be among the 24 highest-risk places   which include Athens, Cape Town and Buenos Aires   some of our cities at the mouth of estuaries are extremely vulnerable to a combination of flooding, rainfall and storm surge. </p><p>A highly co-ordinated response is needed to build resilience in adapting for inevitable climate impacts and to minimise risk from all three happening in quick succession or all at once   a key message from Ireland s first national climate risk assessment conducted by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). </p><h>Storm \u00c9owyn </h><p/><h>Most of all, Ireland has got lucky on storm surge. Storm \u00c9owyn, which struck in January, reveals the extent of the most recent near miss. The bottom line is: storm surges in the order of five metres are looming, and we should probably be planning for 10m in some of our most populous urban centres. </h><p>A research team at University of Galway School of Engineering showed \u00c9owyn generated the highest storm surges ever recorded   more than 2.5m  above the normal predicted tidal water level. At Galway Port, it peaked at 2.6m above mean sea level, the average height of the sea surface. </p><p>The highest surge along the western coastline was recorded at Limerick Docks: 2.99m. Had these surges occurred a week earlier during a spring tide, Galway Port would have reached 4.96m and Limerick Docks 5.85m. </p><p>That indicates that tens of thousands of people and properties narrowly escaped disaster in the form of inundation by little more than luck of timing when \u00c9owyn hit the country. The storm s track was equally fortunate, with record overland wind speeds concentrated on less populated areas of the northwest. </p><p>Climatologist Prof Peter Thorne of Maynooth University spends much of his time analysing risk as chairman of the Climate Change Advisory Council adaptation committee; whether it s the remotest places such as the Aran Islands, areas that habitually flood (and cannot get reasonable insurance cover) or our sitting-duck cities. </p><p>When it comes to Ireland s sitting ducks, he highlights places with river flows   Cork, Dublin and Galway. Cork is  very, very vulnerable , while in the capital much of the risk is due to so much of the State s critical infrastructure, as well as functionality of Ireland s political and financial systems, being  within a few metres of the river Liffey . </p><p>He worries about anywhere taking a long time to drain  so impact will be long-lived , as opposed to  short flashy catchments  draining in a day or two   or within hours. That includes anywhere along the river Shannon. In Limerick, the EPA has estimated extreme floods  under a high-end scenario of sea-level rise  may increase up to 12.5-fold, amounting to more than EUR 1 billion for a single event. </p><p>Physical risks have not changed, but our understanding of risk has. It is going up incrementally due to sea level rise, especially where it intersects with river flow and increased rainfall intensity. The more we push the climate system, the bigger the risk and it rises  very, very quickly , becoming more erratic, says Thorne. </p><p>While much of the east coast is  incredibly vulnerable , individual households and farmland are most threatened, with its rail links, ports and major roads at risk. </p><p>Thorne accepts a lot of work is being done on protections in urban areas, where poor design including hard-paved surfaces can aggravate flooding. Cork, for example, faces particular challenges because of its central island, though it has developed a park that can become a lake if necessary   a measure that is standard in many French cities and towns due to flash-flood risk. </p><p>But it s particularly hard to deploy such adaptation measures in built-up, already congested areas, even if they are nature-based solutions rather than hard engineering. Invariably, installing them causes large disruption for business, tourism and the daily lives of commuters. </p><h>Wicked problem </h><p/><h>The data and more accurate computer modelling indicate, however, we have to get to grips with the wicked problem of climate adaptation. In some places, protection within a decade is required. The vulnerability of places such as Portrane in north Dublin and Greystones, Co Wicklow, for instance, stands out. </h><p>The World Meteorological Organisation says global mean temperatures are likely to continue at or near record levels between 2025 and 2029. Models have flagged the imminent possibility of a  two-degree year  (above pre-industrial times), which a few years ago would have been considered impossible within such a narrow time-frame. </p><p>This means there is a high probability temperatures and precipitation will exceed long-term averages in the next five years. Sitting-duck places   including Ireland s equivalent   are in the firing line. </p><p>And yet a European Commission assessment of the Government s national energy and climate plan, published on May 28th, highlights a disturbing lack of coherence on adaptation. While climate vulnerabilities are acknowledged, proposed adaptation actions are vague, unquantified  and poorly integrated into overall planning . </p><p>The shape of what is required is clear. The Climate Change Advisory Council has spelt out what needs to be done to support preparedness for extreme events in its annual review for 2025. The EPA assessment provides critical indication of what the climate risks are, when they are likely to arise and, most importantly, where. It s now up to government departments, key sectors such as energy, transport and communications, and local authorities to better frame the response. </p><p>They should do so mindful of a World Resources Institute report providing powerful evidence that bolstering funding for adaptation and resilience is not only urgent but also one of the smartest development investments available today. </p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["It is going up incrementally due to sea level rise, especially where it intersects with river flow and increased rainfall intensity.

There are no quick fixes - this is a problem long in the making and it will take long term, systemic change to manage effectively.\" Conference discussions emphasised that while warmer temperatures, excess nutrients and low rainfall are key drivers of algal blooms, the root causes lie in land use and sewage management practices that have built up over decades. The conference stressed the need for long-term, cross-sectoral, catchment-wide solutions backed by strong community engagement and ongoing research. The core message from today's event is that as the frequency and severity of BGA blooms continue to increase, The Rivers Trust remains committed to collaborative action and science-led strategies that develop and deliver solutions to protect and improve rivers and communities.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table>", "publisher": "Ballymoney Chronicle", "instances": ["This DAERA-funded programme works directly with local farmers to implement practical, water-friendly measures on farms to tackle pollution at the source and improve water quality across Northern Ireland. Hosted online, The Rivers Trust international conference - titled A Bloomin' Disaster: The Causes and Costs of Blue-Green Algae - brought together experts from across Ireland, UK, Europe and beyond to examine the rising threat of blue-green algal (BGA) blooms across the UK and Ireland and to explore catchment-based solutions. Professor Katrina Campbell of Queen's University Belfast delivered a compelling and informative presentation on the health impacts of BGA, underlining the risk these toxic blooms pose to both animals and humans. Her research highlighted the growing concern around public exposure, especially in recreational waters and rural areas. The packed agenda featured various speakers, including representatives from the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, Wessex Water, the Wye &amp; Usk Foundation and SEGES Denmark, while Eliot Taylor discussed his work on BGA in South Africa and Malawi, showcasing innovative approaches and international learnings.

Published in March, A Colossal Missed Opportunity   Ireland s Climate Action and the Potential Costs of Missing Targets, looked at the possible costs Ireland faces if it fails to meet its agreed EU climate commitments. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These require domestic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions, an increasing share of renewable energy, and improved energy efficiency. The report estimates that Ireland could potentially have to pay out between EUR 8 billion and EUR 26 billion to its EU partners if it does not step up climate action swiftly. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">If the Government implements the additional measures in its own Climate Action Plan by 2030, it could reduce the amount due to between EUR 3 billion and EUR 12 billion   better but still enormous. </p><p>At issue are key pieces of EU legislation, including the Effort Sharing Regulation, which Ireland and other European countries agreed to adopt in 2018. It covers emissions from domestic transport, buildings, small industry, waste, and agriculture. Ireland is already near the bottom of the league when it comes to emissions reductions covered by this regulation. </p><p>Two other pieces of legislation could pose smaller but still significant costs. These cover land use and forestry, and the share of energy coming from renewable sources. </p><p>The targets are all part of the EU s effort to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050. Failing to meet these commitments could result in substantial costs. </p><p>For starters, Ireland would need to purchase allocations from other member states that had overperformed against their annual emission allocations. </p><p>This could be both expensive and difficult as few member states are likely to overperform and just eight are likely to have allocations to sell. </p><p>Furthermore, the shortfalls expected for three large member states   Germany, Italy, and France   could be substantial. </p><p>Indeed, the report cautions that Germany s expected shortfall is so great as to mean that it might require more than half of the emissions allocations likely to be available for purchase. </p><p>This could result in a bidding war which would leave Ireland with limited or no access to the allocations necessary to, in effect, purchase its compliance. </p><p>If Ireland somehow manages to obtain emissions allocations, it will then have to spend billions of euro to purchase them. </p><p>Under land use regulations, Ireland has agreed to use nature-based solutions and practices to improve land and forestry management in order to reduce and offset emissions. </p><p>At present, Ireland looks set to fall short of its agreed commitments under this regulation too. To comply, Ireland will need to purchase further emissions allowances, known as Land Removal Units, again at a cost of billions of euros.</p><p>And that s on top of any costs arising from missing the targets under the EU s Renewable Energy Directive, which commits us to achieving a 43 per cent share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2030, alongside additional sub-targets for specific sectors such as heating, cooling and transport. </p><h> Knuckle down The risks inherent in missing our regulatory targets are stark but it s not too late to mitigate them. According to the report s authors, Ireland could still just  knuckle down  and meet its targets.</h><p>That would require significant investments and policy changes but would also mean improving citizens  lives here rather than transferring large sums to our European neighbours which would be required were we to buy compliance, it points out. </p><p>The fact that emissions allowances might be thin on the ground due to larger states like Italy, Germany and France having to buy them to make up for their own shortcomings is a cause for hope for some. There is a belief in some quarters that if a number of influential member states miss their targets, a reprieve will be given.</p><p>That is wishful thinking, not just given the law as it currently stands but also because there are vested interests in ensuring the law is strictly adhered to. Not every country is in the same boat, after all. Both Spain and Portugal, for example, are likely to exceed their targets, which would allow them to sell surplus allowances to others, generating valuable revenues for them.</p><p>But even when lumped in with other laggards, Ireland s position as a small country makes it vulnerable. The financial burden of the Effort Sharing Regulation, for example, is up to five times greater here than for larger countries such as Germany, France or Italy, when looked at as a share of their economies.</p><p>It s why stepping up efforts on climate action now and meeting our targets makes the most sense, not least because it would avoid the risk of Ireland getting into a cycle of deepening emissions reductions requirements, and the need for sudden policy shifts. </p><p>Recent events have already highlighted how climate action can benefit people. Ireland s reliance on imported fossil fuels left it exposed to geopolitical disruptions and price rises during the cost-of-living crisis, for example, while, more recently, Storm \u00c9owyn showed the need for more secure and stable energy infrastructure. </p><h>Meeting commitments </h><p/><h>Then there is the cost, which would represent a massive transfer of wealth to Ireland s neighbours. And remember, having transferred these amounts, Ireland would still be obliged to meet its commitments. </h><p>By way of illustration, for  EUR 12 billion spent now   just one-tenth of the capital spending planned out to 2030   the Government could, the report suggests, reduce the costs of buying 700,000 new electric cars to less than EUR 15,000 per vehicle, allow the Government to ramp up charging infrastructure and cover the estimated additional costs of upgrading Ireland s energy grid, as well as support forestry and the rewetting of peatlands. </p><p>Not taking actions such as these is the  colossal missed opportunity  to reduce emissions and deliver significant improvements in Irish society, it says.</p><p>Swifter action would do more than just avoid hefty payments and meet Ireland s agreed commitments. It would transform Ireland to a  healthier, more sustainable, and more energy-secure society, the report contends. </p><p> It is very serious, but we can get back on track,  says Eddie Casey, chief economist with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, who suggests that just a few big policy changes could take us a long way, including ramping up the electrification of the State and upgrading the energy grid to ensure more renewable energy can be brought online.</p><p>Supporting the rollout of the national fleet could help too. Any move that would reduce the cost of EVs will help break down the cost barriers that impede many purchasers. Moves to make forestry more attractive will pay dividends and restoration of bog lands could help too, he adds.  Rewetting peatlands that were historically drained turns them from being carbon emitters into carbon sinks, and doesn t cost a lot of money to do.  </p><p>Such measures won t just provide environmental benefits, they will allow the Government to focus on what can be done with money that would otherwise have to be spent on compliance and penalties.  But there is no room for complacency,  he says. l</p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["This could be both expensive and difficult as few member states are likely to overperform and just eight are likely to have allocations to sell. Furthermore, the shortfalls expected for three large member states   Germany, Italy, and France   could be substantial. Indeed, the report cautions that Germany s expected shortfall is so great as to mean that it might require more than half of the emissions allocations likely to be available for purchase. This could result in a bidding war which would leave Ireland with limited or no access to the allocations necessary to, in effect, purchase its compliance. If Ireland somehow manages to obtain emissions allocations, it will then have to spend billions of euro to purchase them. Under land use regulations, Ireland has agreed to use nature-based solutions and practices to improve land and forestry management in order to reduce and offset emissions. At present, Ireland looks set to fall short of its agreed commitments under this regulation too. To comply, Ireland will need to purchase further emissions allowances, known as Land Removal Units, again at a cost of billions of euros. And that s on top of any costs arising from missing the targets under the EU s Renewable Energy Directive, which commits us to achieving a 43 per cent share of renewable energy in gross final energy consumption by 2030, alongside additional sub-targets for specific sectors such as heating, cooling and transport.

The water seeps in everywhere   through doors, between the skirting boards, in gaps you didn t know existed.</p><p>The final torment is saved for the next day, when the waters have receded and you re left with a soaking, stinking mess which will cost you thousands, because your insurance stopped covering flood damage the last time this happened.</p><p>I m fortunate to own a home but it has a wet history, and many floods have hit us. The last flood, in October 2011, was so severe that within minutes water was pouring into the electrical sockets a few feet up the wall. We bucketed the water out the window in a pitiful attempt to show some fight but it was futile. The force of the flow was beyond anything we could influence.</p><p>Nobody died, so we just got on with it, but there s no doubt that the experience of flooding leaves you with a potent mix of emotions. It s exhausting and upsetting to fight it and clean up afterwards. You feel relieved if nobody is hurt; if someone is injured, it s gut-wrenching. You re grateful to neighbours for helping (flooding has an uncanny way of bringing people together) but you re left worrying that it ll happen again. Whether justified or not, you feel a sense of outrage that the powers that be didn t do enough to prevent it in the first place.</p><p>These feelings hit me last October while listening to locals describe the events around Storm Babet, which caused Midleton in Co Cork to flood. One local described how he was having a coffee one minute and the next the town was knee-deep in flood water. The deluge of more than a month s worth of rain in just 48 hours turned the main street into a river.</p><p>Thanks to scientists in Maynooth University, we now know that the climate crisis made the extreme rainfall which fell on Midleton last year  more likely and more intense . Alarmingly, had the floods occurred during high tide, the flooding could have been much worse.   Within days some Cork politicians called for reinforced concrete to be put on the sides of the Owenacurra river to keep the water at bay. The instinct to pour concrete to defend ourselves against nature is understandable; each time I flooded, I immediately wanted a wall to be built to funnel the water away. But these solutions are expensive, need constant costly maintenance and often end up increasing the likelihood of flash floods. We like to think we can control water with concrete; we can t.</p><p>Instead, hard engineering needs to become a smaller part of a much bigger picture, which involves taking a wider view of the flood-prone area. Zooming out, it encompasses the surrounding urban areas and, further afield, the expanse of farmland and upland areas. On these lands, we need to find ways to increase the Earth s  soakability  so that when a torrent of rain falls the water finds its way down, not across, the surface of the Earth.</p><p>A few months ago, I visited a farm in Ballygow, south of Wexford, where geographer Mary Bourke of Trinity College Dublin is working with her sister and brother-in-law, beef and sheep farmers Caroline and Patrick Gleeson, on an experimental project to find cheap, nature-based solutions to reduce the impacts of flash floods downstream by re-meandering rivers, installing leaky dams and creating flood storage zones.</p><p>We stood in a stream in the corner of a field where Mary had placed a long tree trunk where the flood water naturally entered the field; the log didn t stop the water, it just slowed the flow.

It might begin life in a sodden bog or meadow, then trickle downwards through fields and under bridges   a watery capillary winding across the landscape   before joining forces with another stream.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">One morning last week, I stood with Pat Lee, a suckler and sheep farmer in Mayo, a few metres from his sruth\u00e1n, the Ower, and watched it flow into the larger, shimmering Black river, An Abhainn Dubh, in the corner of one of his fields.</p><p>While the Ower emerges from a wet field about a mile north of Pat s farm, the start of the Black river is a turlough about eight kilometres to the east in Kilmaine. It then flows over limestone rock through Shrule, following the Mayo/Galway border, and alongside Pat s organic farm east of Headford. Two miles downstream, it empties into the eastern shores of Lough Corrib. The life that depends on the Corrib   the eels, salmon, trout, lamprey and hundreds of invertebrates   also relies on these tributaries as nursery grounds and places to feed and live.</p><p>During winter and spring, when the rain is heavy, water will frequently spill over at the confluence of the Ower and Black river on Pat s land. It s a reminder that this slice of the field is part of them. Waterways expand and contract with the seasons, occupying a dynamic space beyond their summer banks.</p><h>Evolution of farming </h><p>Like nearly all of our waterways of the past century or so, the Black river has been drained, modified and engineered. It s the story of the evolution of farming. Historically, Ireland was not a land of green pastures; it was soggy and wet. To produce food, field drains were laid to dry the land out. If the field is sloped, the excess water flows with gravity to the nearest stream or river. But where land is flat   which is the case in the midlands   rivers and streams were deepened to create an artificial gradient.</p><p>Instead of piecemeal drainage works carried out by individual landowners, the State introduced the Arterial Drainage Act in 1945, which transferred responsibility to the Office of Public Works (OPW), which took a catchment-level approach. Because rivers and streams retain a kind of water memory and will constantly try to revert to their original form, the OPW became legally responsible for keeping the modified channels clear.</p><p>And so, thousands of acres of land were brought into food production. Today, drainage works on 11,500km of river channels and 800km of embankments provide discharge for 260,000 hectares of agricultural land. But the Act set the Irish State on an expensive and unwinnable war against water and nature, causing untold damage to habitats for fish, wetland birds, and species such as the freshwater pearl mussel and the natterjack toad. It has proven disastrous for flooding, too; using rivers merely as drains for water, which would otherwise be slowly soaked up and released by the land, is a recipe for flash flooding in towns and villages downstream.</p><p>The work needed to keep the channels clear involves using hydraulic excavators, mini-diggers, tractors and trailers, tipper lorries, weed-cutting boats, chainsaws, mulchers, mowers and shears. Silt and vegetation are scooped out of river channels and spread along the bank or onto spoil heaps. Herbicides are sprayed, and scrub and woodland on the banks are trimmed away.</p><h>Alternative </h><p>If the 1945 Act is consigned to the history books, is there a cheaper, more effective alternative?</p><p>Historically, the low-lying Stonyford river in Meath, a tributary of the Boyne, meandered through wetlands and would flood its banks in winter, depositing finer silt and clay onto the land. In the 1960s, the land was drained for farming. The surplus water from the fields had nowhere to go, so the OPW lowered the water table by deepening the river through dredging and rock blasting along the river bed.</p><p>The drainage worked for agriculture but left an artificially deep river clogged up with silt. And so, the OPW would send in the diggers to clear the silt and vegetation, causing the water to rapidly drain downstream. This maintenance cycle   expensive, destructive, but effective in the short term   continued for decades.</p><p>Then, in the winter of 2014, the OPW dredged the river for the final time. They fenced the waterways to keep the livestock from accessing the water and eating the vegetation along the banks. Over six years, how would the river respond to this experiment in passive restoration? Scientists from Inland Fisheries Ireland waited and watched to see what nature would do.</p><p>Given extra time without being dredged, the silt in the river   a fertile mix of clay, sand, dead bits of plants and fish, wood and leaves   moved towards the edges where vegetation secured it. The amount of silt in the riverbed halved. The centre of the river became covered in gravel, which is the ideal habitat for invertebrates and spawning fish. Overall, this low-cost experiment in allowing the river to renaturalise itself has improved the physical characteristics of the river to benefit the species who live in it.</p><p>There are nearly 2,500 people employed by the OPW, yet just three are ecologists, and one is an environmental scientist. If we want any chance of restoring our waterways and minimising flood risk, we need the expertise and ambition to understand, respect and implement nature-based solutions to help solve our extensive problems.

It explains their causes and assesses whether events could have been predicted. It also evaluates how risk of similar events will change in future under different climate change scenarios, and underlines the merits of climate attribution research. </p><p>It was compiled by climate scientists at the University of East Anglia (UAE), the UK Centre for Ecology &amp; Hydrology, the UK Met Office and the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.</p><p>It finds that emissions from wildfires globally were 16 per cent above average, totalling 8.6 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. Emissions from fires in the Canadian boreal forests were more than nine times the average of the past two decades, and contributed almost a quarter of the emissions. An unusually high number of fires were also seen in northern parts of South America, particularly in Brazil s Amazonas state and in neighbouring areas of Bolivia, Peru and Venezuela. This led to the Amazon region experiencing among the worst air quality ratings on the planet. Meanwhile, wildfires in the Arctic have become common and more extensive.</p><p>Wildfires are killing people, destroying properties and infrastructure, causing mass evacuations, threatening livelihoods and damaging vital ecosystems, noted Dr Matthew Jones of UEA.  Wildfires are becoming more frequent and intense as the climate warms, and both society and the environment are suffering from the consequences. </p><h>Destructive flooding </h><p>The loss of carbon stocks from boreal forests in Canada and tropical forests in South America has lasting implications for the Earth s climate. Forests take decades to centuries to recover from fire disturbance, meaning that extreme fire years such as 2023-24 result in a lasting deficit in carbon storage for many years to come.</p><p>Climate models suggest the toll from extreme wildfires will increase by the end of the century, particularly in future scenarios where greenhouse gas emissions remain high. These projections are yet another indication of the urgent need to rapidly reduce greenhouse gas emissions and manage vegetation to reduce the risk and impacts of increasingly severe wildfires on society and ecosystems.</p><p>Several factors control fire, including weather conditions influenced by climate change, the density of vegetation on the landscape influenced by climate and land management, and ignition opportunities influenced by people and lightning. The critical lesson is the need to cut emissions (to reduce temperatures) while scaling up adaptation measures in preparation for unavoidable impacts. At least the EU s Civil Protection Mechanism is showing its worth at an immediate, practical level. It pools resources such as planes and firefighters which are deployed when a government needs help in the event of a natural disaster.</p><p>In Ireland s case, the biggest threat from extreme weather events is likely to be destructive flooding, but all it takes is a drought of a few weeks to make land vulnerable to wildfires.

Alongside this reduction, a new movement has emerged to put agriculture at the heart of  water quality improvement.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The EUR 60 million five-year Farming for Water project is a European Innovation Partnership (EIP), the largest one ever carried out in Ireland. The project will support up to 15,000 farmers in the provision of rainwater management plans, earthen bunds and tree planting among a range of other measures designed to help improve water quality.</p><p> With around 80 per cent of Ireland s agricultural area consisting of grassland, the role of the livestock sector in managing the natural environment and water quality is clear,  says Conor Mulvihill, director of Dairy Industry Ireland, the Ibec industry body that represents primary and secondary dairy processors, including the specialised nutrition sector.</p><p> While there is significant work to be done to further improve water quality, data from the European Environment Agency shows that Ireland currently has the highest water quality among major dairy producers across Europe,  he adds.  Department of Agriculture data shows that Irish farmers have delivered a staggering 30 per cent reduction in their use of chemical nitrogen in just two years. </p><p>He says that achieving good water quality requires targeted action across all relevant sectors, such as agriculture, urban wastewater, domestic septic tanks and forestry.  This highlights the need for a transparent and joined-up approach to addressing challenges. Adopting a proactive approach on a local catchment level is key to enhancing water quality in the period ahead. The dairy sector is committed to playing its part, working with local farm families on local bespoke solutions. </p><p>He believes Ireland is starting from a good base in terms of water quality.  We are very lucky in that regard. The results of the EPA Water Quality in 2022 Indicator Report highlighted that about 83 per cent of our rivers are of high, good or moderate biological quality, a slight rise on previous reports; 60 per cent of rivers sampled showed high or good nitrate quality; and 72 per cent showed high or good phosphorous quality. </p><p>He notes the success of the industry-driven Agricultural Sustainability Support and Advisory Programme (ASSAP) water quality programme in this regard.  Since 2017, the programme has grown to include over 45 advisers nationally, over half of which are funded by dairy processors. More than 5,000 assessments have been completed across 190 priority areas for action, with great farmer engagement and very encouraging results for water quality. It was clear that we needed to scale up this to a national level movement and this spring saw the launch of the Farming for Water project supported by the Local Authority Waters Programme (LAWPRO), Teagasc and Dairy Industry Ireland. </p><p> Mulvihill says the programme includes innovations like results-based payments, a research hub and nature-based solutions.  The programme utilises the ASSAP assessment approach, bringing a joined-up approach to delivering relevant, bespoke on-farm advice and incentivising the implementation of measures,  he adds.</p><p> We know this work is critical, as challenges in relation to water quality are leading to considerable policy uncertainty regarding the future of the nitrates derogation, which is crucial to underpinning the economic and social sustainability of Ireland s outdoor, grass-based production system. This uncertainty is impacting on the ability of the sector and farm families to plan for the future. Addressing this with urgency is critical to secure the future direction of the Irish dairy and the wider agriculture sector.</p><p> With regard to the future of Ireland s nitrates derogation, it should be clearly noted that no country has complied with the Nitrates Directive, so why threaten the viability of our globally recognised grass-based industry with its removal?  he asks.</p><p>Noting a 2023 EY report which showed that the Irish dairy sector had grown to become the country s biggest native industry with a value of EUR 17.6 billion, Mulvihill says:  Ireland has proven it can be a global leader in high-quality sustainable nutrition with a low environmental footprint   while delivering social and economic sustainability to every parish in the country. </p><p>And further growth will be necessary.  The United Nations has estimated that we need to produce more food in the next 25 years than has ever been produced in human history. Dairy demand is projected to grow by 29 per cent by 2050 to meet future nutritional needs. We firmly believe as an industry that we can balance our environmental, social and economic sustainability commitments to meet this demand, instead of production leaking to other countries with multiples of the environmental footprint of Irish agriculture.

It was clear that we needed to scale up this to a national level movement and this spring saw the launch of the Farming for Water project supported by the Local Authority Waters Programme (LAWPRO), Teagasc and Dairy Industry Ireland. Mulvihill says the programme includes innovations like results-based payments, a research hub and nature-based solutions. The programme utilises the ASSAP assessment approach, bringing a joined-up approach to delivering relevant, bespoke on-farm advice and incentivising the implementation of measures,  he adds. We know this work is critical, as challenges in relation to water quality are leading to considerable policy uncertainty regarding the future of the nitrates derogation, which is crucial to underpinning the economic and social sustainability of Ireland s outdoor, grass-based production system. This uncertainty is impacting on the ability of the sector and farm families to plan for the future. Addressing this with urgency is critical to secure the future direction of the Irish dairy and the wider agriculture sector. With regard to the future of Ireland s nitrates derogation, it should be clearly noted that no country has complied with the Nitrates Directive, so why threaten the viability of our globally recognised grass-based industry with its removal?"]}, {"relevance_score": 33, "title": "Native Irish oysters return to Belfast Lough after a 100-year absence", "published": "2024-08-16", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">After more than 100 years, oysters are back in Belfast Lough.

According to researchers at Queen's University Belfast, the lough is in hypertrophic status - the worst category of waterway nutrient pollution. More than 80% of the bacterial DNA tested from algal mats belonged to potentially hazardous microbes, including E.coli, salmonella and 11 others that can cause human illness. The scientists tested samples from mats of algae at Toome Lock, Rea's Wood, Antrim Boathouse and Ram's Island in 2023. Their work has confirmed the lough's hypertrophic status - the worst category of waterway nutrient pollution They found the samples to be 'dominated' by bacteria associated with wildfowl or livestock faeces or human-effluent wastewater treatment. And they detected a large amount of toxins, including one that has not been discovered on the island of Ireland before. Antrim and District Angling Club has urged members not to consume their catches, to take extra care when handling fish and take all precautions to wash and sanitise after contact with water and fish. Dr Neil Reid from the Institute of Global Food Security at the school of biological sciences in QU, was the lead author of the report, said farmers had a key role in addressing the problem. \"Technological solutions to better use slurry, for example, through anaerobic biodigestion, as well as good on-farm wastewater management is needed urgently on most farms,\" he said. \"So-called 'nature-based solutions' such as planting vegetation and leaving buffer strips along waterways or creating drainage swales, willow plantations and reedbeds could dramatically reduce the environmental footprint of farming avoiding any conflict with the productivity and profitability of the agriculture sector.\" He called for government to support a \"just transition\" for the agricultural sector, through agri-environment subsidies. \"Recent national and local political change should foster optimism that the environment and opportunities for change now exist,\" he said. The study, published in the journal Environment International, found the hazardous algal bloom (HAB) that developed in 2023 was \"an unprecedented environmental perturbation to an internationally important ecosystem\", likely due to a combination of excess nutrient in the water, climate change and the effects of invasive species. It says \"significant investment\" would be needed in wastewater infrastructure and in-lake remediation strategies. A Lough Neagh action plan is in place to address the challenges facing the largest body of freshwater in these islands. It includes a research programme to test potential solutions to the blue-green algal crisis. Addressing its members, Antrim and District Angling Association said: \"In recent weeks the large build up of Blue-green algal bloom has taken over the lough and has amassed as far up as the Airplane Pool at the Castle Gardens. \"Dr Neil Reid from Queens University confirmed not only the highest levels of hypertrophic contamination ever recorded on the Island of Ireland, but also the discovery of never before found bacterias that are extremely harmful to both animals and humans. \"We are now advising all members NOT to consume fish caught from the Six Mile River for the foreseeable future. \"Members are also advised to be extra careful when handling fish and take all precautions when fishing to wash and sanitise after contact with water and fish. \"We regret what is happening on our waters and as a committee, we want you to know that we, along with other lough based angling clubs and together with the UAF, LNP, LNT and SMWT are working hard to bring as much influence to remedy the algae problem. \"We trust you are enjoying your fishing and encourage you all to move to catch and release until further notice.\" With the Crumlin River also choked with green sludge, the Crumlin and District Angling Association has said that the situation is 'much, much worse than last year', adding: \"The system is broken and needs fixing. We must protect our natural resources.\" A spokesman for the Six Mile Water Trust added: \"We should note the risk to health.

He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album Acrasia back in 2019. His latest single, If You Want A Good Dream, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on I Don't Want to Know - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, Sleeping with Ghosts. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>Daire Heffernan The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne</p><p>Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream.</p><p>Ahmed, With Love Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like Whatchimacallit deserve a wide audience. He's prolific, too. Another song - Wok To Blackrock - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>Baba Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, Sad Party, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of 1\u00ff\u00ff% Her - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring.</p><p>Tayne Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, Love, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, Good Vibrations, was a hoot. Ordinary Love, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, Saipan, will be huge. A big-screen</p><p>dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>Cara Loftus Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on The Last Duel, Disenchanted and Star Wars: The Last Jedi. An impressive</p><p>list, but Dubliner Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut Spilt Milk, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak.</p><p>First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama The Sparrow gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in The Listeners, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>Ella Lily Hyland Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in Fifteen-Love, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller Black Doves, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in Towards Zero - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica</p><p>Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama A Thousand Blows on Disney+.</p><p>Thaddea Graham The second season of Bad Sisters may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's After the Hunt, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now.</p><p>Niamh Moriarty A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan</p><p>and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series Best Interests. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama September Says, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama Louise Lives Large, and is currently developing</p><p>a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences.</p><p>Sade Malone A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's Antigone, Marian Quinn's Twig was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's Sive at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series Hope Street, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025.</p><p>Peter Claffey Another Bad Sisters regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms, a hugely anticipated prequel to Game of Thrones, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros. These kinds of roles can be life-changing. Best of luck to</p><p>Sustainability</p><p>Laura-Kate Howells Nurturing the next generation of advocates for our environment is Laura-Kate Howells. She has just launched a forest school, F\u00e1sta Go Fi\u00e1in (Grown Wild), in Cahersiveen, Co Kerry. It follows her restoration of an old farmhouse and barn, which she shared on Instagram (@stories_of_change_). Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster. Alongside that, she's designing a nature-based, solutions-focused programme for schools and youth groups, blending creativity with her extensive environmental education work.</p><p>William O'Brien Ballincollig's William O'Brien along with Colm O'Brien, Jamie Wedderburn and Akhil Voorakkara are the co-founders of Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering. Their revolutionary start-up puts robots to work restoring ocean ecosystems. Their robots are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster than human-led methods at restoring crucial, carbon-capturing seascapes, including seagrass beds, which draw down 35 times more carbon than rainforests. Seagrass is present in every ocean, making it the focus of their first autonomous marine drones, which are restoring these precious ecosystems in the US and Australia. Next year will see them expand their restoration work and grow into other ocean conservation efforts, including environmental monitoring and habitat mapping. With $2m pre-seed funding secured, these men will be making waves in 2025 sussing climate solutions that benefit us all.</p><p>Karen May Xocean is a Louth-based company supplying uncrewed surface vessels that map the seabed and excel at environmental monitoring. The autonomous nature of these crafts saves lives by taking humans out of harm's way and letting tech do this treacherous work. The continuous data collection Xocean vessels deliver assists our shift to renewable energy, aiding wind farm projects. Next year will be busy for CFO and director Karen May as the company plans major expansion, increasing its headcount by 100 globally. The revolutionary tech company will grow its operations in Australia and mainland Europe. The Irish innovators are one of Europe's fastest-growing clean tech companies and secured (EURO)30m funding earlier this year, so 2025 will be very impactful.</p><p>Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of our climate's warming so far, hence their prevalence in this list, and activists are leading the charge in advocating for policies to protect the ecosystems that sustain our lives. With 2025 set to be a landmark year for the ocean, Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 should be on your radar. From tireless advocacy work with FairSeas leading to the publication of the Marine Protected Areas Bill, to attending the UN Ocean Conference in France and releasing a new short film that he produced and presented highlighting Ireland's coastal communities, O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 has a busy year ahead.</p><p>Aoife Rooney Ireland's omniscient sustainable fashion designer is going international in 2025. Those who enjoyed the Kildare designer's Conscious Atelier in Naas will be heartened to know her exquisitely curated sustainable boutique stepped aside so Aoife Lifestyle could be shared with the world.</p><p>Her new year will be dedicated to her circular fashion brand being celebrated abroad. Marvel at Rooney's Marcella SS25 collection, inspired by her grandmother, to see how sustainability can be synonymous with luxury. Rooney's use of sustainable natural fabrics, including Irish beetled linens, tweeds, GOTS-certified organic cotton and organic denim set the standard for sustainable Irish design.</p><p>Jennifer Quinn Saying 'I do' got sustainable when Jennifer Quinn opened Cirq in Kildare. Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February. The new year will see Cirq collaborate with beloved Irish bridal boutiques to showcase their sample gowns, and Quinn's rental section will increase too. A mustvisit for 2025 and beyond brides.</p><p>Paul McAree Drumroll please! The circular economy meets craftsmanship in Paul McAree's Retuned. The Clonakilty, Co Cork-based creator upcycles musical instruments into unique homeware - a fun example of the circular economy in action, giving these pieces another life. Think vinyl clocks, cymbal lamps and drum tables. McAree's passion turned into a business after family and friends who received gifts of his reimagined instruments encouraged him. His wife and daughters coined the pitch-perfect name Retuned. Next year will be a big year of progress with our shift to the circular economy and Paul intends to showcase his sustainable designs around the country. You can see them for yourself at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.retuned.ie\">www.retuned.ie</url>.</p><p>David Hartigan 'Every job is a climate job' is an adage exemplified by David Hartigan's centring of sustainability in his entrepreneurial pursuits. The Dubliner founded Hemp Heroes and Blynk+ Drinks. Hemp Heroes is the first hemp company, as well as pet and food supplement company, to achieve B-Corp certification in Ireland - the gold standard for sustainable business operations. Hartigan's 2025 plans will set tails wagging as he prepares to launch more sustainable functional pet treats. There'll be some for us humans too, harnessing the power of organic functional mushrooms. This entrepreneur-on-the-rise is moving to a bigger premises, where he'll install solar panels. The future looks bright.</p><p>Activists</p><p>Jenny Maguire In February 2024, Jenny Maguire was elected as the next president of Trinity College Dublin Students' Union in a landslide victory. An outspoken transgender activist, Maguire has always been passionate about social justice issues and keen to make the world a more accepting place. \"Activism has never felt like something I have pursued,\" she says, \"but instead, something I've inherently done. I've always been a sensitive soul who has always wanted justice for all. Injustice doesn't shut me down, it has always pushed me forward to try and make good. I'm too stubbornly optimistic to stop demanding a better world\u2026\"</p><p>Sofiya Kalinova When Sofiya Kalinova qualified as a barrister in 2023, she became the first deaf person in the country to do so. Kalinova's qualification marked a groundbreaking moment for inclusivity in the Irish legal system. Understanding how inaccessible systems can marginalise people, Kalinova was determined to ensure that the law serves everyone equally, regardless of their circumstances. Currently, Kalinova is developing a project to make vital legal knowledge accessible to ISL users and help to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the legal system. \"Becoming a barrister has allowed me to combine my advocacy work with a professional platform to drive systemic change,\" she says.</p><p>An Dream Dearg The Irish language thrives in Northern Ireland, thanks, in part, to An Dream Dearg, a grassroots network advocating for Irish language rights. Since its founding in 2017, it has championed legislative protection for the Irish language and its growing community through a rightsbased Irish language act, #AchtAnois. By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change. Rooted in activism, it challenges inequality, inspires action, and proves that no question is too bold to ask for a fairer future for the Irish language. \"We are not naive to the fact that we still have a long way to go,\" says a spokesperson from the network, \"and we will continue to use our platform and our voices, just as we have done in the past, to ensure rights, recognition and respect for the Irish language.\"</p><p>Darragh Adelaide A video of Darragh Adelaide went viral in 2023 when he surprised a right-wing anti-immigration protester by replying to him in fluent Irish. Adelaide's activism goes beyond anti-racism; he has campaigned on the issues of housing, trans rights and Palestinian liberation to name but a few. Adelaide has since been elected as a councillor for Clondalkin on South Dublin County Council with People Before Profit. In his short time on the council, Adelaide has been active on tackling dereliction, combating the far-right, and the provision of public care nurses.</p><p>Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez After moving to Ireland from Venezuela in 2013, Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez became a passionate activist for migrants' political rights</p><p>and minority representation. She directs National Voter Registration Day, educating and empowering minorities to engage with the Irish political system.

Dr Khan aspires to inspire hope and understanding, saying, \"I want people to learn that those seeking sanctuary at our doors have stories behind them.\"</p><p>James Stokes Having campaigned for his school to provide free sanitary products to people affected by period poverty, James Stokes has had a clear interest in combating society's inequalities from a young age. Stokes is a Traveller activist and aspiring politician who credits his grandfather - also an</p><p>activist - with inspiring him to stand up for what he believes in. Currently a student at Maynooth University and working as an education support worker, Stokes hopes to become a primary school teacher but also plans to continue working for change. \"I hope to continue being an activist that will stand up to the next government to demand a national Traveller mental health strategy,\" he says, adding he'd like to stand for election in the future.</p><p>Andrea Reilly Growing up in foster care is challenging, especially for children with disabilities. Andrea Reilly, who has fetal alcohol spectrum disorder and spent 18 years in care, uses her lived experience to inspire change. As an active member of the EPIC (Empowering People in Care) Youth Council, she advises EPIC and national stakeholders on issues impacting children and young people with disabilities in care. By sharing her story and engaging directly with decision makers, Reilly aims to inspire change and ensure better support for children with disabilities in care.</p><p>shion</p><p>Fa</p><p>Megan Williams Mayo-born jewellery designer Megan Williams got a lovely surprise this summer when she was sent a photograph of Zendaya wearing a pair of her freshwater pearl earrings. It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says. Now based in Lyon, Williams's focus for 2025 is to expand her stockists across France, Ireland and the UK, \"and to keep making beautiful things\".</p><p>Emmanuella Nkem Isede A fashion content creator since 2021, Emmanuella Nkem Isede is gaining a reputation for her big, bold and utterly singular styling. Mixing up finds from the high street, charity shops and unexpected brands, she creates looks that are every bit as inventive as fashion's most influential stylists. Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother.</p><p>\"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon. By day, he creates avantgarde pieces that are at the intersection of costume and haute couture. By night, he works with the legendary Susanne Bartsch, hosting and producing lavish parties. Mangru has produced two New York Fashion Week collections of his own, with a third coming in February. Meanwhile, his work is getting noticed by the people he has long admired, including Emmy award-winning costume designer Zaldy. The pair recently worked together</p><p>on the first-ever trans-inclusive Victoria's Secret show, with Mangru creating outfits for models including Valentina Sampaio and Gigi Hadid.</p><p>Ben Harte It was a big year for Meath-born production designer Ben Harte, who creates a world of his own through set design and fashion styling. During the summer, he got the opportunity to assist the touring stylists of Kylie Minogue, Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj for their Dublin concerts. \"Initially, I thought it was going to be an intimidating experience,\" he says, \"but after spending all day with the artists' teams, we all really warmed up to each other and I had great fun hearing their stories and advice.\" His set design is also getting noticed, with PhotoVogue - an online offshoot of Vogue magazine - highlighting his work. Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plussize collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign. It's the latest international booking for the 22-year-old, Wicklow-born model, who was scouted by an agent from Not Another Agency in P Mac's pub in April 2023. Higgins's first-ever modelling job was for the Burberry AW24 campaign, which was shot in Ireland. She's now signed by agencies in London, Milan and Paris and, after graduating from a bachelor's degree in spatial planning, she'll be dedicating the next year to modelling.</p><p>Arts</p><p>Rois\u00edn O'Donnell A slew of writers - from Elaine Feeney to Roddy Doyle - have heaped praise on the forthcoming debut novel Nesting by award-winning writer Rois\u00edn O'Donnell. Nesting is the story of a mother named Ciara Fay, who makes a split-second decision to leave the family home with her children and soon finds herself navigating the precarious housing system. O'Donnell's debut short story collection, Wild Quiet, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals The Stinging Fly and The Tangerine, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. Nesting will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. A Fix of Light is aimed at teens</p><p>aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing ( just look at the success of series Heartstopper), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world.</p><p>Anna Mullarkey Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play Safe House, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In Safe House - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from</p><p>Galway, composed the music for Safe House and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After Safe House completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>Allie O'Rourke Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show The Good Room and the film Scouting for Boys, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show Girl D**k Energy to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>Jessie Thompson This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show Crawler at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>Wendy Erskine Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel The Benefactors being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in The Benefactors, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, Sweet Home and Dance Move, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>Dave Tynan Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature Dublin Oldschool, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson. But he's also a writer whose short fiction has featured in Winter Papers and The Stinging Fly, and in spring we'll see his name reaching an even bigger audience when his debut short story collection, We Used to Dance Here, is published by the prestigious UK publisher Granta Books. His publisher describes the collection as comprising \"taut, humane and unflinching stories that explore Dublin's underbelly\". Sign us up.</p><p>Mike Rice Fans of the Northern Irish comedian Vittorio Angelone will be familiar with Mike Rice, a fellow comedian who's his co-star on their podcast Mike &amp; Vittorio's Guide to Parenting (key point: neither have children). With his first-ever Vicar Street show set for September next year, it looks like Rice is building towards bringing his comedy to the next level in 2025. Irreverent and with a gift for impressions, the Kilkenny native is gathering a large fanbase on social media, which Ireland's comics are finding a solid base from which to create a longterm career.</p><p>Fo od &amp;</p><p>drink</p><p>Anthony O'Toole Perched on the picturesque Carrig Rua Hill in north Wexford behind his parents' house, chef and food consultant Anthony O'Toole's tiny edible garden is home to over 500 varieties of organic heritage seeds and plants grown for flavour rather than yield. Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east. O'Toole is someone who gets things done without shouting about it, so keep an eye on his progress on Instagram (@fattomato_)</p><p>Laura Chabal 2025 will get off to a busy start as, with her husband, chef Kevin O'Donnell from Wexford, Chabal is gearing up to open their first restaurant, Comet, in the early spring in partnership with Barry Fitzgerald of Bastible. Chabal is French- Irish; she and O'Donnell met in Dublin and spent several years in Copenhagen before returning to Ireland via France last year. The couple have been running the</p><p>Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin. O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota The Ib\u00edl\u00c8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00c8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00c8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his</p><p>partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg Estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination, which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead. Much of the produce used by the kitchen is grown or foraged on the estate or in the local area.</p><p>Jennie Moran Fans of Luncheonette cafe in its incarnation as NCAD's canteen or its later Hugh Lane Gallery residency will know Jennie Moran and her fabulous frocks. An artist with a fascination and flair for food, Moran's academic leanings were fostered in unique ways by a recent master's in gastronomy and food studies at TU Dublin. She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer</p><p>Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than (EURO)11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events</p><p>caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks. This small but mighty hardback is packed with 100 family-friendly recipes, variations and tips to inspire anyone looking to eat well with minimal fuss or waste.</p><p>Sebastian Skillings Another newcomer at The Irish Food Writing Awards 2024, winning the Food and Drink TikTok /Insta Award thanks to his gorgeous iPhone photography and often simple, always appealing seafood recipe ideas shared as The Hungry Fishmonger on Instagram. Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin</p><p>with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram</p><p>page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer.</p><p>John Kearns Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricksand-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus.</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-ofhouse half of the couple who secured</p><p>two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing</p><p>possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.bech-bailey.com\">www.bech-bailey.com</url>.</p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under- 19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fasttracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria,</p><p>he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender</p><p>for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under- 23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p>", "publisher": "Irish Independent", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 328, "title": "The ones to watch 2025 - Ireland's rising stars and new talents", "published": "2024-12-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">?Here are the names you need to look out for next year:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Music</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">?Ramper</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ramper is the nom-de-plume of Donegal alt-folk troubadour Declan McClafferty. He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acrasia </emphasis>back in 2019. His latest single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">If You Want A Good Dream</emphasis>, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I Don't Want to Know</emphasis> - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords</p><p>The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleeping with Ghosts</emphasis>. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>?Ahmed, With Love</p><p>Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whatchimacallit</emphasis> deserve a wide audience. He's prolific too. Another song - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wok To Blackrock</emphasis> - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>?Baba</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sad Party</emphasis>, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100% Her</emphasis> - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring. </p><p>?Tayne</p><p>Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Love</emphasis>, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>?Daire Heffernan</p><p>The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">?John Meagher</emphasis></p><p>Film and TV</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn?</p><p>An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Good Vibrations</emphasis>, was a hoot. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ordinary Love</emphasis>, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but the point is this: Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saipan</emphasis>, will be huge. A big-screen dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>?Cara Loftus</p><p>Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Duel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disenchanted</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</emphasis>. An impressive list, but Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spilt Milk</emphasis>, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak. First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sparrow</emphasis> gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Listeners</emphasis>, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>?Ella Lily Hyland</p><p>Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fifteen-Love</emphasis>, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Doves</emphasis>, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Towards Zero</emphasis> - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Thousand Blows</emphasis> on Disney+. </p><p>?Thaddea Graham</p><p>The second season of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">After the Hunt</emphasis>, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now. </p><p>?Niamh Moriarty</p><p>A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Best Interests</emphasis>. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">September Says</emphasis>, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Louise Lives Large</emphasis>, and is currently developing a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences. </p><p>?Sade Malone</p><p>A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Antigone</emphasis>, Marian Quinn's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twig</emphasis> was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sive</emphasis> at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hope Street</emphasis>, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025. </p><p>?Peter Claffey</p><p>Another <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</emphasis>, a hugely anticipated prequel to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Game of Thrones</emphasis>, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros. These kinds of roles can be life-changing. Best of luck to Mr Claffey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris Wasser</emphasis></p><p>Sustainability</p><p>Laura-Kate Howells</p><p>Nurturing the next generation of advocates for our environment is Laura-Kate Howells. She has just launched a forest school, F\u00e1sta Go Fi\u00e1in (Grown Wild) in Cahersiveen, Co Kerry. It follows her restoration of an old farmhouse and barn, which she shared on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@stories_of_change_</emphasis>). Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster. Alongside that, she's designing a nature-based, solutions-focused programme for schools and youth groups, blending creativity with her extensive environmental education work.</p><p>William O'Brien</p><p>Ballincollig's William O'Brien along with Colm O'Brien, Jamie Wedderburn and Akhil Voorakkara are the co-founders of Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering. Their revolutionary start-up puts robots to work restoring ocean ecosystems. Their robots are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster than human-led methods at restoring crucial, carbon-capturing seascapes, including seagrass beds, which draw down 35 times more carbon than rainforests. Seagrass is present in every ocean, making it the focus of their first autonomous marine drones, which are restoring these precious ecosystems in the US and Australia. Next year will see them expand their restoration work and grow into other ocean conservation efforts, including environmental monitoring and habitat mapping. With $2m pre-seed funding secured, these men will be making waves in 2025 sussing climate solutions that benefit us all.</p><p>Karen May</p><p>Xocean is a Louth-based company supplying uncrewed surface vessels that map the seabed and excel at environmental monitoring. The autonomous nature of these crafts saves lives by taking humans out of harm's way and letting tech do this treacherous work. The continuous data collection Xocean vessels deliver assists our shift to renewable energy, aiding wind farm projects. Next year will be busy for CFO and director Karen May as the company plans major expansion, increasing its headcount by 100 globally. The revolutionary tech company will grow its operations in Australia and mainland Europe. The Irish innovators are one of Europe's fastest-growing clean tech companies and secured \u20ac30m funding earlier this year, so 2025 will be very impactful. </p><p>Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1</p><p>Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of our climate's warming so far, hence their prevalence in this list, and activists are leading the charge in advocating for policies to protect the ecosystems that sustain our lives. With 2025 set to be a landmark year for the ocean, Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 should be on your radar. From tireless advocacy work with FairSeas leading to the publication of the Marine Protected Areas Bill, to attending the UN Ocean Conference in France and releasing a new short film that he produced and presented highlighting Ireland's coastal communities, O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 has a busy year ahead.</p><p>Aoife Rooney</p><p>Ireland's omniscient sustainable fashion designer is going international in 2025. Those who enjoyed the Kildare designer's Conscious Atelier in Naas will be heartened to know her exquisitely curated sustainable boutique stepped aside so Aoife Lifestyle could be shared with the world. Her new year will be dedicated to her circular fashion brand being celebrated abroad. Marvel at Rooney's Marcella SS25 collection, inspired by her grandmother, to see how sustainability can be synonymous with luxury. Rooney's use of sustainable natural fabrics, including Irish beetled linens, tweeds, GOTS-certified organic cotton and organic denim set the standard for sustainable Irish design.</p><p>Jennifer Quinn</p><p>Saying 'I do' got sustainable when Jennifer Quinn opened Cirq in Kildare. Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February. The new year will see Cirq collaborate with beloved Irish bridal boutiques to showcase their sample gowns, and Quinn's rental section will increase too. A must-visit for 2025 and beyond brides.</p><p>Paul McAree</p><p>Drumroll please! The circular economy meets craftsmanship in Paul McAree's Retuned. The Clonakilty, Co Cork-based creator upcycles musical instruments into unique homeware - a fun example of the circular economy in action, giving these pieces another life. Think vinyl clocks, cymbal lamps and drum tables. McAree's passion turned into a business after family and friends who received gifts of his reimagined instruments encouraged him. His wife and daughters coined the pitch-perfect name Retuned. Next year will be a big year of progress with our shift to the circular economy and Paul intends to showcase his sustainable designs around the country.

The Dubliner founded Hemp Heroes and Blynk+ Drinks. Hemp Heroes is the first hemp company, as well as pet and food supplement company, to achieve B-Corp certification in Ireland - the gold standard for sustainable business operations. Hartigan's 2025 plans will set tails wagging as he prepares to launch more sustainable functional pet treats. There'll be some for us humans too, harnessing the power of organic functional mushrooms.

An outspoken transgender activist, Maguire has always been passionate about social justice issues and keen to make the world a more accepting place. She says, \"Activism has never felt like something I have pursued, but instead, something I've inherently done. I've always been a sensitive soul who has always wanted justice for all. Injustice doesn't shut me down, it has always pushed me forward to try and make good. I'm too stubbornly optimistic to stop demanding a better world...\"</p><p>?Sofiya Kalinova</p><p>When Sofiya Kalinova qualified as a barrister in 2023, she became the first deaf person in the country to do so. Kalinova's qualification marked a groundbreaking moment for inclusivity in the Irish legal system. Understanding how inaccessible systems can marginalise people, Kalinova was determined to ensure that the law serves everyone equally, regardless of their circumstances. Currently, Kalinova is developing a project to make vital legal knowledge accessible to ISL users and help to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the legal system. \"Becoming a barrister has allowed me to combine my advocacy work with a professional platform to drive systemic change,\" she says.?</p><p>An Dream Dearg</p><p>The Irish language thrives in Northern Ireland, thanks, in part, to An Dream Dearg, a grassroots network advocating for Irish language rights. Since its founding in 2017, it has championed legislative protection for the Irish language and its growing community through a rights-based Irish language act, #AchtAnois. By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change. Rooted in activism, it challenges inequality, inspires action, and proves that no question is too bold to ask for a fairer future for the Irish language. \"We are not naive to the fact that we still have a long way to go,\" says a spokesperson from the network, \"and we will continue to use our platform and our voices, just as we have done in the past, to ensure rights, recognition and respect for the Irish language.\"</p><p>Darragh Adelaide</p><p>A video of Darragh Adelaide went viral in 2023 when he surprised a right-wing anti-immigration protester by replying to him in fluent Irish. Adelaide's activism goes beyond anti-racism; he has campaigned on the issues of housing, trans rights and Palestinian liberation to name but a few. Adelaide has since been elected as a councillor for Clondalkin on South Dublin County Council with People Before Profit. In his short time on the council, Adelaide has been active on tackling dereliction, combating the far-right, and the provision of public care nurses.?</p><p>Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez</p><p>After moving to Ireland from Venezuela in 2013, Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez became a passionate activist for migrants' political rights and minority representation.

Stokes is a Traveller activist and aspiring politician who credits his grandfather - also an activist - with inspiring him to stand up for what he believes in. Currently a student at Maynooth University and working as an education support worker, Stokes hopes to become a primary school teacher but also plans to continue working for change. \"I hope to continue being an activist that will stand up to the next government to demand a national Traveller mental health strategy,\" says Stokes, adding that he'd also like to stand for election in the future.</p><p>Andrea Reilly</p><p>Growing up in foster care is challenging, especially for children with disabilities.

It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says. Now based in Lyon, Williams's focus for 2025 is to expand her stockists across France, Ireland and the UK, \"and to keep making beautiful things\".</p><p>Emmanuella Nkem Isede</p><p>A fashion content creator since 2021, Emmanuella Nkem Isede is gaining a reputation for her big, bold and utterly singular styling. Mixing up finds from the high street, charity shops and unexpected brands, she creates looks that are every bit as inventive as fashion's most influential stylists. Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother. \"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru</p><p>At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon. By day, he creates avant-garde pieces that are at the intersection of costume and haute couture. By night, he works with the legendary Susanne Bartsch, hosting and producing lavish parties. Mangru has produced two New York Fashion Week collections of his own, with a third coming in February. Meanwhile, his work is getting noticed by the people he has long admired, including Emmy award-winning costume designer Zaldy. The pair recently worked together on the first-ever trans-inclusive Victoria's Secret show, with Mangru creating outfits for models including Valentina Sampaio and Gigi Hadid.</p><p>Ben Harte</p><p>It was a big year for Meath-born production designer Ben Harte, who creates a world of his own through set design and fashion styling. During the summer, he got the opportunity to assist the touring stylists of Kylie Minogue, Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj for their Dublin concerts. \"Initially, I thought it was going to be an intimidating experience,\" he says, \"but after spending all day with the artists' teams, we all really warmed up to each other and I had great fun hearing their stories and advice.\" His set design is also getting noticed, with PhotoVogue - an online offshoot of Vogue magazine - highlighting his work. Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray</p><p>When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp;amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plus-size collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins</p><p>With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign. It's the latest international booking for the 22-year-old, Wicklow-born model, who was scouted by an agent from Not Another Agency in P Mac's pub in April 2023. Higgins's first-ever modelling job was for the Burberry AW24 campaign, which was shot in Ireland. She's now signed by agencies in London, Milan and Paris and, after graduating from a bachelor's degree in spatial planning, she'll be dedicating the next year to modelling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katie Byrne</emphasis></p><p>?Arts</p><p>?Rois\u00edn O'Donnell</p><p>A slew of writers - from Elaine Feeney to Roddy Doyle - have heaped praise on the forthcoming debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> by award-winning writer Rois\u00edn O'Donnell. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> is the story of a mother named Ciara Fay, who makes a split-second decision to leave the family home with her children and soon finds herself navigating the precarious housing system. O'Donnell's debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Quiet</emphasis>, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Tangerine</emphasis>, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton</p><p>Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fix of Light</emphasis> is aimed at teens aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing (just look at the success of series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heartstopper</emphasis>), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world. </p><p>?Anna Mullarkey</p><p>Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis>, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from Galway, composed the music for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>?Allie O'Rourke</p><p>Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Room</emphasis> and the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scouting for Boys</emphasis>, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Girl D**k Energy</emphasis> to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>?Jessie Thompson</p><p>This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crawler</emphasis> at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams</p><p>Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>?Wendy Erskine</p><p>Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis> being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis>, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sweet Home</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dance Move</emphasis>, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>?Dave Tynan</p><p>Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dublin Oldschool</emphasis>, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson. But he's also a writer whose short fiction has featured in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winter Papers</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis>, and in spring we'll see his name reaching an even bigger audience when his debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We Used to Dance Here</emphasis>, is published by the prestigious UK publisher Granta Books. His publisher describes the collection as comprising \"taut, humane and unflinching stories that explore Dublin's underbelly\".

With his first-ever Vicar Street show set for September next year, it looks like Rice is building towards bringing his comedy to the next level in 2025. Irreverent and with a gift for impressions, the Kilkenny native is gathering a large fanbase on social media, which Ireland's comics are finding a solid base from which to create a longterm career. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aoife Barry</emphasis></p><p>Food and Drink</p><p>Anthony O'Toole</p><p>Perched on the picturesque Carrig Rua Hill in north Wexford behind his parents' house, chef and food consultant Anthony O'Toole's tiny edible garden is home to over 500 varieties of organic heritage seeds and plants grown for flavour rather than yield.  Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east. O'Toole is someone who gets things done without shouting about it, so keep an eye on his progress on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@fattomato_</emphasis>)</p><p>Laura Chabal</p><p>Laura Chabal's 2025 will get off to a busy start as, with her husband, chef Kevin O'Donnell from Wexford, she is gearing up to open their first restaurant, Comet, in the early spring in partnership with Barry Fitzgerald of Bastible. Chabal is French-Irish; she and O'Donnell met in Dublin and spent several years in Copenhagen before returning to Ireland via France last year.  The couple have been running the Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin.  O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota</p><p>The Ib\u00edl\u00e8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00e8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00e8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu</p><p>Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane</p><p>Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead. Much of the produce used by the kitchen is grown or foraged on the estate or in the local area.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katy McGuinness</emphasis></p><p>Jennie Moran</p><p>Fans of Luncheonette cafe in its incarnation as NCAD's canteen or its later Hugh Lane Gallery residency will know Jennie Moran and her fabulous frocks. An artist with a fascination and flair for food, Moran's academic leanings were fostered in unique ways by a recent master's in gastronomy and food studies at TU Dublin. She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew</p><p>Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than \u20ac11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks. This small but mighty hardback is packed with 100 family-friendly recipes, variations and tips to inspire anyone looking to eat well with minimal fuss or waste. </p><p>Sebastian Skillings</p><p>Another newcomer at The Irish Food Writing Awards 2024, winning the Food and Drink TikTok /Insta Award thanks to his gorgeous iPhone photography and often simple, always appealing seafood recipe ideas shared as The Hungry Fishmonger on Instagram. Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer. </p><p>John Kearns</p><p>Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricks-and-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus. </p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-of-house half of the couple who secured two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through bech-bailey.com. </p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane</p><p>Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under-19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel</p><p>The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fast-tracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria, he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill</p><p>Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under-23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham</p><p>A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan</p><p>Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan</p><p>Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cathal Dennehy</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "Wexford People (Ireland)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 328, "title": "The ones to watch 2025 - Ireland's rising stars and new talents", "published": "2024-12-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">?Here are the names you need to look out for next year:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Music</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">?Ramper</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ramper is the nom-de-plume of Donegal alt-folk troubadour Declan McClafferty.

It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>?Ahmed, With Love</p><p>Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whatchimacallit</emphasis> deserve a wide audience. He's prolific too. Another song - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wok To Blackrock</emphasis> - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>?Baba</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sad Party</emphasis>, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100% Her</emphasis> - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring. </p><p>?Tayne</p><p>Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Love</emphasis>, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>?Daire Heffernan</p><p>The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">?John Meagher</emphasis></p><p>Film and TV</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn?</p><p>An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Good Vibrations</emphasis>, was a hoot. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ordinary Love</emphasis>, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but the point is this: Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saipan</emphasis>, will be huge. A big-screen dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>?Cara Loftus</p><p>Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Duel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disenchanted</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</emphasis>. An impressive list, but Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spilt Milk</emphasis>, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak. First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sparrow</emphasis> gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Listeners</emphasis>, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>?Ella Lily Hyland</p><p>Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fifteen-Love</emphasis>, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Doves</emphasis>, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Towards Zero</emphasis> - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Thousand Blows</emphasis> on Disney+. </p><p>?Thaddea Graham</p><p>The second season of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">After the Hunt</emphasis>, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now. </p><p>?Niamh Moriarty</p><p>A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Best Interests</emphasis>. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">September Says</emphasis>, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Louise Lives Large</emphasis>, and is currently developing a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences. </p><p>?Sade Malone</p><p>A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Antigone</emphasis>, Marian Quinn's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twig</emphasis> was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sive</emphasis> at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hope Street</emphasis>, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025. </p><p>?Peter Claffey</p><p>Another <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</emphasis>, a hugely anticipated prequel to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Game of Thrones</emphasis>, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros. These kinds of roles can be life-changing. Best of luck to Mr Claffey.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Chris Wasser</emphasis></p><p>Sustainability</p><p>Laura-Kate Howells</p><p>Nurturing the next generation of advocates for our environment is Laura-Kate Howells.

Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster. Alongside that, she's designing a nature-based, solutions-focused programme for schools and youth groups, blending creativity with her extensive environmental education work.</p><p>William O'Brien</p><p>Ballincollig's William O'Brien along with Colm O'Brien, Jamie Wedderburn and Akhil Voorakkara are the co-founders of Ulysses Ecosystem Engineering. Their revolutionary start-up puts robots to work restoring ocean ecosystems. Their robots are 10 times cheaper and 100 times faster than human-led methods at restoring crucial, carbon-capturing seascapes, including seagrass beds, which draw down 35 times more carbon than rainforests. Seagrass is present in every ocean, making it the focus of their first autonomous marine drones, which are restoring these precious ecosystems in the US and Australia. Next year will see them expand their restoration work and grow into other ocean conservation efforts, including environmental monitoring and habitat mapping.

Next year will be busy for CFO and director Karen May as the company plans major expansion, increasing its headcount by 100 globally. The revolutionary tech company will grow its operations in Australia and mainland Europe. The Irish innovators are one of Europe's fastest-growing clean tech companies and secured \u20ac30m funding earlier this year, so 2025 will be very impactful. </p><p>Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1</p><p>Oceans have absorbed the vast majority of our climate's warming so far, hence their prevalence in this list, and activists are leading the charge in advocating for policies to protect the ecosystems that sustain our lives. With 2025 set to be a landmark year for the ocean, Jack O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 should be on your radar. From tireless advocacy work with FairSeas leading to the publication of the Marine Protected Areas Bill, to attending the UN Ocean Conference in France and releasing a new short film that he produced and presented highlighting Ireland's coastal communities, O'Donovan Tr\u00e1 has a busy year ahead.</p><p>Aoife Rooney</p><p>Ireland's omniscient sustainable fashion designer is going international in 2025. Those who enjoyed the Kildare designer's Conscious Atelier in Naas will be heartened to know her exquisitely curated sustainable boutique stepped aside so Aoife Lifestyle could be shared with the world. Her new year will be dedicated to her circular fashion brand being celebrated abroad. Marvel at Rooney's Marcella SS25 collection, inspired by her grandmother, to see how sustainability can be synonymous with luxury. Rooney's use of sustainable natural fabrics, including Irish beetled linens, tweeds, GOTS-certified organic cotton and organic denim set the standard for sustainable Irish design.</p><p>Jennifer Quinn</p><p>Saying 'I do' got sustainable when Jennifer Quinn opened Cirq in Kildare. Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February. The new year will see Cirq collaborate with beloved Irish bridal boutiques to showcase their sample gowns, and Quinn's rental section will increase too. A must-visit for 2025 and beyond brides.</p><p>Paul McAree</p><p>Drumroll please! The circular economy meets craftsmanship in Paul McAree's Retuned. The Clonakilty, Co Cork-based creator upcycles musical instruments into unique homeware - a fun example of the circular economy in action, giving these pieces another life. Think vinyl clocks, cymbal lamps and drum tables. McAree's passion turned into a business after family and friends who received gifts of his reimagined instruments encouraged him. His wife and daughters coined the pitch-perfect name Retuned. Next year will be a big year of progress with our shift to the circular economy and Paul intends to showcase his sustainable designs around the country.

The Dubliner founded Hemp Heroes and Blynk+ Drinks. Hemp Heroes is the first hemp company, as well as pet and food supplement company, to achieve B-Corp certification in Ireland - the gold standard for sustainable business operations. Hartigan's 2025 plans will set tails wagging as he prepares to launch more sustainable functional pet treats. There'll be some for us humans too, harnessing the power of organic functional mushrooms.

An outspoken transgender activist, Maguire has always been passionate about social justice issues and keen to make the world a more accepting place. She says, \"Activism has never felt like something I have pursued, but instead, something I've inherently done. I've always been a sensitive soul who has always wanted justice for all. Injustice doesn't shut me down, it has always pushed me forward to try and make good. I'm too stubbornly optimistic to stop demanding a better world...\"</p><p>?Sofiya Kalinova</p><p>When Sofiya Kalinova qualified as a barrister in 2023, she became the first deaf person in the country to do so. Kalinova's qualification marked a groundbreaking moment for inclusivity in the Irish legal system. Understanding how inaccessible systems can marginalise people, Kalinova was determined to ensure that the law serves everyone equally, regardless of their circumstances. Currently, Kalinova is developing a project to make vital legal knowledge accessible to ISL users and help to bridge the gap between the deaf community and the legal system. \"Becoming a barrister has allowed me to combine my advocacy work with a professional platform to drive systemic change,\" she says.?</p><p>An Dream Dearg</p><p>The Irish language thrives in Northern Ireland, thanks, in part, to An Dream Dearg, a grassroots network advocating for Irish language rights. Since its founding in 2017, it has championed legislative protection for the Irish language and its growing community through a rights-based Irish language act, #AchtAnois. By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change. Rooted in activism, it challenges inequality, inspires action, and proves that no question is too bold to ask for a fairer future for the Irish language. \"We are not naive to the fact that we still have a long way to go,\" says a spokesperson from the network, \"and we will continue to use our platform and our voices, just as we have done in the past, to ensure rights, recognition and respect for the Irish language.\"</p><p>Darragh Adelaide</p><p>A video of Darragh Adelaide went viral in 2023 when he surprised a right-wing anti-immigration protester by replying to him in fluent Irish.

Adelaide has since been elected as a councillor for Clondalkin on South Dublin County Council with People Before Profit. In his short time on the council, Adelaide has been active on tackling dereliction, combating the far-right, and the provision of public care nurses.?</p><p>Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez</p><p>After moving to Ireland from Venezuela in 2013, Liliana Fern\u00e1ndez became a passionate activist for migrants' political rights and minority representation.

It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says.

Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother. \"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru</p><p>At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon.

Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray</p><p>When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp;amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plus-size collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins</p><p>With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign.

O'Donnell's debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Quiet</emphasis>, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Tangerine</emphasis>, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton</p><p>Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fix of Light</emphasis> is aimed at teens aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing (just look at the success of series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heartstopper</emphasis>), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world. </p><p>?Anna Mullarkey</p><p>Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis>, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from Galway, composed the music for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>?Allie O'Rourke</p><p>Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Room</emphasis> and the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scouting for Boys</emphasis>, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Girl D**k Energy</emphasis> to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>?Jessie Thompson</p><p>This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crawler</emphasis> at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams</p><p>Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>?Wendy Erskine</p><p>Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis> being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis>, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sweet Home</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dance Move</emphasis>, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>?Dave Tynan</p><p>Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dublin Oldschool</emphasis>, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson. But he's also a writer whose short fiction has featured in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winter Papers</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis>, and in spring we'll see his name reaching an even bigger audience when his debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We Used to Dance Here</emphasis>, is published by the prestigious UK publisher Granta Books.

Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east. O'Toole is someone who gets things done without shouting about it, so keep an eye on his progress on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@fattomato_</emphasis>)</p><p>Laura Chabal</p><p>Laura Chabal's 2025 will get off to a busy start as, with her husband, chef Kevin O'Donnell from Wexford, she is gearing up to open their first restaurant, Comet, in the early spring in partnership with Barry Fitzgerald of Bastible. Chabal is French-Irish; she and O'Donnell met in Dublin and spent several years in Copenhagen before returning to Ireland via France last year.  The couple have been running the Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin.  O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota</p><p>The Ib\u00edl\u00e8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00e8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00e8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu</p><p>Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane</p><p>Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead. Much of the produce used by the kitchen is grown or foraged on the estate or in the local area.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katy McGuinness</emphasis></p><p>Jennie Moran</p><p>Fans of Luncheonette cafe in its incarnation as NCAD's canteen or its later Hugh Lane Gallery residency will know Jennie Moran and her fabulous frocks. An artist with a fascination and flair for food, Moran's academic leanings were fostered in unique ways by a recent master's in gastronomy and food studies at TU Dublin. She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew</p><p>Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than \u20ac11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks. This small but mighty hardback is packed with 100 family-friendly recipes, variations and tips to inspire anyone looking to eat well with minimal fuss or waste. </p><p>Sebastian Skillings</p><p>Another newcomer at The Irish Food Writing Awards 2024, winning the Food and Drink TikTok /Insta Award thanks to his gorgeous iPhone photography and often simple, always appealing seafood recipe ideas shared as The Hungry Fishmonger on Instagram. Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer. </p><p>John Kearns</p><p>Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricks-and-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus. </p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-of-house half of the couple who secured two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through bech-bailey.com. </p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane</p><p>Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under-19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel</p><p>The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fast-tracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria, he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill</p><p>Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under-23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham</p><p>A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan</p><p>Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan</p><p>Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cathal Dennehy</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "Kerryman (Ireland)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 328, "title": "The ones to watch 2025 - Ireland's rising stars and new talents", "published": "2024-12-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">?Here are the names you need to look out for next year:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Music</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">?Ramper</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ramper is the nom-de-plume of Donegal alt-folk troubadour Declan McClafferty. He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acrasia </emphasis>back in 2019. His latest single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">If You Want A Good Dream</emphasis>, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I Don't Want to Know</emphasis> - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords</p><p>The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleeping with Ghosts</emphasis>. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>?Ahmed, With Love</p><p>Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whatchimacallit</emphasis> deserve a wide audience. He's prolific too. Another song - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wok To Blackrock</emphasis> - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>?Baba</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sad Party</emphasis>, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100% Her</emphasis> - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring. </p><p>?Tayne</p><p>Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Love</emphasis>, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>?Daire Heffernan</p><p>The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">?John Meagher</emphasis></p><p>Film and TV</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn?</p><p>An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Good Vibrations</emphasis>, was a hoot. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ordinary Love</emphasis>, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but the point is this: Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saipan</emphasis>, will be huge. A big-screen dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>?Cara Loftus</p><p>Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Duel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disenchanted</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</emphasis>. An impressive list, but Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spilt Milk</emphasis>, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak. First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sparrow</emphasis> gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Listeners</emphasis>, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>?Ella Lily Hyland</p><p>Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fifteen-Love</emphasis>, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Doves</emphasis>, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Towards Zero</emphasis> - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Thousand Blows</emphasis> on Disney+. </p><p>?Thaddea Graham</p><p>The second season of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll. Next, you'll find her in Noah Baumbach and Emily Mortimer's yet-to-be-titled coming-of-ager on Netflix, which also stars - deep breath, everyone - George Clooney, Laura Dern, Greta Gerwig, Eve Hewson and Adam Sandler. After that, Graham will appear in Luca Guadagnino's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">After the Hunt</emphasis>, opposite Julia Roberts and Andrew Garfield. She's in the major league now. </p><p>?Niamh Moriarty</p><p>A Screen International 'Star of Tomorrow', Killiney teenager Niamh Moriarty made quite the impression as Sharon Horgan and Michael Sheen's disabled daughter Marnie in Jack Thorne's award-winning BBC series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Best Interests</emphasis>. Next, she'll appear in Ariane Labed's tension-fuelled family drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">September Says</emphasis>, which received its world premiere at Cannes last summer. Moriarty, who has cerebral palsy, also appeared in the RT\u00c9 teen drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Louise Lives Large</emphasis>, and is currently developing a feature screenplay inspired by her own experiences. </p><p>?Sade Malone</p><p>A flashy, contemporary remix of Sophocles's?<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Antigone</emphasis>, Marian Quinn's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Twig</emphasis> was the big opening picture at the 2024 Dublin International Film Festival. Its leading woman, the sublime Sade Malone, garnered glowing reviews for her stirring portrayal of a defiant Dubliner whose family is torn apart by a vicious gangland war. Elsewhere, the English-Irish actor headlined a warmly received revival of John B Keane's <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sive</emphasis> at the Gaiety Theatre. Throw in a regular role in the BBC crime series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Hope Street</emphasis>, and it seems Malone was everywhere this year. The sky is the limit in 2025. </p><p>?Peter Claffey</p><p>Another <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> regular. Peter Claffey's Joe doesn't get all that much screen time in Sharon Horgan's popular murder comedy. But that's OK: the former rugby union player from Galway will be front and centre of his own television series in 2025. Make way for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</emphasis>, a hugely anticipated prequel to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Game of Thrones</emphasis>, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros.

Her 2025 aim is to secure funding to make the forest school accessible to everyone in the increasingly diverse community she enjoys in Cahersiveen. Meaningful connection to nature while we're young is shown to make us more likely to become environmentally conscious adults and that's what she's aiming to foster.

Her beautiful bridal boutique experience boasts rails of secondhand and ex-sample dresses, a conscious coup for sustainable brides to be. The impact of filling a circular hole in Ireland's wedding landscape led her to save between 500kg-1,000kg of textile waste, 270,000 litres of water and three metric tonnes of CO2 emissions - not to mention the monetary savings brides buying from Cirq enjoyed by opting for secondhand style. All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February.

It transpires that the multi-hyphenate star picked them up in a London pop-up shop where a small selection of items from Williams's brand, Saltwater Design, was stocked. It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says. Now based in Lyon, Williams's focus for 2025 is to expand her stockists across France, Ireland and the UK, \"and to keep making beautiful things\".</p><p>Emmanuella Nkem Isede</p><p>A fashion content creator since 2021, Emmanuella Nkem Isede is gaining a reputation for her big, bold and utterly singular styling. Mixing up finds from the high street, charity shops and unexpected brands, she creates looks that are every bit as inventive as fashion's most influential stylists. Born in Nigeria and now based in Dublin, Isede says she inherited her love of fashion from her mother. \"She had this effortless way of putting looks together that always stood out. We didn't have enough growing up but she made sure those thrifted items stood out fashionably.\" While her mother gave her the confidence to rock to her own beat, people didn't quite get her vision at first, she adds. \"But I stuck to what I loved, and today, some of those same people who laughed are now looking up to me for inspiration.\"</p><p>John Mangru</p><p>At just 26 years of age, Dublin-born John Mangru is making waves in New York as a fashion designer, stylist and emerging club kid icon. By day, he creates avant-garde pieces that are at the intersection of costume and haute couture. By night, he works with the legendary Susanne Bartsch, hosting and producing lavish parties. Mangru has produced two New York Fashion Week collections of his own, with a third coming in February. Meanwhile, his work is getting noticed by the people he has long admired, including Emmy award-winning costume designer Zaldy. The pair recently worked together on the first-ever trans-inclusive Victoria's Secret show, with Mangru creating outfits for models including Valentina Sampaio and Gigi Hadid.</p><p>Ben Harte</p><p>It was a big year for Meath-born production designer Ben Harte, who creates a world of his own through set design and fashion styling. During the summer, he got the opportunity to assist the touring stylists of Kylie Minogue, Doja Cat and Nicki Minaj for their Dublin concerts. \"Initially, I thought it was going to be an intimidating experience,\" he says, \"but after spending all day with the artists' teams, we all really warmed up to each other and I had great fun hearing their stories and advice.\" His set design is also getting noticed, with PhotoVogue - an online offshoot of Vogue magazine - highlighting his work. Harte says he wants to up the ante next year with \"bigger set builds and more intricate designs\".</p><p>Joanne Murray</p><p>When 25-year-old Joanne Murray started designing her graduate collection at the Limerick School of Art &amp;amp; Design, she became much more aware of body diversity and unrealistic sample sizes. \"Making clothes for what we call 'straight-sized' models didn't feel right,\" she says. \"It was hard enough trying to find someone who was slim enough to fit into those garments, and it made me think, 'Why am I making this if the average person can't wear it?' Murray, who is from Ballinasloe, Co Galway, went on to win the IDI Graduate Award for her plus-size collection. Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins</p><p>With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign. It's the latest international booking for the 22-year-old, Wicklow-born model, who was scouted by an agent from Not Another Agency in P Mac's pub in April 2023. Higgins's first-ever modelling job was for the Burberry AW24 campaign, which was shot in Ireland. She's now signed by agencies in London, Milan and Paris and, after graduating from a bachelor's degree in spatial planning, she'll be dedicating the next year to modelling.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katie Byrne</emphasis></p><p>?Arts</p><p>?Rois\u00edn O'Donnell</p><p>A slew of writers - from Elaine Feeney to Roddy Doyle - have heaped praise on the forthcoming debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> by award-winning writer Rois\u00edn O'Donnell. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> is the story of a mother named Ciara Fay, who makes a split-second decision to leave the family home with her children and soon finds herself navigating the precarious housing system. O'Donnell's debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Quiet</emphasis>, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Tangerine</emphasis>, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton</p><p>Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fix of Light</emphasis> is aimed at teens aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing (just look at the success of series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heartstopper</emphasis>), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world. </p><p>?Anna Mullarkey</p><p>Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis>, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer. This year will undoubtedly see Mullarkey's star rise as the show transfers off-Broadway to St Ann's Warehouse in Brooklyn in February 2025. In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from Galway, composed the music for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>?Allie O'Rourke</p><p>Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Room</emphasis> and the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scouting for Boys</emphasis>, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Girl D**k Energy</emphasis> to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>?Jessie Thompson</p><p>This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crawler</emphasis> at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams</p><p>Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary? That must be the mindset of Nigerian-Irish Osaro Azams. She's a founder of the Fried Plantains Collective (an LGBTQ+ and feminist group for people of colour) and is a poet, singer, director and performer. As she says herself, she is \"booked and busy\", and is someone who clearly has her eye on doing bigger things in 2025.</p><p>?Wendy Erskine</p><p>Fans of Wendy Erskine's short stories will know that the Belfast writer is a truly special author - so special that you want to keep her for yourself. But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis> being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis>, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sweet Home</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dance Move</emphasis>, first. Next year will cement Erskine as one of the island's finest contemporary writers.</p><p>?Dave Tynan</p><p>Dave Tynan is another Irish creative who works across media, with a decade-long career in film including the feature <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dublin Oldschool</emphasis>, which starred Emmet Kirwan and Ian Lloyd Anderson. But he's also a writer whose short fiction has featured in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Winter Papers</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis>, and in spring we'll see his name reaching an even bigger audience when his debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">We Used to Dance Here</emphasis>, is published by the prestigious UK publisher Granta Books. His publisher describes the collection as comprising \"taut, humane and unflinching stories that explore Dublin's underbelly\".

With his first-ever Vicar Street show set for September next year, it looks like Rice is building towards bringing his comedy to the next level in 2025. Irreverent and with a gift for impressions, the Kilkenny native is gathering a large fanbase on social media, which Ireland's comics are finding a solid base from which to create a longterm career. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Aoife Barry</emphasis></p><p>Food and Drink</p><p>Anthony O'Toole</p><p>Perched on the picturesque Carrig Rua Hill in north Wexford behind his parents' house, chef and food consultant Anthony O'Toole's tiny edible garden is home to over 500 varieties of organic heritage seeds and plants grown for flavour rather than yield.  Driven by curiosity, biodiversity and flavour, the Fat Tomato horticulture project started small eight years ago and now has a kitchen pantry and an honesty shop, as well as an online store. Plans are afoot for a smallholding and a home for sharing, where chefs, gardeners, farmers, producers, artists, writers and other creatives can have time to dream, grow, cook and eat. It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east. O'Toole is someone who gets things done without shouting about it, so keep an eye on his progress on Instagram (<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">@fattomato_</emphasis>)</p><p>Laura Chabal</p><p>Laura Chabal's 2025 will get off to a busy start as, with her husband, chef Kevin O'Donnell from Wexford, she is gearing up to open their first restaurant, Comet, in the early spring in partnership with Barry Fitzgerald of Bastible. Chabal is French-Irish; she and O'Donnell met in Dublin and spent several years in Copenhagen before returning to Ireland via France last year.  The couple have been running the Comet Supper Club while they looked for premises before snagging one of the best locations in the city centre. Their new restaurant will be located on Joshua Lane, off Dawson Street in the heart of Dublin.  O'Donnell formerly worked at Restaurant Kadeau in Copenhagen and Le Doyenn\u00e9 outside Paris and is committed to serving seasonal and sustainably sourced produce from Ireland and Europe. A short wine list and longer cellar list will focus on biodynamic and natural wines from winemakers whose ethos aligns with Comet's commitment to sustainable production and high quality.</p><p>Tolu Asemota</p><p>The Ib\u00edl\u00e8 pop-ups in the Fumbally and Blas Cafe hosted by Tolu Asemota last year provided an insight into the vibrant, contemporary West African food scene in Ireland. While there are an increasing number of African street food options in Ireland, Ib\u00edl\u00e8's fine-dining and carefully considered drink offering stands out, and attracts a glamorous, diverse and sophisticated crowd. Asemota, who now works as a model after a career in data with Ryanair, is on the hunt for a permanent home for Ib\u00edl\u00e8, and we'll be hoping he finds the perfect spot for this exciting venture.</p><p>Adi Jugu</p><p>Adi Jugu is a Galway-based Sicilian pastry chef and chocolatier who worked at the fine-dining restaurant Lignum in Bullaun before setting up Brontelway with his partner Silvia Gorgone. Brontelway makes artisanal chocolates with pistachios grown in the pair's home town of Bronte, Sicily, where their families have cultivated pistachios on volcanic rock for generations. These pistachios are picked by hand every two years. Jugu pairs them with premium Irish dairy and the finest chocolate to produce some of the most sublime chocolates we've ever tasted. Expect the pistachio dragees to take over the nation any day now.</p><p>Ophelia Keane</p><p>Ophelia Keane's parents, Paul and Georgie, bought the Inish Beg estate near Baltimore in the 1990s and moved from London to develop it as a holiday and wedding destination which they have run successfully for the past three decades. Now their daughter Ophelia, a trained chef, has stepped up into a more active role and introduced Carpa Dining, which hosts both private and public events, including some interesting collaborations - including with Bahay, Note and Brian's Wines - and she has more up her sleeve for the year ahead. Much of the produce used by the kitchen is grown or foraged on the estate or in the local area.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Katy McGuinness</emphasis></p><p>Jennie Moran</p><p>Fans of Luncheonette cafe in its incarnation as NCAD's canteen or its later Hugh Lane Gallery residency will know Jennie Moran and her fabulous frocks. An artist with a fascination and flair for food, Moran's academic leanings were fostered in unique ways by a recent master's in gastronomy and food studies at TU Dublin. She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular. Oh and she's researching her next book on the art of the welcome.</p><p>Orla McAndrew</p><p>Pre-pandemic, Orla McAndrew was approaching 40 with no clear career prospects. A mother of three girls with a culinary arts degree that had knocked her confidence, she had never earned more than \u20ac11 per hour. A chance chat with someone struggling to book a wedding caterer led to McAndrew doing it - and kickstarting her business as a bespoke caterer, boosted through TV chef appearances on RT\u00c9's Today Show. As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks. This small but mighty hardback is packed with 100 family-friendly recipes, variations and tips to inspire anyone looking to eat well with minimal fuss or waste. </p><p>Sebastian Skillings</p><p>Another newcomer at The Irish Food Writing Awards 2024, winning the Food and Drink TikTok /Insta Award thanks to his gorgeous iPhone photography and often simple, always appealing seafood recipe ideas shared as The Hungry Fishmonger on Instagram. Having worked in operations for London restaurant groups, Sebastian Skillings only became a fishmonger in 2021 when he moved to Dublin with his Dubliner wife. With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge. Soon, he landed a deal with a UK publisher for a cookbook due next spring, which will showcase how versatile cooking seafood is, the different techniques and how every species of fish has different tastes and textures to offer. </p><p>John Kearns</p><p>Social entrepreneur John Kearns reckons he has an answer to the broken bricks-and-mortar restaurant model, where aspiring restaurateurs have to factor full rent and rates into their margins. Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus. </p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-of-house half of the couple who secured two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through bech-bailey.com. </p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane</p><p>Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under-19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel</p><p>The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fast-tracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria, he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill</p><p>Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under-23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham</p><p>A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan</p><p>Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan</p><p>Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cathal Dennehy</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "Corkman (Ireland)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 328, "title": "The ones to watch 2025 - Ireland's rising stars and new talents", "published": "2024-12-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">?Here are the names you need to look out for next year:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Music</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">?Ramper</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Ramper is the nom-de-plume of Donegal alt-folk troubadour Declan McClafferty. He cut his teeth in the four-piece band In Their Thousands, who made small ripples with their album <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Acrasia </emphasis>back in 2019. His latest single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">If You Want A Good Dream</emphasis>, was released in October. A charming, lo-fi song centred on acoustic guitar, it's a celebration of the little things, although there is a Marmite quality to his vocals. After the release of three singles this year, a debut solo album is expected in 2025.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Dabilla</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Named after the hound from Irish myths and legend, Dabilla is a duo based in Drogheda, Co Louth, who make music that's rooted in trad but embraces several contemporary genres such as electronica. Singer and guitarist Oisin Dillon and piper Darragh \u00d3 H\u00e9iligh are determined to try something different, and that's certainly the case on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">I Don't Want to Know</emphasis> - their cover of the late John Martyn's great song which was released in November. Much is centred on \u00d3'H\u00e9iligh's wonderfully expressive uilleann pipes.</p><p>Cliffords</p><p>The Cork five-piece hit the ground running with a fine, five-track debut EP this year, and their live shows have been widely praised. The vocal and focal point of the band is Iona Lynch, a singer of real distinction, and that's certainly the case on their best song to date, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sleeping with Ghosts</emphasis>. It will remind many of their Dublin contemporaries Soda Blonde - high praise indeed. They have recently signed with the London-based manager Tara Richardson, who has worked with the likes of Snow Patrol and Declan McKenna.</p><p>?Ahmed, With Love</p><p>Irish-Sierra Leonean rapper Ahmed Karim Tamu has been making waves in the Dublin hip-hop scene for a number of years, and many are tipping him to break into the mainstream. In October, he released a 10-track mixtape, Comma, Fullstop, which demonstrates his impressive flow and wry, observational narrative. Songs like <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Whatchimacallit</emphasis> deserve a wide audience. He's prolific too. Another song - <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wok To Blackrock</emphasis> - alongside emerging artists Curtisy and Lonely Chap, is one of the great Irish singles you didn't hear in 2024.</p><p>?Baba</p><p>Siobh\u00e1n Lynch has been on the Dublin music scene for a number of years but it feels as though her time is about to come. A recent single, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sad Party</emphasis>, showcases her soulful vocals, and its accompanying video demonstrates that much can be done creatively, even when budgets are tight. She also featured on the second edition of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">100% Her</emphasis> - an album celebrating female writers and producers and curated by Universal Music. A debut album is expected in the spring. </p><p>?Tayne</p><p>Heavily inspired by the abrasive industrial rock of bands like Nine Inch Nails, the Irish trio, now based in London, are set to release their debut album, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Love</emphasis>, at the end of January. Frontman Matthew Sutton says the music's influence doesn't just come from the harder end of the rock spectrum but from the likes of Lady Gaga and au courant pop stars such as Charli XCX. They're set to play several indie festivals in 2025, including England's 2,000 Trees alongside Irish compatriots Kneecap.</p><p>?Daire Heffernan</p><p>The 21-year-old Dubliner, now based in Belfast, began writing songs when her late father taught her to play the guitar when she was 11. Inspired by indie folk and dream pop, and influenced by artists including Adrianne Lenker, Sufjan Stevens and Cocteau Twins, she impressed many with her latest single, I Have the Fear. It's in the same ballpark as Phoebe Bridgers and suggests Heffernan has the potential to break into the mainstream. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">?John Meagher</emphasis></p><p>Film and TV</p><p>Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn?</p><p>An acclaimed husband-and-wife duo from Northern Ireland, directors Lisa Barros D'Sa and Glenn Leyburn have been on the go for years. Their Terri Hooley biopic, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Good Vibrations</emphasis>, was a hoot. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Ordinary Love</emphasis>, a gripping romantic drama with Lesley Manville and Liam Neeson, tugged at our heartstrings. Hardly newcomers, then, but the point is this: Barros D'Sa and Leyburn's next project, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Saipan</emphasis>, will be huge. A big-screen dramatisation of the great Roy Keane/Mick McCarthy debacle of 2002, the film stars \u00c9anna Hardwicke as the frustrated Cork man and Steve Coogan as his disappointed manager. Brace yourself for controversy.</p><p>?Cara Loftus</p><p>Screenwriter Cara Loftus knows her way around a film set and was part of the production crew on <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Last Duel</emphasis>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Disenchanted</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Star Wars: The Last Jedi</emphasis>. An impressive list, but Loftus is now ready to tell her own stories. Her feature debut <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Spilt Milk</emphasis>, set for release in 2025, tells of an 11-year-old boy who wishes he was a hotshot detective, like his screen idol Kojak. First, he'll need to navigate a tricky social environment in 1980s Dublin. A promising set-up, and Loftus has two further features in development - and a TV series to boot. Exciting times.</p><p>Ollie West</p><p>It is, perhaps, too early to be looking for the next Paul Mescal. But Ollie West, a talented Dubliner with a tidy CV and a beguiling presence, reminds us somewhat of the Oscar-nominated Maynooth man. Released in July, Michael Kinirons's icy homegrown drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Sparrow</emphasis> gave the youngster his first film role as a heartbroken son, struggling with a family secret. Later, West played an anxious secondary school student opposite Rebecca Hall in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Listeners</emphasis>, a gripping four-part television drama, produced by Element Pictures. A hell of a start, and the future is looking bright for this gifted performer.</p><p>?Ella Lily Hyland</p><p>Is Ella Lily Hyland on the brink of superstardom? It certainly looks that way. Carlow's finest first came to our attention as a former tennis prodigy in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Fifteen-Love</emphasis>, opposite Aidan Turner. This year, she played a conflicted freelance assassin in the Netflix spy thriller <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Black Doves</emphasis>, alongside Keira Knightley and Ben Whishaw. Extraordinary company, and it gets better. You'll find her next in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Towards Zero</emphasis> - a major BBC adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel, with Anjelica Huston - and in Steven Knight's Victorian-era boxing drama <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Thousand Blows</emphasis> on Disney+. </p><p>?Thaddea Graham</p><p>The second season of <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Bad Sisters</emphasis> may have taken some peculiar turns, but the performances were excellent, and Northern Irish actor Thaddea Graham was especially good as rookie Detective Inspector Una Houlihan. Graham, it seems, is on quite the roll.

Make way for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Knight of the Seven Kingdoms</emphasis>, a hugely anticipated prequel to <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Game of Thrones</emphasis>, starring Claffey as Ser Duncan the Tall, a mysterious 'hedge knight' hoping to make a name for himself in merry-old Westeros.

All that achieved and Cirq's first birthday isn't until February.

By fostering solidarity and intersectionality, An Dream Dearg unites people to demand change.

It's been all go ever since for the designer, who took part in another pop-up in Selfridges, London, in November. \"I feel like I've been chasing my tail all year trying to keep up with orders, which I'm so grateful for,\" she says.

Now, after a six-month stint at Karl Lagerfeld, she's interning with G-Star Raw in Amsterdam. \"Eventually, I would love to have my own brand that features plus-sized, curvy bodies,\" she says. \"Body diversity is something I'm really passionate about and I want to gather as much knowledge as I can from working with different companies.\"</p><p>Emma Rose Higgins</p><p>With her Rapunzel-like red hair and striking blue eyes, Emma Rose Higgins lights up the new Jean Paul Gaultier Christmas campaign.

O'Donnell's debut short story collection, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Wild Quiet</emphasis>, was published in 2016, and she's won a number of awards for her work. You may have already spotted her writing in the journals <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Stinging Fly</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Tangerine</emphasis>, but 2025 looks like the year O'Donnell will reach a broader, eager audience in Ireland. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nesting</emphasis> will hit bookshops in late January 2025.</p><p>Kel Menton</p><p>Kel Menton's debut young adult fiction will be published with Little Island Books next year, with buzz building about this new voice. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">A Fix of Light</emphasis> is aimed at teens aged from 15-18 and blends queer romance and fantasy, and will be published on February 6. Menton is a non-binary writer and youth theatre facilitator from Cork who graduated from UCC, and started writing their book at age 16. With many young readers hungry for more queer voices in publishing (just look at the success of series <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Heartstopper</emphasis>), this could be Menton's time to make their mark on the Irish publishing world. </p><p>?Anna Mullarkey</p><p>Musician Anna Mullarkey received excellent reviews for her collaboration with Enda Walsh on the play <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis>, which was on the Abbey Theatre stage this summer.

In <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> - described by Walsh and Mullarkey as a 'song cycle' - a young woman named Grace lives alone in the countryside, and music plays a key role in telling her story. The multi-talented Mullarkey, who's from Galway, composed the music for <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> and has been carving out a solid career as a musician. After <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Safe House</emphasis> completes its run, we can undoubtedly expect more exciting things from Mullarkey this coming year and beyond.</p><p>?Allie O'Rourke</p><p>Thanks to her dry, cutting and often knowingly off-colour humour, Allie O'Rourke has been making a name for herself on Ireland's comedy scene in recent years. She's not content to work in just one genre, however, as shown by her recent support slot for Alok Vaid-Menon at Liberty Hall, the Dublin Fringe show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Good Room</emphasis> and the film <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Scouting for Boys</emphasis>, which she and Matthew Tallon are developing with Screen Ireland. As a trans comedian, she's part of a small but growing community in Ireland's comedy scene - and one who's refreshingly unafraid to say what she thinks. She'll play her biggest solo gig yet when she brings her show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Girl D**k Energy</emphasis> to Smock Alley on January 4.</p><p>?Jessie Thompson</p><p>This was a big year for dancer Jessie Thompson, who got five-star reviews for her \"dazzling and compelling\" show <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Crawler</emphasis> at the Edinburgh Fringe. Working across contemporary dance and hip-hop and many of the spaces in between these genres, Thompson's vibrant and fluid style marks her out as someone who will put her stamp on Ireland's dance scene long-term. The Swords native takes part in dance battles, choreographs her own work, and also works with live music. She took part in several events in the 2024 Dublin Dance Festival, and is certainly one of the young Irish dancers poised to do even bigger things this coming year.</p><p>Osaro Azams</p><p>Why be one kind of artist when you can truly embody the meaning of multi-disciplinary?

But 2025 will see her absorbing debut novel <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis> being published by Sceptre, and with it any chance of the rest of the world not knowing how talented she is. With a voice that is crystal clear and a viewpoint that takes in the world's cruelties and joys, Erskine's talent shines in <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">The Benefactors</emphasis>, which is published in June. That gives everyone enough time to read her short story collections, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Sweet Home</emphasis> and <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dance Move</emphasis>, first.

It sounds like a delicious combination of River Cottage and The Tyrone Guthrie Centre, something you'd be more likely to find in upstate New York or northern California than in Ireland's sunny south east.

She won the Emerging Voice Award at the Irish Food Writing Awards 2024 for her intriguing book How to Soften Corners, a meditation on hospitality produced with students of her Creative Hospitality module at NCAD - since developed into a postgraduate professional certificate that examines the philosophy, laws and customs of hospitality as a tool set for various creative projects. In 2025, Moran will bring to New York her playful physical theatre show, The Story of Hospitality, developed with dancer Aoibhinn O'Dea; conceive an elements-themed banquet for the Oxford Food Symposium; travel to LA's Getty Museum to research their culinary manuscript library; and hopefully return to curate food events addressing climate crisis at the Earth Rising festival at IMMA, one of several cultural institutions that Moran collaborates with on the regular.

As Ireland's first zero-waste weddings and events caterer, McAndrew combines skillful creativity with savvy resourcefulness, and uses Instagram to share smart tips on avoiding food waste. Named Network Cork's Solo Business Woman of the Year 2024, McAndrew's first cookbook, Larder, is published this coming January, as number 13 in the cult-status series of Blasta cookbooks.

With hospitality on hold, he took a job at George's Fish Shop in Monkstown, where he was struck by how many questions people had about cooking fish. He conceived his Instagram page as a database to inspire customers, plus an opportunity to improve his own cooking skill set and knowledge.

Due to open in March as Tallaght's 'Left Bank' as an all-day-into-evening gathering space, Priory Market will be a new indoor market with 14 different food operators, wine and cocktail bars, and various event spaces, including its own 100-seater theatre - plus its own coffee roastery and onsite brewery featuring Ireland's first tank bar. All profits will be re-invested into local enterprise development and jobs, including existing projects like The Edge incubation hub. Kearns is CEO of Partas, a social enterprise established in 1984. He hopes the market will become Tallaght's thriving, inclusive heart for community, culture, craic and cuisine. He argues that this model is more affordable for the food operators than setting up individual restaurants. From Kearns's perspective, curation is key, with quality-focused traders on board, including fully trained sushi chef Ken Komatsu of Matsu Ramen, as well as AfroCaribbean, Mexican, Indian, Italian, Middle Eastern and Irish fare on the market's various menus. </p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey</p><p>Majken Bech-Bailey is hardly a new face in Irish gastronomy, being the front-of-house half of the couple who secured two Michelin stars at the short-lived but extraordinary Aimsir restaurant in Kildare's Cliff at Lyons. However, the brand that she is launching in 2025 and the unique proposition that it offers is something altogether new for Ireland and on the cutting edge of global alcohol-free beverage development. This spring, her new B\u00c6K brand - designed as complex, non-alcoholic alternatives to wine with similar structural qualities and food-pairing possibilities - will start appearing on fine-dining restaurant drinks list. Unlike non-alcoholic wines, which are perhaps the least successful category of de-alcoholised beverages, these all-natural affairs are based on fruit, vegetable and nut juices infused with fresh herbs, foraged plants, and teas - and are utterly delicious. Meanwhile, Bech-Bailey will continue sharing her considerable knowledge through a series of masterclasses in non-alcoholic beverages and food pairing, bookable through bech-bailey.com. </p><p>Sport</p><p>Katie Keane</p><p>Not many Leaving Cert students spend part of their final year at school away on international duty with the national soccer squad, but Katie Keane is not your average 18-year-old. The goalkeeper kept 10 clean sheets as she helped Athlone Town to victory in this year's SSE Airtricity Women's Premier Division, which earned her a call-up to the Republic of Ireland senior squad. The Ratoath native turned in one of her most notable performances of the year when keeping a clean sheet during a draw against Spain at the Under-19 European Championships in Lithuania. A bright future beckons.</p><p>Caspar Gabriel</p><p>The Leinster Rugby Academy has long been a production line of top-level stars, and this 19-year-old, who was recently fast-tracked into their ranks, could well be the next big thing. A native of Vienna, Austria, he moved to Dublin several years ago to study at Terenure College and pursue his dream of professional rugby. He's since made a huge impression for Terenure and the Leinster Under-19s and was described by Terenure College's senior coach Sean Skehan as the most talented schoolboy he's ever seen. Gabriel is expected to satisfy eligibility requirements for the Ireland Under-20 team, and the way rugby aficionados speak of his ability, it looks a matter of time before he arrives at the top tier.</p><p>Nicola Tuthill</p><p>Ireland has a rich legacy in the hammer throw and this 20-year-old from Bandon in Co Cork looks set to reignite that in the years ahead. Tuthill made her Olympic dream a reality in 2024, smashing the Irish Under-23 hammer throw record to qualify for Paris, and while that was all about gaining experience, she looks capable of developing into a real contender for the 2028 Olympics in Los Angeles. In 2025, she will target the European Under-23 Championships - where a medal looks a realistic prospect - and the World Championships in Tokyo.</p><p>Ben Cunningham</p><p>A rising star in a county that should contend for All-Ireland titles for many years to come, this gifted half-forward is a player we'll hear lots more about. He was a key part of St Finbarr's run to the county title in 2022 and was brilliant when helping Cork to last year's Under-20 All-Ireland title. The son of former Cork hurling legend Ger Cunningham, injury scuppered his progress in 2024, but he could well become a starter for the Rebels in 2025. Physically imposing, pacy and an excellent free taker, he would prove a useful addition to their powerful attacking unit as they bid to reach the promised land.</p><p>Michael Noonan</p><p>Having made his senior league debut for St Pat's in recent months and been capped for Ireland at Under-15, Under-16 and Under-17 level, the future looks limitless for this 16-year-old prodigy. The striker recently scored a hat-trick for St Pat's in their Leinster Senior Cup win over Bohemians and his talent has long been on the radar of Man City, with Noonan reportedly travelling across the water in October to sign a pre-contract agreement with the Premier League champions. Brexit rules mean he can't sign for UK clubs until he turns 18 but, given his trajectory, we'll likely hear lots more about Noonan in 2025 and beyond.</p><p>Adam Olaniyan</p><p>Ireland might have a rich, storied legacy in producing champion boxers, but very little of that success occurred in the super heavyweight division. However, this 18-year-old Dubliner recently won gold in the 92kg+ category at the Youth World Championships in Montenegro, winning his four bouts by unanimous decision. The Tallaght native, who represents Jobstown Boxing Club, previously won gold at the European Youth Championships and European Schoolboys Championships. At 6ft 6in, he's just as towering as he is talented, with boxing gurus believing he has all the tools needed to reach the highest level.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Cathal Dennehy</emphasis></p>", "publisher": "Wicklow People (Ireland)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 25, "title": "Nature restoration law 'rescuable but not looking good' after U-turns", "published": "2024-03-29", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Efforts are continuing behind the scenes to salvage the nature restoration law after last-minute backtracking by several European Union countries.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Environment Minister Eamon Ryan said the law was \"rescuable\" although he remained very worried about it.</p><p>The landmark law to stop and reverse the loss of nature and habitats on land and sea was passed by the European Parliament and was due to be rubberstamped by EU environment ministers last Monday.

His local village of Finchingfield - a picture-postcard hamlet based around a stone-cross war memorial on a green, next to a duck pond, overlooked by an old windmill and a 13th Century stone church - was constantly prone to serious flooding.</p><p>It has been, for as long as anybody who has been born or bred there can remember.</p><p>Indeed, the floods have been so high in the past that some residents have even been spotted surfing through the village.</p><p>When it floods, a number of homes in the village will flood, costing thousands in damages.</p><p>Granted, because of the size of the village, the flooding is on a very different scale to what has happened in places such as Midleton in East Cork, where during last year's Storm Babet more than 400 homes were damaged.</p><p>However, in October 2001, the area saw its worst flooding for decades, during what was described at the time as the first floods of Britain's \"new wet season\".</p><p>Finchingfield was one of a number of villages in Cambridgeshire and Essex to be cut off, as around 75mm of rain fell in one day alone, leaving thousands of hectares of land under water.</p><p>\"The village tended to flood a couple of times a year, with water covering the road alongside the pond and caus ing localised disruption,\" said Archie. \"Every decade or so, a more significant flood event would impact homes and businesses.</p><p>\"The most serious flood event in living memory was in October 2001, which affected around 30 properties.\"</p><p>Hundreds of homes across Cambridgeshire and Essex were flooded and around 100 people had to be rescued from their homes.</p><p>Of the 20 severe river flood warnings around Britain at the time, one related to the River Pant, which flows in a south-easterly direction and is fed by the river that runs through the village.</p><p>The areas affected by flooding already had high levels of ground water from a series of floods that hit the affected areas the year before.</p><p>The area's underground aquifers - naturally-occurring bodies of rock and/or sediment that hold underground water filtered down from the surface soil above ground - were full.</p><p>They had not emptied as they would be expected to and, as a result, rivers and streams in the area were already high by the time the rain storms arrived in 2001.</p><p>That year, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change had also reported that the intensity of rainfall in areas around the world was getting worse.</p><p>In its report on the science of climate change, it warned: \"Global warming is likely to lead to greater extremes of drying and heavy rainfall and increase the risk of droughts and floods.\"</p><p>The impact of this change may have already started to be felt in Finchingfield but, due to a variety of reasons, there was little anybody could do about it.</p><p>Because it only - officially - has 18 properties listed as flooding risks, the village has always been low down on the list of priorities for authorities more focused on shoring up flood defences in more populated areas.</p><p>Added to this, the historic village is in a conservation area, which makes it harder for homeowners to make any structural changes to mitigate against flooding.</p><p>So, in 2018, after seeing what was happening with beavers in Devon, Archie decided to introduce them onto his estate.</p><p>His first pair was released into the first fenced-off enclosure on his estate in March 2019.</p><p>The initial pilot project was a partnership between his family's estate and Brit-ain's Environment Agency, with support from the Essex and Suffolk Rivers Trust, Essex Wildlife Trust, and a beaver expert called Derek Gow.</p><p>It was part-funded by a variety of organisations, including the Anglian Eastern Regional Flood and Coastal Committee (RFCC) and Coca Cola, via the Rivers Trust and the World Wildlife Trust.</p><p>Initially, it cost \u00a345,000 to erect beaver fencing, eight timber 'leaky' dams - usually made of logs strapped together - and some field-edge rainwater capture ponds. The two Eurasian beavers were introduced into the 10-acre enclosure, which consists almost entirely of woodland, in 2019 and they have since bred. There is now a family of 11 beavers there.</p><p>Two more enclosures, which cover a much larger area of some 100 acres, were constructed and a pair of beavers introduced into each of them in early 2023.</p><p>The work, carried out mostly in 2022, cost \u00a3380,000, a bill met by a variety of organisations including the East Anglian RFCC, various water utility companies, the county council, and the Environment Agency.</p><p>The estate now has about a dozen beavers in three different enclosures, with the last two running along the valley of the Finchingfield Brook, which flows into the nearby village.</p><p>In total, there is about 2km of meandering river within the enclosures, surrounded by woodland, farmland, and grassland.</p><p>How it works on the Spains Hall Estate farm and just about everywhere else is pretty simple.</p><p>As soon as the beavers arrive in their vast enclosures, which are usually centred around existing streams or small rivers, they start diverting the flow of the water to slow it down.</p><p>They do this by building their famous so-called 'leaky dams' with mud, tree logs, branches, twigs, and rocks.</p><p>They gather up the materials from a 10m-20m radius around the area they want to live in and drag or carry it with their hand-like front feet to where they want to build their dam.</p><p>The beavers gnaw away at the trees, which usually have a diameter of between 5cm and 15cm, although they are known to fell trees with a diameter of 80cm.</p><p>Archie said they are so good at felling trees that \"you rarely see flattened beavers\".</p><p>\"Basically, they chew away at the tree and as they get to the centre of it, they stop and listen to it,\" he said.</p><p>\"They are listening for any signs that the tree may be about to fall.</p><p>\"The closer they get to felling it, the more times they stop what they are doing to listen out for any creaking sounds.\"</p><p>The tree logs, branches, and other materials are put together by the beavers in such a way that they are compacted tightly enough to reduce the flow of water sufficiently to build up a reservoir or pond, usually to a depth of around one metre.</p><p>However, they do leak, and if the water falls below a certain level, the beavers repair them.</p><p>They are constructed across existing water courses and in such a way that when the beavers have enough water in their pond, the rest of the water they don't need carries on its downward course.</p><p>Pools of very slow-moving water are then created over time.</p><p>This has the knock-on effect of reducing the speed of water flowing downstream and helps reduce or eliminate extreme or flash downstream peak flows.</p><p>As well as regulating the flow of water, the dams also act as a natural water-filtration system.</p><p>This is because sediment and other debris in the water gets trapped in the so-called leaky dams.</p><p>As they need depth of water to feel safe, if they don't live in a den built into a river bank, they will build what are known as lodges, which are large, dome-shaped structures made up of tree branches and twigs, rocks, and mud.</p><p>They start building these by erecting a sturdy base out of branches and logs, which they drive into the bed of the stream or river they are going to live in.</p><p>Then they start building on the base until the structure is anything from 2m to 12m high, depending on the size of the beaver colony involved, and up to around 10m wide. Once built, and with the lodge's underwater entrance in place, it forms a safe place away from predators for beavers to sleep, keep warm in winter, and raise their families.</p><p>The big question is: Has Archie's beaver scheme worked?</p><p>The honest answer is either \"probably\", as Archie states on his estate's website, or it is \"impossible\" to say at this stage.</p><p>Asked how he can quantify how different things are on the estate in a flooding context to how they were five years ago, he replied: \"It's impossible to say categorically whether the scheme is preventing flooding.</p><p>\"But the Environment Agency, which has been monitoring the estate since before the project began, reports significant impacts.</p><p>\"Locals who were in the village at the time of the 2001 flood told me that in January 2021, when we experienced a significant storm, they felt the village would have flooded more seriously without the upstream project.</p><p>\"We are still working with our research partners to assess the full impact of the beavers, but we are confident enough in the early findings to commit to building much larger enclosures where more beavers can create more wetland.</p><p>\"Essentially we now have water all year round, whereas previously the estate was dry in summer.</p><p>\"This has encouraged wildlife to return, including water shrews.\"</p><p>One key witness to the suc cess of the project has to be Alex Robinson.</p><p>She is the sub-postmistress of Finchingfield Post Office, and she swears by the beaver project.</p><p>She said that once every one or two years, flooding would be so bad that the centre of the village would be blocked off for up to two or three days.</p><p>\"I think it is a fabulous project,\" said Ms Robinson.</p><p>\"It does really seem to have solved the flooding problems.</p><p>\"I can't remember, since the beavers have been in there doing their stuff and flooding their areas, the village flooding in the centre as it used to do.\"</p><p>She and Jane Welsh, who manages the post office shop, have been living in the village for 14 years, and they remember big floods that went up into the Fox on the Green pub.</p><p>\"Every other year, the water would block the centre of the village,\" Jane said.</p><p>Alex added: \"There were even a few years when we couldn't get insurance against flooding.</p><p>\"That has changed recently because the underwriters have reviewed things.</p><p>\"Since the project started, we have had no major flooding although there have been much more storms.\"</p><p>Another important question is whether beavers would be welcome in Ireland, where they would have to be introduced.</p><p>Various bodies are in little doubt what the answer is.</p><p>In a December 2020 article entitled 'The Case for Beavers in Ireland', which was published by the Irish Wildlife Trust, P\u00e1draic Fogarty said: \"Yes.\"</p><p>The ecologist wrote: \"We should be bringing beavers into Ireland on account of the clear advantages they can bring to restoring our shattered ecology.</p><p>\"Let them be our allies in the fight to clean our waterways, reduce flooding, and lock up greenhouse gasses.</p><p>\"In my view, they would be of benefit, helping to restore naturalness to our collapsed river systems while -

Humanity will not limit global heating to safe levels or stem the ongoing loss of wildlife without them. From the boreal forest that stretches around northern Europe, Siberia, and Canada, to the Amazon, Earth's forests are some of the most biodiverse places on the planet, home to species found nowhere else.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yet all too often, forests are worth more money dead than alive - despite promises from global leaders to halt deforestation. Their exploitation has pushed many plants, animals and fungi to the brink of extinction, while slowly degrading their ability to generate rainfall, sequester carbon and cool the planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the race to create incentives to preserve forests rather than cut them down, the carbon-offsetting market has taken centre stage. Forest-offsetting schemes often sell credits on the basis that they will fund conservation schemes, protecting sections of forest that would otherwise be cut down - thereby preventing carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere.</p><p>Scientific research and journalistic investigations, however, indicate that many of these schemes are essentially \"hot air\" and failing to protect forests as promised. As some major firms reassess their use of forest credits, it raises questions about how we pay for and in-centivise the protection of these crucial ecosystems.</p><p>Here are five ways that experts have suggested we could tip the balance in favour of keeping forest ecosystems alive.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">1: Pay countries to look after forests</emphasis></h><p>At Cop28 in Dubai, the Brazilian government put forward proposals for a multibillion-dollar global fund that would reward countries for conserving forests and penalise them for deforestation. Tasso Azevedo, a forest expert and adviser to president Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva, said countries could be paid $ 30 a year for every hectare of forest they kept intact, while being penalised for every hectare lost.</p><p>\"Imagine you have a country that has 1,000 hectares of forest. If you maintain the forest, you will get $ 30,000, but if you clear cut 10 hectares, you get nothing,\" he told a side event at the summit.</p><p>In order to qualify for the Tropical Forests Forever fund, countries would have to meet three conditions: Keep deforestation below 0.5% a year; have forest loss trending downwards or keep it below 0.1%; and give the majority of funds to the people looking after the trees. The fund could be could be financed by putting a charge on fossil fuel sales, Azevedo said.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2: Ban goods that harm forests</emphasis></h><p>Coffee, beef, rubber, soy and palm oil have driven the destruction of huge areas of forest - releasing vast carbon emissions along the way - and are often consumed in countries thousands of miles away from the Amazon or the Congo basin where they are produced.</p><p>To make sure European consumers are not driving further demand for forest loss, the EU has introduced strict regulations on high-risk products. From 2024, firms working in deforestation hotspots must certify that their goods have not harmed forests after a cutoff date of December 31, 2020. If countries like China and the US also introduced restrictions on deforestation-linked commodities, economic demand would probably fall sharply, lessening the incentive to further clear forests.

Driven by AI, it utilises a combination of satellite multispectral imaging and ground-based sensors to accurately quantify carbon sequestration and biodiversity above and below ground.</p><p>This enables corporate organisations and SMEs to work with landowners to produce biodiversity credits. The lands, under long-term stewardship agreements, are dedicated solely to enhancing biodiversity and capturing carbon, using entirely natural processes and adhering strictly to a policy of causing no harm.</p><p>The first year of this deal with Coffeeangel, which supplies coffee and brewing equipment, entails removal and storage of a minimum of 80,000 kgs of carbon from the atmosphere at Dunsany nature reserve, while also protecting and enhancing its ecosystem.</p><p>The estate dates from the 11th century and covers an area of 650 hectares. Some 300 hectares have been dedicated to rewilding, forming the core of its nature reserve.</p><p> When I embarked on my journey of rewilding the land, the objective was simple: bring back nature,  explains Lord Dunsany, the film director and writer Randal Plunkett.  The goal was quickly achieved with species returning and increased biodiversity. Then came the second goal, making rewilding a mainstream concept. </p><p>Although the public was listening, other rewilding initiatives were slow to get started, he adds. </p><p> Landowners were fearful to buy into the concept as there was no way to make it financially viable.

This has long been the Zoological Society of London's approach to conservation. And it works. It was this approach that saw communities set up their own sanctuaries for pangolins on Palawan island in the Philippines, and it is this approach that is helping to identify conservation ideas for the protection of the critically endangered angel shark off Ireland and Britain's coastline.

Many of our rivers have been denuded of any kind of vegetation, as well as being straightened and deepened under government-funded drainage schemes.</p><p> I would not have beavers on my list. There is so much more we can be doing,  she says. Bourke is working with  leaky dams  at sites in Cork and Wexford, where logs are used as barriers to hold back high-water levels. Unlike beaver dams, they do not reach down to the river bed and so do not flood farmland. </p><p>She believes that creating a series of these leaky dams, starting in the uplands, can be done at scale and with community support, that would be effective in reducing the impact of downstream flooding and would effectively mimic the work of beavers.</p><p>Harty agrees that there s a lack of trees and woody material in and around our rivers, but nevertheless believes there are likely to be some areas that would be suitable for beaver introduction. He thinks step one is to pay farmers a premium for native woodland establishment on either side of rivers. Both the new Forest Strategy and the Department of Agriculture s agri-environment scheme, ACRES, provide dedicated measures for this purpose. He thinks that the habitat creation and establishment of beavers would be a five- to 10-year process.</p><p>Would beavers prove to be invasive, in the way that rhododendron or grey squirrels have proven to be? The science suggests this is unlikely, given that, unlike most species which are listed as alien invasive in Ireland, beavers have evolved for millenniums in western Europe and alongside the many other species with which they interact. We also seem to be quite relaxed about introducing large numbers of non-native species, such as pheasants or free-roaming sheep, with few or no safeguards for the wider environment. And while it may be possible for people to mimic the work of beavers, given the scale of work that is required across Ireland, wouldn t beavers do a better job and at a lower cost?</p><h> A story of renewal and abundance  </h><p>At the University of Exeter last April, beaver ecologists and policymakers convened to celebrate the impressive success of beaver reintroductions in England and Scotland. In Wales, beavers are being kept under close watch in fenced enclosures at a number of locations, while some breeding in the wild is suspected. There have been some conflicts with local landowners, but these are being dealt with. Overall, reintroducing beavers is high return with low impact and low cost. One attendee noted that  beavers are such a different nature story than the one we normally associate with loss and destruction. It is one of renewal and abundance .</p><p>After years of trying to engineer our rivers into submission, there was welcome talk this autumn of changing how we use our land as part of wider efforts to deal with flooding. After Midleton in Co Cork was badly affected, Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said:  We have to consider the impact inappropriate land use can have on flooding and drainage. </p><p>Along with flooding, over half of our rivers are failing to reach  good status , due largely to pollution from agriculture and human waste, as well as poor  hydromorphology , a word that describes how the shape of rivers has been altered through arterial drainage and the imposition of dams and other barriers to the movement of fish.</p><p>Meanwhile, biodiversity is plummeting, with some of our most endangered species and habitats associated with river systems, such as the freshwater pearl mussel, Atlantic salmon, and native alluvial (swamp) forests.</p><p>The task is immense: as well as facing the prospect of runaway climate change, we have legally binding commitments to protect biodiversity and restore all of our water bodies to  good status  by 2027.

Belfast City Council are already thinking seriously about how we can do this. As part of the One Million Trees project, Belfast City Council aims to plant one million trees by 2035. This commitment demonstrates how we need to go beyond simply 'protecting' nature, we need to restore it. To successfully tackle the converging climate and nature crises, we need to extract less and plant more. Belfast City Council's One Million Trees project also shows how, as well as reversing wildlife loss, nature-based solutions hold aesthetic value. They bring life and colour into our city, regenerating our urban landscapes. Of course, we need to go beyond just planting trees and protecting forests. We need to ensure that multiple types of habitat are protected, such as grasslands, wetlands and peatlands. We need to consider how to restore biodiversity in our oceans as well as on land. We need to protect important habitats, like sea grass, kelp forests, salt marshes and oyster beds: all of which store blue carbon.", "We need to address this. We often see public attention directed towards geo-engineering solutions and high-performing technologies. While these technologies can help with carbon capture and CO2 extraction, we need to be directing our attention towards nature. Technological solutions can be highly innovative and enabling, but words like 'green hydrogen', 'smart grids' and 'heat pumps' mean very little to ordinary people. Even industry-changing technology cannot bring people together in the way that nature does. Unlike technology, nature-based solutions and projects - involving local communities from their conception to installation engage our hearts and minds. When we take nature into account, we become better custodians of the planet. We also become better custodians of one another.
