Brendan himself is Ireland's first biological agroforest farmer.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This is the second time he's done this trek, having cycled 1,200km from Malin to Mizen Head last year for the same cause. His team of five cyclists visited 10 different farms along the way, to showcase the growth of regenerative farming around the country.</p><p>\"We highlighted each farm that we went to, showing the work that they were doing,\" says Brendan. The aim was to bring farmers together and show the viability of regenerative farming.</p><p>Over seven days, Brendan organised 10 different events - where each farmer cooked their own produce - and sold tickets to the general public.</p><p>\"They were like little mini weddings. Good craic, great fun and lots of networking,\" he says. \"It showed that you can produce food without degrading the soil and harming the environment. It really highlighted that farming can be a solution to a lot of problems.\"</p><p>The endeavour was so popular that the group are doing it again this year.</p><p>From September 8, they plan to cycle the east coast from the Giant's Causeway to Waterford, highlighting similar farms.</p><p>Brendan is a graduate of the MSc in AgInnovation (Agricultural Innovation &amp; Entrepreneurship) at the University of Galway, which he completed in 2023. He credits the course with opening his mind to new ways of solving problems and says it gave him the tools to undertake such endeavours as this long-distance cycle. It also inspired him to work with others.</p><p>\"It taught me you can't do everything on your own. You need a team around you.\"</p><p>The course was designed by Professor John Breslin, author of Old Ireland in Colour and founder of Galway startup accelerator PorterShed. John has a passion for entrepreneurship and innovation, and saw a gap in rural Ireland.</p><p>\"He saw that Ireland needed to be helped. And basically it starts with the farmer in the field,\" says Martina O'Grady. A farmer's daughter from Roscommon, Martina did the course herself four years ago and now teaches on the programme.</p><p>The master's aims to foster entrepreneurship in rural Ireland and addresses the challenges faced by farmers in the modern era.</p><p>\"If you keep doing what you've always done, you're always going to get the same result. You have to be the change yourself. We can give them the confidence to pivot on their farms. Essentially, we need to give farmers courage,\" says Martina.</p><p>\"Encouraging them to look at agriculture in a difa ferentw y, and changing the way we do it so that it can survive - that's really what the programme is about.\"</p><p>Martina is keen to stress that \"you don't necessarily need any great qualifications coming into the course. It's the passion we're after - if you can show us that there's something that you want to do for rural Ireland to help farmers through innovation, we really want you to succeed.\"</p><p>The Level 9 master's has been running for seven years, with 30-35 participants each year. The course is designed to fit into busy schedules with one two-hour Zoom class per week in the evening and 10 in-person Saturdays at the university over one year.</p><p>Prospective students wary about going back to college can take heart from the course diversity, with ages ranging from 22 to 70 years old. As well as farmers, previous course participants have varied backgrounds including a veterinary nurse, a solicitor, a wine shop owner, and tech experts looking to reshape agriculture through technology. A broad range of business ideas that have sprung forth from the course include wool promotion, beekeeping, willow coffin-making and a nature-walk company.</p><p>At the end of the course, Martina says that \"people felt they had come on this journey with each other, even though they had only met 10 times\".</p><p>For Brendan, the course has given him the structure and confidence to diversify his farming business. He now cooks at Electric Picnic, has spoken at the Web Summit and gives tours at his farm.</p><p>The course offers 90pc funding by Springboard for those in employment, and is 100pc funded for job seekers. The course is still open for applications and the closing date has been extended until August 13. Martina urges people to apply, regardless of circumstances.</p><p>\"We have farmers saying, 'I'm going to have calving or lambing season in the middle of March; I won't be able to make that Saturday.'

I knew then that he was a man who was used to hard work.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With his cousin Dylan van Leeuwen, Brummelman built a medieval roundhouse in a beautiful woodland setting in Co Galway during the Covid pandemic. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Surrounded by oak trees and bluebells and next to a bubbling stream, it looks exactly like the sort of place an ancient Irish family might have chosen to settle in. </p><p>Brummelman was born in the Netherlands but has lived in Ireland for many years, having followed his aunt and his cousins here.  I was three years old when my parents moved to a house within a woodland in Friesland in the north of the Netherlands,  he says. </p><p> As a child, I was out in the woods every day. This gave me a strong connection with nature, and later combined with the environmental interests that my parents gave me.  </p><p>Brummelman has been interested in bushcraft since he was a child. He has taken on a range of challenges, living in the woodlands with only basic tools such as a knife and an axe. </p><p>I watch him lighting a campfire with just a flint to ignite the kindling that he has collected in the woods. He has also become a self-taught film-maker and his YouTube channel, Smooth Gefixt, has an international audience. </p><p> Over the years I have tried to teach myself a variety of woodworking skills,  he says. </p><p> Wood is such a beautiful and easy material to work with. Trees are so useful for everything from making fires to building houses. I am not against cutting trees at all but we should try to do it in a sustainable, balanced way.  </p><p>In his practical approach to life, Brummelman says he is  always happy  to use firewood to heat his house. If demand was higher for timber, he believes that could be a driver for creating more forest cover. </p><p>With his family, Brummelman has recently bought an area of woodland near Lough Rainey, Co Clare. This is a conventional conifer plantation, but it is beside an ancient woodland with mostly native tree species.</p><p> I saw this as an ideal place to start a conversion from a monoculture plantation to a more mixed woodland,  he says. </p><p>He will do this conversion in gradual stages, first thinning out the spruce trees and planting native trees in their place. </p><p> The existing conifers will provide cover for the native trees to mature and eventually replace them. With this type of continuous cover forestry, both economic and biodiversity values of the forest grow hand in hand. </p><p> Brummelman s late father was a vet and he grew up visiting many farms with him. </p><p> In Ireland I have been talking to many farmers about woodland,  he says.  I want to encourage farmers to incorporate trees into their farming enterprises. </p><p> Because we don t really have a forest culture any more, most farmers don t think of trees as a useful part of their farming. However, with continuous-cover forestry, the focus can be on individual trees. </p><p> Farmers could go into a forest, manage it carefully and add value to individual trees. In that way they would connect more to their woodland. It feels very satisfying to walk through your own forest which is maturing around you.  </p><p>At the Slieve Aughty Centre, he has been planting an agroforestry plot with a variety of native and non-native trees such as sweet chestnut. </p><p>He has a few favourite tree species. He planted a lime tree in memory of his father, who clearly had a big influence on his son s life. </p><p> I like eating lime leaves as a salad,  he says.  For forest development in Ireland, I think oak is the most interesting as it can grow rapidly in good soils with very specific management. </p><p>Although he is passionate about trees, he is also a practical person who knows the benefits that trees and woodland offer. </p><p>He is very familiar with a variety of European woodlands as he studied Forest and Nature Conservation at Wageningen University in the Netherlands. </p><p>Now Brummelman has qualified as a registered forester and is training in the methods of continuous-cover forestry.

It avoids synthetic inputs, supports biodiversity, and often improves soil health. But it also comes with a major challenge: lower yields. On average, organic farms produce less food per hectare than conventional ones - on average 10-25% lower yields, although this varies by farming type and region. Meaning we'd need much more land to grow the same amount of food organically.</p><p>Globally, this raises an uncomfortable truth, if we go fully organic, we may have to convert more land to agriculture. Land that might otherwise be forests, peatlands, natural grasslands, for example. That extra land demand could accelerate biodiversity loss, increase greenhouse gas emissions, and threaten the very ecosystems organic farming seeks to protect.</p><p>A 2019 study published in the journal <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Nature Communications</emphasis>, and led by Britain's Cranfield University, found that going fully organic in Britain could increase the carbon footprint of food production by up to 70%, mostly due to land-use change overseas to compensate for lower yields. In other words, what we gain in pesticide reduction, we may lose in deforestation and carbon debt elsewhere.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Land sparing: high-yield farming, but at what cost?</emphasis></h><p>The alternative? Intensify production on the most suitable land using highy-ield methods, synthetic fertilisers, irrigation, and even genetically modified crops, while sparing other land entirely for nature. Known as the land sparing model, this approach banks on efficiency. The idea is simple: grow more on less land, so that we can set aside more of the planet for conservation and rewilding.</p><p>In theory, it's sound. Modelling studies suggest that intensifying production on existing farmland could allow for up to 40% of agricultural land to be restored to natural habitats, if done right. But there are huge caveats.</p><p>First, intensive farming often depletes soil, pollutes water, and erodes local biodiversity. It's also a major driver of greenhouse gas emissions, especially from livestock and fertiliser use. Without strict environmental regulations, intensification can do more harm than good. Second, land sparing relies on strong policy enforcement. Just because one area produces more doesn't mean another area will automatically be rewilded.

That means producing more food while using less land, water, and carbon. The global food system already accounts for over one-third of greenhouse gas emissions, and agriculture is the leading cause of deforestation and biodiversity decline.</p><p>To meet this challenge, we can't rely solely on ideology, whether it's techdriven maximalism or organic purity. Instead, we need evidence-based, regionally adapted food systems that recognise trade-offs for win-wins.</p><p>This includes:</p><p>(1) shifting diets, especially reducing high-emission foods like beef in favour of more plant-based proteins</p><p>(2) cutting food waste, which currently squanders up to 30% of global food production</p><p>(3) supporting smallholder farmers, particularly in the less developed countries, where yield gaps are large but often due to lack of access to tools, credit, or knowledge, and not poor practice, and finally</p><p>(4) investing in agroecological transitions that don't just mimic nature, but restore its functions in food production.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">What can Ireland do?</emphasis></h><p>Ireland, with more than 68% of land used for agriculture, mostly for beef and dairy, is deeply tied to these global debates.

Importantly, Brian was able to convert part of the farm to organics. He has the option of converting the remainder down the line once he has gotten used to the system, and depending on the market for organic meat.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">He currently has 550-600 ewes and 100 head of cattle. He grows tillage on the farm for two reasons: Firstly, it provides a high protein, high energy winter feed (combi crop of wheat and peas); and secondly, it breaks up the sod before reseeding and so works well in the rotation.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Soil fertility focus</emphasis></h><p>There has been a significant emphasis on optimising soil fertility on the farm. Soil analysis and the use of a nutrient management plan has allowed Brian to focus on where to target lime to raise soil pH, and where to target slurry and compound fertilisers for optimising phos phorus (P) and potassium (K) indices.</p><p>There are 41% of his soils optimum for pH, P and K, with 77%, 74%, and 77% optimum for pH, P and K, respectively. This has been a great foundation for Brian to successfully incorporate clover into the swards and reduce reliance on chemical nitrogen.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Converting to organics</emphasis></h><p>Brian started the conversion to organic production in the last 12 months. Brian chose to convert 70% of the agricultural land to organic farming.</p><p>Partial conversion of the farm to organic farming is allowed, subject to the following conditions:</p><p>* If both organic and conventional crops are to be produced, different species of plant, or different varieties that can be easily differentiated at all stages of growth and production, must be used.</p><p>* If both organic and conventional livestock are to be produced, different species must be involved.</p><p>He converted for a number of reasons. Firstly, the value of the Organic Farming Scheme payment to the farm.</p><p>An annual participation payment is be paid to all scheme participants to cover administrative costs, which is in addition to the per hectare payment. Both payments will be incorporated into the annual scheme payment. An amount of  2,000 will be paid to scheme participants in the first year of conversion and  1,400 for every subsequent year of the contract.</p><p>Another key reason was the potential markets for organic lamb. Brian is hopeful of premium markets for organic lamb.</p><p>Brian was operating a 1,000 ewe unit. Sourcing labour was becoming a major issue on the farm. It made sense to reduce ewe numbers to reduce labour requirement and operate at a more sustainable level and to improve work-life balance.</p><p>Switching to organic production also helps Brian meet his emissions targets.</p><p>But, of course, he had several key considerations before he switched to organics.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Incorporating clover</emphasis></h><p>Brian has been using clover for the last few years to reduce his reliance on chemical nitrogen. He has also made progress to increase soil fertility to ensure productivity is maintained.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Sourcing farmyard manure</emphasis></h><p>Brian has 100 head of cattle, which are housed for five months of the year. These provide Brian with a source of farmyard manure for targeting low P and K fields.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Stocking rate</emphasis></h><p>For organic production, the stocking rate needs to be less than two livestock units per hectare. Brian had 1,000 ewes and 300 ewe lamb replacements before conversion. He has reduced ewe numbers to 550-600. This was a choice that suited him from a labour perspective.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Bedding areas</emphasis></h><p>Brian needed to consider if animal housing could be modified to incorporate a bedded lying area.</p><p>All sheds are straw bedded for the sheep enterprise. Cattle sheds have a slatted feeding area with a straw laying area - so if in the future he decides to convert the cattle to organic, there are no major financial requirements.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Other schemes</emphasis></h><p>Other environmental schemes may not be eligible for Or ganic Farming Scheme payment.</p><p>Brian is also in Acres and the options chosen for Acres means his organic payment is not affected. Brian is maximising payments for Acres and organics.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Animal health</emphasis></h><p>The routine prevention of health problems in animals is key for organic livestock production. Brian has operated with a robust flock health plan, which has helped to reduce animal health risks. He also regularly uses faecal egg sampling to identify fluke and worm challenges rather than using routine preventative treatment.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Will it be profitable</emphasis></h><p>This farm is already operating at a high level of output, coupled with low production costs.

She said that agroforestry \"has the potential to help restore over one billion hectares of degraded agricultural land worldwide\". In Ireland, we are determined to see forest cover grow and we are determined to ensure that agroforestry is integral to that growth,\" she said. Agroforestry is an important bridge between forestry and agriculture. Our forestry programme offers several potential opportunities to develop agroforestry.

Now the more prominent EU examples of agroforestry are sheep grazing beneath cork oaks in Portugal and Spain, or tall fruit trees under which crops are grown or livestock grazed, in Central Europe."]}, {"relevance_score": 23, "title": "Redistribute CAP funds for extensive livestock farming, Ag Commissioner says", "published": "2024-08-06", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The next CAP should introduce a redistributive payment for sustainable mixed farms, supporting extensive sustainable livestock farming, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture has said.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Commissioner Janusz Wojciechowski's comments came while speaking on Food for Europe, a podcast produced by the European Commission's DG AGRI.</p><p>\"Intensive farming is not a good solution for the future of European agriculture.

This is the annual gettogether of organic, biodynamic, chemical free and an increasing number of regenerative farmers who are transitioning to more sustainable production methods. This year the numbers increased by almost 50% reflecting the growing acreage of land in Ireland being farmed on organic principles to 5% in 2024 from a mere 2% in 2022. Organic production is increasing worldwide with Australia, India and Argentina leading the way. In Europe, Liechtenstein has the highest organic area at 43% followed by Austria, the leading EU country at 27.5%. Sales of organic food continue to rise exponentially particularly in the US and Australia. Here in Ireland, despite the cost of living crisis, an increasing number of people are connecting the food they eat to the health of the family.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is a growing realisation that it's more cost-effective to invest in chemical free foods rather than expensive and not always effective supplements. Once again I repeat our food should and can indeed be our medicine. There's also a significant increase in the number of families who have started to grow some of their own food at home, in veggie patches, allotments and even on window sills and balconies.</p><p>This not only enhances our lives, reminds us of what food should taste like but it excites the kids and teaches them some really important life skills. It also shows them (and us) how much work actually goes into producing nourishing wholesome food, it doesn't just appear on the supermarket shelf. John Hogan, an agronomist and horticultural consultant with 40 years' experience spelled out the challenges but also the growing market for Irish organic food and opportunity for export substitution. Most would have a gut feeling (as do I) that organic, chemical-free food, grown in rich fertile soil has got to be altogether better for our wellbeing but why, one might ask, in the midst of this cost of living crisis, would the consumer reckon that it's worth the extra money unless there is scientific evidence to prove it. We urgently need targeted stats, anecdotal evidence is not enough.</p><p>Poor diets are also linked to 20% of deaths worldwide, eleven billion annually and cost health authorities countless millions globally.

BioFarm encourages and supports farmers and growers to consider agroforestry, silvopasture (a way of combining trees, livestock, and forage crops on the same land for multiple benefits), the importance of dung beetles, all play their part in enriching fertile soil and producing healthy food to nourish rather than damage our health which is what farming should be all about in the end.</p><p>We stayed at Fitzgeralds Woodlands hotel in Adare, the conference venue.

Stocking rateAgroforestry can involve pasture, grazing, silage and hay. Other systems may be considered on a site-by-site basis, as long as the tree stocking rate is between 400-1000 trees per hectare, it is at least 0. 5ha and at least 20m wide. The trees will be thinned out in time, reducing numbers to 160-250 trees per hectare. This will allow enough light to filter through the canopy, enabling continued grass growth.

The scheme was introduced in October last year to encourage long-term forest creation for farmers with over 3.1 million ha of land but is not suited to native forest establishments.</p><p>At the time, Minister Pippa Hackett said: \"Key to the success of increasing afforestation rates is to build confidence among farmers of the benefits of forestry as a viable option to complement their existing farm enterprises.</p><p>\"This scheme has been designed to have a straightforward approval process, which means that it is now open for new native forests to be planted before the end of 2023 under this scheme.\"</p><p>According to research published in 2022 by Teagasc and UCD, forestry cover in Ireland is 25 pc lower than the European average, with a critically low rate of afforestation.</p><p>\"It has reached a point where farmers are saying, 'if I plant trees, I'm devaluing the land'. Now that land is extremely expensive and farmers are making a lot more money at dairying and other types of farming, forestry just isn't a great option,\" explains farmer and forester Joe Barry.</p><p>\"If planted, the trees have to be there for ever - according to the new schemes, once you plant them and avail of the grants, you can't take your land out of forestry - that's one of the biggest reasons why farmers are against it.</p><p>\"Farmers basically want money from their land, it's as simple as that.\"</p><p>According to Teagasc's forestry development officer John Casey, Ireland's Forest Strategy Implementation Plan identified a number of barriers to achieving the 8,000ha annual target last year for a number of reasons.</p><p>These included competing land uses, the permanent land use change, difficulties in the administration of forestry licences and negative perceptions of forestry as a whole.</p><p>However, he finds more interest in the newly introduced scheme. Out of the 446 applications received by the Department, 311 applied for the creation of small native forests (NTA1), 34 applied for creating small native forests for water protection (NTA2) and 101 applied to plant under both.</p><p>\"At Teagasc one-to-one clinics earlier this year, there was significant interest in the NTAS,\" he says.</p><p>\"Their attraction to farmers may in part be attributed to the fact that native tree applications have historically tended to consist of relatively small areas in comparison to commercial private forests, while agroforestry is seen as a potential bridge between agriculture and forestry, which could yield both economic and environmental rewards from the farm enterprise.\"</p><p>This year, the annual budget of the Government's forestry programme was slashed from (EURO)110m to (EURO)91m. The nearly (EURO)20m fall has led to disappointment among farmers.</p><p>\"We've had historic problems going back a number of years now,\" says Padraig Stapleton, the IFA's Forestry Committee chair.</p><p>\"The backlog has been largely rectified but there's a very heavy bureaucratic burden to get licensing, road grants, and on the other side of the things, we have the ash dieback scheme and the way that has been handled.\"</p><p>\"When you look at the new scheme as a purely business decision and what a farmer has to give up\u2026 first of all, 15pc of your land goes to biodiversity, and 20pc of the remaining portion has to go to broadleaves, which are a non-commercial crop.</p><p>\"Yes, you will get a 20-year premium on them but in the lifetime of a family farm, 20 years is a very short time. After that, no more income can be derived from that land.</p><p>\"Our land is all we have - no matter what we do with it, every acre is what we need to generate an income from. If you take 35pc of that away from us, you will never reach our planting targets.\"</p><p>Mr Stapleton points out that people's confidence in forestry and the industry as a whole has fallen over the last few years, with the way successive schemes were managed and how diseases affected forests.</p><p>\"It's very unfair to ask the farmers to take on that burden in the name of biodiversity,\" he says. \"If a farmer decides in the morning to plant his land, the problem with forestry is that once you sign the dotted line, it is in forestry now and forever more.</p><p>\"When you sign up to that 20-year premium, you're dictating to future generations that you decided to go into forestry and you will have to live with the consequences of my decision and no income.</p><p>\"The way the programmes are constructed will never fulfil what the government set out to do.\"</p><p>Joe Barry believes that the best solution for farmers such as himself would be to encourage people in the industry to plant commercial timber.</p><p>\"All the new schemes are stressing on planting broadleaves, and that takes us back to the old money problem again,\" he says.</p><p>\"Yes, farmers are getting money through these schemes but that's not enough incentive. I myself have loads and loads of broadleaves.</p><p>\"I love them, but I'm not stupid enough to think that I'm going to make money out of them.</p><p>\"We need to be planting more broadleaves. Oak seems to be the only one left - everything else seems to be dying of diseases.</p><p>\"Farmers should be allowed and encouraged to plant commercial timber that can be used in building. Take the Sitka spruce or the Norway spruce - these are trees that the industry needs and wants, and they all go into our housing estates, helping lock up carbon.</p><p>\"Whereas, if I plant an oak in the morning, it will be ready for harvest in about 150 years' time. So the State should plant the broadleaves and farmers should be allowed to plant commercial timber that they can make money out of - otherwise you're never benefiting off that hard work.</p><p>\"If I plant 20ac of Sitka spruce and I start off when I'm 50, in 30 years' time when I'm 80, I can harvest the fields and I can get back a couple of thousand euro at least. That's attractive.</p><p>\"Whereas, with broadleaves, even my grandchildren might not see the returns.\"</p><p>Manus Crowley, director of Enfor, an organisation that supports the sustainable management of forests, says Forest Type 10 (FT10) - an afforestation grant which aims to create continuous cover forestry (CCF) has found great interand est among farmers. \"I think there's huge interest in agro-forestry and native woodlands among foresters,\" he says. \"The FT10, which is a mixed commercial CCF-type woodland, has people really interested. \"But I think it's too early to tell what people's interest in forestry will look like since many of these schemes are so new.</p><p>\"I wouldn't use the NTAS scheme as a barometer for people's interest in forestry because it's more of an environmental scheme for planting tiny woodlands.</p><p>\"That said, the incentives for it are brilliant it's really easy to get approval under it. I think it should be bigger - people will be more interested in planting then.\"</p><p>Mr Crowley, who is a forester himself based in Kilkenny, has been busy with afforestation work covering a number of counties from Leitrim to Waterford and Clare.</p><p>\"We are out the door with work,\" he says. \"I think farmers are definitely interested in planting. \"I'm not sure why that idea (that they are not interested) is being perpetuated. Maybe relative to 25 years ago when we were planting 15,000ha a year, we are way behind that.</p><p>\"But you have to give it a little bit more of time, the programme is only one year old.</p><p>\"The problem with forestry is not any of that - it's the fact that it lost any credibility between the time of 2018 to 2021 when all the licensing difficulties arose with landowners.</p><p>\"The amount of money offered to farmers in the name of afforestation is massive now, so it's not just about money.</p><p>\"The only glaring difficulty from my perspective is that the bureaucratic process is still relatively slow, and there's a lot of third party intervention and slow ecological tests. Approval can take anywhere from two months to 14 months.\"</p><p>'Farmers are saying, 'if I plant trees, I'm devaluing the land'. Now that farmers are making a lot more money at dairying and other types of farming, forestry just isn't a great option'</p>", "publisher": "Irish Independent", "instances": ["According to Teagasc's forestry development officer John Casey, Ireland's Forest Strategy Implementation Plan identified a number of barriers to achieving the 8,000ha annual target last year for a number of reasons. These included competing land uses, the permanent land use change, difficulties in the administration of forestry licences and negative perceptions of forestry as a whole. However, he finds more interest in the newly introduced scheme. Out of the 446 applications received by the Department, 311 applied for the creation of small native forests (NTA1), 34 applied for creating small native forests for water protection (NTA2) and 101 applied to plant under both. At Teagasc one-to-one clinics earlier this year, there was significant interest in the NTAS,\" he says. Their attraction to farmers may in part be attributed to the fact that native tree applications have historically tended to consist of relatively small areas in comparison to commercial private forests, while agroforestry is seen as a potential bridge between agriculture and forestry, which could yield both economic and environmental rewards from the farm enterprise. This year, the annual budget of the Government's forestry programme was slashed from (EURO)110m to (EURO)91m. The nearly (EURO)20m fall has led to disappointment among farmers. We've had historic problems going back a number of years now,\" says Padraig Stapleton, the IFA's Forestry Committee chair. The backlog has been largely rectified but there's a very heavy bureaucratic burden to get licensing, road grants, and on the other side of the things, we have the ash dieback scheme and the way that has been handled. When you look at the new scheme as a purely business decision and what a farmer has to give up\u2026 first of all, 15pc of your land goes to biodiversity, and 20pc of the remaining portion has to go to broadleaves, which are a non-commercial crop."]}, {"relevance_score": 31, "title": "Restoring the 'big old trees' missing from the Irish countryside", "published": "2024-08-24", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Time away in Kerry with the family is only complete with a bit of weather. So I find myself smack bang in the middle of that oh-so-familiar forecast: southerly winds reaching gale force 8 on Irish coastal waters from Carnsore Point to Mizen Head to Erris Head. The clouds hang low and threaten to bring the curtain down on the sea view. Too forceful for surfing but too grim to stay indoors, with the sound of the wind as it whistles around the house, we turn our backs on the Atlantic Ocean and head inland, hoping lakes and trees can offer a bit of respite from the storm.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">And so we find ourselves in Glanteenassig, from Gleann T\u00ed an Easaigh, the valley of the waterfalls, an expansive 450-hectare wood nestled in the Slieve Mish mountains.

But there is one big problem: planning laws.</p><p>Minister for the Environment Eamon Ryan believes that Ireland can address climate challenges, but emphasises the need for significant changes in planning legislation to expedite wind energy development   the timelines for planning and delivering offshore and land-based wind farms are too long.</p><p>The State of the Climate in Europe report for 2023 highlights rising temperatures, unprecedented glacier melt, low precipitation and more wildfires. However, the report also stresses the potential for renewable energy development. Ireland s Climate Action Plan 2021 outlines a strategy to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 51 per cent by 2030, with a goal of generating five gigawatts of offshore wind power by that year. Achieving this target would significantly enhance our renewable energy supply, powering millions of homes and reducing reliance on fossil fuels. In May 2023, four projects were awarded contracts and are expected to provide three gigawatts once operational. However, this will not be enough to meet the target.</p><p>Farming and agriculture play a significant role in climate change, both by contributing to greenhouse gas emissions and being affected by climate shifts. Our beef and dairy herds release greenhouse gases, leading to global warming, which in turn alters weather patterns, growing seasons and crop productivity. Climate change impacts precipitation, causing water shortages, droughts and flooding, while unsustainable farming practices degrade soil health and diminish carbon storage. Rising temperatures and changing rainfall patterns threaten crop yields and food security. Additionally, climate change extends the range of pests and increases extreme weather events, damaging crops and infrastructure.</p><p>Implementing sustainable practices such as crop rotation, conservation tillage, agroforestry and organic farming can help mitigate these impacts. Government support through incentives and research is essential for building a sustainable and resilient food system. Farmers have the power to drive the necessary changes to mitigate and adapt to climate change, ensuring a sustainable agricultural future in Ireland.</p><p> But is not just farmers that must prioritise climate change. A major challenge in tackling this crisis is persuading everyone that there is a direct link between their daily activities and climate change. We don t have to be passive, or fatalistic   we can tackle the problem. But we need to believe what the scientists tell us. Climate denial is now out of the question   for leaders in politics, business and agriculture. And people at home. Better communication is a matter of urgency.</p><p>As citizens we need to recognise that our daily actions, consumption, behaviour have an impact not only on us, but on Ireland and the world. We can make small changes like choosing to buy local, use public transport, recycle, consume less and reduce food waste   which will have a massive impact if achieved at scale. Almost everything we do on a daily basis consumes precious energy. But we can lower energy use at home by taking shorter showers, reducing heat settings on boilers and using less water.</p><p>Climate innovation stimulates the economy. We need entrepreneurs with innovative technologies and business models to accelerate climate adaptation. Replacing fossil fuels and creating new sources   renewables   will revolutionise the economy. We must incentivise innovative smaller companies to develop solutions to transform how we provide energy, water, food and clothing to meet or even exceed climate targets. There are companies waiting to demonstrate their technologies to support climate adaptation and mitigation. However, there are few opportunities for demonstration and scaling, and planning difficulties can be a huge barrier.</p><p>This week s alarming climate statistics are also bad news for big businesses. They too need to adapt to the accelerating problem, with 80 per cent globally seeing physical climate risks to their business. However, only 27 per cent rated adaptation as a  very high priority , compared with more than double (60 per cent) for mitigation. Adaptation for the future is as important now as mitigating extreme weather in the present.

Additionally, climate change extends the range of pests and increases extreme weather events, damaging crops and infrastructure. Implementing sustainable practices such as crop rotation, conservation tillage, agroforestry and organic farming can help mitigate these impacts. Government support through incentives and research is essential for building a sustainable and resilient food system. Farmers have the power to drive the necessary changes to mitigate and adapt to climate change, ensuring a sustainable agricultural future in Ireland. But is not just farmers that must prioritise climate change. A major challenge in tackling this crisis is persuading everyone that there is a direct link between their daily activities and climate change.

In contrast to any of the crops we actually grow here, prices for cocoa and sugar are both rising. Sugar price has increased by about 20pc in the last year, largely down to weather in Brazil, but cocoa's rise is more dramatic and complicated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sugar is an annual crop and the old saying that the cure for high prices is high prices applies to it, as this year's prices will increase the area planted next year and prices will fall again. Cocoa beans are harvested from a tree that lives for 100 years so the crop cannot respond easily to market prices.</p><p>The cocoa bean is the source of cocoa, the key ingredient in chocolate, and it comes from equatorial regions. Ghana and Ivory Coast in west Africa account for 70pc of global cocoa production, and Indonesia for another 15pc. Most of the rest is grown in Latin America where the plant originated.</p><p>Most cocoa farmers only have a couple of hectares, often rented, and have very little scope to invest. Trees take five years after planting to produce their first crop and output declines from 30 years of age. The kind of planned replacement programme this requires is difficult for small farmers, and the Ghanaian and Ivorian governments have programmes to fund replanting, but there are still challenges.</p><p>Swollen root virus, spread by mealybugs, is rampant in cocoa trees, and infected ground cannot be replanted for five years. Environmental restrictions on deforestation limit options for planting in fresh ground so farmers often switch to alternative crops such as cassava.</p><p>El Nino has affected west Africa severely in the last year and the higher rainfall has driven fungal diseases, further reducing output.</p><p>Less fertiliser is being used due to high prices, and overall cocoa production is expected to drop by more than 10pc this year.</p><p>Lower production has coincided with a post-Covid rise in demand for chocolate and this, along with billions of hedge-fund dollars, has driven prices up by 60pc since January and 150pc in the last 12 months. If this sounds like a great time to be a cocoa farmer, the reality is more bitter.</p><p>In 2019, Ghana and Ivory Coast formed a cocoa-exporting cartel based on oil's OPEC. At the start of each harvest, a price based on the average of the previous 12 months is fixed for growers. This should allow high prices to eventually trickle down to growers, but in practice there seem to be a lot of noses in the trough and farmers are currently getting about one-quarter of the internationally traded price.</p><p>Various initiatives from buyers, environmental organisations and the European Union aim to support sustainable cocoa production but most of these are likely to further constrain production in the short term. Deforestation bans limit African production and, while there is suitable land available in Latin America, the political stability needed to promote such a longterm crop is absent in many countries. Moves to agroforestry and regenerative farming are encouraged but these can also be expected to constrain production while they are being established, and the better education being encouraged often sees fewer people going back to the grind of subsistence farming.</p><p>Cocoa prices will come back a bit when speculators have a meltdown but supply will be hard to increase. If my Easter egg costs the same as last year's, it probably contains less cocoa. It may have been replaced with cheaper ingredients like palm oil, or the egg maybe part of a fivefor-(EURO)10 supermarket deal that has nothing to do with the cost of production.

'Banks had started refusing the smaller funds for getting planning done,' she says. 'I was working in a big firm with about 50 project managers and a couple of hundred quantity surveyors and I can remember saying, \"There's a crash coming\". People thought I was crazy because we were busier than ever but that was my strong feeling so I decided to re-train.'</p><p>There was something else about the industry that had been bothering Ailbhe too. 'I was becoming very uneasy about the lack of sustainability in construction,' she says. 'At that time there was no proper attention given to the careful use of resources that are non-renewable - the huge amounts of carbon in concrete and huge amounts of timber use that wasn't coming from sustainable sources. But also there was very little reuse of buildings there was a lot of knock down and rebuild.'</p><p>That wasn't the world she wanted to be in so she went to London to re-train in sustainable development, which accidentally led to her real epiphany.</p><p>'I had an opportunity to go to a climate conference in 2009 when I was studying and that absolutely opened my eyes to what was coming towards us in terms of climate. I thought then, do you know what? I need to go home and buy a farm.'</p><p>Her parents, she says, were simultaneously horrified and delighted but her knowledge of the area meant she approached someone about half a mile from her parents' home and proceeded to buy Brookfield Farm.</p><p>At 40, Ailbhe started to study organic farming, thanks to the help of a neighbour.</p><p>'I bought a conventional tillage farm, which had 15 acres of broad leaf trees which were 12 years old at that stage,' Ailbhe says. 'It runs down to Lough Derg and is a really beautiful farm and I was lucky to be able to buy it. It had been leased for decades and probably had 40 years of unbroken barley growing in the conventional system and it needed thought and a reconfiguration of what the land was going to do.</p><p>'I worked with a tillage contractor who was a very good friend of the family and gave me great advice - he said, \"Until you have done your studies, carry on with the farm the way it is for the next couple of years, I will do the contracting the ploughing and the harvesting and the making bales and you take it slowly.\" It is a completely different farm now but it was good to have that time to work it out.'</p><p>After three years of study, Brookfield Farm began to transform into grasslands and organic barley fields whose harvest is used for making beer and it has just won a contract to supply Waterford Distillery for an organic whiskey. It's a place where organic sheep graze on land that has been brought back to grass. Ailbhe learned beekeeping and has native Irish black bees who make honey for her hives. She makes candles, polishes and balms from their beeswax that she sells via the farm website.</p><p>There are experiments of growing Jerusalem artichokes and different kinds of potatoes.</p><p>But all the while Ailbhe has continued to study and learn, now teaching agriculture in Tipperary and Gurteen agricultural colleges while farming what is now 84 acres of diverse and organic land.</p><p>As someone who came into farming with a blank canvas, Ailbhe has always seen the isolation that farmers might feel and has always opened up her farm to others.</p><p>'Right from the start, because I was teaching agriculture, I felt people who are farming have a responsibility to bring society with them, to invite people in,' she says. 'From the very first year I had the farm open for walks and open days so it has always been part of educating people about what agriculture is and where we are going.'</p><p>It was through this that she started Field Exchange, a festival at which farming meets art, where artists, farmers and members of the public can meet and exchange skills and ideas, and also discuss where farming is headed or needs to go.</p><p>'I came up with the idea of applying for funding to help farmers shift their attitudes around changing farming practices. It's very scary for individual farmers to change their practices in farm- ing,' she says. 'Because I was teaching agriculture too, I am aware that farmers get very little additional education and opportunities to meet up and learn new stuff.</p><p>'When I started, I was a new entrant to farming and to me the land was a wide open thing. A lot of people who inherit farms feel it's very much closed and you do what your dad did. There's very little sense that you can do anything and that's the kind of sense that I want to bring with Field Exchange, that you can look at your land more creatively.</p><p>'The teaching has taught me an awful lot about how the agricultural system works, what farmers need and what they are not getting. The idea of Field Exchange came up as a way to bring people together as we have so few opportunities in farming to actually meet up and have discussions - not just about the price of cattle but where people are going.'</p><p>Ailbhe doesn't think farming is dying out but feels there is a lot of pressure on the type of family farming we are used to seeing.</p><p>There are issues surrounding climate change with emissions, the loss of habitat for animals, water quality and so on but she also believes there is a lot of fingerwagging and apportioning blame to individual farmers from quarters that don't actually understand what it is to work on the land.</p><p>'My feeling is that it is not individual farmers but the system they have been walked into over decades now,' she says. 'It worked very well for a few decades but it isn't working any more. That is leading to a huge amount of frustration among individual farmers and with people who live in cities and towns who are not connected with farming.</p><p>'They are frustrated because they can see what the problems are - with the water quality in Lough Neagh for instance it is really obvious there is a huge problem. Individually you are getting blamed for a systemic problem.</p><p>'I do think it is absolutely solvable but we all do have to have a different kind of conversation with each other, a different kind of discourse and a different kind of collaboration.

'It's not someone in the city saying you need to do something differently.</p><p>'There has been an aggressiveness that has come into the discussion around environment, climate, agriculture and the rights of farmers, the rights of consumers, the rights of citizens and the rights of wildlife.

Their goal is to regenerate the landscape through farming, and they produce vegetable boxes through a Community Supported Agriculture (CSA) scheme. In early 2020, they planted Ireland's first syntropic agro-forestry system: An apple, plum, hazelnut, and walnut forest.</p><p>Syntropic agroforestry is a system of farming that works with nature; syntropy means the accumulation of energy and life, and agroforestry means growing trees and shrubs amongst whatever you're farming, be that animals or crops or both. At the farm in Wicklow, they are pioneering trials for commercial syntropic agroforestry systems that will work with the Irish temperate climate and landscape. From what I saw, it's going brilliantly.</p><p>I saw the trees, already fruiting but not ready to harvest. All around them grew various fruit and vegetables, including radishes, carrots, spinach, kale, onions, potatoes, broad beans, strawberries, raspberries, currants, and rhubarb. Hazel and Davi had also planted \"service species\" including alder, poplar, and willow trees, as well as shrubs called tree lupins. Those species provide cover and, when pruned and chipped, make potent biomass to add to the soil. This keeps the fertility cycle going, and indeed the abundance of berries, fruit, and vegetables in amongst the leafy trees on a July day was stunning.</p><p>I grew up in rural Cork, and generations of my family have farmed beef, dairy, and potatoes. Hazel and Davi's Wicklow Farm looks different from what I'm used to - there is no slurry tank, no tonnes of fertiliser in huge plastic bags, no massive and costly machinery. While the fields were laid out in orderly rows, instead of one crop of a uniform height, the fields looked more like densely packed orchards. Syntropic agroforestry is new to Ireland, but it is an ancient practice developed by early farmers in the Amazon. Indigenous people grew their food in a clearing, sowing their annual plants and future tree crops together. Those dynamics - a diverse landscape with many layers of plants all taking turns in harvesting the sunlight - inspired the system thriving today. Farmers love this system because within a few years it is p ossible to make a closed loop of productivity, eventually not needing to add anything from the outside.</p><p>Ernst G\u00f6tsch is a Swiss farmer who moved to Bahia, Brazil, in the early 1980s and developed syntropic agroforestry on 400 hectares of land there.

Hazel and Davi's Wicklow Farm looks different from what I'm used to - there is no slurry tank, no tonnes of fertiliser in huge plastic bags, no massive and costly machinery. While the fields were laid out in orderly rows, instead of one crop of a uniform height, the fields looked more like densely packed orchards. Syntropic agroforestry is new to Ireland, but it is an ancient practice developed by early farmers in the Amazon.

For example, the Irish Peatland Council has previously outlined that the relatively small 75-acre Lodge Bog, in Co Kildare, would emit the equivalent of 66,000 cars a year if it was drained.</h><p>The Green Party has stressed that rewetting would be voluntary for farmers and landowners and an  emergency brake  was written into the text to suspend temporarily targets where they would severely impact food production.</p><p>While Mr Bright acknowledges the Nature Restoration Law is a  blunt tool , he feels that the threat farmers feel is probably less than they perceive it might be.

We ve contacted the Minister for Agriculture as well,  he said. He says both are confident there won t be any issues  but they seem reluctant to put it in writing .</p><p> Some 80-odd years ago when they started draining these bogs, the lands around them would have had springs or wet patches. When they were drained, all those springs dried up,  Mr O Brien said.  If rewetting happens, the bogs will swell and rise up, and when they become saturated in 10 and 20 years  time, it will act like a water tower and all those underground springs and streams will rise up again.</p><p> What we want is a guarantee that if that does happen then Bord na M\u00f3na would come as speedily as possible to fix it so that it can be farmed.

However, the current Government may not be in place to execute that plan. Dairy farmer Pat O Brien pointed out that all five of Fine Gael s MEPs voted in favour of the law.</h><p> The traditional farmer s parties, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael, just abandoned farmers since we dug them out of a hole in the 1990s.

As MEPs supported a sustainable carbon cycles resolution with 323 votes to 257, rapporteur Alexander Bern-huber (Austria) said: \"We support sustainable carbon cycles and the concept of carbon farming, which can actively contribute to climate change mitigation. Carbon farming can become another source of income for European agriculture and forestry. We also believe it should be voluntary and incentive-driven, without unnecessary bureaucracy and obligations. The EU becoming carbon neutral by 2050 means that each single tonne of carbon dioxide equivalent emitted into the atmosphere will have to be neutralised by a tonne removed from the atmosphere. The Parliament was responding to citizens' expectations to introduce a certified system of carbon removal as part of safe and sustainable food production."]}, {"relevance_score": 21, "title": "New 'crucial' knowledge transfer programme opens for applications", "published": "2023-07-20", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The new knowledge transfer (KT) programme under CAP has opened for applications.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The programme will allow for knowledge exchange and innovation between advisors, farmers, and other stakeholders, Minister for Agriculture Charlie McConalogue said, and will play a \"crucial role\" in helping farmers to meet current and future challenges.</p><p>\"This new programme will build on what was achieved by its predecessor under the 2014-2020 Rural Development Programme,\" Mr McConalogue said.</p><p>\"It will also contribute to the wider development of the Agricultural Knowledge and Innovation Systems [AKIS] by harnessing the knowledge of all those who work in the agri-food chain.</p><p>\"I look forward to advisors and farmers engaging with the new KT programme - to the benefit of Irish farm businesses - as this is where the programme's success will be measured.\"</p><p>Minister of state Martin Heydon added that the new programme will \"provide an important avenue to support farmers to access information across a wide range of topics, including environmental sustainability, digital and smart technologies, and succession planning\".</p><p>\"I am particularly pleased that farm health, safety, and wellbeing has been included as a priority topic in the new programme,\" he said.</p><p>\"Peer learning is a powerful driver of behavioural change and has been shown to be an effective method of improving safety on farms.</p><p>\"This ensures the programme covers not only economic and environmental sustainability, but also social sustainability on farms.\"</p><p>There is a two-step application process.</p><p>Expressions of interest to act as a KT facilitator from FAS-approved advisors are accepted online via agfood.ie by September 1.</p><p>If approved, the KT facilitator will be invited to submit an application for a KT group and nominate the group participants on the online KT system by October 31.</p><p>Participants will receive reimbursement to the amount of  750 per annum where all the requirements of the programme have been met.</p><p>Facilitators will receive  500 per annum per participant in their group(s) where all the requirements of the programme have been met.</p><p>Each KT group can have a maximum of 20 participants and each participant must attend eight group meetings and one-to-ones with the KT facilitator each year of the three-year programme.</p><p>This programme is separate to a forestry-specific Knowledge Transfer Programme also announced by Minister of State Pippa Hackett this month.</p><p>The Forestry Knowledge Transfer Group (KTG) Scheme has reopened for 2023.

And there it is, a flash mob of blooming orchids. The common spotted orchid's slender, tapering stems rise out of the ground, adorned with elliptical leaves; the cone-shaped flower apex is varied in colour, from a hint of pink to something reminiscent of lilac. A snow-white variety, O'Kelly's spotted-orchid, is scattered between them and exudes a sweet scent.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This alder wood runs through the centre of Keith and Caroline Brennan's 12-acre farm in the corner of north Roscommon, tucked between the Kilronan mountains on one side and the soft wetlands of Leitrim on the other. Keith was born and raised in Dublin's Liberties - in the 1911 census, his ancestors lived on Bride Street - and the prospect of owning land was enticing. Following the economic crash, the Brennans whittled down the options: a two-bedroom house in Drimnagh or a clod of Roscommon soil? They went with life on the land.</p><p>Keith wanted to reimagine the farm's potential and find a way to map out an economically viable future that could withstand the immense climatic uncertainties ahead. If he flattened the land and spread chemical fertiliser, then set it to green grass or planted a forestry crop, he would maximise the public subsidies on offer. But Keith preferred to farm under the assumption that natural resources are exhaustible; without nature, the land would quickly wear out. From the start, he saw his role as a farmer as being wider than just producing food. He would be a land manager and nature-creator as well.</p><p>It began with orchids. Wild orchids are remarkably patient and can lie dormant for years if environmental conditions aren't right. Their rhizomes and finger-shaped tubers remain alive - if a little sluggish - as they bide their time for more favourable circumstances to emerge.</p><p>His first move was to fence the alder wood to protect it from deer and his flock of diminutive Shetland sheep. The sheep were allowed in during the colder months (their grazing opened up space for the orchids to emerge), but as the sun warmed up in spring, he took them out to let the flowers grow. Within a year, orchids popped up.</p><p>We crouch down in the damp humidity of the wood. Among the wispy grasses, the orchids stand erect and sturdy. It's hard to imagine that they began life as dust-like seeds barely visible to the eye. These microscopic specks contain enough genes to develop but lack the nutrients for germination. To solve this, orchids and soil fungi engage in a quid pro quo relationship.</p><p>The fungi - such as the delicate, branch-like Tulasnella - colonise the seeds with thread-like filaments, which provide the orchids with enough nutrients to germinate. As the orchid grows upwards, it converts energy from the sun into sugars, which the fungi willingly absorb. Keith knows this delicate, finely tuned relationship is easily shattered by ploughing, spraying chemicals and adding fertiliser to the land.</p><p>Keith split the farm into acre-sized parcels of woodland, species-rich meadows, wild flower hay meadows, open hilly grassland and agroforestry. The small fields are separated by fencing and dense hedgerows of plums, crab apples, hazelnuts, elder, hawthorns, blackthorn and whitethorn, which act as a windbreak and also feed his bees and pigs. O'Kelly's orchids (named after Patrick O'Kelly, a colourful farmer and botanical expert from the early 1900s who discovered them in his native Ballyvaughan in the Burren) have spread throughout the farm.</p><h>Wild flower species </h><p>We stand in the wild flower hay meadow. The names of the species flow off Keith's tongue: stitchwort, foxgloves, bluebells, ragged robin, white clover, bird's-foot trefoil, devil's bit scabious, pimpernel, meadow vetchling, sheep's sorrel, yellow primrose, eyebright and cinquefoil. There are 61 wild flower species here. They support a multitude of insects, which are in turn eaten by the 41 species of birds that have made this land their home. In the summer, Keith cuts the meadows in succession and dries the flowers and grasses as hay, which is fed to the sheep over winter. The wildflowers continue to grow well into autumn.</p><p>What if, all those years ago, farmers had been paid to stay and manage the land for nature and food, at a similar rate to the money poured into tax-free publicly funded schemes for monoculture forestry?</p><p>A 120-acre Sitka spruce plantation, owned by Bank of Ireland, wraps around the farm. A few years ago sections were clear-felled and old farmhouses and stone-walled sheds that were previously hidden felt sun on their walls for the first time in years. In one townland that's now planted, 18 people had farmed the land.</p><p>These people died or drifted away - no doubt tempted by more favourable employment prospects elsewhere, or understandably indifferent to a future on the land. Still, a question remains: what if, all those years ago, farmers had been paid to stay and manage the land for nature and food, at a similar rate to the money poured into tax-free publicly funded schemes for monoculture forestry?</p><p>In a sense, one of the greatest problems about the land in this part of the west of Ireland - a mistaken idea that the ground is \"marginal\", \"poor\", \"wet\" and \"unproductive\" - is its greatest strength, for nature thrives in these conditions.

However, beneficial features will be deemed part of the eligible hectare once they are less than 50pc of the reference parcel area minus deductions for any artificial features and waterbodies.</p><p>The main beneficial features are set out below: \u00a6 Scrub \u00a6 Trees \u00a6 Woodland \u00a6 Habitat \u00a6 Rock Where beneficial features are present, there are three possible categories that a parcel can be placed in.</p><p>PARCEL REDUCTIONS</p><p>Reduction to Category % beneficial be applied 10 up to 50 0 2 50 up to 70 Area identified 3 70 up to 100 100</p><p>The above categories apply to Permanent Grassland only. Arable lands and Permanent Crops where the percentage exceeds 50pc are deemed ineligible.</p><p>LAND AREA FOR LIVESTOCK STOCKING CALCULATIONS The Eligible Hectare (EH) value at reference parcel level is the eligible area for payment purposes. The LPIS parcel information is also used as the basis for the stocking rate calculation for Nitrates and for Active Farmer, ANC and Eco scheme (Ag Practice 2 &amp; 3). For stocking rates purposes, a reference area will be calculated for each parcel, this is the total area of the parcel with non-productive areas deducted.</p><p>The Reference area is the area used to calculate the livestock stocking density for Area of Natural Constraint scheme, Active Farmer, ECO scheme, and Nitrates. Simply put, the Reference area is the area available for grazing. It is the digitised area of a parcel less the area under ineligible and beneficial features .</p><p>The reference area can be less than the Eligible Hectare for a parcel. For Example, a parcel of 10 ha with 2 ha of scrub would have an EH value of 10 ha, but a reference area of 8 ha.</p><p>Scrub and rock may now occupy up to 50pc of a parcel provided they do not impact the agricultural activity</p>", "publisher": "Irish Independent", "instances": ["he new CAP will see a number of significant changes to the rules around what land is eligible for payment under the various new schemes. TSome farmers could see significant amounts of land previously ineligible now become eligible for payment. Here we outline some of the key details farmers need to be aware of. For the purposes of BISS and other area-based schemes, the Department has defined an eligible hectare as an agricultural area that is used for an agricultural activity. AGRICULTURAL AREA An Agricultural Area is comprised of arable land, permanent crops and permanent grassland, along with agroforestry systems. Permanent Grassland is land used to grow grasses or herbaceous forage including heather and rushes, and Permanent Crops are lands that yield repeated harvests, for Example willow. Non-agricultural areas are ineligible for payment irrespective of the activity being carried out. Non-agricultural areas include the following: \u00a6 Artificial areas such as roads, paths, buildings, farmyards, quarries \u00a6 Waterbodies such as streams, lakes, and ponds greater than 0. 2 ha \u00a6 Sand \u00a6 Areas predominantly used as sports fields, golf courses, pitch-and-putt courses. AGRICULTURAL ACTIVITY An agricultural activity includes the production of agricultural products, such as livestock or growing crops, or can involve the maintenance of the agricultural area."]}, {"relevance_score": 28, "title": "How to move away from a junk food diet for plants and ourselves", "published": "2021-07-24", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Elevated carbon in the atmosphere is the nightmare that keeps on giving as we head into a summer of fire and fury.

size.</p><p>And have you carried out fertility tests on them, or have you received a fertility cert with a recently purchased bull?</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Balancing spring grass</emphasis></h><p>Energy is a critically important nutrient required by dairy cows.</p><p>Inadequate energy intake has a negative impact on a herd's overall performance, and ultimately on the cows' reproductive performance.</p><p>Anoestrus cows are more common when body condition losses in early lactation are excessive.</p><p>Body condition is the key to fertility!</p><p>How pronounced a negative energy balance is in individual cows is more related to how much energy they consume than how much milk they produce.</p><p>Cows will try to milk as much as they are genetically capable of for a period of time, regardless of intake, unfortunately to the detriment of body condition.</p><p>The closer you can match energy and dry matter intakes to their requirements, the better they will perform.</p><p>Thin cows have low milk protein and generally are harder to get in calf.</p><p>Excess body condition loss after calving means depressed milk yield, lower fertility, poor milk quality, and an increased risk of metabolic disorders such as ketosis and fatty liver</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Where does the feed go?</emphasis></h><p>So how do dairy cows partition the energy they consume?</p><p>* Body functions: Day-today activities like staying alive!</p><p>* Growth in first and second calvers until they reach full maturity.</p><p>* Fighting disease: Energy supply is critical to drive the immune system, in conjunction with sufficient minerals and vitamins.</p><p>* Producing milk: The amount of energy required will be determined by the cow's genetic potential to milk, and total energy eaten will be determined by the quality and availability of feed.</p><p>* Milk quality: Energy supply determines milk protein, and fibre digested determines butter fat.</p><p>* Maintaining or increasing body condition: cows gaining body condition are in a positive energy status and tend to have increasing levels of milk protein.</p><p>* Reproduction: once all of the above functions have been catered for with sufficient energy, then the reproductive system can use the remaining energy to successfully go back in calf.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Establishing feed requirements</emphasis></h><p>Cows producing 30 litres plus, or 2.2kg-2.5kg of milk solids, will be required to consume 18kg to 20kg of dry matter (DM).</p><p>Achieving 15 to 18kg of DM from grass should be targeted, and this will only be achieved when the appropriate grass covers and area allocated are offered.</p><p>In any grass-based production system, grass must be the priority feed.</p><p>However, once cows have maxed out on grass intake, how do we balance it properly for optimum utilisation of this super-food?</p><p>Only supplement cows once you know what energy grass has supplied, and use additional feed to strategically bridge the gap between energy consumed and energy required.</p><p>Dry matter intake should be calculated and related back to requirements, based on animal performance.</p><p>This has an impact on milk yield, herd health, fertility, milk quality and feed costs.</p><p>Any extra kgs of DM required will then come from supplementation indoors, usually fed as concentrates in the parlour, but also as a forage-based buf fer feed including maize, beet, whole crop, straw, bale silage etc.</p><p>Constructing an appropriate feeding strategy for a herd of cows requires knowing the genetic potential of the herd, the land type being farmed, and the stocking rate, among other factors.</p><p>Land and labour remain limiting factors on Irish dairy farms, and achieving more kgs of solids per cow might help farms when it comes to future environmental constraints.</p><p>The Irish dairy herd with its current genetic make-up is capable of producing more kgs of solids than it currently does!</p><p>* Independent dairy and beef nutrition consultant Brian Reidy, Premier Farm Nutrition, can be contacted at <email

options", "published": "2023-03-09", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Development Officer During November, 2022, a proposed investment of  1.3bn in Irish forestry was announced, representing the largest ever investment by an Irish Government in tree planting. The proposed new Programme is very ambitious and contains a proposed range of forest types to facilitate new forest creation and also interventions to help facilitate sustainable and resilient existing forests.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The proposed new Forestry Programme 2023-2027, is set come into force in 2023 as soon as State Aid approval by the EU Commission has been received. According to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (DAFM), this process is ongoing and all stakeholders will be updated as State Aid application moves closer to completion. Pending approval of the new Programme, DAFM have put in place interim schemes for afforestation and forest roads, available to holders of valid technical approvals.</p><p>The proposed new Forestry Programme 2023-2027 is the main implementation mechanism for the new Forest Strategy (2023-2030), which reflects the ambitions contained in the recently published 'Shared National Vision for Trees, Woods and Forests' in Ireland until 2050. Higher grant rates for forest establishment are also proposed. Forest premium rates are proposed to be increased by between 46 and 66%, depending on Forest Type. A premium duration of 20 years is set to apply for approved applicants who meet farmer qualification criteria. The new Programme will be 100% Exchequer funded.</p><p>Table 1 shows the eligible Forest Types and relevant supports available under the current Interim Afforestation Scheme (via General De Minimis). Additional new Forest Types will be available under the new Forestry Programme</p><p>The decision to plant is a long term land use change and consideration of all implications is recommended, including its potential to fit in very well with other farming enterprises and to provide financial, environmental and social benefits. This article also takes an initial look at the potential financial returns from two of the Forest Types in Table 1 available under the Interim Afforestation Scheme.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">COMPARING FOREST TYPES</emphasis></h><p>The Teagasc Forest Investment Valuation Estimator (FIVE) informs decision making in relation to potential land use and forestry options. FIVE uses discounted cash flow (DCF) analysis to model indicative financial returns for forestry land use options (forest creation) and management options (e.g. forest thinning). It provides financial output for decision support, particularly in relation to reviewing pre-planting options and comparing criteria such as tree species, yield classes and forest rotation lengths according to landowners' preferences and objectives. In order for landowners to get the optimum benefit from FIVE, Teagasc forestry advisers can facilitate one to one consultations in order to go through the forestry establishment scenarios that may be appropriate for individual circumstances.</p><p>Potential timber revenues are generated by FIVE through the selection of forest criteria and management regimes. A range of variables are used as inputs in a typical financial analysis. These include species, site productivity, rotation length, relevant premium payments, establishment and on-going management costs as well as potential thinning and clearfell timber volumes and revenues. Future cost and revenue streams from forestry are generated by FIVE and are discounted to present day values and presented as net present values (NPVs).</p><p>The NPV refers to the net returns to forestry over one (or more) forest rotation(s). In order to compare forestry with other farm enterprise options (at an indicative level), the FIVE tool expresses different forest crop rotations on an annual per hectare basis by generating the Annual Equivalent Value (AEV) for each forest scenario. The AEV expresses the NPV as a series of equal cash flows over the forest rotation.</p><p>The following case studies use FIVE analysis to compare the returns for type Forest Types 7 and 12 available under the Interim Afforestation Scheme (via General De Minimis).</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FARM FORESTRY OFFERING HIGHLY COMPETITIVE OPTIONS</emphasis></h><p>If all costs and revenues associated with forestry land use are compared with all costs and revenues associated with agricultural land use (after adjusting to present values and the one-year cycle per annum basis) then the forestry AEV per ha and family farm income can be considered conceptually equivalent. In this regard, forestry returns can be highly competitive when compared to many agricultural enterprises.</p><p>It should be borne in mind that this analysis compares observed agricultural incomes with projected future forestry income flows discounted to today's values and converted to annual equivalent. This allows indicative rather than absolute comparison.</p><p>FIVE analysis does not take into account the capacity for eligible forestry parcels to draw down the new Basic Income Support Scheme (BISS) payment as well as the forestry premiums. It also does not factor in the potential income-tax free returns and relative efficiencies in terms of labour inputs when compared to other enterprises.</p><p>FIVE cannot account for uncertainties such as potential subsidies that agricultural and forestry land will attract in the future or what new values may emerge for the services produced by agricultural and forestry land uses.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">FURTHER INFORMATION</emphasis></h><p>The forest options considered here clearly have many benefits but it is important that farmers and landowners are fully aware of all implications in advance of informed decision making. Teagasc provides comprehensive supports and the best information available to help inform good decision-making while supporting landowners in meeting their objectives. Teagasc will be running a nationwide series of forest walks in April, looking at different forest types and what they can deliver for both the landowners &amp; society, Check out the event page on <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.teagasc.ie/forestry\">www.teagasc.ie/forestry</url> for further details later this month or contact your local Teagasc forestry advisor.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A TECHNICAL APPROVAL</emphasis>:</h><p>Applicants who hold a valid technical approval for Afforestation or Forest Roads on 31 December 2022, but have not commenced work, and do not wish to wait until the launch of the finalised Forestry Programme 2023-2027 may wish to consider an Interim Afforestation Scheme (via General De Minimis) or an Interim Forest Road Scheme (via General De Minimis), as appropriate, which offer new funding rates (See Table 1 for Interim Afforestation Scheme rates).

We crack open wet soil, slot the roots of a small birch tree into the gap and firm it in. The blessings of Mother Earth on you, little tree. The birch is a bare slip of a thing barely anchored in the ground. One down, 23,999 to go.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">I m in a field in Roscommon and this is the hardest work I have ever done. We straighten aching backs and squint to make out the rows of brown saplings bent by the wind in this rain-streaked place. It s one of many  how the heck did we get here?  moments.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These fields were the cheapest land my husband Liam and I could find nearly three years ago when the idea came to us to try to grow a native woodland. After a 10-year stint as restaurant critic for The Irish Times, I took a midlife swerve into the woods back in 2020 when my focus switched from food to forests. As a version of the proverb goes: the best time to plant a forest was 20 years ago. The second best time (and maybe our last chance) is now.</p><p>The search for land was an education and we nearly gave up. In a Father Ted moment, there was one farm owned by two priests. One wanted to sell, the other didn t. Then there was the genial gentleman who wanted a chunk paid off the books so the bank wouldn t discover the real price. We declined. In the end we found these fields scattered across three different areas, close to a train station. They made a sort of sense.</p><p>We are both urban culchies. When I was eight my family moved from a suburban bungalow to a house with a few acres on a hill. Over the years there were cattle, a couple of pigs, a field of raspberries, potatoes. I stood in gaps and longed for smooth flat asphalt and roller-skating. Liam grew up not far from Roscommon, where rushes are called rishes and horseflies that can bite through denim are clegs. Both of us ran to cities and met in a busy newsroom as far from fields as we could get. But in the shock of Covid came a yearning to circle back somewhere solid.</p><p>We are not born landowners, farmers, rewilders, ecosystem restorers. Feel free to pick your term. I ve only ever managed a postage stamp garden. He is a dab hand at killing plants. When we first met we had a running joke where we would make up the name of any bird we saw    Isn t that a chuffing spacklespot?    both of us entirely ignorant of their actual names. Now we have stewardship of roughly 40 acres, home at various stages to a cuckoo, countless frogs and field mice, several hares, foxes and a chorus of birds, mewling buzzards, murmurations of starlings, and a thrillingly glimpsed barn owl, more of which later.</p><p>We are building a forest. In this we are working with forester Bernard Kiernan. We first rang him three years ago and he surveyed prospective land for us, planned and calculated and pushed the mountain of paperwork through the pipeline to get us here. On the morning of the winter solstice last December the brown envelope arrived, thick with folded planting licence documents. Every woodland over a certain size needs to be licensed by the Department of Agriculture and some licences have taken years. We were thrilled.</p><p>The soil here is gley, a word as claggy and airless as the ground it describes. This gley can snap a spade handle like a toothpick. Some fields have a loose peaty layer that turns to mud pie in the wet. Grass will grow, but rushes grow better. Chest-high in summer with flag irises spearing up through the throng. This year brought forests of nettles and bramble stems thick as your thumb. In winter the heavy kind of frost, that only happens this far inland, furs everything white, mulching the green back to yellow. As rented land, the fields were grazed until recently by beef cattle. The animals sank into the mud, leaving the ground potholed. Ankles can be wrenched, and wellies lost. Misjudge a hummock and you have to be pulled out with a cartoon sucking sound. It feels like every easy calorie has been wrung out of the place. In all the days of tree planting, we don t encounter a single earthworm, just beetle grubs, like maggots in a corpse.</p><p> I had a fhaarm in Africa ...  a friend intones in her best Meryl Streep when I talk about our project over dinner. They call me Farmer Cleary in the WhatsApp chat afterwards. It is scrappy and messy and tentative and has woken me at 4am more than once, but we are building a full-size forest.</p><p>For the last three years, my day job has been building pocket versions since my brilliant friend Ashe Conrad-Jones showed me an article about Tiny Forests. Together we set up our version, Pocket Forests, to bring native trees and shrubs to urban areas where nature was barely getting a look in. I have loved this work more than anything. Trees make me happy, and calm my climate anxiety, and it has been a joy to bring communities of people together to make space for nature.</p><p>For a large part of those three busy Pocket Forest pioneering years, the Roscommon forest-in-waiting has been there in the background. On quiet visits I try to get to know some of the fields, turning over the daunting notion of  owning  something as ancient and other as land criss-crossed with hedgerows of hawthorn, blackthorn, birch, willow and elder towered over by ash trees, which are hammered by ash dieback.</p><p>The hedgerows are linear forests, stems and branches furred with moss, lichen and tiny ferns. Primroses pop up in spring, mushrooms in later months. In one low-lying area, just glimpsed bulrushes mark ground too wet for woman or beast, so birches and willows have gleefully claimed it for themselves.</p><p>These  scrub  areas were long the bane of farmers  lives, outlined in red on their site maps to be taken out of their farm payment as  unproductive . Good farming meant clearing, draining, spraying and fertilising scrub areas to turn them into pasture. But that dial has shifted and we realise how urgently we need what these habitats produce: space for nature, healthier soil and a much needed way to draw carbon dioxide out of our overheating world and absorb and weather our weather extremes.</p><p>We are planting more than 27 of the 40 acres, just over 11 hectares.  What size is that compared to, say, Stephen s Green?  a friend asks. As it turns out, St Stephen s Green is 22 acres (it was originally exactly 27 acres when first marked out as a park in 1663). So we are planting a forest bigger than St Stephen s Green. The remaining 13 acres will be let do their thing, habitat for the frogs and birds that love water, rushes and long grass.</p><p>The first batch of trees arrives on my birthday at the end of March, more than 13,000 bare-root trees in bags, the load small enough to fit in a single white van. Matt from Hometree takes a breather after we unload them, looking out over the raggedy fields.  This land is lucky,  he says, because we are not here to take from it. We feel lucky to be able to do this.</p><p>Generosity is all around us. Neighbours have been kind and welcoming. No one seems bothered by the idea that we re turning (or returning) these fields to forest.  Not sitka,  is the first thing I tell everyone when we talk to them. It ll be native trees.  Sure the land s not good for much else,  has been the response from more than one neighbour.</p><p>The planting is a white-knuckle stressor by the end. The clock ticks. The dormant trees can last a short time in their bags, but there s been a wait for the contractors, the fencer and field excavator and the team of planters.</p><p>When the excavator arrives I take a selfie with the huge beast of a machine, excited as a nine-year-old. Mark, the driver, moves methodically through each field, lifting and dropping a bucket-sized sod at regular spacing, one for each tree, with a clanking sound as the metal bucket scrapes on boulders laid down by glaciers. They fence as they go. The machine makes manageable work of this.</p><p>But the planting has to be done by hand, and boot and spade. And there s no sign of the planting contractors. Family rallies around. Easter weekend is late in the chilly spring and we barbecue and blather on about meitheals to the English cousins.</p><p>Leaning on a spade, I look up as Liam, our son, my cousin and her partner plant in lines, carrying fistfuls of trees. We are peasants in a 19th century French oil painting, in better rain gear. Cars slow to see people bent over lines in these rushy fields. In the end our meitheals are not enough. With Bernard s help we manage around 6,000 trees, but the rest look like they might die in their bags. It s nearly May and they are leafing up, making one last push to live. The professional planters arrive just in time.</p><p>Seven men travel in a van from their base in the southeast. In just a few hours they plant roughly 18,000 trees. They have lighter spades and a strength and skill that makes the work look almost easy. Stamp on the spade, bend with the tree, final stomp to seal the roots. Three precise moves at a rhythmic fast pace. Their skill and speed is phenomenal. It s what happens when you re paid per tree: the faster the better. It takes roughly four seconds to plant an oak, a tree that may grow for centuries. I am beyond grateful to them.</p><p>The costs of the ground preparation and fencing, the trees, the labour to plant them and their management in the first growing seasons are covered by the Government establishment grant. Three quarters of this grant is paid once the forest is planted and our tree costs are reimbursed. Some forestry companies can cover all these costs for the landowner so they have nothing to pay upfront.</p><p>By the end we have sourced and planted roughly 24,000 native trees: birch, scots pine, hazel, willow, alder, crab apple and sessile and pedunculate oaks. This winter we hope to add more species: wild cherry, rowan, black poplar, aspen, whitebeam, spindle, guelder rose and holly. The hedgerow trees already here will seed themselves through the mix.</p><p>When spring arrives with a clamour of birdsong, there is a sense of peace as the land recovers from our assault. And just like that our tentative start begins to flourish. Scots pines come back from the dead, throwing up the brightest, greenest new growth in the hot June sunshine. It s been some year: the driest February, the wettest March, the hottest June, the wettest July has put farming on a knife-edge. But these are conditions our trees welcome with open branches, turning warmth, light and water into growing wood and palm-sized leaves, mini solar panels soaking up the sun when the clouds part and it glitters from a washed blue sky. The thin wands of birches throw out leafy side branches like feather dusters, racing the rushes to get to the light.</p><p>The magic never gets old. One- and two- year-old trees planted in winter look like dead sticks, but plug them into the ground and a lifeforce pulses through them. A key meets a lock and things open with a flow that is heartening. There is a rightness to the combination of young dormant tree and old dormant ground. Sligo beef farmer Clive Bright put it brilliantly recently, describing a visit to a rocky Galway farm of gorse and bracken where the land  was just itching to be forest .</p><p>Yet the system we are doing this in is in a mess. There is a shortage of labour, Irish- grown trees and people who have land willing to take the leap. We are among a handful of landowners to plant trees this season as farmers and foresters wait for the new Forestry Programme to be approved by the European Commission. This is announced as I write. The EUR 1.3 billion programme will see payments up more than 60 per cent for the kind of forest we have planted. Assuming it grows well every year for 15 years (20 for farmers), a forest like ours will receive a per hectare payment of EUR 1,103 a year. The scheme will reward woman-made forests, rather than a  fence and leave  approach allowing land to forest itself.</p><p>But there is also a payment for areas of  emerging woodland  of EUR 350 a hectare. Central Statistics Office figures from 2020 show that the average annual farming income in Roscommon is EUR 12,000. Even on a small farm, farmers can make as much from the ecosystem and carbon services of native woodland with less work, less methane emissions, less pollution of our waterways. Farmers qualify for 20 years of grants. Landowners like us get 15 years of annual payments. My husband and I don t qualify as farmers. We need proof that the bulk of our income comes from farming or a herd number, and three sons don t, as yet, qualify for herd status.</p><p>Now, every time we visit there is something new to see, another surge of growth, more nettles to trample. They (like the clegs) also sting through denim. We camp in warmer weather and see bats flit across the sky. Sitting with my son at the camp fire, I look left and catch a glimpse of a large brown wing, flying sideways close to the ground, a barn owl hunting for the field mice that live in the grass.</p><p>I remember childhood adventures playing in a stream in a leggy hedgerow my brothers and I christened the Zambezi river. Walking through the grass and rushes with a cloud of tiny moths rising around me, it smells like a lost past. I remember the girl I was, who loved James Herriot books and wanted to work outdoors with animals. This project has cracked open endless wonder, seeing the world in technicolour. There are huge orange dragon flies like flying cinnamon sticks, tiny mushrooms sprouting from sods that the digger upturned, common spotted orchids with their purple and white flowers like massed wings of beautiful insects. This  marginal  spent land is home to so much already.</p><p>The future for the forest will be to manage it as a forever resource. We are growing it for biodiversity and as a carbon sink. We can also manage it for timber, thinning out the trees in five to seven years  time under continuous cover, a way of harvesting timber without cutting down the whole forest, or clearfelling as has been the standard practice with conifer plantations. Forester Bernard Kiernan will be our expert guide.</p><p>According to the carbon calculators, our trees should begin to sequester significant amounts of carbon in about a decade. Depending on how they grow and how the soil life grows with them, our 11 or so hectares could remove 120 tonnes of carbon a year. It s a drop in our emissions ocean (Irish per capita emissions are 12 tonnes a year). But with the national target of 8,000 hectares to be reforested every year, we can see how land use can play a huge role in our climate ambitions.</p><p>For that to happen, forestry needs to become as sexy a job as cheffing, something both women and men see as a tough but desirable and satisfying career. We need to give it the status it deserves as an important tool for our survival. Farmers and landowners need to see potential for trees to help them do what they do. So it doesn t feel like losing land to trees but gaining all the benefits, beauty and health they bring, along with a new system of payments for ecosystem services once the 15 or 20 years of forestry payments finish.</p><p>Healthy diverse forests are the critical infrastructure of our future, the only kind of infrastructure that grows stronger and more effective the older it gets.</p><p>I love our knee-high trees, but there are a few that are most beloved. Towards the end of the planting, my parents visit and my mum plants a tiny oak, my dad surrounds it with small hazel whips. Oaks take their time to leaf up. She hasn t been well, but she s on the mend. On my last visit, the small stick she planted has pushed out leaves. These new baby oak leaves have a silken texture like the softest skin. Here is hope, the quiet beginning of a story which will continue to strengthen and unfold beyond us.</p><p>And the person I married who is many things but not a plant person? Just recently I overheard him talking to a tree, in the same encouraging tone I regularly use with my beloved baby trees (think Moira Rose from Schitt s Creek). In this respect alone, my work here is done. When they are big enough we will hug them. For now we talk to them, praise them to the skies and hope to see them thrive. l </p><p>It has been a joy to bring communities of people together  to make space for nature</p><h>How to build a forest </h><p>1. Find a registered forester in your area. 2. Ask them to visit the land to assess it for potential as a woodland. Not everywhere is suitable for woodland. In areas of special habitat, what is already there may be doing a better job for climate and biodiversity than any forest can. 3. If the land is suitable, the forester will apply for the licence on your behalf. You will sign lots of paperwork. 4. If the licence is granted, you can work with the forester to plant part or all of it yourself, or they will source and plant it for you.  The establishment costs of fencing, trees and planting are covered by a grant from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. You can plant a number of forest types. If your interest is climate and biodiversity, one of the best options is continuous cover native woodlands. If you want to farm the land, plant agroforestry, wide-spaced protected trees which will improve soil, provide habitat for wildlife, shelter and potential fodder for farm animals and create a beautiful biodiverse farm. 5.

Somewhere on the path outside the glade someone laughed loudly, and the sound carried through the trees. The squirrel leaped on to a feathery birch branch that looked barely strong enough to take his weight before bouncing to a higher, safer place. </p><p>Our lives are full of doing, especially in the run-up to Christmas.

The Japanese concept is based on reconnecting with the natural world to get powerful health benefits. Our stress hormone drops when we spend time in forests.

The scientists put the findings down to diet, proximity to the sea and the abundance of Mediterranean plants emitting immune system-boosting and antiviral compounds. </p><p>Federico encouraged us to smell things, to pick up handfuls of leaves and, if it was safe, to taste things we found, and then he sent us off to explore alone.

The aim was to put forestry on a commercial footing, responding to criticism that it was not suitably market-oriented.</p><p>From its outset, Coillte sought to make forestry profitable, not just for small farmers but for institutional investors such as pension funds.</p><p>Bord na M\u00f3na overexpanded in the 1970s in response to the oil crisis and found itself under financial pressure in the 1980s. In response, Eddie O'Connor was installed as chief executive director in 1987, with the intention of making the peat industry more competitive.</p><p>O'Connor's measures, which included cutting the workforce by 50%, could not halt the decline of the industry, which also faced early pressures of society-wide decarbonisation efforts.</p><p>From the 1990s, Coillte and Bord na M\u00f3na entered an era of EU-led economic liberalisation and competition, bringing with them huge land banks that had been acquired during a period of state-led national development.</p><p>Over the past decade both Coillte and Bord na M\u00f3na have rebranded themselves as green companies, advertising 'land solutions' and 'climate solutions' respectively to address climate change and biodiversity loss.</p><p>The 'green' conversion of these two semi-states is significant as both have historically been associated with environmentally damaging extractive activities. But, while the rebranding appears to break with the past, what hasn't changed is a commercial requirement to make new activities profitable.</p><p>Coillte's forest assets, as they refer to them, are no longer just about the value of timber, but the value of atmospheric carbon stored by trees.</p><p>Creating new forestry has thus become a cornerstone of EU and Irish climate strategy. The target of 17% tree cover by 2030 (from 12% today) is key to explaining the Gresham House investment - private finance is seen as the quickest way to meet EU climate commitments, and investment funds are keen to invest in 'sustainable' projects.</p><p>As well as investment funds, Coillte has also partnered with multinational companies; in 2015 it sold an Athenry woodland to Apple for (now aborted) construction of an  85m data centre.</p><p>Coillte has also developed several wind farms on its land and in 2021 partnered with ESB as FuturEnergy to expand their wind holdings.</p><p>Bord na M\u00f3na is delivering 'climate solutions' on its land bank primarily through the development of alternative energy.

As Indian vultures declined, the number of rabies cases rose</emphasis></h><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In the early 1990s, vultures across India started dying inexplicably. Long-billed, slender-billed and oriental white-backed vultures declined to the brink of extinction, with the number of India's most common three vulture species falling by more than 97% between 1992 and 2007. Six other species were in sharp decline too. Scientists started testing the dead birds and worked out they had been exposed to Diclofenac, an anti-inflammatory drug routinely given to cattle in south Asia at the time. The vultures fed on the carcasses of cows and were poisoned.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That began a far-reaching chain reaction. As vulture populations crashed, cow carcasses started to pile up, and the numbers of rats and wild dogs surged. Dogs became the main scavengers at dumps previously used by vultures. Data suggests that from 1992 to 2003, dogs increased by 7m. The number of dog bites soared and rabies infections shot up, causing tens of thousands of people to die each year. In 2006, Diclo-fenac was banned, and vulture populations have slowly started to recover.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">2. Sparrow slaughter in China sparked insect plagues</emphasis></h><p>In the late 1950s, China's leader, Mao Zedong, wanted to rapidly industrialise the country through the Great Leap Forward. That involved the \"four pests campaign\", targeting mosquitoes, rats, flies - and sparrows. He ordered all the China's sparrows to be killed because he thought they were feeding on rice and grains, reducing the amount available for people. Citizens were told to shoot the birds, tear down their nests, smash their eggs, and bang pots so they would be scared into the sky and fall to their deaths, exhausted. Sparrows were nearly driven to extinction in China.</p><p>What Mao's officials didn't realise is sparrows rely on grains for only a small part of their diet: The bulk of it comprises insects. After the mass killing, there was an eruption of insect pests which destroyed the country's crops.</p><p>\"This ecological catastrophe coupled with a multi-year drought and disastrous agricultural policies led to one of the most devastating famines in history. It is estimated that about 45m people died,\" says Prof Marc Cadotte, ecologist at the University of Toronto.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">3. Deadly frog fungus caused malaria spike</emphasis></h><p>A deadly chytrid fungus called Batra-chochytrium dendrobatidis ripped through Panama and Costa Rica from the 1980s to the mid-1990s, leading to the extinction of dozens of species of amphibians, some scientists putting the number at 90. It was described as \"the greatest loss of biodiversity attributable to a disease\", but most people would have been unaware of the tragedy.</p><p>After the deaths, there was an eight-year spike in malaria cases in Central America, as mosquitoes thrived, probably because there were no frogs, salamanders, and other amphibians to prey on their eggs, researchers reported recently. At its peak there was a fivefold increase in malaria cases.</p><p>\"If we allow massive ecosystem disruptions to happen, it can substantially impact human health in ways that are difficult to predict ahead of time and hard to control once they're under way,\" says Michael Springborn, University of California, Davis.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">4. Mangrove loss made the Asian tsunami worse</emphasis></h><p>In 2004, an Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami killed more than 230,000 people. The countries worst hit were Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India, and Thailand, all of which had experienced significant declines in mangrove cover, according to a report by the Environmental Justice Foundation.</p><p>From 1980 to 2000, the area covered by mangroves in these countries fell by 28%. In places where the trees had been destroyed, the waves penetrated further inland, killing more people and aggravating the destruction of homes and livelihoods. The \"mangrove forests played a crucial role in saving human lives and property\", the report said.</p><p>Mangroves absorb impact of waves and rising sea levels by their large root systems, which dissipate energy.</p><p>\"Conserving and restoring coastal mangrove areas is essential if coastal communities are to recover and be protected from similar events,\" the report concluded.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">5. As bees disappear, fruit trees in China are hand-pollinated</emphasis></h><p>In Sichuan province, south-west China, the widespread use of pesticides alongside habitat destruction means that farmers have to carry pots of pollen to pollinate pear and apple trees themselves, according to Dave Goulson, professor of biology, University of Sussex. This means using a paintbrush attached to a long bamboo pole to dab inside each flower. About 30% of China's pear trees are artificially pollinated, according to one study.</p><p>Pollinating insects are vital to human food security - three-quarters of crops depend on them. They are also crucial to other wildlife, as a source of food and pollinators of wild plants. But a lack of wild pollinators is affecting food production around the world. In the US, researchers studied seven crops grown in 13 states and found five showed evidence that a lack of bees is affecting the amount of food grown, including apples, blueberries and cherries.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">6. Losing coral reefs leaves coastal properties unprotected</emphasis></h><p>Like mangroves, coral reefs are a natu ral barrier to waves and storms. Because of their hard, jagged formations they can protect coastal communities and reduce the threat of erosion. They make it more likely for waves to break off-shore, reducing wave energy by an average of 97% by the time they hit land. It is estimated that nearly 200m people in coastal areas around the world depend on the protection of coral reefs.</p><p>Research shows, in the US they provide more than $ 1.8bn annually in flood protection benefits. However, developments such as marinas and docks, as well as pollution, damage these reefs. The corals are also being destroyed by rising temperatures, which lead to mass bleaching. Research suggests that virtually all corals on the planet will suffer from severe bleaching if global temperatures rise by 1.5C.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">7.

Included is a new cohort of Organic Accelerator Advisers to build farmer confidence and skills.</p><p>There has been research progress, for example, Teagasc examined potential food residues such as traces in milk from new, lower-emitting fertiliser formulations, and the results allow the industry to have confidence in widespread use of these new fertilisers such as protected urea, which are needed to reduce emissions.</p><p>At 37.1% of national emissions (not including the Land Use, Land-use Change and Forestry sector), agriculture is the largest emitting sector, and its emissions increased by 10% from 2015 to 2020, largely related to the abolition of milk quotas and related increase in dairy cow numbers.</p><p>Enteric fermentation in cattle and sheep caused 57.5% of agriculture emissions, soil emissions 26.8%, manure management 10.3%, and the remainder, 5.4%, came from fuel, application of lime for soil fertility, and urea.</p><p>Therefore, ruminants (the enteric and manure sources) were the source of 68% of Irish emissions, with enteric alone the source of 19%.</p><p>This is why diversification, breeding, feed management, animal health, low emission slurry spreading, earlier slaughter, and other ways to reduce enteric and manure emissions are seen as the areas of highest greenhouse gas abatement potential.</p><p>In the first Climate Plan 2021 progress report, a completion rate of 73% of 2021-22 actions is reported overall.</p><p>But the report details several measures that were not delivered on time, which are expected to be completed early this year.</p><p>As for LULUCF (the Land Use, Landuse Change and Forestry sector), it is described as an increasingly challenging emissions source. It has significant potential to absorb carbon, through sequestration in trees, wet boglands, and harvested wood. But declining forest area, drainage of peat soils for farming, and peatland drainage, have made LULUCF a net source of emissions since 1990, and corrective action is needed.</p><p>Therefore, increasing afforestation is a key objective in the climate plan, along with better grassland management on organic soils, and restoring and rewetting peatlands that were drained for farming or peat extraction.</p><p>The Peatlands Restoration Programme is in place, having worked on eight protected raised bogs in 2021, totalling 620 hectares. Restoration will continue in 2022. In the Enhanced Decommissioning, Rehabilitation and Restoration Scheme for Bord Na M\u00f3na peatlands, works have commenced on 18 bogs, with 5,196 hectares rehabilitated.</p><p>Efforts to increase landowner participation will be central to the design of the DAFM's next Forestry Programme. While participation in some schemes has increased, afforestation applications reduced from 528 (4,341ha) in 2020 to 502 (4,245ha) in 2021.</p><p>Integrated land use planning for appropriate afforestation that includes rewetting and habitat restoration is important, to prevent any rebound emissions or environmental effects from planting on organic soils.</p>", "publisher": "Irish Examiner", "instances": ["The average finishing age of prime beef must be reduced from 27 to 24 months by 2030.
