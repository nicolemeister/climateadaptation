States' obligations to address climate change are not just confined to their commitments under the 2015 Paris Agreement, but encompass a broad range of international law principles, treaties, and norms that must be taken into account to address the urgent threat posed by climate change.</p><p>In particular, the court set out that states must take climate measures which reflect their \"highest possible ambition\", in accordance with the best available climate science and other considerations like intergenerational equity. This places the interests of young people - those who will inherit the consequences of today's inaction - at the very core of climate governance.</p><p>The court's opinion also affirmed the interdependence of environmental protection and human rights, stating that the right to a healthy environment is foundational to the enjoyment of all other rights. This reflects what young climate activists have long insisted: That climate inaction violates fundamental rights, deepens global inequalities, and exposes vulnerable communities to escalating hardship, displacement, and injustice.</p><p>Moreover, the court's treatment of the international environmental law principle that states should refrain from acts of transboundary harm to the environment has profound implications for climate action. The court made clear that a state's failure to fulfil its climate-related legal obligations may amount to an \"internationally wrongful act,\" triggering international responsibility and potential consequences for that state. Crucially, it affirmed that inadequate action to curb greenhouse gas emissions, including continued fossil fuel production, consumption, licensing, and subsidies, may all contribute to such violations. This conclusion resonates strongly with the demands of youth activists, who have persistently highlighted that fossil fuel dependence is not just an environmental hazard, but a violation of international law, and that a fair transition is a legal and ethical imperative to prevent further harm to vulnerable communities.</p><p>As the court itself noted, law is only one part of the response needed to address the climate crisis. The advisory opinion is non-binding, but, importantly, we now have clear confirmation of states' obligations to address the \"existential problem of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life and the very health of our planet\".</p><p>These obligations are not just words, they are an expression of the moral, political, and legal imperative to protect the only home we have. They add to the global call to deliver justice for communities harmed by activities which have polluted our air, endangered our health, and destroyed lives across the globe, particularly in the Global South and in vulnerable and marginalised communities.</p><p>Just as young people drove the effort to clarify states' obligations, young people can now create further change in their communities and hold states accountable to these obligations. States and decision-makers at every level must implement calls for justice from marginalised communities, particularly those in the Global South who achieved this success. This moment must mark a turning point from legal clarification to real, enforceable action. The law is clear. Youth made it clear.

Across the country, the fodder was all but gone and the cows were still in the sheds, the ground untrafficable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A man from Mayo called in desperation, looking for any hope of a settling down of the weather. I wasn't able to give it to him, but I was able to listen to him.</p><p>He had a small farm. His cows were about to start calving in the sheds, and he cried as he described the distress this caused his herd.</p><p>As I write, close to 20 years on, I can feel the tears welling in my eyes as I remember his grief.

There was no plan for retraining or alternative work. It was just a sword through the workforce.</p><p>This interview came on the same day as climate scientists criticised a proposal for taking a \"temperature neutrality\" approach to climate change. This is favoured by the Department of Agriculture here, and in other countries that export livestock, such as New Zealand.</p><p>\"Temperature neutrality\" in effect means that each country would keep their contribution to global warming stable, rather than aiming for the more onerous target of \"net zero\" emissions. In Ireland, this would allow us to offset methane emissions from our strong agricultural sector with a reduction in CO2 from burning fossil fuels, for example.</p><p>This is why countries with large livestock exports might favour this idea - but also why climate justice activists might oppose it. Developing countries would be at a disadvantage trying to get into the food production business to feed their own people.</p><p>In our house, this started a conversation about blame and deflection.</p><p>Deflection has really come into the public arena in recent times, mostly because we are seeing it being done so badly that it would be almost comical - if it weren't so unfunny.</p><p>The magician's call to \"look over here\" while they deceive you right under your nose has become the tradecraft of almost every politician operating today.</p><p>My husband stated with clear, calm fact that farmers were the biggest polluters in the Netherlands. Certainly they are vilified there for protests such as closing the motorways with their tractors.</p><p>In fairness, the Netherlands is doing well on the energy front, with up to half the country powered by renewable energy, and they have one nuclear reactor, too. But they are home to the busiest port in Europe at Rotterdam, to one of the biggest airports at Schiphol in Amsterdam, and let's not forget those eight-lane motorways that the farmers blocked with their tractors. The Netherlands is home to some of the biggest names in oil and gas - but if we're busy hating the farmers, we're not paying as much attention to what the fossil fuel industry is up to. Certainly not as much attention as we should.</p><p>When you try to find the dollar amount spent globally on subsidies to \"Big Oil\", along with the benefits from tax exemptions, the figures are mind-boggling. Tracking down the sums is nearly impossible: $10bn here, $52bn there, $760bn in \"total externalities\", whatever that is... Whatever it amounts to, we're seeing companies with so much profit it's hard to remember how many zeros are involved in taking money from taxpayers for the privilege of finding more ways to release more carbon from beneath the earth and send it into the atmosphere.</p><p>These same companies can then do their greenwashing, reporting on the millions they have invested in renewable alternatives. Billions for oil, millions for renewables.</p><p>It is true that intensive farming is a huge polluter in the Netherlands, staining the local environment with waste while using up vast amounts of power and water. But if you follow the money, it's quickly evident most of the profits from these industries go to multinational companies, not to the guys getting their hands dirty. Food production only accounts for 11pc of the overall take, with post-production - such as processing, transport and retail - hoovering up the rest.</p><p>The industrialisation of farming in this country has the potential to be an increasing blot on our landscape, too. It will cause repercussions on the climate and then the weather. Even so, I still side with the guy in the field, doing the work needed to be done to feed me.</p><p>Food prices do not reflect the cost of food production. After World War II, many populations across Europe faced starvation while countries struggled to get back on their feet.

Petrol and diesel cars are often the only option in rural areas that are not served well by public transport and for people with disabilities or caring roles. If clean technologies are prohibitively expensive and grants are targeted at those with higher incomes, the people who often need them the most cannot benefit from them.</p><p>Socially just climate action also means delivering energy policies that support those who struggle the most with rising energy costs. This should ideally mean locally-owned renewable energy resources that deliver tangible benefits directly to the communities that host them.</p><p>In Ireland, the idea that women will be affected more than men by the climate crisis may not be obvious at first. We live in a country that claims to support equality for women. However, the reality is that women are, on average, poorer than men. They therefore have fewer resources to counter the impact of the crisis and invest in alternative, more sustainable products and solutions. Almost half of lone parents - mostly women - live in deprivation and private rented accommodation, struggling to pay rising energy costs and without access to retrofitting schemes.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Unequal impacts</emphasis></h><p>Sunshine is always welcome, however highest temperature records for April were broken at 17 weather stations across Ireland - a further sign that Ireland is not immune to the phenomenon of global heating. In fact, 2024 was the first year that the Earth crossed the 1.5\u00b0C global warming threshold. Storm \u00c9owyn and recent foods are a stark reminder of Ireland's vulnerabilities. Across Europe, heatwaves, droughts, wildfires and fooding are putting a strain on people's health, livelihoods and public infrastructure.</p><p>While Ireland's average temperatures have increased in line with climate models, we don't particularly notice the slow creep of global heating ourselves, especially during summers when it seems like the sun barely shines at all. Yet subtle changes in the climate system will likely lead to more dramatic consequences over time: more extreme rainfall, more drought, more fooding. The 2023 synthesis report of the Irish Climate Change Assessment notes that, for Ireland, the consequences of global heating are likely to be profound, with more extreme weather events likely to become more frequent and more intense.</p><p>But what we often fail to recognise is the way that climate change - along with policies designed to manage and prevent climate change - often has unequal impacts. While extreme weather and policy measures will affect everyone, whether directly or indirectly, some people and communities are much more vulnerable than others.</p><p>Many other social groups are challenged by climate action policies because of their identities, for example the Traveller community, migrants or people who are dependent on jobs and sectors that are carbon intensive. We need to carefully design climate policies and investments to ensure we are responding to the needs of communities on the ground, and not to just seek the least-cost emission reductions. As a first step, the Government should collect detailed data on gender, disability and ethnicity to aid in gender, poverty and equality-proofing climate policies. It is also vital that the voices of marginalised communities are heard in climate policy decision-making.</p><p>Care work is another example of how climate and gender intersect. Most care work is carried out by women and this changes the way energy and transport services are used. A 2020 Transport Infrastructure Ireland study called 'Travelling in a Woman's Shoes' found that women rely heavily on cars to carry out caring journeys, with 95% of women outside of Dublin and 79% of women inside Dublin seeing cars as necessities. Sustainable mobility for all means putting the needs of people with disabilities and children first in the planning process and ensuring that public transport is both safe and accessible, with timetables that cater to a variety of needs beyond the typical work-home commute.</p><p>By failing to consider the lived reality of women, current climate policies are making the lives of many harder. Climate action that is only available to those who own their own homes, or who can afford to purchase an electric vehicle is more like business-as-usual than the transformation towards sustainability and equality we need.

We re talking about her work/life imbalance, the juggling of domestic and professional responsibilities that has her absurdly multitasking, barely pulling it off, always failing someone or something, always guilty.

The answer is that adequate childcare should be available and affordable.)</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Something sustainable is literally something that can be held up, from the Latin  tenere  as in  tenacious .

Harvesting peat is the obvious local example but others would include losing weight, overwork and lack of rest.</p><p>We re used to sustainability as a buzzword around care for the environment, and often such terms feel reproachful, as if we re being told off for using too much, taking more than our share.

It doesn t have to be that way.</p><p>I ve always thought it s deeply unfair to position new parents like my friend at the sharp end of green scolding.

Maybe let s inconvenience some oligarchs before we come for the exhausted mothers, and while we re at it provide a subsidised laundering service for cloth nappies.</p><p>Human energies also need care, which is not in opposition to but part of care for human environments. Much of our excessive consumption comes from various kinds of scarcity: time, affordable fresh food, active transport infrastructure and reliable public transport. Some people are obviously making active choices to prioritise their own egos and individual power over everyone else s health and safety (SUV drivers, I mean you), but most of us are muddling through in environments engineered to create scarcity and to direct us to solve this engineered scarcity by unsustainable consumption.</p><p> For most of us, the necessary changes must be collective and corporate. Only the well-resourced can consistently resist powerful systems as individuals. I can cycle everywhere because I live within 10km of most of the places I need or want to go, because I have a high degree of control over my own time and the immeasurable blessing of physical health. In this situation, the choice to cycle enhances and does not deplete my life. It is (most days) more of a joy than a sacrifice.

Climate catastrophe is no longer a distant threat, it is our present reality. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It is manifesting as a litany of disasters from destructive wildfires reducing homes and forests to ash, to devastating storms and floods washing away livelihoods and claiming lives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It s easy to understand the desperation for quick-fix solutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Carbon market mechanisms have long been the favourite climate  solution  among parts of the private sector in the Global North, and some governments. This is where countries or companies buy  carbon credits  from countries or communities in the Global South to offset their emissions. It sounds appealing, and those in favour argue countries or companies unable to cut their emissions in the short term can fund climate action for those bearing the brunt of the crisis.</p><p>However, the reality of carbon markets falls short of this rosy picture.</p><p>Carbon market projects almost always fail to provide any real climate benefit. Worse, they have a long history of subjecting host communities to various abuses and human rights violations. They simply do not work. And even if they could provide some relief, the idea that the benefit would somehow make ongoing emissions elsewhere acceptable as the world careers towards nearly 3 degrees of warming is indefensible.</p><p>Multiple investigations have shown most carbon markets do not represent real emission reductions. A study into Verra, a leading crediting programme, found more than 90 per cent of its rainforest offsets were  phantom credits    in other words, worthless for the climate. </p><p>Another review by Corporate Accountability and the Guardian found 39 of the top 50 projects were probably  junk . A 2024 Nature Communications study, covering about a fifth of all issued credits, found that less than 16 per cent of those credits represented real reductions in emissions.</p><p>Even when carbon markets deliver the promised climate action, most of the time the buyer uses the credit for an offset. For example, a major oil company or petrostate might claim  net zero  progress by funding a tree-planting initiative in Kenya. But while a few thousand trees are planted in the Global South, oil drilling and fossil fuel expansion continue in the Global North. The emissions aren t reduced, they re just offset on paper. The climate still loses, but the polluter gets to look green.</p><h>Abuse and displacement</h><p/><h> Some climate action may be happening, but it is in the context of emissions being allowed elsewhere   just greenwashed to look acceptable.</h><p>While many projects claim they will bring benefits to a region, including jobs or other investments, they not only have a history of failing to deliver for communities, but also have a record of violence, displacement, abuse and other injustices.</p><p>A Carbon Brief investigation has found more than 100 documented cases of harm to host communities over the past five years. Communities are displaced from their land or lose access to forest in the name of stopping deforestation, though the local community is almost never the cause of the deforestation.</p><p>Recently published ActionAid USA research, Caution Required: Protecting Communities from Carbon Markets, focuses on Kenya, which has the largest and oldest carbon projects in Africa. Many of these illustrate the problems with exaggeration of emissions avoided, carbon sequestered and uncertainty of carbon credit value as well as risks to communities.</p><p>Of the 317 carbon projects registered with voluntary carbon markets in Kenya, most are small cookstoves or water-filtration projects. While they may offer health benefits, studies show these projects often exaggerate climate impact by overstating the uptake of cookstoves and water filters   and firewood saved. Private companies and organisations that implement these projects and purchase the credits typically benefit far more than the communities.</p><p>Most of Kenya s largest carbon projects involve attempts to alter land use and control. The largest carbon credit project is the Kasigau Wildlife Corridor Project, run by Wildlife Works, a company originating in the United States. The project claims to avoid carbon emissions by protecting against deforestation, but there are serious concerns over inflated emissions baselines, unfair revenue distribution and community marginalisation. </p><p>An investigation by the Kenyan Human Rights Commission and the Dutch organisation SOMO found there was a significant pattern of sexual harassment and abuse by senior Wildlife Works employees and rangers of local women, female employees and the wives of junior male workers.</p><p>Another big project, the Northern Kenya Grasslands Carbon Project, which covers nearly two million hectares, has been praised internationally despite serious human rights concerns.</p><p>The overall experience of projects in Kenya was that they lacked legitimate, informed and prior consultation with affected communities. They were not consistently established with regard to community land rights laws and UN land tenure guidelines. Additionally,  middlemen  and technical consultants took much of the economic benefit before it reached communities.</p><p>Unfortunately, this dismal record in the Global South has not deterred interest in carbon markets or carbon credits. Buyers   typically corporations or governments under pressure to reduce emissions   are generally looking to purchase credits for carbon offsets. On the other hand, sellers   often poorer Global South governments or local communities   are generally not motivated by supposed climate benefits, but rather by the need for revenue.</p><p>Most experts agree the world will cross the 1.5-degree threshold. There is no longer enough time to decarbonise and reduce emissions before crossing the line. Every fraction of a degree of warming worsens impacts, increases devastation, and risks tipping points that collapse ecosystems and drive more climate change. Current policies put the world on track for a near three-degree rise, which would be catastrophic. Yet instead of urgent systemic change, carbon offsets offer a false solution, letting polluters claim progress without cutting emissions at source. </p><h>Calling for an end to off-sets</h><p/><h> Carbon markets persist due to the failure to date to provide adequate and quality climate finance, a key pillar of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement. Far too little money is flowing.</h><p>Developed countries promised $100 billion a year in climate finance by 2020 as a good-faith downpayment on what everyone acknowledged was a far greater need. That money was not only late, but what was provided was overwhelmingly in the form of loans, further ratcheting up debt, and double-counted development assistance.</p><p>When setting the new climate finance target at Cop29 in Baku, developed countries refused to engage in a real discussion of the scale of the need for climate finance or have a conversation about the quality of that finance. The resulting goal was a profound disappointment, with vague references to blended finance and more ambition through the private sector. This has deeply strained climate negotiations.</p><p>ActionAid is calling for an end to offsets as a climate strategy. Carbon markets are not climate finance and do not lessen the climate finance obligations of rich countries, responsible for 92 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. </p><p>Instead of false promises, we need real solutions: direct emissions cut at source, progressive taxation on polluters, public climate finance that supports just transitions, and investments in renewable energy and adaptation. Climate justice means putting people and the planet before profit.</p><p>Communities are being led towards carbon markets to make up for the lack of real climate finance, all while climate impacts are increasing and climate action is becoming more urgent. Therefore, carbon markets represent a policy failure and a moral failure. They present a profound risk to communities that require extreme caution.

This has deeply strained climate negotiations. ActionAid is calling for an end to offsets as a climate strategy. Carbon markets are not climate finance and do not lessen the climate finance obligations of rich countries, responsible for 92 per cent of carbon dioxide emissions. Instead of false promises, we need real solutions: direct emissions cut at source, progressive taxation on polluters, public climate finance that supports just transitions, and investments in renewable energy and adaptation. Climate justice means putting people and the planet before profit. Communities are being led towards carbon markets to make up for the lack of real climate finance, all while climate impacts are increasing and climate action is becoming more urgent. Therefore, carbon markets represent a policy failure and a moral failure. They present a profound risk to communities that require extreme caution.

A great party with a purpose. The Great Oven Disco Cantina is a new event at this year s All Together Now festival from July 31st to August 3rd at the Curraghmore Estate, Co Waterford, bringing together big names in food, music and art with a brilliant objective   to send a community oven to Palestine. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This new stage and tent will feature food from Tang restaurants, the sounds of Palestinian radio station Radio Alhara, sets from the global electronic music platform Mixmag and surprise Irish artists. Everyone is coming together to raise funds to support an initiative by the Great Oven to set up their first base in Palestine. </p><p>Founded by chef and TV producer James Gomez Thompson, the Great Oven is an organisation that builds giant, decorated community ovens in refugee camps, conflict zones and informal settlements. He first heard stories of community ovens as a child from his Spanish mother and grandmother. While filming a BBC series in Lebanon with Nigel Slater, he discovered similar ovens being used there. </p><p>Lebanese producer Nour Matraji shared stories of her grandmother baking bread in a community oven during the civil war, and the pair joined forces to create a community oven in Tripoli with peace-building in mind. It led to an epiphany, Gomez Thompson says,  that it shouldn t just be a thing for television, it should be an organisation that really exists . The Great Oven was born in 2019, starting in Lebanon.</p><p> It was the peak of the Syrian migrant crisis and then the Beirut port explosion. But we realised we could put ovens in refugee camps and use them for emergency disaster relief.  They wanted to offer an alternative to traditional food aid and handouts, which can be temporary and impersonal. </p><p> People need a place to cook for themselves, there s a simple dignity in the ritual of preparing your own food or sharing food,  says Gomez Thompson. </p><p>The ovens are built from steel and refractory bricks; they are generally made in the style of the country in which they are built; they have made a number of Lebanese-style Manakish ovens. They can weigh up to two tonnes, and run on gas.</p><p> A lot of people look at them and think you can just do bread, but we do everything in there. We tend to do lots of big shared tray bakes, we work with the food available. </p><p>Local artists are invited to decorate them.  The ovens become safe spaces around which culture starts flourishing too,  says Gomez Thompson.  People care more if they feel ownership.  The ovens become hubs for cooking, teaching, sharing and bringing people together. </p><p>So far, Great Oven has set up nine ovens in Lebanon and South Africa and is now expanding to Palestine, which is where one of the ovens from the Great Oven Disco Cantina at All Together Now will end up. The festival event is acting as a springboard and fundraiser for the Palestinian project, which aims to build a cultural bridge between Palestine and Ireland. </p><p>Gomez Thompson has been based in Ireland in recent years, where he says he has found a strong connection between his work and the country s outlook. He also has family connections here.  I m half Spanish, half Irish. I spent a considerable amount of my childhood here, so it s great that Ireland has become such a sanctuary for this project.  </p><p>The two decorated ovens, which are central to the Great Oven Disco Cantina event at All Together Now, have been decorated at the Irish Museum of Modern Art by Irish artists Maser and Aches. The food cooked in them at All Together Now will be from Tang, who are closing their Dublin restaurants for the weekend and sending their team to Waterford to run daily five-course banquets and an all-day barbecue. The menu has been created by Gomez Thompson and Tang chef Keith Coleman, featuring recipes from Great Oven refugee cooks. </p><p>And there will be plenty of dancing. Music has played a big role in the Great Oven s story   early on, they turned a damaged Beirut venue into a community kitchen with a dance floor, connecting with an online Palestinian station Radio Alhara. DJs from the station will play at Great Oven Disco Cantina across the weekend, and Mixmag (the UK online dance music magazine) will host Ireland s first Mixmag Lab set, which will be streamed globally.</p><p>Once the festival ends, the real journey begins and the ovens will be taken to their new homes. One will go to the Wonder Cabinet creative hub in the West Bank. The other will live at Bohemian Football Club in north Dublin where it will be central to a new programme of community events   a collaboration between Gomez Thompson and Se\u00e1n McCabe, Bohs  head of climate justice and sustainability   including dinners, pop-ups and possibly match day food, and involving local migrants and economically vulnerable people. </p><p> We want to bring everything we ve learnt in some of the hardest places in the world, and see how they can be applied here,  says Gomez Thompson.  We want to make it a safe space for people from different backgrounds to start cooking and dining together.

The momentous case opens the door for countries impacted by climate disasters to sue major emitting countries for reparations. Citizens could seek to hold governments to account for a failure to safeguard their human rights if their own or other countries fail to take adequate action to ensure a safe climate.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Here is what the court ruled - and the global ramifications likely to flow from it:</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Climate change breaches human rights</emphasis></h><p>The ICJ case was instigated by law students at the University of the South Pacific in Vanuatu in 2019.</p><p>They successfully launched a campaign for the court to examine two key issues: the obligations of countries to protect the climate from greenhouse gases, and the legal consequences for failing to do so.</p><p>The court found a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is essential for the enjoyment of many other human rights. As such, it found, the full enjoyment of human rights cannot be ensured without the protection of the climate system and other parts of the environment.</p><p>The ruling confirms climate change is much more than a legal problem. Rather, the justices concluded, it is an \"existential problem of planetary proportions that imperils all forms of life and the very health of our planet\".</p><p>Most nations have signed up to global human rights agreements such as the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The ICJ ruling means parties to those agreements must take measures to protect the climate system and other parts of the environment.</p><p>An advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice is not legally binding. But it is an authoritative description of the state of the law and the rights of countries to seek reparations if the law is breached. As such, it carries great legal weight.</p><p>Just as climate science assessments of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change have become the gold standard for understanding the causes and impacts of climate change, the court's ruling provides a clear baseline against which to assess countries' action, or inaction, on climate change.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Keep 1.5C alive</emphasis></h><p>In recent years, many states' emissions reduction targets under the Paris Agreement have seemed to \"settle\" at levels which would hold global temperature increases to 2C at best. But the ICJ ruled the much more ambitious 1.5C goal had become the scientifically-based consensus target under the Paris Agreement.</p><p>Some countries argued that formal emissions targets should be left to the discretion of each government. However, the court found against this. Rather, each nation's targets had to be in line with - and make an adequate contribution to - the global goal of holding heating to 1.5C.</p><p>The court found each state's emissions-reduction pledges should be judged against a stringent \"due diligence\" standard. The standard takes into account each country's historical contributions to emissions, level of development, and national circumstances, among other factors.</p><p>The ruling means rich countries will be required under international law to make more ambitious emission-reduction pledges under the Paris Agreement, such as for the 2035 target under consideration by the Australian government.</p><p>The court decision also provides a measure of climate justice for small island states which have historically low emissions but face a higher risk of damage from climate change.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Hold states accountable for inaction</emphasis></h><p>Because climate change is global, it is difficult, but not impossible, to attribute damage from extreme weather to the actions of any one nation or group of nations. On this question, the court said that while climate change is caused by the cumulative impact of many human activities, it is scientifically possible to determine each nation's total contribution to global emissions, taking into account both historical and current emissions.</p><p>If a nation experiences damage due to another nation, or group of nations failing to fulfil international climate obligations, the ruling means legal proceedings may be launched against the nations causing the harm. It may result in compensation or other remedies.</p><p>For small, climate-vulnerable nations such as those in the Alliance of Small Island States, this opens more legal options in their efforts to encourage high-emitting nations to properly address climate change.</p><p>Importantly, the court made clear that nations can be legally liable even if damage from climate change comes from many causes, including from the activities of private actors such as companies. That means nations cannot seek an exemption because others have contributed to the problem. They must also act to regulate companies and other entities under their jurisdiction whose activities contribute to climate change.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Paris Agreement quitters aren't safe</emphasis></h><p>One line of argument put to the court by Australia and other states was that climate treaties represented the only obligations to tackle climate change under international law. The court found this was not the case and that other international laws applied.</p><p>The US pulled out of the Paris Agreement earlier this year. The court's opinion means the US and other nations are still accountable for climate harms under other international laws, by which all countries are bound.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Could this lead to greater climate action</emphasis></h><p>The ICJ has produced a truly historic ruling.

Reasonable people cannot deny Mr O Toole s conclusion that the Irish, like every nation, are  a product of multiple invasions and migrations, colonisations and resistances, settlement and unsettlement .</p><p>Nonetheless, Mr O Toole should be far more hesitant to take English-sounding names like Clarke, Sands and Hughes at face value.

Why should we expect them to care about climate change, unless and until it affects their bottom line? </p><p>Michael O Leary has ample evidence that Ryanair does not need to  keep passengers happy , or to act responsibly in the face of climate change. Why bother, as long as they operate within the law and the money keeps rolling in, in ever-increasing quantities? </p><p>Celestine O Reilly (Letters, August 20th) refers to the  insanity  of pumping out increasing amounts of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. </p><p>I agree with her, but we must accept that whenever we choose to fly with Ryanair, or any other airline for that matter, we are among the many millions who are putting their hands to that pump.

A brother who has access to a white horse, who realises that Uisce \u00c9ireann s proposed Shannon pipeline project needs to be scrapped?</p><p>The similarities between the MetroLink and Shannon pipeline projects are interesting to say the least.</p><p>The Greater Dublin Water Supply study was started by Dublin City Council in 1996, nearly 30 years ago. A feasibility study was commissioned in 2004 and the results was the  silver bullet  that was to be the Shannon pipeline.</p><p>The initial estimate for the project was EUR 700 million. This increased to EUR 1.6 billion by 2016, and in June 2024, the major projects advisory group recommended that an estimated cost of EUR 10.4 billion would be needed   EUR 10.4 billion no less, and no one has batted an eyelid. </p><p>Some EUR 67.6 million has been spent on the project between 2014 and 2024, and not a pipe laid. Serious consideration was not given to alternative solutions.</p><p>For instance, the rivers in the East   the Liffey, Slaney, Boyne and Barrow   have a combined flow three-quarters that of the Shannon and the incremental development of these, together with the proper utilisation of the Poulaphouca reservoir (Blessington Lakes), would provide the same solution at a fraction of the cost.</p><p>Existing investment is being ignored and existing resources are being underutilised. The Irish taxpayer has already paid for the construction of a 22kmsq reservoir (Poulaphouca) at the Blessington Lakes for this specific purpose, to store water for summer supply when the rivers are low. So why is Poulaphouca not being used as a long-term solution? </p><p>Poulaphouca holds 190 billion litres of water and is one of the biggest reservoirs in these islands. Poulaphouca was originally intended for water supply primarily. </p><p>The greater amount of the reservoir is devoted to electricity generation, a minuscule amount of electricity in the context of the overall electricity generation of the country. This must change and water supply be given priority. Cost would be almost zero.</p><p>Thames Water in England are proposing to build a facility smaller than Poulaphouca (150 billion litres) and say it is needed to secure the supply for 15 million Londoners. Fifteen million no less!</p><p>Poulaphouca is the centre of any possible solution in any instance, so why build a pipeline? Just optimise beneficial use of the reservoir together with the rivers of the east and save the country several billion euro.

The club uses DHL's green programme to ship their jerseys. They have talked sustainability with O'Neill's. All of the vendors at Dalymount Park have moved to compostable packaging, and they work with Dublin City Council (DCC) on compostable waste and the like.</p><p>Children from schools in the nearby area designed environmental posters that have been put up on rubbish bins in the ground. And the club did a matchday audit for a home game with Shamrock Rovers last year that showed their average fan produces just 87g of waste when the Uefa norm is basically 10 times that.</p><p>\"We could improve on that 87g,\" McCabe says, \"but what's the point?\"</p><p>Eh, come again?</p><p>McCabe isn't dismissing the importance of this stuff. The point is that it amounts to the lowest of hanging fruit, that clubs shouldn't be applauded for doing any of it, and that it ultimately won't make any meaningful dent on the wider climate and sustainability crises. Bohs, he explains, see things differently to the rest of the sports sustainability community.</p><p>\"We are so far into the abyss here that a lot of the conversation really annoys me in sports sustainability because it is just rearranging the deckchairs. You can find any number of resources to see where we are going. One in particular, the [predicted] collapse of the Atlantic currents as early as this year, is genuinely some of the most scary stuff you can read.\"</p><p>So, what role does sport have in combating climate change then? \"I would argue we fundamentally don't.\"</p><p>So far so confusing, right?</p><p>Sport can't run from climate change any faster than other industries. Pitches and other infrastructure are at risk of rising sea levels and from fluctuating weather patterns. Athletes are being exposed to insufferable heat. Then there are the economic nuts and bolts that get corroded by the changes. Supply chains, transport, schedules, all of it.</p><p>Climate change means food shortages, mass migration, and displacement. That leads in turn to civil unrest and instability, geopolitical fragmentation and, if society breaks down, then sport will be the last of anyone's concerns. So, for McCabe and Bohs, it is social transformation that is the cornerstone of their climate change work.</p><p>\"That's what we see as our role here now, to walk the talk quite quickly.\"</p><p>McCabe did some sums a while back and found that 175 clubs that had made up the now-defunct European Football for Development Network were contributing 6.1m tonnes of CO2 every year. Considerable but, at the same time, a drop in the ocean. Now consider that there are 290m football fans in Europe with a footprint of 1.62bn tonnes.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Big difference</emphasis></h><p>\"So this is where we change the dial. Not fan travel, or where you are getting your jerseys from. That's important stuff but ultimately meaningless in terms of the scale of the emergency we are facing... We are in a planetary emergency. How do we play to our strengths? What are our strengths? Our strengths are our fans.\"</p><p>Social transformation is one of their three core beliefs. The second is that you have to take actions that are accessible and meaningful. Uefa made a sustainability ad last year with people shutting fridge doors and turning off lights. A stadium cheered every time a woman turned down a thermostat by a degree.</p><p>Great and all, but 30% of Irish people are living in energy poverty. Some are choosing between warmth and food in the winter months. So that's one-third of the population alienated from Uefa's message straight up. Bohs don't see an awareness crisis: People know what's happening. They see an affordability crisis.</p><p>Which takes us to the third core point.</p><p>This is explained with a picture of Buenos Aires streets heaving with millions of people after Argentina's 2022 World Cup win. Transfer that communal bond into solutions for the climate crisis and you're in business, and Bohs believe that, being 100% fanowned, they can use football's economies of scale to build community wealth through climate action.</p><p>\"We think that if you can own a football club and compete against Dermot Desmond as a football community then you could own other tangible assets that could be beneficial for our community.</p><p>\"There are 3bn football fans in the world. Why in the name of jaysus would we be looking at them and wondering, 'how do we get them to use a bamboo toothbrush, or take a shorter shower and eat less hamburgers?' It's madness.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mobilising collective</emphasis></h><p>The key is in mobilising this collective, and it starts by addressing inequality.</p><p>Earlier this month, McCabe and members of the club board, staff, Dublin City Council representatives, members of the Education and Training Board Ireland, and local development partners, travelled to the Basque region in Spain to visit the Mondragon Corporation.</p><p>Set up in 1956 by Fr Jose Maria Arizmendiarrieta, Mondragon is an enormous network of semi-autonomous businesses across finance, industry, retail and the knowledge sectors. Each one is owned and operated by its workers while, at the same time, part of a larger, mutually-beneficial association.</p><p>Mondragon has built up 81 separate cooperatives and employs 70,000 people. It generated a profit in 2023 of  593m with revenues that have pushed past  11bn and, because of its ownership model, the area has the lowest inequality in Europe. Bohs used their links with Athletic Bilbao to get in touch.</p><p>Another trip has just been undertaken to Cleveland, Ohio, where the Evergreen Cooperative, set up in 2008 when the global recession hit, is operating under principles learned from Mondragon. Their umbrella group now boasts a laundry, a solar co-op and a green growers co-op among their operations.</p><p>This is the sort of space where Bohs sees themselves making an impact.</p><p>Dublin City Council has already adopted community wealth-building into its economic strategy for the capital city and Bohs want to be a part of that: Part of a hub that supports businesses, provides central funding, and takes back a small percentage of the money generated.</p><p>The environment and the community would benefit. And so would the club. \"For the fan-owned model to continue to exist, we have to get quite innovative about how we resource it,\" says McCabe, \"because the money [needed] in the League of Ireland is going up, it's not going down, right?\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Skills programme</emphasis></h><p>They have already dipped a toe in these waters with a free eight-week Spark Skills programme teaching up to 150 members of the local community how to build solar circuits, fix bikes, and learn about energy efficiency. Sheffield United have been handed the blueprint and plan to start their own version next year.</p><p>The Phibsboro club are currently working with Uefa, Solar Power Europe, KPMG, and others on an application for European funding towards a project that, supported by a credit union, would put 500 units of free solar on their supporters' homes with fans repaying through the savings generated.</p><p>Doing it at that sort of scale would bring down the terms of the loan, improve the efficiency of installation, and create opportunities for employment. Bohs are also liaising with the Education and Training Board Ireland, thanks to a grant from SSE Electricity, to put a green apprenticeship programme in place alongside their football academy.</p><p>Young players who don't make it in football full-time - and that's the vast majority of them - would pick up a lifetime skill that offers a career in a potentially lucrative industry that would serve the environment.</p><p>So, there may be no points or trophies at play here, but the prize could hardly be greater.</p><p>\"We have a very unique opportunity here to shift an entire mindset globally because the NFL come to visit us here,\" says McCabe.</p><p>\"We've had football associations from Bulgaria, from Latvia, and football clubs from all over Europe.

The Narrow Road is a gruelling watch. It is also a strain on the eyes, with much of the action shrouded in shadow, making it often difficult to discern what is going on. That is perhaps a mercy. Much like the book, the series is a rebuttal to cinema s historic tendency to portray the second World War as a jolly jaunt in distant climes.</p><p>The moral centre of the piece is Belfast s Ciar\u00e1n Hinds. He plays the older Dorrigo Evans, a surgeon from Tasmania captured by the Japanese in Indonesia and forced to labour on the notorious Burma Death Railway. </p><p>As empathetically brought to life by Hinds, Evans is a successful doctor who reluctantly recalls his war years for a journalist. But just below the patrician surface lurks unresolved trauma. The source of that pain is made dreadfully clear in the flashbacks to the war, where the young Evans is inhabited with charismatic stoicism by Jacob Elordi. </p><p>Horror is blended with heartache through flashbacks, in which Evans embarks on an enthusiastic affair with his uncle s wife (Odessa Young) shortly before shipping out to war   and despite being engaged to his girlfriend (Olivia DeJonge). Oddly, the same plot device is central to Sebastian Faulks  first World War elegy, Birdsong. What is it about young men who are about to potentially meet their maker and the forbidden rhapsody of the love of an older woman?</p><p>Sunday nights on the BBC tend to be dedicated to superior, cosy crime or binge-worthy drama. The Narrow Road to the Deep North is something else. It s slow, difficult TV. But it is worth the effort, and Hinds has never been more commanding as a man who has left hell but knows hell will never leave him.</p><p>Mary Robinson has been a transformative figure in Irish politics   the country s first woman president, a tireless campaigner for equality and ferocious advocate for human rights.</p><p>It s a shame, then, that her life has been flattened out into a functional feel-good story by <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Mrs Robinson</emphasis> (RT\u00c9 One, Wednesday). The documentary, released in cinemas in 2024 and now airing on terrestrial television, has a becalmed,  eat your greens  quality and is incurious about the private person behind the public figure.</p><p>The best that can be said is that it does an efficient job tracing the broad arc of Robinson s career   from her childhood as the daughter of two doctors and the grandchild of a well-connected local lawyer in Ballina to her advocacy for women s rights as a young barrister in 1970s Dublin. </p><p>Her fearlessness in the face of power is confirmed all over again as we see her become UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and stand up to both China and the United States   only to be asked to leave the job before her term was up.</p><p>The turning point in her life, of course, was the 1990 presidential election. As the film shows, the campaign against her had a nasty edge. </p><p>One low was Charles Haughey apparatchik P\u00e1draig Flynn going on the radio and claiming that she was presenting a fake version of herself and of her having a newfound interest in her family.</p><p>However, Mrs Robinson makes the baffling decision to skirt around rival candidate Brian Lenihan s self-sabotage when he contradicted himself on television over whether he had phoned the \u00c1ras to ask president Hillery to decline to dissolve the D\u00e1il in 1982.</p><p>At the time, the  mature recollection  debacle was widely regarded as having swung the election. And yet Mrs Robinson does not mention it. Nor does it broach the whispering campaign against the president once she had taken up residency at the Phoenix Park for instance, the notorious  Big Bird  incident in which her fashion sense was mocked. There was a feeling at the time that many in Ireland wished to undermine her and could not come to terms with a woman in power. You wouldn t know it from watching Mrs Robinson.</p><p>There are contributions from celebrity admirers such as mogul Richard Branson and musician Peter Gabriel.

Just as the stabbing of a child in Dublin in November 2023 triggered racist violence, so the fatal attack on a dance class near Liverpool was seized upon as an excuse for carnage in the UK. Children had died, cities were burning   and British politicians appeared dazed by the scale of what had happened.</p><p>Twelve months later, Finding Neverland director Dan Reed has painstakingly and cripplingly chronicled these terrible events with <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">One Day in Southport</emphasis> (Channel 4,9pm). If only a filmmaker of equal stature would turn their attention to the anarchy that gripped Dublin seven months previously. Alas, we wait in vain. </p><p>He begins with a close-up on one of the survivors of the attack   a now 13-year-old who cannot be named for legal reasons.</p><p> My vision was going blurry and I ran across to this guy and I said to him:  I ve been stabbed, I think I m dying,  she recalls of the brutal assault by Axel Rudakubana on the Hart Space, a community hub in Southport, a quiet seaside town 27km north of Merseyside.</p><p> I was struggling to breathe, and I saw my sister there and she was saying,  Please don t die, please don t die . </p><p>Her voice is heavy with trauma, and the viewer s heart will break for her and for the families of the three children who died: six-year-old Bebe King, seven-year-old Elsie Dot Stancombe and Alice da Silva Aguiar, aged nine.</p><p>What happened next was, of course, shocking but not surprising. Racists, thugs and  citizen journalists  descended on Southport and whipped up hysteria against a local mosque. With police on the ground seemingly in the dark about Rudakubana, rumours that he was a Muslim immigrant began to spread. He was, in fact, born in Cardiff to a family from Rwanda, which is overwhelmingly Christian. Yet that was of little comfort to the terrified people inside the mosque in Southport.</p><p>Reed isn t interested in blaming people and wisely avoids portraying Rudakubana as some sort of interesting or complicated villain (he is now serving a 52-year murder sentence). He wants to give a voice to the victims of the attack and to understand the anger that turned town centres across Britain into a war zone.</p><p>Those on the hard right tell Reed that their protests are not about race but about working-class people.  The issues we are now fighting has changed. It ain t about race no more, it is about class,  claims Wendell Daniel, the black videographer who works with Tommy Robinson, one of Britain s most prominent far-right activists.</p><p>However, chilling footage from around Britain suggests that the 2024 protests quickly descended into mob rule, as we see when another panicking videographer rushes back to his car after thugs surround his Asian wife.</p><p>No Irish person needs to be reminded about racism in British society. Nonetheless, something has shifted since the pandemic, says Weyman Bennett, co-convenor of Stand Up to Racism. Right-wing marches used to attract a certain type, he says    Billy No-Mates , middle-aged men, without friends or a purpose in life.</p><p>Now, they are increasingly joined by women and young people, says Bennett   an entire swathe of society that feels abandoned, and believes people such as Tommy Robinson claim to have the answer.</p><p>It s a terrifying thought. But then, as anyone who saw Dublin burn in November 2023 will know, it isn t really a thought at all, it s the new reality with which we are all going to have to come to terms and, sooner or later, perhaps, take a stand against. l </p><h>Ones to Watch </h><p>Rob Brydon maroons contestants in a mystery country and invites them to work out where they are in <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Destination X</emphasis> (BBC One, Wednesday, 9pm)</p><p> Did Britain s most iconic royal secretly tie the knot with her groundsman?

As temperatures are rising, so too are incidences of extreme weather, from droughts and floods to heat waves and wildfires - with over 3bn people living in areas of high vulnerability to climate change.</p><p>It is clear from scientific evidence that the children and young people of today are the \"generation most affected\" by the climate crisis. Children and young people today are the most impacted by the climate crisis - a crisis they have been born into. Yet, they will shoulder a disproportionate share of the burden of climate change, resulting in both direct and indirect impacts on their well-being across the lifespan.</p><p>Unicef's recent report, 'A Threat to Progress', states that \"climate change is changing children... impacting almost every aspect of child health and wellbeing\". In terms of health, children are now more susceptible to respiratory and gastrointestinal illnesses, and infectious disease, as a result of changing air quality, water pollutants, extreme heat, and other ecosystem hazards.</p><p>From Los Angeles to Laos, more than 200m children's schooling was disrupted or displaced in the last year by extreme weather, such as flooding and wildfires. We know that children experience trauma from these extreme weather events that they carry with them into adulthood. We also know that climate anxiety and distress are rising among children and young people worldwide, who report feelings of betrayal by the inaction of adults and po-licymakers. This youngest generation are not just passive victims of climate impacts; they are potential catalysts for change. It is critical that development of climate leadership among children and young people therefore starts as soon as possible.</p><p>Climate leadership in regards to children means actively involving young people in understanding, addressing, and advocating for solutions to climate change. By combining education, empowerment, and action in age-appropriate ways, we help children become informed, responsible, and proactive members of their communities.</p><p>Recent research demonstrates the importance of developing climate leadership among children, where they can play an effective role in sustainabil-ity advocacy. Our children hold a unique position within their families, schools, and wider communities; they promote pro-environmental behavioural change, because they possess powerful agency to drive awareness and action. Climate leadership is dependent, however, on two key issues: Children's accurate knowledge of climate change, and their active involvement in sustainability leadership activities, both inside and outside of school.</p><p>While primary schools are increas ingly supported by national policies to embed education for sustainable development in the curriculum, the Global Learner Survey, 'Making the grade for climate education: I learned about the weather, but not climate change', shows frustration among learners worldwide about the adequacy of topics related to climate issues in school. This issue is even more salient for young people, and their parents, since every job will have a climate component over the next decade - from doctors and nurses, to accountants, tradespeople, sustainability officers, or policymakers.</p><p>It is understood that children and young people require education in climate leadership. <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">National Geographic Kids</emphasis> published a practical set of recommendations on 'How do you teach children about climate change?' . This simply involved a three-step process of explaining the science of our world and environment; explaining the problems that are arising because of climate change; and finally, explaining the solutions. This solution-driven approach is very much required by our young people to lead in climate change.</p><p>However, we will have to be much more creative and applied in the education of our children and young people in climate change.</p><p>Kemmy Business School is leading a new creative and applied climate initiative, Climate Leadership through Na-ture's Canvas. This partnership with primary school teachers, children, and their families educates children about climate science through play and art, and offers the opportunity to develop leadership skills while engaging in creative art and works.</p><p>This initiative challenges all participants to explore, create, and lead. The first engagement with children involves the introduction to the Climate Fresk game. Children will solve a puzzle, each piece of the puzzle represents a crucial aspect of climate change - from human activities to their environmental consequences, such as sea level rise or ocean acidification. By linking puzzle pieces on the causes and consequences of climate change, children and their teachers will build a storyboard of climate change, becoming participative learners. What follows is a facilitated discussion on potential actions and solutions, with the intention of leaving all participants with a feeling of hope and empowerment to move toward action.</p><p>Next, in collaboration with Irish children's artists, a poetry canopy - similar to a patchwork quilt inspired by poetry - will be created using recycled materials and natural objects. This collaborative green art activity is designed to help children and their teachers understand environmental issues such as pollution, deforestation, and resource overuse. As they explore these topics through art, children gain a deeper awareness of the challenges associated with climate change and begin to appreciate the need for sustainable practices. This activity will also develop important leadership capabilities, such as self awareness, collaboration, and communication. They will learn how to share ideas, listen to others, and find ways to compromise and influence in group settings.</p><p>There has been some very positive, albeit laboured steps at third level-education, to embed climate courses or climate-related courses into the curricula - such as climate change sociology and economics.

No matter how much you try to solve for X   working from home, asking relatives for help, using cr\u00e8ches, childminders and availing of State subsidies and payments   it seems designed to break you financially and emotionally. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It s been 20 years, but my nerves still haven t recovered from organising childcare for our two kids. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Like most people, I had to work to help pay the bills. Choice didn t come into it. Even though my husband and I were highly educated, well-paid professionals living in Dublin, it was an exhausting struggle. We were paying EUR 2,500 on our mortgage and EUR 2,000 monthly for the creche in which we were lucky to get two places. The numbers never added up. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My husband is an accountant and I was a personal finance journalist. We had knowledge, energy and means and we still couldn t find the right formula for our family. Financially, I could only afford to take five months off with each child.</p><p>We didn t live large. The kids  clothes were a combination of hand-me downs, gifts or purchases from Penneys, Dunnes or other low-cost retailers. To save money, we used home exchanges for our holidays and our car was second-hand. We weren t buying designer clothes, takeaways, lattes or going to the pub every week   common  advice  at that time from the older generation and finance experts. </p><p>Every penny was counted, every possibility explored, but since we didn t have family to help out for free   which isn t ideal or fair anyway   it became a constant puzzle to be solved.</p><p>My husband s job was not flexible, so I had to reorganise my work schedule for school training days or holidays. The one-hour difference in pick-up times between junior/senior infants and first through sixth class was ridiculous, coming as it did right in the middle of the work day. If you don t work near where you live, it is impossible. </p><p>Children s childcare and developmental needs also change as they grow, so we had to constantly seek out the most suitable arrangements such as a creche, au pair or childminder. Afterschool care was not available at that time for older children; nor were breakfast clubs.</p><p>For me, the juggle became impossible unless I worked from home. When we had two children, doubling the cost for a creche, an au pair was an obvious solution. She minded the older child while I was working in the kitchen. I ll never forget interviewing economists with the phone on my left shoulder while breastfeeding our younger on my right. </p><p>Add a sick child into this fragile mix, and it was absolute chaos. Naturally, children want and need their parents when they re not feeling well, but deadlines and workflows are not easily adjusted. In the end, I quit my beloved career in journalism and started my own company. </p><h>Rigged game  My story is every parent s story then and now. No matter what you do or how you plan, the numbers can never add up in Ireland. The game is rigged against working parents. </h><p>Today, childcare costs are still high, places are like hen s teeth, and the stress this places on working parents and their children is enormous. Mortgages, rents and the high cost of living all make things more difficult.</p><p>Ireland has some of the highest childcare costs in Europe, with one-third of a woman s median full-time earnings being used on childcare back in 2019. That figure rises in lower-income family households, particularly lone-parent households (overwhelmingly led by women). </p><p>Ireland also has the highest reliance on unpaid care work in the European Union   most of it unpaid childcare likely provided by relatives. </p><p>In recent years, government has committed to providing more support and is moving towards a public childcare model. The National Childcare Scheme and the Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme help parents reduce costs. </p><p>The Core Funding grant helps early- learning and childcare providers with their operating costs. Recently announced new caps on what providers can charge from September should mean no parents pay more than EUR 295 a week for a child attending a service in the scheme for 40 to 50 hours a week. That figure will, in most cases, fall to EUR 198.70 after other supports are factored in, but the caps vary according to the number of hours involved.</p><p>High childcare costs are a barrier to women working outside the home, and this has prevented Ireland s child poverty rates from improving. The existing system is not working well for current or future generations.</p><p>Women have been in the workforce for decades. The majority of families need two incomes to pay the bills. Why haven t we been able to solve this equation? Is it because we think it s just a women s issue, or are we under the delusion that most families can survive on one salary?</p><p>Who should be responsible for childcare and the tasks involved in raising happy and healthy kids? Naturally, it s the parents  responsibility first, but society, the Government and employers all have a part to play. </p><p>And, weirdly, everyone seems to forget that men are parents too. In Ireland, women spend on average 21.3 hours per week on unpaid care work, in comparison to 10.6 hours per week for men. </p><p> In Irish society, the crisis in care is central to women s inequality, with under-resourcing, lack of adequate provision, accessibility issues and moves towards commodification and corporatisation affecting almost all aspects of care and support provision,  states a recent study,<emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>Gender equity and care for transformative climate justice, by Jennie Stephens of Maynooth University and Orla O Connor of the National Women s Council. </p><p>When childcare can t be provided by the mother, it s often a woman   not the father   who steps into the breach.

While it is encouraging to see educators engaging students through popular platforms, this trend raises deeper questions about what we value in education and what we may be losing.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The rise of exam-focused influencers, with their bite-sized hacks and algorithm-boosted predictions, reflects an increasingly transactional view of learning.

The claim that local residents are  possibly the last great stakeholder in what has become an increasingly frenetic policy area , is misinformed and short-sighted ( Everybody wants to get on board the State s aviation policy , Cantillon, Business, May 13th). </p><p>Children s safety, health and economic prospects unequivocally depend on urgent and economy-wide cuts to fossil fuel use. The record-breaking levels of flight traffic in Ireland also means record-breaking levels of aviation fossil fuel use. </p><p>In 2023 Ireland used 1.36 billion litres of aviation fossil fuel and this will increase massively if national airport expansion takes place. Experts advise there is no viable or sustainable alternative to jet kerosene, and there is none for the foreseeable future. </p><p>In recent days we learnt that 100 million of the world s five year olds (83 per cent) face deadly and unprecedented heat in their lives if climate action is not strengthened. Yet children continue to be ignored as key stakeholders in decisions that will have irreversible impacts on their lives   such as massive and polluting airport expansion. The reason our children are on track for deadly heat, among many other life-threatening hazards, is inadequate action to cut the fossil fuel pollution endangering their futures.</p><p>The aviation industry must do its fair share for climate action and protect children from the horrendous and avoidable harms they are facing. The State must regulate it accordingly via a science-based aviation policy. </p><p>It is only children who have the fundamental right to growth, development and survival, not any industry, and the State must fulfil its obligations to them.

They cite Uisce \u00c9ireann and the Greater Dublin Drainage project, EirGrid, the passenger cap at Dublin Airport and the Ardee bypass, the National Maternity Hospital, social and affordable housing in Ringsend, wind farms and MetroLink. </p><p>Both refer to the problems of planning as favourite culprits in this failure, particularly referring to individuals standing in the way of the common good. This has never been a real factor. With the exception of EirGrid, whose problems are of resources, the failure lies firmly with the leadership of the infrastructure providers, not with the citizens who occasionally attempt to hold their power to account.</p><p>It would take too long to analyse all the examples cited, but looking at just two of the failures, the passenger cap was a condition of planning permission granted in 2007; the DAA had more than 15 years to address it but did not. Metro North was actually granted planning permission in 2011 and that permission was allowed to lapse.</p><p>Effective leaders take responsibility for their actions and unite people with a shared vision, working together to overcome vested interests. Without gifted leadership, we would not have been able to tackle the financial crisis nor the pandemic. We would not have the IFSC and the Dublin docklands. Ardnacrusha was the gift of the leadership of a young Irish engineer in the 1930s.</p><p>It s time that we stopped blaming the citizen for failure.

Such figures starkly highlight the injustice of the situation.</p><p>Wealthier nations in the Global North, where emissions are highest, have not taken the lead in reducing their carbon footprints, instead allowing climate-harming corporations to operate primarily without regulation. This negligence manifests as a human rights crisis across the globe, with marginalised communities - who have contributed the least to climate change - suffering the most. They face extreme weather, loss of lives and livelihoods, displacement, and hunger, pushing them deeper into poverty and amplifying existing inequalities.</p><p>Globally, governments continue to enable the expansion of this destructive industry, often at the expense of the world's most vulnerable populations.</p><p>Alarmingly, by 2030, governments collectively plan to produce more than double the amount of fossil fuels required to stay within the critical 1.5C warming limit, set by the Paris Agreement. This completely disregards the scientific consensus, the necessity of phasing out fossil fuels to mitigate further climate impacts, and violates the agreements and obligations to protect and support those who have done the least to cause this crisis, but who are suffering the most.</p><p>It may not surprise many to read that Ireland is falling short of its commitments, but by how much is truly shocking. Current government policies and private-sector initiatives are facilitating an increase in the country's fossil fuel demand and infrastructure, (such as plans for liquefied natural gas facilities) and the proliferation of data centres.</p><p>These plans directly contradict Ireland's climate obligations and risk entangling the country in human rights abuses linked to continued high greenhouse gas emissions and excessive energy demands.</p><p>Claims that dependence on more polluting, fossil fuels is a solution to energy security couldn't be further from the truth. In reality, it only exacerbates vulnerability to geopolitical shifts and price shocks.</p><p>Earth is now projected to reach a sobering 2.6C-3.1C of warming by 2100. However, if the rest of the world had polluted like Ireland, the world would already be at 3.6C of warming. Ireland is on a slippery slope to missing our emissions reduction target of 51% by 2030, with just a 23% reduction expected.</p><p>Even before you consider the impacts of new liquefied natural gas facilities and the energy use of projected data centres, Ireland's ambition and delivery on climate action falls far short of our fair share. These shortcomings alone are due to cost the country  26bn - an alarming sign of a government failing to meet its obligations.</p><p>Ireland's role as a global financial hub further complicates the issue. With substantial investments in fossil fuel companies through Irish subsidiaries, Ireland is directly and significantly implicated in the climate crisis.</p><p>In June 2024, Irish investment firms held roughly  31.76bn in fossil fuel assets, 91% of which were tied to companies actively expanding fossil fuel production. The emissions linked to these investments exceeded Ireland's national emissions by a staggering 20%, underscoring the need for accountability on these activities, which is currently lacking.</p><p>The climate crisis is fundamentally a human rights crisis, and there have been increasing calls from human rights treaty bodies for a complete fossil fuel phaseout and stringent regulations against corporations responsible for damage both at home and abroad.</p><p>In Malawi where Tr\u00f3caire works, 56% of those affected by Cyclone Freddy's impacts were children.

Children, women, and the world's most vulnerable are losing everything.</p><p>It is time for a decisive shift away from fossil fuels. Ireland can be a key player in this transition by endorsing a global Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, by prohibiting new fossil fuel infrastructure, and swiftly implementing policies that promise a just phase-out of fossil fuels domestically, and urgently reduce emissions.</p><p>Every fraction of a degree of warming holds dire consequences, making every tonne of carbon pollution critical.

True, an infinitesimally small contribution   but one that reminds us that some of the greenhouse gases we emit today will still be around, trapping the Earth s heat, far into the distant future. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some have shorter lifetimes. Methane, for example, which constitutes 30 per cent of Irish greenhouse gas emissions, produces its intense warming effect 80 times greater than CO2 over 20 years. But it doesn t stop there, as much of it then converts to CO2, which joins the long-term store of that gas for centuries. Those who would have you believe that the warming effect of methane emissions disappear after a decade or so are simply wrong. It matters not to the atmosphere whether that methane has come from a dairy cow or a leaking gas pipeline. It all ends up in the atmospheric reservoir of greenhouse gases for future generations to cope with.</p><p>So decisions made today regarding our emissions have very long-term consequences for those who come after us. It also confirms that there is no turning back the dial in terms of the warming effect of gases already emitted. No feasible removal technology exists at the scale and deployment level to get us out of our predicament over the next few decades. This means that there is only a certain amount of additional emissions that the world can add to the atmosphere before trigger points of warming and potential tipping points of climate dislocation are inevitable. </p><h>Radical cuts </h><p/><h>For a 50-50 chance of limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees above pre-industrial levels, the remaining global budget at the beginning of this year was estimated to be 235 billion tonnes of CO2. This will be used up in around six years at current rates of emission. The best we can do is buy time by radical cuts in emissions.</h><p>What is Ireland s fair share of this remaining budget? How should countries that have benefited from burning fossil fuels since the industrial revolution do in any allocation, compared with developing countries that have only recently started emitting significant amounts of greenhouse gases?</p><p>Ireland has sought to address these issues in its climate legislation and its adherence to the Paris Agreement of 2015 by a system of legally binding five-yearly carbon budgets. The most recent update of these has been recommended to the Minister for the Environment by the Climate Change Advisory Council. These limit national emissions to 295 million, 200 million and 160 million tonnes for each of the five year periods 2021-25, 2026-30 and 2031-35 respectively. Before taking these limits to the Oireachtas for approval, the Minister is seeking public submissions on them to be made before June 4th. </p><p>It is an opportunity for citizens to express their views on this critical intergenerational issue.</p><p>These new carbon budgets were required to be formulated in compliance with the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021, which was passed overwhelmingly, and enthusiastically supported by the two major parties in government today. </p><p>This Act also requires consistency with Article 2.2 of the Paris Agreement, which requires governments to implement climate actions to  reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.  </p><p>This convoluted phrase essentially brings us back to the issue of fairness. What is fair for a rich country like Ireland to claim in terms of the remaining global carbon budget? Has this principle been observed in formulating the new round of carbon budgets?</p><p>In its first report in 2021 advising the minister on the design of the original carbon budgets (2021-2030), the Climate Change Advisory Council produced a reasoned justification of how the budgets represented a fair and equitable contribution to meeting the needs of Paris 2.2.

The values are in no particular order and none is more important than the other. But our position on the continuum of each value does give an insight into our suitability for a particular role - in this case, the president of Ireland.</p><p>Of the 15 values, the ones that I would rate as values aligning with the role of president include the following:</p><p>* Radius: A measure of how much you value being in a position to change the world. This is not about fame but about \"how big a crater there would be if your life was dropped on the world like a bomb\". Welch suggests that \"most people who have an off-the-charts high radius ranking are coming from a noble place, galvanised by a soul-deep yearning to restore dignity to the powerless, aching, and disenfranchised\".</p><p>Dr Ryan, while managing health emergencies in the WHO for the past 27 years, and leading the organi-sation's response to covid, as well as more recently deploring the atrocities in Gaza, including child deaths and starvation, has consistently demonstrated a high radius ranking;</p><p>* Non Sibi is the Latin term for 'not for self' and as a value it reflects helping others as a life-organising principle. Another value that</p><p>Dr Ryan would appear to rank highly;</p><p>* Agency is a measure of self-determination as a life-organising principle. Steve Jobs personified agency as a value when he said \"your time is limited so don't waste it living someone else's life. Don't be trapped by dogma - which is living with the results of other people's thinking. Don't let the noise of other opinions drown out your own inner voice.\" In a nutshell, drive your own bus;</p><p>* Achievement: How much you value respect from your community, for being the very best you can be at what you do;</p><p>* Work centrism: Linked to valuing achievement - placing work as a key priority in your life that defines your meaning and momentum;</p><p>* Voice: A strong desire to say what you think. Dr Ryan's recent comments about the atrocities in Gaza and previously about social justice and health justice - specifically in relation to the distribution of the covid-19 vaccine to low-income countries - were examples of his ability to speak his mind.</p><p>Welch lists other core values that all of us have to a greater or lesser degree but may not sit as comfortably with the role of president.

In tandem with this, pollinator-friendly planting, use of native trees and a  no spray policy  promoting sustainable, chemical-free practices, allow biodiversity to thrive. </p><p> Castlegregory is a small village with a big environmental commitment, where community, climate action and biodiversity go hand in hand,  says Bettina Pickering, who nominated the village.</p><p>The breadth of activities keeps volunteers  connected and involved , she adds.  Our green efforts go beyond TidyTowns. The community council hosts annual circular economy events ...

That alone is challenging in modern Ireland, but the project is operating in an important archaeological landscape. </p><p> The farmland comprising the ancient  royal  landscape of Rathcroghan is a little greener than most, due to the initiative of the local landowners, farmers and the surrounding community,  says Joe Fenwick. </p><p>It was the prehistoric capital of Connacht. Rathcroghan Mound was where the kings and queens of the province were inaugurated in a ritual  mating  with the local Earth goddess. </p><p>Established in 2018, the project is supported by the EU Just Transition Fund, and has 60 participating farming families, with others waiting to join. Its  success can be measured in the positive impact, ambition and cohesion that it has brought to the wider community. It is based on a simple model of collaborative, community-led governance,  says Fenwick. </p><p>It promotes solutions and innovations devised by local people with a view to sustaining fulfilling farming livelihoods, while promoting the stewardship, conservation and protection of the archaeological, ecological and cultural heritage of the area. It also addresses wider environmental concerns; maintaining groundwater quality, carbon sequestration and other actions in support of achieving climate neutrality. </p><p>Those involved have demonstrated the benefits of embracing farming traditions that are as old as the locality s archaeological monuments, Fenwick believes, but also apply modern, imaginative, green innovations. </p><p>The greening of Millbrook, surrounding <emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Oldcastle Gaelic Football Club s</emphasis> pitches in Co Meath, is a perfect example of starting small and reaping benefits over time. </p><p> [It] shows how the GAA community can contribute to lowering carbon emissions, teaching people about biodiversity and the benefits of green spaces,  says Ealma Purcell.

We start with a bed of nepeta, adored by pollinators, a hive of buzzing activity. The riverbank is fenced off for safety, allowing it to become a wildlife haven, with otters and a resident heron,  says Purcell. </p><p> We never cut the grass here, making it a totally safe environment for any creature that calls it home, and you can often hear the squeaks of little mammals.

Located between Wicklow town and Bray, it is made up of a large forest garden and  Hub13 , a rural remote working hub repurposed from a disused sawmill into studios with co-working and office spaces. </p><p>The garden is 2.8 hectares (seven acres) of regenerated pastoral farmland transformed from heavily sheep-grazed ryegrass. Within the project are various small and family-sized allotments maintained through no pesticide use and deploying  no dig  organic methods. </p><p>Taking over the family farm in 2014,  Huw saw the pronounced decline in insects he remembered seeing in the meadow when he was child. He was asked to sell sites for one-off housing but made a decision instead to enhance the environment and restore lost biodiversity,  says Caroline Costigan, who works there part-time. </p><p>The allotments provide families with space and awareness to care for nature and the opportunity to make sustainable choices to grow their own food, limit food waste and avoid chemicals and excessive plastic packaging. </p><p>Hub13 provides a rural biodiversity-focused workplace to people including creative artists and those who were feeling isolated working at home or were previously commuters on the N11, she adds.

Diverse local groups work diligently to help the peninsula move towards being more resilient, having cleaner energy, protecting our natural and beautiful landscape while keeping the local economy strong to ensure a vibrant, liveable place for future generations ... it s about local people having a real say in shaping their community s future.  </p><h> Footprint for good  The concept of a  carbon footprint  has come to be understood as an indicator of our ecological impact on Earth, but it has ignoble origins. </h><p>The idea gained popularity in 2003 when fossil-fuel company BP launched an advertising campaign asking people on the street what their carbon footprint was. It emerged that marketing agency Ogilvy &amp; Mather s brief was to promote the slant that climate change is not the fault of an oil giant, but of individuals. The company unveiled its  carbon footprint calculator  so people could assess how their normal daily life   going to work, buying food and travelling   is largely responsible for heating the globe. Initially, it was a guilt trigger. </p><p>In spite of the sinister motivation of Big Oil, individuals can address their carbon footprint meaningfully; their actions add up to significant impact. However, it is only by collective action   in decarbonising, restoring nature and using water sustainably   that the necessary multiplier effect is deployed.

However, comparing the Irish Catholic Church to what was almost like theocracy by proxy from the 1930s on is always going to make the religion look like a political force in decline. When really, it could just be a political force in proportion.</p><p>The legacy of the most shameful parts of our social history has left Ireland with a visceral fear of mixing religion and politics. Modern Ireland wants its church and its State as far away from each other as possible, for rational reasons that we all understand. Talking about the church as a political lobbying force makes people suspicious, and it conjures fears of regressive policy efforts. It shouldn't.</p><p>Because Ireland went through radical social change later but at a more intense pace than other European countries, the Irish Catholic Church only exists in the minds of younger people who remember its interventions in recent referenda as a fringe conservative lobby group with a weird and disproportionate focus on sexual morality. The Irish Catholic Church shares a fair proportion of the blame for this.</p><p>If those social issues, which it thankfully lost the argument on, were the only policies of the Irish Catholic Church, then maybe it would be accurate to say it has no political purpose now. But taking the issue of housing as one example, the dominant Irish political issue of this century, the church has a long record of advocacy - including its presence in frontline emergency accommodation services like the Peter McVerry Trust and the Capuchin Day Centre. The Irish Catholic Bishops have also taken a solid line against successive governments on the scandal of the homelessness crisis.</p><p>Considering the well-established position of the church on the issue of migration and the Middle East, I would argue that the Irish Catholic Church might actually have the potential to become more politically relevant than it has been in recent years.</p><p>Why does that matter? Well, because there are plenty of lobby groups and representative bodies who rightly get the platform and attention from the political system that they deserve - who might just happen to represent fewer people than go to mass every week. If you have thousands of people attending a weekly event where inherently political messages are being shared, then that qualifies the Irish Catholic Church as a relevant political force by any reasonable metric.</p><p>The way we talk about the church now often creates images of empty, cobweb-strewn pews. In my personal experience, congregation sizes are healthier than they're often portrayed - especially in urban areas with young migrant populations. And from anecdotal evidence of the effect of shared parishes and cut mass times, I wonder if the vocation crisis shouldn't be the greater concern over mass attendance anxieties.</p><p>A healthy secular political system would recognise the Irish Catholic Church for what it is - a political force, yes, but not a domineering one. The church thankfully doesn't have that mighty mandate of the past anymore, but it still has a moral one that deserves to be listened to.</p><p>'The legacy of the most shameful parts of our social history has left Ireland with a visceral fear of mixing religion and politics'</p>", "publisher": "Irish Independent", "instances": ["I've heard similar utterances from the altar before, on issues like housing and Gaza. While appeals from priests over the last decade against social reforms like marriage equality and abortion rights have tended to attract more public and media attention, it is often forgotten that the Irish Catholic Church remains a legitimate political constituency in Ireland. For any political anorak, an election is an election. So the eyes of the wannabe psephologists of the world are this week trained on the mysterious and almost high-camp machinations of the conclave that is trusted with voting for the next Pope. Like any good election, the selection of the next pontiff has activated an intensive lobbying effort. Climate justice activists have stressed the need for the new Pope to continue where Pope Francis's environmental advocacy left off. And there is an international tug of war for the heart and soul of the Catholic Church, with liberals and conservatives arguing between themselves about which decisive direction the world religion should venture towards now. In Ireland, we have also been having these conversations for the last few weeks. Theologians and Catholic commentators have been parsing issues like gay rights and marriage equality, a policy on which Pope Francis brought the church right up to a line that it never quite crossed. The possible future role of ordained women in the church, the important place of the Vatican in an international political climate that has become hostile to immigration, how radical a plea for peace has become in 2025, and the unfortunately perpetually relevant question in this country about the way the church has - or, more often, has not - responded to heinous child sex abuse have all been interrogated. So while our media and political system does recognise the Catholic Church as an important political body, there is an incongruous difference between the way that we talk about the international church and our own domestic one."]}, {"relevance_score": 29, "title": "'A pope among the people, with an open heart towards everyone'", "published": "2025-04-28", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The earthly remains of Pope Francis were laid to rest at the Basilica of St Mary Major, near the icon of Mary he venerated and as he requested.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">It followed his funeral Mass in St Peter s Square at the Vatican and a 4km journey through the people-lined streets of Rome.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The interment ceremony inside was private, but followed camerlengo Cardinal Kevin Farrell marking the pope s coffin with his seal before the remains were laid in a simple tomb and sprinkled with holy water.</p><p>The Regina Caeli prayer was said and the official act confirming the burial was read aloud before being signed by Dublin-born Cardinal Farrell.</p><p>Estimates indicate that as many as 250,000 people attended the funeral Mass earlier with a further 150,000 lining the streets of Rome as people said goodbye to their bishop.

'Hear Our Voices' is an action-packed day with inspiring talks, interactive workshops, and networking opportunities focusing on how a clean, healthy and sustainable environment is both a human right and necessary for children to enjoy their rights. The all-day event is about recognising the diverse voices of young people and the existing community of young rights and climate activists, environmental NGOs and academics who are passionate about delivering a 'just transition' movement. Recognising the changes, decision-makers must make to combat the effects of climate breakdown to ensure no one is left behind. Special guests will facilitate workshops and 'walkshops' focusing on advocacy and voice, skills development and creative practices around Greenmount Campus' scenic grounds.

They are strategically investing because they think that investment in universities will help profits, whether through improving their reputation or being able to influence policy, because universities play a big part in setting the discourse for policy options. </p><p> Because the public system is strong, but chronically underfunded, there is more pressure to get money from other sources. </p><p>The source of funding does not necessarily speak to the quality of academic work, says Stephens, and lots of good work can come from industry-funded research.</p><p> But at the agenda-setting level, especially with fossil fuels, it means that companies might fund fossil-fuel friendly technical fixes, such as carbon capture, but not fund science on how to phase out fossil fuels. This is one of the biggest risks. </p><h>Safeguards </h><p/><h>Dr Lisa Keating, director of research and innovation with the Irish Universities Association, says there are safeguards around private research funding to third-level.</h><p> They are subject to rigorous due diligence processes to assess ethical, reputation and strategic considerations before acceptance,  she says.</p><p> When it comes to collaborative research projects, similar safeguards are in place to maintain academic independence and research integrity. These include clear contractual frameworks, conflict of interests declarations [which] help to mitigate risks related to biased research agendas or compromised academic freedom, oversight and review committees and performance and compliance monitoring. </p><p>Keating says universities do not approach industry funding for research as a money-saving exercise. </p><p> In our public universities, industry funding is seen as complementary to State or other funding, such as that from the EU. Many major research programmes have multiple funding sources. </p><p>She says, however, that industry funding cannot fund the sector alone. </p><p> It can support national innovation goals and relieve some burden on the public sector, [but] it cannot replace the foundational role of strong, sustained government investment in research and development   investment that enables research for public good, supports a diverse knowledge base and ensures Ireland s global competitiveness in the long-run,  Keating says.  We have called on the Government to undertake a major research investment programme. </p><p>A spokesperson for Trinity endorsed the comments made by the IUA and added that Trinity worked with industry  because it wants to make things better .</p><p>\u00d3 Maonaigh says industry funding can have public value, but says there is a pressing need for more transparency about who is funding what   and why. </p><p>Industrial funders are allowed to choose whether to keep their contributions confidential, while  commercial sensitivity  means access to information can be routinely denied to both researchers, journalists and the wider public. </p><p> It isn t always possible to know the information that we want,  says \u00d3 Maonaigh.  But we re not looking for the intellectual property of technologies, but simply what is the scale of investment going into certain departments. There is information held in a remote server at the Department of Enterprise, but it is difficult for the public or the academic community to measure it,  he says.</p><p>Reilly struggled to gather comprehensive data for the paper, because the data itself is scant.</p><p> It s so fragmented, even within government departments, so policymakers themselves don t have an accurate picture and map of industry funding,  she says.</p><p> While DFHERIS [the Department of Higher Education] releases some reporting on funding, it is limited. </p><p>With a requirement that publicly funded research centres secure funding from industry, \u00d3 Maonaigh   himself an early-career academic   points out that younger researchers can be particularly vulnerable to corporate pressure.</p><p> Early career academics are struggling with precarious work and lack of funding, so if an organisation comes along offering a salary, it s hard to say no. Perhaps there may be more freedom when someone is more advanced in their career,  he says.</p><h>Openly report </h><p/><h>In response, Keating says all IUA member universities openly report their research projects. </h><p> At any one time, there are a myriad of research projects at various stages of operation. If you look at, for instance, the University of Galway s Combustion Chemistry Centre, you will see the details of the project, including the commercial partners involved in supporting it. </p><p>This, Keating says, helps safeguard academic independence and ensure oversight when companies such as CRH fund research activities. </p><p>Stephens says, however, that private industry funding can constrain academics and research centres by ensuring that only companies with enough wealth get to dictate the agenda in the first place. </p><p> Geothermal energy, for instance, has so much potential, but it doesn t have a powerful lobby group, so it is under-recognised and underinvested. And how secure will academics feel to critique their key or future funders? These are the longer-term consequences that we need to consider. </p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["Rather, according to new PublicPolicy. ie research into funding of Irish universities by researchers at Maynooth University, it is increasingly becoming the norm   and Government policy is clear that the influence of corporates and the private sector is set to grow. Indeed, the establishment of technological universities and the Higher Education Act 2022 both play a role in increasing third-level and industry collaboration   especially in science and technology which, in 2022, secured 99 per cent of all industry funding, compared to just one per cent for humanities. In the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, State investment in higher education plummeted, with core public funding decreasing by 50 per cent between 2008 and 2019. In 2022, the Department of Further and Higher Education, Research, Innovation and Science (DFHERIS) reported a EUR 307m annual funding gap.

I'm lucky because it has taken me all around the world as a climate change negotiator, as an adviser to different governments and international agencies. After eight years of travelling with Mary Robinson as part of the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, I decided to turn my attention to Ireland.

I come from a different world, but I think greenwashing is a big problem - people using the word just because they can.</p><p>I feel like it has become the trendy little thing. You see content creators who are being sponsored by fast fashion suddenly talking about sustainable fashion. Because it's cool. It feels like you can just use the word - you don't have to find any depth in knowledge or the understanding.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara</emphasis>: I would say, though, I've seen a lot of these words come in and out over the years... but the overriding response we get in Change by Degrees when we help people understand what sustainability is - is surprise. They didn't know that sustainability was about human rights; they didn't know it was about their health and wellbeing; they didn't know it was about the representation of women in minorities in decision making - they just thought it was about boring old carbon and pollution.</p><p>Helping people to understand what the word means so they're also better able to hold the people who use it incorrectly to account is, I think, important.

I see an amazing lack of leadership. That failure is also an opportunity, I hope, for new leaders to be inspired enough to step in so our kids might grow up with a different style of leadership. I think what's really important is we don't all get dispirited and just switch off but rather to say, 'I'm going to use my sphere of influence to make the best impression,' do good for people, do good for the planet. Get reenergised by that.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pat</emphasis>: I do think in some ways we have regressed since the pandemic and the political climate. Sometimes these kinds of things tend to favour short-term solutions over the long-term sustainability initiatives we need to see. Now, we are looking at economic recovery, trying to deal with any sort of immediate issues around immigration, jobs, health. But I do think in many ways we have progressed as well. I'm seeing people become more conscious of individual impact, local sourcing is becoming more common; I see this with clients. There is a rise in sustainable consumption practices.</p><p>I do think there's growing public pressure for bigger systemic changes in areas of renewable energy, reducing waste, transportation. Even if I compare my little journey here over the past eight years, people were asking me, 'What are you doing? Are you crazy?' And now everybody is like, 'This is it. We have to do it.' I do feel like, as a collective, we're more conscious on where we need to go.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: It's a hard one, isn't it, because there is so much hopelessness sometimes that people feel with sustainability but I think all of us here are very hopeful - that's probably why we're all in these sectors. You have to be hopeful when it comes to this, especially with what's happening in the world.</p><p>We're filming a documentary at the moment all around the impact the fast fashion industry is having on our planet. I was over in Kenya at Dandora landfill, one of the biggest landfills in the world, and it was so heartbreaking and so scary to see.

If you remember back to covid, we talked about building back better. Do you remember that expression? We were going to learn the lessons of a global pandemic and we were going to do things differently. We haven't. We've just gone back to doing things exactly like we used to.</p><p>That's a very frustrating part of human nature. When we have such a deep experience, a lived experience, why doesn't it change how we do things?</p><p>Now we're in the midst of another crisis around cost of living, around the great geopolitical changes in the world... so again we have an opportunity to say, 'OK, in all of this mayhem, what's going to emerge from this?'</p><p>As people who care about other people and people who care about nature, that's where we need to be putting our heads together and getting organised and figuring out how we're going to find a way out of this current situation and into something better.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: What I'd love to see is more of this conscious mindset coming in and that people understand that if they do invest in this garment, they will hand it down from generation to generation.</p><p>Another big thing that I want to see come to life more is understanding the ingredients. It's very similar to food. Having better quality ingredients in what you have is not only better for the planet but also better for yourself. It's the same for fashion. The material I'm wearing now is sustainable wool - Irish woven fibre - and is much better than wearing a polyester fibre and then, if you're looking at the lifecycle of that garment, you're starting from nature, you're ending in nature.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara</emphasis>: I do not know why women accept to be dressed in plastic. I don't get it.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: I feel like sometimes a lot of people don't even know what polyester is actually made of. Or don't want to know.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conor</emphasis>: Same as food. People don't actually realise what it means. Because these items are given different names, it disguises the fact of what they are, and I see that in food as you see it in fashion, Aoife.</p><p>It's set up in a way that you have to google what you're wearing - because on the label it's going to say 30% cotton, 70% polyester, or whatever it is, and [they're] not realising its plastic. There's more plastic in that top than your credit card.</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">On where to start and why we don't have to be perfect</emphasis></h><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Conor</emphasis>: People are more and more aware but, with that, comes people being overwhelmed. They don't know where to start.</p><p>My youngest - she's 14 now - goes to McDonald's. I'm not going to say she doesn't. She goes with her friends and she has chicken nuggets. I've shown her the videos. I've shown her what the chicken nugget is.</p><p>I was driving her one day from school and she said, 'Can we go to the drive-thru?' And I said, 'You hardly want to get chicken nuggets. I told you - it's beaks, it's eyes...' She goes, 'Hang on a minute, you're all about food waste so, if that chicken is being killed, should we not be eating all of it?' This is where you have this young generation who think they know it all and they have smart answers and we have the parents who are trying to make changes. They are aware but they're overwhelmed.</p><p>It's [all about] making out positive, little steps - easy wins that give you confidence. All of a sudden, when you see these changes happening in your home, you kind of go, 'Wow, I can do that.' Don't set yourself up to fail. Be positive. Plan out. Make easy wins.</p><p>I know time is not on our side but, to bring people on the journey, I always say - set out a year,a 12-month plan. In my home, what am I going to do? Make it accessible.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Pat</emphasis>: Coming from my area of sustainable living, I would say try to embrace sustainable habits in your daily routine. Start with something very simple yet impactful.</p><p>It's not a massive lifestyle change. It's a small thing you can do. I'm always coming from a place where I'm encouraging people to audit their lifestyle. Look inside your bins and see what it is that you're wasting the most? It's such a small thing but, at the end of the week, what went into our bins? If there's a lot of food packaging, can I do better on that front? If there's a lot of composting waste, what happened there? Why did we throw away so much food?</p><p>It's not a cake recipe. We're not all going to all have the same issues because we have different lifestyles but understanding the problem and setting up your goals and what 'good' looks like could be a good place to start.</p><p>It is cost effective. I would love for people to start seeing that. Why would you go for a fashion haul when you can buy a very good piece or an item that will last you for years?</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Aoife</emphasis>: For me, it's can you do something small? Can you look to second-hand? Can you set up a vault on your account to start saving for that investment garment?</p><p>When you invest in something, when you spend that money and save for it, you really do appreciate it so much more than that fast-fashion or that cheaper purchase that you're not as connected to.</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Tara</emphasis>: Sustainability doesn't belong to green people. It belongs to everybody, and everybody belongs in the conversation. That is not a conversation for people who are perfect.</p><p>Conor just said he's not perfect. His kids eat McDonald's, my kids eat McDonald's. That's how it is. There is no perfect in this.</p><p>Know where your food comes from, read the label on your clothes, be curious. Then take an action. Do something different. When you take that action, think about how that makes you feel. Human beings are driven by emotional stories so tell the story of your action, not in a preachy way but rather like, 'It felt so good because I did this.'</p><p>Your friends and family and colleagues trust you and listen to you more than any politician, any expert.

After eight years of travelling with Mary Robinson as part of the Mary Robinson Foundation - Climate Justice, I decided to turn my attention to Ireland. That led me to write a book, How to Save Your Planet One Object at a Time, and to set up Change by Degrees. Conor Spacey: I'm 37 years cooking, which is long before the word 'sustainability' even appeared or anyone knew what it was. I founded a company 10 years ago called FoodSpace.

The churn might turn hollow. The cow might dry up. A neighbour's glance could curdle cream. The land, newly green and trembling with promise, was also thick with risk.<br/></p><h>May and fertility</h><p>We often speak of May Day as a festival of flowers, of fertility, of warmth returning to the land. But we forget how closely joy was braided with fear. That same May morning when bonfires blazed on hilltops and young people leapt the flames for luck, doors were bolted, fires watched, and wells guarded like treasure chests - not for what they held, but for what they might lose.</p><p>In the stories passed down, those suspected of butter theft were almost always women. Poor, widowed, solitary or simply somehow deemed 'odd'. A woman who asked for coal or a cup of milk on May morning might be enough to draw suspicion. <url normalizedValue=\"https://irishfolklore.wordpress.com/2017/04/30/the-folklore-of-may-day-bealtaine/\">\"Don't give anything away,\" people said. \"No fire, no milk, no water, no gifts</url>.\"</p><p>And so, in some parts, the countryside became a landscape of vigilance.</p><p>There were tales of old women dragging spancels - straw ropes used for cattle - through the dew of a neighbour's field, stealing milk with each slow sweep. Of hares spotted suckling on cows' udders at dawn. Of men chasing them with dogs, only to find, later, an injured woman behind a bolted door.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://www.nli.ie/news-stories/stories/there-once-was-welsh-priest-called-gerald\">Giraldus Cambrensis, </url>writing in the 12th century, tells of such transformations: women becoming hares, slipping through fences, stealing sustenance with teeth and tongue.</p><p>Shape-shifting, in these stories, is rarely a gift.</p><p>It is almost always a crime.</p><p>There was the threat of the well being \"burned\" by cinders dropped into it, a kind of curse cast by a visitor who came too early and left too fast. If the wrong person took the first water of the day, it could rob the community of its milk profit for the whole year. In response, families rose early. Some stayed up all night to guard the well. Others fetched the \"flower of the well\" before dawn and fed it to their cattle as protection.</p><p><br/></p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6690675/original/?width=580&amp;version=6690675\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>These rituals of defence were intricate and intimate. Rowan branches and yellow primroses were strung over doorways. Butter churns were chained. Bonfire smoke was gathered in bowls and carried back to the hearth. Holy water was sprinkled on animals. Some struck their cows with a quicker-berry switch to drive out the invisible.</p><h>The past and the present</h><p>It would be easy now to dismiss these practices as quaint or backwards. But they weren't just stories. They were systems of care. Memory-maps for surviving hunger, illness, isolation. And yes, they were also tools for control. For identifying enemies. For managing fear.</p><p>These customs also remind us of how gender, vulnerability, and power are deeply entangled. The accused were never random. They were women who lived alone. Women who owned little. Women who asked questions or offered herbs. Women whose usefulness had run out - or who refused to be used at all.</p><p>That logic is alive and well today.</p><p>We see it in the return of far-right rhetoric. In attacks on reproductive rights. In the demonisation of migrants. In how queerness, difference, dissent and refusal are once again made to stand trial in the court of public opinion. We see it in the algorithms. In the microphones of men who want women quiet and borders hard. In every politician who claims neutrality is outdated, as though peace were a luxury, not a commitment.</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"https://img2.thejournal.ie/inline/6690668/original/?width=580&amp;version=6690668\">Link to Image</url><br/></p><p>Here in Ireland, the debate around potential changes to our neutrality is one of the clearest signs of this erosion. For decades, our military neutrality rested on the principle that any deployment required the approval of the UN Security Council, the government and the D\u00e1il. The Triple Lock has <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.irishtimes.com/politics/2025/03/04/cabinet-signs-off-on-proposals-to-scrap-triple-lock-for-troop-deployments/\">now been loosened</url>. We are told it is pragmatic. Strategic. And yes, admittedly, we have a determined warmonger in Russia's Putin at the doors of Europe. The world is changing, and we have to acknowledge that. But this does signal a profound shift: from protection to participation. From principled caution to silent complicity.</p><p>Bealtaine, if we let it, can help us ask better questions.\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://irishpagan.school/\">Lora O'Brien and Jon O'Sullivan</url>\u00a0remind us that Bealtaine is not just about flowers and fire. They see it as a time to renew our commitment to protection, both practical and sacred. In their teachings, they urge us to walk the boundaries, to gather yellow blossoms, to cleanse our thresholds - not just with smoke or water, but with intention. Most importantly, they ask us to reflect on: What are we protecting? What needs to change? These are not abstract reflections, but urgent political questions. Around us, wars rage. Genocides unfold in real time. Governments fail or actively harm. Climate collapse accelerates. The bonfire on the hill cannot shield us from this. But it can still remind us of who we are when we gather around it.</p><h>Looking inward</h><p>From the <url normalizedValue=\"https://uisneach.ie/bealtaine/\">Hill of Uisneach</url> right across Ireland to <url normalizedValue=\"https://feilenabealtaine.ie/\">Dingle town,</url> Bealtaine is still celebrated, and regional traditions are embraced. The Uisneach Fire Festival brings people together to honour the sacred centre of Ireland, where flames are lit and rituals shared - part resistance, part renewal. In Dingle, where the Atlantic meets myth, Bealtaine is marked with seaside blessings, floral garlands and community walks that call in the season through joy and care.\u00a0</p><p>In Killorglin,\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.facebook.com/maydaykerry/\">the Bealtaine festival</url> founded by the\u00a0<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.kfest.ie/news/remembering-conor-browne-a-pillar-of-k-fest-and-the-killorglin-community/\">late Conor Browne </url>continues to grow, bringing together art, ritual, music and politics in ways that honour both ancestral memory and urgent present-day solidarities between people, land and the spirit of collective care. Folklorists and historians like <url normalizedValue=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/au/podcast/bealtaine-the-hill-of-uisneach-handfasting-and/id1484857885?i=1000653706285\">Shelly Mooney in Wexford </url>and <url normalizedValue=\"https://tradition.ie/folklore/\">Billy Mag Fhloinn in Kerry</url> have worked to recover and reimagine these traditions for new generations. MagFhlionn's contributions to F\u00e9ile na Bealtaine in Dingle bring a theatrical and communal energy to contemporary celebrations, bridging folklore and embodied practice in vivid, provocative ways, most notably through the <url normalizedValue=\"https://tradition.ie/pagan-rave/\">Pagan Rave Project</url>.</p><p>These revivals matter because they resist the hollowing out of seasonal knowledge and communal time. They hold open a space where slowness is not failure, where repetition is not redundancy, but remembrance. They remind us that ritual can still be a form of resistance - a way to insist on presence in a world that demands acceleration, distraction, forgetting.</p><p>To gather, to light a fire, to walk the bounds of your place: these acts are quiet refusals. Of extraction. Of disposability. Of the myth that we are separate from the land, or from one another.</p><p>And yet, even as these festivals flourish, they do so in tension with a broader landscape of loss - ecological, spiritual, civic. A world where the weather is stranger, the soil more tired, the commons ever more divided. Where the rituals may survive, but the conditions they once protected against now roar louder than ever.</p><p>And now somehow the dew is harder to find. The grass is fenced off, chemically treated, bought up by developers who speak of land as \"assets\" and rain as \"risk.\" The bonfires still burn - but now they're surrounded by hazard tape, or else condemned entirely.</p><p><br/></p><p>What we once did to honour the season, to mark our kinship with soil and seed, we now outsource to corporations who sponsor tree-planting drives while cutting down forests elsewhere.</p><p>But still. Still, the impulse remains. In the rise of community gardens on vacant plots. In the school strike signs that say there is no planet B, and the fierce clarity in young faces. In people standing between bulldozers and bogland. In the quiet refusals - the ones who walk the canal instead of shopping, who repair instead of replace, who share instead of hoard. In the faces of the young, and the brilliant students I am privileged to teach at DCU, who ask sharp questions, who volunteer, who understand advocacy and activism, who imagine better ways of living together, even when the news tells them not to. In students across Ireland and the world who refuse despair, and make solidarity into practice.</p><h>Irish spirit</h><p>Bealtaine was never about passive celebration. It was a reckoning. A refusal to surrender to coldness. A flare to say: life matters here. And we will guard it, if we must, with flame.<br/><br/>And flame, of course, is never singular.</p><p>There is the fire that razes, that bombs, that incinerates. But there is also the fire of communion. Of bonfires lit not just to warm, but to warn. To gather. To signal across distance. To hold space. There is the fire of protest. Of workers who walk out. Of marches that clog streets with possibility. Of vigils, songs, fists - not only lifted in fury, but in collective clarity.</p><p>This, too, is May Day.</p><p>Because May Day belongs not only to the land, but to those who labour upon it, and beyond it. To the ones who rise up when the land is hoarded, when care is undervalued, when work is invisibilised. It is the day of garment workers and carers, dockers and teachers, farmhands and freelancers. It is etched in union banners and whispered at kitchen tables. It reminds us that labour isn't just what's waged - it's what's required for any of us to survive.</p><p>May Day insists that these labours, too, are sacred. That fire isn't only for mourning or warning, but for insisting: another way is possible. So yes, Bealtaine is about butter and blossoms - but also about barricades. About collective bargaining. About housing that doesn't break us. About reproductive autonomy. About climate justice. About rights-rights not as theory, but as breath. As bone.</p><p>And so, yes. It's easy now to say the world is on fire and mean it literally. Australia, the US and Greece. The Amazon. Gaza. Khartoum. Our housing systems. Our summers. The temperature rises like a pulse, like the rage we've tried too long to suppress.</p><p>And yes, despite everything that's been stolen - butter, land, futures - we still gather. Still tend. Still leap the flames. Not because we are untouched by grief, but because grief has taught us how to protect what remains.</p><p>The rituals may have shifted shape, but their core still holds.</p><p>We face the thresholds together - barefoot, trembling, bright with defiance - lit by what we still carry: the courage to imagine otherwise.\u00a0</p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Dr Fiona Murphy is an anthropologist based in the School of Applied Language &amp; Intercultural Studies at Dublin City University.\u00a0</emphasis>\u00a0</p><p>\u00a0</p><p><br/></p>", "publisher": "The Journal (Ireland)", "instances": ["That fire isn't only for mourning or warning, but for insisting: another way is possible.

It is a beacon that upended centuries of Catholic church teaching by framing a dialogue for all of humanity. It embraced green radicalism, pleading for collective action to rescue Mother Earth. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Subtitled  On the Care of our Common Home , the challenges it presented went beyond  tagging God into the global conversation on climate change    and the target was far beyond the world s 1.2 billion Catholics. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Published in June 2015, the message of Laudato Si  (Praise Be to You) was arresting; the accompanying environmental audit of the world was breathtaking. It was designed to transmit a message of  serious moral responsibility  to protect the environment. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Francis highlighted human damage to the planet that had exacerbated poverty, particularly in the developing world.  A true  ecological debt  exists, particularly between the global north and south,  it said, citing over-exploitation of resources and a throwaway lifestyle of the better-off that is frequently incompatible with a sustainable world. </p><p>He was clear on where obligations rested: almost totally among wealthier countries and powerful multinational corporations. </p><p> It is our marching orders for advocacy,  Archbishop Joseph Kurtz of the US Congress of Catholic Bishops said. </p><p>Columban missionary Fr Se\u00e1n McDonagh, an unlikely contributor to the document, says Laudato Si   is probably the best encyclical I have seen going back to the 19th century . </p><p>In his book Laudato Si : an Irish Response (2017), McDonagh wrote it  is the first papal document to understand the magnitude of the ecological destruction taking place globally and the urgency with which it must be faced . </p><p>It rows back on biblical tradition, he says, which dictated that mankind multiply and take over the Earth including every living creature. </p><p>It addresses  the central issue of our time   climate change   and destruction of biodiversity , McDonagh says, but 10 years on  unfortunately, the Catholic church didn t take seriously the message in Laudato Si  . </p><p>It is seldom at the centre of Christian faith today, he says. And given the world is closer to climate tipping points and scientific evidence provides unprecedented clarity,  a new Laudato Si  is required . </p><p>On a personal basis, he says he had  a poor enough record with the Vatican  because of his 1990 book The Greening of the Church, which said it must address the global population issue. </p><p>McDonagh s involvement was initiated after he wrote an article for the Universal Catholic in November 2013. He got a call from Cardinal Peter Turkson, the pope s leading climate adviser, who asked him to write a paper on connections between justice and the creation. </p><p>He told the cardinal he had a fractious relationship with his predecessor Cardinal Renato Martino, especially after he had run a Vatican conference in 2007 and invited six climate sceptics from the US. That did not preclude McDonagh s input. </p><p>Within the church, the encyclical was criticised as negating the Christian tradition, but from conversations with Francis after its publication, McDonagh says, the pope was undeterred and displayed profound understanding of ecology and this was reflected in subsequent sermons. </p><p>As  an ageing atheist , the late environmentalist Michael Viney, in a 2017 column in The Irish Times, praised the encyclical:  I can only cheer the greening of the church in such an influential manner.  </p><p>He praised McDonagh s crusade of over 30 years for  ecotheology , but said:  Laudato Si  quite failed to acknowledge human overpopulation as the driver of planetary degradation.  </p><h>Natural ecosystems</h><p/><h> Viney noted, however, the encyclical s value in granting to natural ecosystems  an intrinsic value independent of their usefulness. Each organism, as a creature of God, is good and admirable in itself . . .   </h><p>Laudato Si  was  timed to be political  in advance of the annual UN gathering of almost 200 countries on climate action, Cop21 in Paris, says Lorna Gold, director of the Laudato Si  Movement. Pope Francis was  a political mover  and it was accompanied by a successful diplomatic offensive, she says. </p><p>It fed into an ambitious coalition including Christiana Figueres, then executive secretary of the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change; lead architect of the landmark Paris Agreement, Laurence Tubiana, and small island states (arguably the most vulnerable to climate disruption). This was a key catalyst in forging the historic Paris Agreement. </p><p>In addressing  all people on the planet , Francis went beyond his flock, Gold says.  One of the revolutionary things is that it was the first church document to quote science, philosophy, poetry. It was not self-reverential as so many documents were in the past.  </p><p>Pope Francis called for an intense and fruitful dialogue between religion and science, where, in the words of theologian Fr Dermot A Lane,  the human is the culmination of the unfolding history of the cosmos and the evolution of life on Earth . </p><p>The encyclical said:  The divine and the human meet in the slightest detail in the seamless garment of God s creation, in the last speck of dust of our planet. </p><p>It emerged from wide consultation   including contributions from Ireland, especially from McDonagh on biodiversity    which made it more rounded , Gold says. This meant it was well received among environmental luminaries of the left such as Bill McKibben, Naomi Klein and former president Mary Robinson. </p><p>A decade on,  it has been a harder struggle in bringing it into the mainstream of the church than you would have thought , Gold says. </p><p>It does not get talked about often as negative stories surface, including clerical sex abuse, but there is a vibrant movement around Laudato Si , Gold says. In the timeline of the church, 10 years is the blink of an eye, so this is laying foundations. </p><h>Movement</h><p/><h> The movement is established in 191 countries including Ireland but concentrated in the Global South. More than 25,000  animators  have been trained  to lead efforts to bring Laudato Si  to their communities and to green the church . </h><p> Whether it s a transformation of the church, it s too early to say. There s a vibrancy and people relate this to their faith and to social justice,  Gold says. </p><p>Despite internal opposition, Francis worked to advocate for  ecological conversion  and  integral ecology . </p><p>The church s leadership has taken a strong position on the unfolding climate and biodiversity crises. It has not endorsed the proposed Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty, a global initiative to accelerate the transition to renewable energy, but more than 100 Catholic institutions have done so. </p><p>Many parts of the church have divested from fossil fuels and Francis spoke out on the need to keep fossil fuels in the ground   much to the ire of Big Oil. </p><h>Common stand</h><p/><h> In advance of Cop26, the UN climate summit held in Glasgow in 2021, the Vatican hosted a meeting of world religious leaders who took a common stand on environment in the hope it would raise ambitions of global leaders. It was attended by 40 faith leaders of the world s major religions and scientists from 20 countries. They called for  ecological conversion rooted in the common good . </h><p>Days before Cop26, on BBC Radio 4 s  Thought for the Day , Francis said only urgent action could  offer concrete hope to future generations  and called on leaders to  take radical decisions . </p><p>Overall, however, Cop26 was a failure; a call to  consign coal power to history  did not happen. Last-minute interventions by China and India weakened the final text. </p><p>Francis s concern about persistent lack of political will in the run-up to Cop28 in Dubai in 2023 (which he had been due to attend, only to withdraw because of illness), and the fractious global context in which climate was being discussed, led him to double down on his climate message. </p><p>He published an apostolic letter, Laudate Deum (Praise God), calling out specifically the influence of corporate interests in multilateral processes at Cop summits.

Not only Little Women, but also her other books in the series. I remember being so happy to discover that the story didn't end with the sisters still living at home. We moved to Belfast when I was 13, and I was heartbroken when I discovered that the only trunk that mattered - the one containing our books - had been lost en route. Decades later, I still feel the heartbreak. For some reason, one book that did make it was a primary school prize of Tales of the Arabian Nights. It was my first inkling that books could also take you to the utterly unknown and exotic, and I was enthralled by it.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">My favourite classic read I'm probably like many others and find it hard not to include Jane Austen in this category. I adore her wit, the irony of so much of her writing, and her acuity in presenting the limited life choices of women in her social class at that era. My mother bought me Austen's collected works one Christmas, a present I still treasure.</p><p>The book I recommend to others Invisible Women: Exposing Data Bias in a World Designed for Men by Caroline Criado Perez exposes the male-centred nature of the world we live in, from seatbelts designed to protect male bodies; a male-dominant medical model that results in doctors not being taught that women's symptoms of heart attacks differ considerably to those of men; to protective clothing that women struggle to wear. I could rant on!</p><p>Women were only hired by the New York Philharmonic Orchestra after a lawsuit in the 1970s, when 'blind auditions' were instituted, preventing any continuance of male bias. It's a book that I would make compulsory reading on every curriculum.</p><p>The book that's made the most impact Sheila Rowbotham published Women, Resistance and Revolution in 1972. At the time I was a young student, involved with women's liberation, struggling with the lack of any knowledge of the history of Irish women, and being told by lecturers that women hadn't done anything. Rowbotham showed that women had always been at the scene of the action and gave me the confidence to begin researching the contribution made by women in Ireland. For that, I will always be in her debt. In more recent times the team at Cork University that has given us the Atlas of the Irish Revolution and Atlas of the Irish Civil War have done Irish society a huge service. They are vast tomes, covering a huge array of topics, and I find myself returning frequently to their pages.</p><p>My favourite author That's a hard one, with so many terrific authors around. Margaret Atwood, Ann Patchett and Maggie O'Farrell write brilliant novels, tackling big issues in a rich variety of settings, and Edna O'Brien has been a heroine since the days of The Country Girls. Her last book, Girl, was an extraordinary achievement.</p><p>My comfort read Comfort for me partly derives from being immersed in lengthy, satisfying reads, with believable characters in settings that appeal to the historian in me. About ten years ago I immersed myself in Elizabeth Jane Howard's The Cazalet Chronicles - a five-book, elegantly written family saga, ranging from the Great War to the 1950s. So many issues are covered - childhood, class, family, fidelity, war, betrayal, the decline of upper-class life and traditions.

We see it in our stormy skies and in the floodwaters inundating our communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We feel it in our throats and lungs when we inhale polluted air, and on our skin as we walk down the street during heat waves.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">World leaders would convene every year to make decisions and deals, compromises and commitments, always falling far short of delivering what was needed to mitigate and, increasingly, to adapt to climate change. This year's United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop29) was no exception.</p><p>All this inertia has spurred some to try to find a way around the hard work of ending harmful greenhousegas emissions, protecting critical ecosystems, and rethinking economic growth and development.</p><p>One proposed \"solution\" being pushed by a small but vocal minority in the Global North, is solar geoengineering, which involves modifying Earth's atmosphere to create a reflective barrier against the sun's radiation. For today's youth and future generations, however, such interventions threaten to be as catastrophic as climate change.</p><p>Solar geoengineering can take many forms, including the release of huge amounts of sulphur particles into the stratosphere to create a reflective barrier against sunlight (stratospheric aerosol injection) and the injection of salt spray into shallow marine clouds (marine cloud brightening).</p><p>But it never addresses the root causes of the climate crisis, and it involves modifying our planet's atmosphere in ways that cannot be adequately tested at scale, with effects that will last decades or longer.</p><p>Geoengineering research has always been controversial for precisely these reasons. Countless scientists and experts have warned that the approach could cause far-reaching unintended consequences.</p><p>Studies show, for example, that it could disrupt climate and weather patterns, leading to severe droughts, hurricanes, and other extreme weather. These risks are unpredictable, and their effects would be unequally distributed.</p><p>In fact, solar geoengineering would amplify existing global power imbalances, not least because decisions about its deployment would be made primarily by rich countries in the Global North - the same countries that created the climate crisis.</p><p>These countries nurtured a deadly phenomenon, the burden of which is falling disproportionately on vulnerable communities, and now they propose a highly risky strategy that, even in the best-case scenario, would not solve the problem.</p><p>None of these objections has prevented millions of euro from being funnelled - largely by tech and finance billionaires - into solar geoengineering initiatives. Proponents suggest that such initiatives are a temporary fix, a way to buy more time for mitigation and adaptation. To us, such statements sound like dangerous castles in the air - appealing but illusory.</p><p>It is far more likely that solar geoengineering would provide an excuse for the world's major emitters not to end their fossil-fuel addiction. This compounds the threat of a \"termination shock\": if solar-geoengineering efforts were abruptly halted, rapid warming would ensue.</p><p>Future generations - including today's young people - would thus have to confront dangerous spikes in temperature and far more acute crises than those we face now.</p><p>If nothing else, we will be the ones footing the bill for the economic and societal transformation that climate change demands - a transformation that is not receiving adequate investment today. Advocates of solar geoengineering like to frame it as a \"cheap\" solution, but diverting resources from initiatives that we know work - and do not risk the health of our planet - cannot possibly be considered sound financial management. Instead, it amounts to offloading the hard work of addressing the carbon debt onto our generation and those that follow us.</p><p>That is why we advocate a full ban on solar geoengineering. And we are not alone. More than 2,000 civilsociety organisations, including Fridays For Future, and over 540 academics have called for an International Non-Use Agreement on Solar Geoengineering.</p><p>Countries on the front lines of the climate crisis, such as Vanuatu and others, have similarly opposed the use of such technologies.</p><p>Some loud - and, no doubt, well-funded - voices might accuse opponents like us of being closed-minded, suggesting that we should be more willing to engage in dialogue on the topic. But this is merely a ploy to dismiss a position backed by ample research.</p><p>The small group of wellfunded young individuals advocating research into solar geoengineering are often connected to organisations known for promoting these controversial technologies, raising the suspicion that they are being co-opted to give solar geoengineering the guise of youth support.</p><p>The last thing young people need is to be left shouldering the responsibility of yet another crisis we did not create.

Here, as countries around the world celebrate International Women s Day on March 8th, we present a portrait of 25 Irish women who have provided leadership, instigated change and bought hope to others in the first quarter of this century. We celebrate Irish women and their stories, from Katie Taylor pretending to be a boy to get her first chance in the boxing ring to Mary McAleese exclaiming  wow  as Queen Elizabeth II began her speech in Irish at Dublin Castle for her historic State visit in 2011. Starting in 2000, we offer a year-by-year snapshot, documenting early successes, lifetime achievements and moments that have shaped lives and had far-reaching effects on Irish society.</p><h>2000 </h><h>Sonia O Sullivan </h><h>On 25th September 2000, all Irish eyes were on Sydney, as O Sullivan lined up for what would be the crowning race of her career. As she rounded the final bend of the 5000m Olympic final, it looked for a moment as though gold might be there for the taking, but alas Romanian Gabriela Szabo had the legs on the day. O Sullivan crossed the line in silver medal position, in a national record that still stands to this day, and became the first and (so far) only Irish woman to win an Olympic medal on the track. A world champion, three-time European Champion, two-time World Cross Country Champion, and, until recently, a World Record holder (her 2000m world record stood until 2017), she is arguably the best sportsperson this country has seen, and an undoubted inspiration for the crop of talent that has followed in her footsteps. </h><h>  Niamh Donnelly </h><h>2001</h><h>Deirdre O Kane </h><h>In 2001, Deirdre O Kane was being touted as a  face to watch  at the Edinburgh Festival, as she performed her first-full length show there. She would go on to perform at this festival every year thereafter, becoming more than a face to watch, but a stalwart of the comedy and entertainment scene. Her career has been a robust and varied one. As an actor, she s toured with Druid Theatre Company, appeared in Paths to Freedom (2000), Intermission (2003), and Moone Boy (2012   2015), and won an Irish Film and Television Award for her portrayal of children s rights campaigner, Christina Noble, in the 2014 feature, Noble. When she started out in the comedy circuit, she was one of the few female faces on the scene, and she has blazed a trail for Irish women in stand-up.

This support of the world s most vulnerable is perhaps the defining element of a career that has included becoming the youngest Reid Professor of Constitutional Law at Trinity College Dublin; working to decriminalise homosexuality, legalise contraception and divorce, and enable women to sit on juries; and serving as the first female president of Ireland, from 1990 1997. Robinson was the first Head of State to visit Rwanda following the 1994 genocide, and the first Head of State to visit Somalia after the 1992 crisis. Now in her 80s, she remains an active campaigner for peace and climate justice. She is a member of the Elders, a group of independent global leaders working for peace, justice, human rights, and a sustainable planet, founded by Nelson Mandela. </h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><h>  ND</h><p/><h>2003 Marian Keyes </h><p/><h>A stalwart of the Irish fiction world and a fierce champion of homegrown writing, Marian Keyes started her career in 1995 with the hilarious novel Watermelon. By 2003, she was seven books into her career and Watermelon was about to be released on to the screen in a film adaptation starring Anna Friel and Brenda Fricker. Keyes  career has only gone from strength to strength since. Her whip-smart, empathetic stories, coupled with her own honesty and vulnerability about her personal life, including her time in rehab for addiction and the later depression she experienced, have seen her become a beloved force in Irish publishing. In the early 2000s, the phrase   chicklit   was still being used to describe commercial fiction penned by women. Keyes was among the authors   like Maeve Binchy, Cathy Kelly and Sheila O Flanagan   who showed that fiction about women could be accessible while plumbing the depths of human experience.   Marian Keyes introduced the world to a particularly witty Irish sense of humour,  says author Edel Coffey.  But she also showed Irish writers that you didn t have to emulate other voices or literary styles to be successful but rather you could be totally authentically yourself and still connect with a large international readership.

A former nurse, Leahy cofounded the Trust in 1975 (it was just  the Trust  then) after </h><p>years spent working with the Simon community in Dublin. In the years since she has been chairwoman of the Sentence Review Group and a former Irish Human Rights Commissioner as well as a writer, broadcaster and lecturer. Her focus throughout has been on battling the issue of social exclusion and helping people who have been left behind. Her memoir, The Stars Are Our Only Warmth, co-written with Catherine Cleary was published in 2018, the same year she was awarded the International Human Rights &amp; Nursing Award from The International Care Ethics Observatory and the Humanitarian of the Year Award from the Irish Red Cross. She s one of the people who makes life in Ireland bearable for the most vulnerable.

Born in Addis Ababa, Negga grew up in Limerick and later London, and by the early 2000s was working across the stage, television and film. Just 10 years after Breakfast on Pluto she received an Oscar nomination for her role as Mildred Loving in the film Loving, about the real-life interracial couple who helped overturn anti-miscegenation laws in 1960s America.

AB</p><h>2006 Garry Hynes </h><p/><h>In 2006 Hynes was awarded Freedom of the City of Galway, the city s highest bestowed honour, having cofounded the Druid Theatre Company there 31 years previously, the first professional theatre company outside Dublin. The world-renowned director had already made history in 1998 as the first woman to win a Tony Award for Directing (her work on Martin McDonagh s debut, The Beauty Queen of Leenane, was recognised on the occasion). From working with McDonagh, to Enda Walsh, to frequent collaborations with the late Tom Murphy, Hynes has had a defining influence on Irish theatre. She has brought new life to old work, and helped to shape a new generation of theatre makers. In 2005, Fintan O Toole described DruidSynge, her production of all six of John Millington Synge s plays, as  one of the greatest achievements in the history of Irish theatre .

In 1993, transgender Kildare woman Lydia Foy sought a new birth certificate with her female gender. She was refused, and brought High Court proceedings in 1997. While her claim was rejected in 2002, in 2007 the case was brought back to court and the judge found that her rights under the European Convention on Human Rights had been violated. This significant result was initially appealed, and in the end it took until 2014 for Foy to settle her action against the State, which pledged to introduce a Gender Recognition Act. This was enacted into Irish law in 2015 and meant that such an onerous legal journey would no longer be necessary for other Irish trans people.

Who can forget her green dress, or her breakout performance as Briony Tallis in Atonement, for which she received the nomination in the Best Supporting Actress category. In the years that have followed, Ronan has flown the flag for the Irish in Hollywood, with three more Academy Award nominations to her name, along with seven British Academy Film Award nominations, and a Golden Globe win for her portrayal of Lady Bird in Greta Gerwig s 2017 film of the same name. Her serious approach to her art form matched with her unpretentious demeanour, her feminist attitude, and her support of up-and-comers, has made her a much admired and beloved figure in Irish arts.

Born in Belfast in 1934, McGuinness has made monumental contributions to Irish life over several decades. She was appointed as the first female judge to the Circuit Court in 1994, subsequently becoming a High Court and a Supreme Court judge. McGuinness also served as a Senator and as a member of the Council of State for Presidents Hillery and Higgins. Her active involvement in public service shaped Ireland s legal and social landscape   she is a former President of the Law Reform Commission and served on the Kilkenny incest investigation. McGuinness s trailblazing legacy is celebrated in a portrait at the National Gallery, recognising her lifelong commitment to justice.

I am a republican. I will be a First Minister for all,  she pledged, hoping to again usher in a new era of change. The daughter of former IRA prisoner and Sinn F\u00e9in councillor Brendan Doris, O Neill had her first child aged 16, while still at secondary school. She became vice-president of Sinn F\u00e9in in 2018, a post she still holds.   ND</h><p/><h>2011 Mary McAleese </h><p/><h>As the second-ever female Irish president, Mary McAleese was already making history when she successfully invited Queen Elizabeth II to Ireland for a historic State visit in May 2011. The visit necessitated the largest security operation in the history of the Republic, but overall was seen as a symbol of the normalisation of the relations between the Republic of Ireland and United Kingdom, and a direct result of the Belfast Agreement. McAleese, who grew up in Belfast, described the visit as an  extraordinary moment in Irish history  and a sign of the success of the peace process. That McAleese herself was seen to exclaim  wow  when the Queen opened her speech at Dublin Castle with the phrase  A Uachtar\u00e1in agus a chairde  showed just how significant an event it was.   AB</h><p/><h>2012 Katie Taylor </h><p/><h>Goosebumps rippled across the ExCel Arena from the moment Katie Taylor walked into the ring for the women s lightweight Olympic final, until the final victorious blows. London was green, white, and gold. Chants of Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9, Ol\u00e9, and Ireland, Ireland, Ireland drowned out the commentary. It seemed this moment had been written in the stars. From her early days pretending to be a boy so she could get into boxing competitions; to fighting in the first officially sanctioned female boxing match in Ireland, aged 15; to being a leading force in the campaign to get women s boxing into the Olympics, Taylor s 2012 Olympic glory couldn t have been more fortuitous. She is widely credited with putting women s boxing on the map, an undertaking she has continued to uphold in her professional career   she competed in the first women s boxing match to headline Madison Square Garden (Taylor v Serrano, 2022), and in the most-watched women s professional sporting event in US history (Taylor v Serrano, 2024). A recent survey confirmed that she is Ireland s most popular sports person.

In the early 2010s, Corless began researching the Bon Secours Mother and Baby Home in Tuam, later publishing an article asking if children had been buried on the site of a septic tank at the home. Between 2011 and 2013 she obtained the death records for children who died in the home, with her story breaking in the national media one year later. In 2017, it was confirmed that a number of human remains   including those of babies and children   were found at the Tuam site. Thanks to Corless s tenacious work, the dark history of these long-running institutions was finally acknowledged and the State apologised for failing the mothers and children who lived in them.

A member of the Religious Sisters of Charity since 1958, Sr Stan (as she is fondly known) had graduated with a Bachelor in Social Science in 1969, and a Master of Social Science in 1980. She has dedicated her life to campaigning for the marginalised in society, particularly those in poverty and homelessness. In 1985, she founded Focus Point, which would later become the homeless charity Focus Ireland, one of the largest voluntary organisations in the country. In 2001, she established the Immigrant Council of Ireland, an organisation that promotes the rights of migrants in Ireland.   ND</h><p/><h>2015  Breege O Donoghue</h><p/><h> From rural Co Clare, Breege O Donoghue was born into an Ireland that did not expect women to become accomplished businesspeople. But after an  accidental  career in hotel management that began in Galway, she joined Penneys in 1979 to set up its human resources department. At that time, it had 24 stores. It now has 350 stores across 11 countries. As the first woman on the Penneys board, she had a long and impactful career at the company until 2016, when she called time after 37 years. The year before she finished, the store reached a milestone moment when Primark (its international arm) opened its first United States store in Boston. O Donoghue was instrumental in this new phase for the company, showing exactly why she has earned such a fierce reputation in business.   AB</h><p/><h>2016 </h><p/><h>Lian Bell </h><p/><h>When members of Ireland s theatre community noticed the Abbey Theatre s centenary programme for 2016 was heavily male-dominated, they did more than complain to the theatre   they started a grassroots movement. The reaction to the programme sparked the campaign #WakingTheFeminists, with artist Lian Bell as campaign director and tens of other artists involved. A public meeting was held at the Abbey in late 2015, where #WakingTheFeminists called for equality for women across the Irish theatre sector. Its calls were heard   it was commissioned by the Arts Council to undertake research into gender balance into the Irish theatre in 2016, and the results were shared with the public that year. The movement forced the Abbey Theatre and Irish theatre as a whole to reckon with how women had been treated in this sector of the arts, leading to new gender policies, codes of behaviour, unconscious bias training and more.   AB</h><h>2017 Sally Rooney </h><p/><h>In 2017, a 26-year-old Irish woman published what The New Yorker called  a new kind of adultery novel . Conversations with Friends had been acquired by publisher, Faber, in a seven-way auction. Its author had recently been shortlisted for the Sunday Times Short Story Award, for her story Mr Salary. Clearly, things were about to take off for Sally Rooney. But just how stratospheric her rise would be was unfathomable to most. The publication, a year later, of her second novel, Normal People, followed by a wildly successful TV adaptation starring Paul Mescal, would garner the admiration of everyone from Sarah Jessica Parker to Kourtney Kardashian. But superstardom aside, it was clear that Rooney had pioneered a new kind of fiction, one whose imitators would be numerous. She has gone on to publish two more successful novels, Beautiful World Where Are You (2021), and Intermezzo (2024). Beyond her literary prowess, she has navigated her elevated status with grace, shying away from the limelight except on rare occasions, when she might advocate for Palestinian rights, or deliver a clear-minded takedown of the Irish government s approach to housing.

In 2018, she cofounded the award-winning social enterprise, Change by Degrees, with the aim of making sustainability convenient for businesses and communities. She is also an advocate for women in science and in January 2019, she travelled to Antarctica as part of Homeward Bound, a global leadership programme for women in science. In 2020, she was appointed to a senior UN role, to facilitate the delivery of Paris Agreement goals.

Born in 1946, Smyth first became involved in activism in the 1970s during the days of the women s liberation movement. In 2022, she was awarded the freedom of Dublin city. In 2019, Smyth was named as one of Time s 100 Most Influential People alongside her co-directors of Together for Yes, Grainne Griffin and Orla O Connor, in recognition of their roles in the campaign to legalise abortion in Ireland.

She grew up in the Labre Park Traveller Housing Site in Ballyfermot in Dublin. Her mother died of pneumonia at the young age of 48. Flynn was diagnosed with dyslexia at the age of 18. She attended Trinity College as part of an access programme, before attending the Ballyfermot College of Further Education and earning a degree in community development from Maynooth University. Over the years she has been an activist with the Irish Travellers Movement, the National Traveller Women s Forum and the Ballyfermot Action Programme. She has campaigned against racism and prejudice and for marriage equality, housing and abortion rights. Since 2020 she has been a tireless voice for equality in the Seanad. Young Traveller writer and activist Emma Ward says of Flynn:  I consider Eileen to be a role model. What she has done during her time as a senator really is amazing ... I hope I can be as brilliant an activist as she has been.    PF</h><p/><h>2021 Patricia Scanlon </h><p/><h>2021 represented a kind of crossroads for Patricia Scanlon. That was the year that the entrepreneur and engineer became executive chair of SoapBox Labs, the company she founded in 2013, having transferred from the chief executive position as funding poured in: by 2021, the company had raised over $12 million in funding to support their endeavours. Soapbox offers voice technology for children to assist with their reading skills, as well as helping them interact well in educational settings. The technology was inspired by her three-year-old daughter, after Scanlon had observed her behaviour responding to a poorly formatted educational reading game on an iPad. Named by Forbes magazine in 2018 as one of the world s top 50 women in tech, in 2022, after selling her company to US education company Curriculum Associates, the Naas native became Ireland s first Artificial Intelligence ambassador, appointed by the Irish government to provide support to government departments and other agencies in relation to the hazards and opportunities created by AI.

He was one of the first people in the state prosecuted under that law, and the court heard the abuse included harassment, threats and sending 30,000 messages to the woman. Judge Martin Nolan told the court that Moody made his ex-partner s life  hell . The survivor in this case was Nicola Hanney, who the following year waived her anonymity for the RT\u00c9 documentary Taking Back Control.  I feel that if I don t break my silence how can I send a positive message to other people that are living in these situations?  Hanney told RT\u00c9. She was widely praised for sharing her story, which included calling for more support for survivors to help them leave abusive relationships and raising awareness about relationship  red flags .  Nicola has been a huge inspiration to women around Ireland who are subjected to coercive control,  says Sarah Benson, chief executive of Women s Aid. </h><p> By sharing her account of abuse at the hands of her former partner she broke the silence that surrounds abuse in Ireland. Women s voices and experiences are critical and should be at the heart of the national conversation on zero tolerance of all forms of gender-based violence.

As a little person, she grew up with parents (Chris and Kath) who founded the organisation Little People of Ireland in 1998, and so understood early on the power of advocating for yourself. Though she trained as a teacher, it was Burke s interest in the fashion industry and how she interrogated its treatment of disabled people on her blog Minnie M\u00e9lange that put her on the radar of high-powered people including US president Barack Obama, who invited her to the White House in 2016. </h><p>She s since founded the accessibility consultancy Tilting the Lens, been the first little person to attend the Met Gala in 2019, run a podcast, written a book (Break the Mould) and appeared on the cover of British Vogue in 2019 and again in 2023, when she also served as a consultant editor. Having already made such a large impact, Burke continues to blaze a trail in the worlds of disability activism, fashion and beyond.

The then 21-year-old had just won a silver medal in the 400m, and run a national record of 49.07 seconds, but it is perhaps the measure of her mettle and ambition that she felt she could have achieved more. </h><p>Later that same year, she would compete in her first Olympics, coming fourth in a 400m final that saw the Olympic record broken. She would also help the women s relay team to another nail-biting fourth, and grip the entire country. </p><p>With national records in every sprint event from 60m to 400m, and a dazzling contract from sporting brand Nike, Adeleke is possibly the most talented sprinter Ireland has ever seen. On and off the track, she inspires young athletes with her talent and positive attitude.

This support of the world s most vulnerable is perhaps the defining element of a career that has included becoming the youngest Reid Professor of Constitutional Law at Trinity College Dublin; working to decriminalise homosexuality, legalise contraception and divorce, and enable women to sit on juries; and serving as the first female president of Ireland, from 1990 1997. Robinson was the first Head of State to visit Rwanda following the 1994 genocide, and the first Head of State to visit Somalia after the 1992 crisis. Now in her 80s, she remains an active campaigner for peace and climate justice. She is a member of the Elders, a group of independent global leaders working for peace, justice, human rights, and a sustainable planet, founded by Nelson Mandela.

By 2003, she was seven books into her career and Watermelon was about to be released on to the screen in a film adaptation starring Anna Friel and Brenda Fricker. Keyes  career has only gone from strength to strength since.

She has gone on to publish two more successful novels, Beautiful World Where Are You (2021), and Intermezzo (2024).

Mental health is affected by a wide variety of issues and circumstances meaning it can not be addressed with one  quick fix . It requires a multifaceted and multidepartmental approach from government and society. </p><p>Cliona (26) believes young adult mental health has been affected more than ever before.  Young people have so much access to news and what s happening around them that it s impossible to be insulated against it. </p><p>News has become more readily available with constant alerts, fake news included, and social media platforms consistently alerting users with targeted headlines. The draw of social media platforms complicates an already difficult digital relationship as this generation was quickly consumed by the internet age and digital revolution.</p><p> We re constantly being primed by these  political, economic, and societal events that are happening outside our world, primarily through the news media,  says Cliona. </p><p> Having more access to information, in general, is impossible to escape, and that can really have an effect on young people who are already stressed about school, about finding out who they are, about friends. There s so many things and facets of being a young person. It can be difficult, but I think more so than ever. All these external factors are really contributing to our mental health journey. </p><p>Cliona feels the situation is worsening with a lack of safe spaces to openly talk about concerns affecting a person s mental state.  It s why organisations like Jigsaw are so imperative,  she says.</p><p> They give young people a safe space where they can speak about how they feel, learn coping mechanisms, and start to think about their mental health as something they need to look after, but also that it s normal. </p><h>Openly discussed </h><p/><h>With the stigma around mental health still existing in Ireland, Cliona feels that for her parents  and grandparents  generations, mental health was never something that was openly discussed. </h><p> The cultural approach to mental health ... is obviously something that can worsen your mental health,  says Cliona who plays a part in opening the discussion as an advocate for the youth mental health organisation Jigsaw, facilitating talks in schools and with young adults.  I think what is so important about mental health is allowing young people to feel like they have those safe people they can talk to. </p><p> Any approach to improving the mental health of those in their 20s and 30s will need to include a variety of promotion, prevention and intervention initiatives,  says O Driscoll.</p><p>These initiatives, he explains, advocate for accessible and equitable mental health services   including expanding access to therapeutic services, increasing funding for mental health services, making them more affordable through the health system, and expanding the provision of services online.</p><p>Private therapy can be cost-prohibitive for individuals.</p><p> As has been well reported and publicised, the mental health services in Ireland are severely stretched and under pressure,  says O Driscoll.  Long waiting lists and delayed intervention have led to a large number of community-based and youth-work organisations taking up the baton and being proactive around mental health.</p><p> These organisations run a wide variety of programmes and initiatives designed to promote positive mental health and wellbeing and to prevent the development of mental health issues and illness. These are delivered to support individuals, families and communities to develop the resilience and coping skills to deal with the ups and downs life throws at us. </p><p>O Driscoll explores this by emphasising the importance of workplace mental health programmes, educational campaigns, community-based support, addressing socio-economic factors, supporting digital wellbeing, recognising cultural sensitivity and inclusiveness, crisis intervention, and policy advocacy. Making initiatives such as mental health days and employee assistance programmes the norm in a workforce provides flexibility for those dealing with mental health issues.</p><p> Stigma and embarrassment still play a significant role in reluctance to seek help,  says O Driscoll.  Third-level institutes, and particularly student unions, are well placed to deliver campaigns with adequate resources. </p><p>Additionally, O Driscoll sees the opportunity to support community organisations, community centres, family resource centres, and youth work organisations through funding and resources as they all play  a vital role in promoting and improving the mental health  of our communities.</p><p> One of the major stressors and issues for this age cohort in 2024 is affordable housing,  says O Driscoll.  This feels unattainable for many, so it should be a priority policy area. And, increasingly, this age group struggles with managing debt due to issues such as high student loans, high rents and other financial obligations. Financial stability is proven to reduce stress and anxiety. Putting in place supports and policies to make this a reality for more people will impact mental health positively. </p><h>Struggling </h><p/><h>Cliona wonders if she hadn t been involved with an organisation involved in youth mental health from a young age, would she have struggled more and if she was struggling where would she have turned?  Knowing that there was always someone there, not even someone, but an organisation I knew I could turn to, seek support if I needed it, always made me feel like I had an option. </h><p> For those struggling with their mental health and in need of a therapeutic intervention, community and youth work organisations offer a low-cost intervention in many cases,  advises O Driscoll.</p><p> In 2024, the National Youth Health Programme launched the Mental Health Sign-Posting Tool. This online information tool was designed to capture and distil all the valuable work being done in the sector and make it easily accessible for those seeking help.</p><p> The signposting tool has the details of all the services, initiatives and programmes developed and delivered in response to a myriad of mental health issues in one place.</p><p> It is an aid to an individual seeking support, family members looking to help loved ones and professionals seeking additional services at both a local and national level. </p>", "publisher": "The Irish Times", "instances": ["A pivotal time in a person s life often comes in their 30s when they reflect on their opportunities, priorities, and future.

These platitudes, presented as wisdom, are as much about shaping the future as they are about rewriting the past.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This narrative isn't new. I heard it four years ago, during the formation of the outgoing government. Back then, I wrote an open letter, which was signed by three other Green Party candidates, urging party members to reject the programme for government. The argument was simple: The proposed plan offered a greener status quo, not the transformative action Ireland so desperately needed.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Instead of delivering a true Green New Deal - where housing, healthcare, workers' rights, and economic security pave the way to a zero-carbon future - it proposed policies that risked deepening inequality and falling short of climate goals. Housing policies catered to developers, carbon taxes disproportionately burdened rural and low-income communities, and agriculture policies continued to favour industry over family farms. For pointing this out, we were dismissed as naive, un-pragmatic, and even childish.</p><p>But the mythology of pragmatism - that the \"worst day in government is better than the best day outside it\" - is a powerful confidence trick. It perpetuates the status quo, ensuring transformative change remains out of reach. And yet, standing at that crossroads in 2020, even those of us who opposed the deal could see why that mythology has such a profound impact.</p><p>Amid the global pandemic, the Green Party entered government for compelling reasons. Climate breakdown demanded urgent action, and the chance to shape policy after decades of inaction was too critical to ignore. Yet, the past four years raise profound questions about whether this was the right call - not just for the party, but for the climate movement and the Irish people.</p><p>There were successes. The Climate Law was a landmark achievement and Greens in ministerial positions advanced important legislation. However, the promise of transformative action was stymied by the status quo. Attempting to retrofit climate solutions onto a neoliberal economic framework left them inaccessible to many. Grants for warmer homes, renewable energy, and electric vehicles encouraged uptake but were largely accessible only to those with the financial means. Instead of fostering equity, these initiatives widened disparities and failed to harness the developmental potential of climate action. The broader climate movement, which had propelled the Greens into power, faltered and lost momentum.</p><p>Beyond climate action, the social dialogue remained weak and the social contract was further eroded. Homelessness soared, housing costs spiralled, and our healthcare system, battered by the pandemic, emerged as one of the worst-performing in the northern hemisphere. While there is no counterfactual, it's hard not to imagine better options were possible.</p><p>In spring 2020, as the government was formed, the European Central Bank had suspended fiscal rules to encourage borrowing in the face of the pandemic, creating a once-in-a-generation opportunity. Ireland could have launched a green industrial revolution - creating jobs, retaining young talent, and accelerating decarbonisation. Instead, cautious fiscal policies prevailed and we failed to meet the moment.</p><p>At times, the Greens seemed compelled to justify their place in government by overstating incremental progress while systemic issues deepened. One recent example was the reframing of emissions reductions from offshoring electricity generation as domestic progress in greenhouse gas reductions. Even after this was exposed, the party stuck to the 7% reduction figure - a well-intentioned attempt to highlight achievements but one that let messaging trump the complexities of reality.</p><p>Messaging was never going to be enough. Enduring climate action requires material benefits that people can see and feel, distributed equitably across society. Without this, climate action risks losing public trust, leaving the very foundations of progress vulnerable to collapse.</p><p>The shortcomings of the past four years are not the fault of one party but reflect a deeper immaturity in Ireland's political system. At its heart, this immaturity undermines representation, engagement, and democratic progress. To build a robust, inclusive democracy, two changes to how we vote and a critical reform to how we legislate are urgently needed.</p><p>First, it's indefensible that Irish citizens abroad remain disenfranchised in 2024. Emigration, often driven by economic necessity, should not strip people of their voice in shaping the nation's future. Second, declining voter turnout further weakens the social contract. Compulsory voting, as practised in Australia, combined with accessible options like mail-in ballots and extended polling days, would ensure greater representation and stronger mandates.</p><p>Beyond voting, Ireland's rigid party whip system constrains legislative progress. It forces TDs to toe the party line and reduces opposition to a symbolic role rather than a legitimate space for constructive contribution. This rigidity stifles innovation, blocks collaboration, and perpetuates the idea that meaningful politics only happens in government.</p><p>To mature as a democracy, we must relax the whip system, enabling opposition parties and individual TDs to shape legislation collaboratively. A system that encourages cross-party initiatives and independent ideas would elevate governance and make opposition a platform for progress, not just dissent.</p><p>I RELAND urgently needs a new vision for politics, rooted in a renewed social contract. One that ensures a safe, sustainable future for generations to come while guaranteeing dignity and rights for those living today. Despite the limitations of Ireland's legislative process, opposition offers the most fertile ground for crafting and advancing such a transformative vision.</p><p>True transformation starts with bold ideas that challenge entrenched systems. Opposition provides the space to develop, refine, and champion these ideas, turning them into platforms for building alliances, mobilising social movements, and connecting with voters disillusioned by the status quo. In this moment, a united and constructive opposition, underpinned by robust grassroots organising, has the potential to reshape Ireland's political landscape far more effectively than diluted compromises forged in government.</p><p>The shifting global economic landscape only heightens this opportunity. As the foreign direct investment model faces mounting challenges and deglobalisation reshapes economies, Ireland stands at a crossroads. We can embrace a bold alternative: Green industrialisation built on State-owned wind energy, fair redistribution, community wealth-building, and democratic local economies. This vision cannot emerge from a government tied to neoliberal orthodoxy; it must come from outside.</p><p>I'm convinced that Green Party voters in 2020 did not vote for the configuration of the last government. They didn't vote for a climate action agenda that would falter due to public push-back, nor did they vote for the housing crisis to deepen or for young people to continue emigrating en masse.</p><p>They voted for something else: A politics that confronts the enormous challenges of our time - climate breakdown, inequality, and the housing crisis - head-on. This is the aspiration of many who seek alternatives to Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael. While current seat arithmetic may allow Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael to govern alone, the temptation for smaller parties to join may persist.</p><p>If those entrusted with the vote for change want to honour it, they must focus on building a new social contract. To do this, we need to break free from the myth of pragmatism. If smaller parties feel tempted to 'pull on the green jersey', they should reflect on the lost opportunity to build a real alternative - a model of governance that is bold, fair, and forward-thinking.</p><p>True pragmatism is about shaping solutions that tackle the root causes of our crises. Real climate action, a just transition, and a renewed social contract will not come from the status quo; they will come from those willing to break with it.</p><p>In doing so we might find a new politics in Ireland - one that values collaboration, embraces complexity, and dares to dream bigger.

Rather than a climate finance goal of $100bn, as previously agreed, this figure has to be in the trillions now in order to help Global South countries already drowning in debt from climate impacts. This commitment of trillions will also help leapfrog the fossil-fuel era by funding the scale-up to renewable energy.</p><p>The Global South is already paying the cost of floods, droughts, cyclones, and destruction caused by climate change. Women are disproportionately impacted. Women and children, for example, are 14 times more likely than men to die during climate-related disasters such as floods or cyclones due to social and cultural barriers.</p><p>In order to transition to greener pathways, they need finance from rich countries.</p><p>This is not a matter of charity; it's a matter of justice and righting a fundamental wrong. Rich countries are most responsible for causing climate change but are providing far too little support to countries impacted and harmed the most in the Global South.</p><p>The estimated fair cost for developed countries is to pay $5 trillion ( 4.74tn) per year in grant-based finance.</p><p>At Cop29, however, the push is to get agreement on $1tn per year, way below what is required. The pressure must be kept this week on rich countries to step up and deliver the finance that is urgently needed to give humanity a real chance of averting runaway climate breakdown.</p><p>Up to this point, it has been largely civil servants in Azerbaijan working desperately hard to negotiate how this goal can be achieved. Nothing is resolved in week one, but the gulf in views is laid bare. The result is a sprawling and scrambled negotiations text that covers the good and the bad of climate finance, the scale of the money, the quality, whether through loans and investments or public finance, with questions of who should be on the hook - developed countries or some developing countries too.</p><p>It is now in the hands of the political leaders who converge this week. There will be vastly opposing world views, pressure to cave, and immense efforts to persuade, all against the backdrop of a tense global political climate.</p><p>The backdrop to these talks is the failure to stop war and a plausible genocide in Gaza, and a global rise of the far right with a deadly anti-climate action agenda.</p><p>All of this is happening as we find ourselves in a general election campaign here in Ireland, with housing and the cost of living dominating the political agenda.</p><p>The idea that Ireland plays its part and forks out billions to the Global South in climate finance will seem impossible with so many homeless and families suffering with high prices of food and essential goods. But we think in the short term at our peril. It is always the poorest who suffer the most, whether in Ireland, in Bangladesh, or in Ethiopia. We must put a better future front and centre in our present.</p><p>Every penny spent now to avoid climate disasters later will be the best money we can spend, for Ireland and the world. This is needed along with reducing our emissions in Ireland and ensuring we do our fair share here. It is not an overstatement in any way to say that the future of our planet depends on just climate action.</p><p>It is of huge concern that governments from the Global North are emphasising the role of private finance when it comes to climate finance and the new goal. This is being framed that 'climate injustice' is essentially an issue of access to private finance on fairer terms. Rather, the injustice is the failure of rich polluting countries to repay the climate debt of the historic responsibilities we owe to the countries on the frontline of the climate crisis.</p><p>Yes, the private sector has a huge role to play. The shift to renewables will crucially involve private sector innovation in green renewable energy. However, it is a false economy to think that the private sector can be the driver of climate finance. The countries that are most vulnerable to the climate breakdown are also facing a debt crisis.

Unwieldy and interminably slow in reaching a decision by consensus, critics dismiss Cops as ineffective talking shops; a  circus of parties . Yet against the odds, they frequently drive change.</p><h>Is the Paris Agreement  fit for purpose? </h><p nitf:lede=\"true\"/><h>In the room will be signatories to the Paris Agreement   almost 200 countries   a monument to collective action. It is a guiding map, reinforced by climate science, showing the way to a more benign physical world, less polluted and healthier   nature balanced with humanity.</h><p>But it is flawed.</p><p>Countries have committed to hold warming to well below 2 degrees above pre-industrial times and to work to limit this to 1.5 degrees. But the agreement allows each country to determine what contribution it makes to these efforts. This inevitably led to a wide gap between collective goals and national commitments. The bottom line is that the collective response is wholly inadequate given what is facing Earth.</p><h>Where are we on temperature and emissions goals? </h><p/><h>It s best summarised in three words: over the limit. This year is set to become the first on record when average temperatures exceed 1.5 degrees, breaching that Paris threshold   though this has to happen over years to be declared lost.</h><p>Emissions are at unprecedented levels, especially from burning fossil fuels. Global temperatures are at their highest in human history. Like a household budget, climate science sets a carbon budget on greenhouse gases that can be  spent  (emitted) for a given level of global warming. If we exceed this budget, global temperatures will become higher. We continue to exceed that budget to an alarming extent.</p><h>Is anything helping us to  get to a better place? </h><p/><h>Many countries have pledged to reduce carbon dioxide and methane emissions, the main antagonists of warming. Added to that, a clean energy revolution is gathering pace. The single biggest way to pivot the world is to replace fossil fuels with renewables as the prime energy source. It is the quickest route to a decarbonised world.</h><p>Analysis would suggest this is unstoppable, despite US president-elect Donald Trump s return to the White House.</p><h>Why should Ireland  slash emissions? </h><p/><h>Ireland generates a mere 0.1 per cent of global emissions, so on the surface it s not our problem. But for many reasons that s not a sustainable position. As climate scientist Peter Thorne has highlighted:  Ireland has among the highest per capita greenhouse emissions in Europe.  We put a small proportion of total emissions into the atmosphere, but if every person in the globe had the historical emissions profile of Ireland, global mean temperature today would be north of 3 degrees. In short, the world would be cooked and humanity would be lucky to survive..</h><p>We need to get a handle on this, Thorne added.  If we can t solve these challenges, challenges on the island of Ireland, then where on Earth can? We have a highly educated population. We have, fundamentally, the capital resources. We have the nimbleness, if it is our priority to act faster. </p><p>What s more, climate disruption is already on our doorstep.

The world cannot decarbonise with ensuring climate justice, but ultimately achieving net-zero emissions brings huge economic opportunity   notwithstanding upfront costs and rocky terrain ahead.</h><p>That transition needs to empower people, not heap blame on them. Climate guilt should rest primarily with Big Oil and carbon polluting industries.</p><h>So what are key agenda  items at Cop29?</h><p/><h> By some distance it is about money and resetting a climate finance goal. A target of $100 billion a year from developed countries for vulnerable countries is in place.</h><p>Remarkably, there is broad agreement this should scale to trillions but gaping differences over who should pay, how much and sources of finance.</p><p>The EU is pushing for much more diversified funding sources, including private finance. What constitutes a rich country is also contested. </p><p>A 1992 list doesn t include China and many wealthy petrostates despite their economic might after decades of growth. Setting out a credible path towards that target will be key to building trust. Ireland s Minister for Climate Eamon Ryan has been asked to play a lead role on adaptation measures to build climate resilience in developing countries.</p><p>Again, this will require money on the table but also, as he sees it, a better way of addressing climate and development.</p><p>A good outcome at Cop29 could provide momentum on overall negotiations and progress parts of the Paris Agreement to ensure meaningful carbon trading and transparency on credits. </p><h>With Trump likely to pull  out , does that make  Cop29 largely irrelevant? World leaders from almost 100 countries are gathered in Baku and Trump will be the main conversation topic. </h><p>The US   the country responsible for most emissions historically and currently the world s second largest emitter   is walking away from its responsibilities. </p><p>It risks heightening fear about inevitable emission impacts in coming years as Trump ratchets up oil and gas production. This may translate into paralysis that scuppers Cop29.</p><p>In the past alliances of more ambitious countries formed during Cops and helped forge strong outcomes against the odds, often with unlikely partners.

Ireland s negotiating team in recent Cops has played an important role, especially in securing a landmark loss and damage fund.  Ireland s position can be a bridging position between the Global North and the Global South,  Ryan told a pre-Cop29 briefing. </p><h>What s the best that  can be hoped for?

Excluded populations   including women, Catholics, ethnic minorities and individuals without property   have gained political rights. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">There is an ongoing campaign to lower the voting age to 16. Many activists on climate justice believe we should go one step further, arguing that representation for future generations should be baked into our democratic institutions. But why end there?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A more radical proposal is to give the natural world, starting with non-human animals, a  voice  in our democracy. It may seem fanciful, but Trinity College Dublin philosopher Dr Pablo Maga\u00f1a Fern\u00e1ndez is determined to give the idea a fair hearing   and to persuade us in the process to become less anthropocentric.</p><p>Four proposals have been put forward by political theorists: First, reserving several seats in parliament for specific  representatives of animals , such as members of an animal rights party. Second, changing the electoral system to allow such a group a greater say in parliament. Third, creating an ombudsman for animals   an independent office tasked with protecting and representing their interests. And fourth, staging deliberative initiatives, allowing citizens to reflect on issues that affect animals   the 2022 Citizens  Assembly on Biodiversity Loss could be seen as a model upon which to build.</p><p> Conceptually speaking, I think, all these proposals make sense. The crucial question is practical: namely which of these proposals is likely to achieve the best combination of feasibility, success, durability, democratic legitimacy and immunity from abuse and manipulation,  says Maga\u00f1a Fern\u00e1ndez, an Irish Research Council research fellow who is participating in a public lecture series on Democracy at a Crossroads this month.</p><p>He explains further as this week s Unthinkable guest:</p><h>Why go beyond existing political institutions to protect animal welfare?  We can improve animals  wellbeing through the law   for example, by passing stricter animal welfare legislation or granting them legal personhood, perhaps even some fundamental rights. But only up to a point. If policymakers can, with little cost, disregard animals  interests   who cannot, after all, vote them out of office   political decisions are likely to be biased in anthropocentric ways. When a political system is biased in these ways, the laws it creates will   to some extent   inherit such biases, thus constraining what judges or animal- focused legal advocacy groups can achieve through the law. The extra step of representing animals in policymaking seeks precisely to affect policymakers  incentives   to make it, in short, costlier to disregard animals  interests. </h><h>Which animals should be represented?  My view is that this is, and should be, best left as an open question. I like to think about this by way of the following analogy: we can pass animal welfare laws even if we disagree about whether such protections should be extended, say, to invertebrates. Then, as we acquire higher-quality scientific evidence about which animals are conscious, whether they can suffer etc, we can suggest amendments, and subject them to public debate.</h><p> I suggest we do the same with representation: we may disagree about the moral status of ants, spiders or lobsters, but we largely agree about  higher mammals , for instance. So we can start there, and leave the conversation open. Moreover, representing animals can only succeed if it s practicable.

As I see it, the main problem, right now, is that policymakers can quite easily ignore animal interests, even when these are deeply affected by the decisions they make . . . In this sense, I do believe XL Bully dogs should receive  a fair hearing  in politics, so to speak. Of course, that doesn t tell us how to resolve the substantive issue. </h><p> But, not even in the case of humans, does representation settle substantive questions.

He is correct that Ireland has qualified and experienced merchant mariners. So the key question is why are these mariners not enticed to the Irish Navy at present? Why do Irish mariners work contracts at sea, away from Ireland for extended periods? There can only be one answer: the remuneration received in the merchant navy would appear to be more enticing. This is the financial remuneration and the remuneration for hours worked. The implementation of the working time directive for the Naval Service and the wider Defence Forces would be a positive from a retention perspective and could potentially entice Irish mariners that Capt McGowan states are readily available. However, one must be cognisant of the fact that the offshore renewable energy market will increase dramatically over the next decade and this will become a draw for experienced Irish mariners and a further draw on naval personnel.  Capt McGowan is correct about the workforce but it would appear that the remuneration model offered by the Naval Service  does not currently match what is available in the merchant navy. A lesson there for for our Minister for Defence Miche\u00e1l Martin, the secretary general of the Department of Defence, and of course the flag officer commanding the Naval Service. </p><p>I would have to disagree with Capt McGowan in respect of his opinion on weapons on Irish warships. The Naval Service has not been afraid to use their weapon systems against gun-running fishing vessels. Main armaments on Naval Service ships have also been used to sink derelict vessels. Such main weapons also act as a deterrent when the Naval Service has conducted maritime interdiction boardings in Irish waters or on missions overseas in the Mediterranean. Capt McGowan makes extremely valid points about the utility of the Spanish navy vessel that visited Ireland earlier this year. The tug Carnota is classed by the Spanish navy as a salvage tug and, as such, brings great utility to support a whole host of maritime safety tasks. This Spanish navy vessel is part of a balanced fleet that the Spanish navy use to carry out a whole range of maritime safety and security tasks. </p><p>Capt McGowan is indeed correct that the Naval Service needs a balanced fleet to conduct a range of naval tasks. The service is what is referred to as a constabulary role navy, tasked with a whole series of maritime security roles, such as providing protection for our gas pipelines, energy interconnectors and subsea fibreoptic cables, vital to keep our economy running. </p><p>Capt McGowan believes that if we don t change our operating methods, we may end up with no naval ships at sea. His is correct, but it is the operating method of the government department and the military command that needs to change, to get our eight vessels back to sea to protect Ireland s economy. The Naval Service personnel must be rewarded for being at sea to a similar extent as their merchant colleagues. The Naval Service must be able to recruit large numbers to grow the force and, considering it is losing highly skilled technicians, such as ordnance artificers,   there must be some retention package implemented as a matter of urgency.

Yes, underinvestment over many years (training staff, maintaining signalling, rolling stock, stations, bridges, railway crossings) but the essential issue here, like so much of the country s institutions and infrastructure, is that it is down to what we re bad at   understanding and recognising who the customer is and what they want. If you understand the idea of service and its delivery, you ll do your damndest to see the customer is okay. Yes, you need capital to provide a seamless and super service but if you don t have lots of money you can at least still provide for stations to be open, officials to be in post answering the public s queries day in and day out. Before you plough money in, you can still provide a service. It s bloody difficult, let s be honest. But officials, poorly paid, often demoralised  and usually in no mind to readily to assist a passenger waiting for their train or enquiring about times, departures, etc, still need to get to grips with what their jobs entail; too many punters, all with different questions on a wintry platform. Far easier to go and hide away or just absent yourself then no one can hassle you!</p><p>The next thing to say is that there s little merit in unions defending the status quo; they may not be able to provide the cash but they can at least make sure their people turn up on time and do the best they can.</p><p>On the investment front, railways, like our already disregarded infrastructure, flood defences, planning, transport, just needs to be addressed. How long do we wish to recognise there s a problem yet do nothing? While politicians are interested in burnishing their own careers and knowing they will be off and away shortly, they just don t care and will not, and probably cannot, plan for the future adequately. But it just has to start somewhere. Why doesn t the incoming government sit down after Christmas, look at the state of this half-built nation and simply say, the public has suffered enough. We will now identify every one of those key infrastructure issues that remain incomplete and allocate the extraordinary monies from capital receipts in our coffers to sort it out. Plan it, finance it, and before delivering it get everyone in a service industry in the public sector properly trained and made aware of the fact their role, their only role, is to help that customer first time and on time. If you can t do it on your own, get help from the private sector; they ll come running if they know this long-standing issue is now being seriously and rigorously addressed.</p><p>We ve been waiting long enough.

There will be a resourcing and funding issues the next government will have to address, we re up for that. </p><p>The sustainability of nursing home care remains under severe strain, with over 70 nursing homes having closed since 2018. Decisive action is required to safeguard the future of care for Ireland s older population. Immediate measures, including reform of the Fair Deal pricing mechanism, are critical to ensuring nursing home care remains accessible, sustainable, and capable of delivering the dignity and respect our older population deserves.</p><p>The demographic challenges facing Ireland are well-documented. The over-65 population has grown by 35 per cent over the past decade and is expected to double in the next 20 years, with the most significant proportional increase among those aged 85 and older. These trends underscore the need for a coordinated response to provide appropriate care for our ageing population.</p><p>Nursing Homes Ireland remains committed to working collaboratively with the Government to address immediate challenges, including funding shortfalls, workforce pressures, and access to primary care services for nursing home residents.

Post the Brexit decision in June 2016, a well-conceived and executed political and diplomatic campaign succeeded in minimising the potential damage to Ireland s political and economic interests.</p><p>Both these initiatives succeeded because there was broad political consensus, including support from Opposition parties, backed up by a wider societal consensus. The political consensus meant policy continuity: when the government changed in 2011 and 2017, the policy remained unchanged. Well co-ordinated cross-departmental implementation arrangements were another key factor.</p><p>In the case of the Hunger Task Force report the societal consensus meant all major Irish NGOs supported the report s recommendations and adjusted their own programmes to enable shared learning with Irish Aid. The All-Island Brexit Civic Forum facilitated discussion with the social partners on the evolving Brexit negotiations.</p><h>Political prioritisation</h><p> The other key factor in both cases was the investment in strategic partnerships with governments, institutions and individuals who supported the Irish case. </p><p>Should these lessons be applied to the 2025 conferences, planning should revolve around three principles: political prioritisation, policy coherence and partnerships to advocate for policy change.</p><p>An early decision by the incoming government to prioritise an integrated food/health/climate strategy at the 2025 conferences would be a powerful signal of political intent. It would enable relevant Oireachtas committees to forge a broad political consensus on the strategy, which in turn could facilitate a societal consensus.</p><p>Developing an integrated strategy will be challenging and will require cross-departmental co-ordination arrangements not currently in place.</p><p>Ireland s international advocacy is most credible when it can be supported by evidence from its domestic policy.  Practise what you preach  is a powerful maxim. </p><p>In 2018, taoiseach Leo Varadkar truthfully acknowledged to the European Parliament Ireland was  a laggard  in its climate policy. In 2024, this is no longer the case. Ireland s 2023 Climate Action Plan set ambitious targets for reduction in emissions and improvement in water quality and biodiversity.</p><p>Food Vision 2030 has as its central objective a commitment that Ireland will be an international leader in sustainable food systems by 2030.</p><p>So Ireland has in place climate and food policies which are fully supported by the government, are internationally credible and about which annual implementation reports are published. Although both policies face implementation challenges, there is a solid basis for framing a credible advocacy policy at each of the 2025 conferences.</p><p>Cop30 should present an opportunity to advocate for policies aligned with long-term Irish interests. The Brazilian presidency will prioritise further development of the Emirates Declaration.</p><p>In addition, President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva has established the Global Alliance against Hunger and Poverty, which aims to harness political drive, enable resource mobilisation and align national and international support to policies aimed at combating hunger and property. </p><h>Strategic partnerships</h><p> This should go hand in hand with commitments to long-term policies enabling food to be produced with a lower environmental footprint and more diverse cropping patterns which are resilient to future climate change. Ireland has agreed to join this alliance.</p><p>Forging strategic partnerships was key to the success of the Hunger Task Force initiative and the Brexit strategy. For Ireland to maximise its influence on policy change at the 2025 conferences, a similar approach will be needed. Fortunately, we can build on existing strong relationships with the European Union, the UN, the United States and the African Union to seek alignment of policy priorities and opportunities to advocate for policy change.</p><p>The British government is committed to positively engage in a range of multilateral initiatives, reversing the insularity and negativity of successive Conservative governments since 2016. As part of the reset in Irish/UK relations announced by Taoiseach Simon Harris and prime minister Keir Starmer, there is scope for innovative Irish/UK collaboration at the 2025 conferences, akin to the positive relations the governments shared in promoting international food and nutrition security during the 2008-2013 period.</p><p>Each of the three conferences in 2025 will require a tailored and differentiated approach, albeit with a common strategic thread which should include a strong focus on gender equality. Any partnership will need to identify shared policy ground, following which specific advocacy priorities for the particular conference should be agreed.</p><p>If Ireland delivers on a credible food/health/climate strategy for the 2025 conferences this should open longer-term possibilities for Irish political leadership and diplomacy. During 2025, attention will turn to the framework to succeed the SDGs which were delivered in 2015 under Irish and Kenyan leadership. If Ireland can demonstrate its commitment to an integrated food/health/climate strategy, both in its domestic policy and through its foreign policy, it will bring practical experience of a vital priority for whatever new framework emerges.</p><p>The three international conferences in 2025 offer a sliver of positivity in an otherwise grim geopolitical situation, including the Middle East, Ukraine and Sudan.

In 2008, the report of the Irish Hunger Task Force led to Ireland having a significant influence on international food and nutrition security policy in the 2008-2013 period. Post the Brexit decision in June 2016, a well-conceived and executed political and diplomatic campaign succeeded in minimising the potential damage to Ireland s political and economic interests. Both these initiatives succeeded because there was broad political consensus, including support from Opposition parties, backed up by a wider societal consensus. The political consensus meant policy continuity: when the government changed in 2011 and 2017, the policy remained unchanged."]}, {"relevance_score": 85, "title": "Left to their own devices?", "published": "2024-12-07", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">AFTER counting got underway in last week's general election, one reality became very clear.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">With 86 of the 174 seats in the next D\u00e1il, Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael would at least make up one part of whatever coalition forms the government of the 34th D\u00e1il.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That numerical reality, while some have not accepted it as a done deal, is undeniable. The Civil War parties, while accounting for their lowest vote share total of all time, at just over 42%, will control large swathes of the next parliament.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">That reality should prompt some soul-searching from those who had spent the three weeks in the general election campaign arguing that another five years of Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael rule would be a disaster for the country.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">However, the fragmentation of the Irish political landscape since 2016, coupled with Miche\u00e1l Martin and Simon Harris ruling out talking to Sinn F\u00e9in, means that the path to power in the D\u00e1il is exceptionally narrow at present.</p><p>But is there a left alternative? Can it be built in five years ahead? Or is it always destined to eat itself?</p><p>In 2020, Sinn F\u00e9in's 24.5% of the vote saw it claim 37 seats and come back as the second-largest party in the D\u00e1il with the largest number of votes. But a dearth of candidates meant that many of the beneficiaries of that surge were other parties of the left, some of whom parlayed that support into seats, some of whom didn't.</p><p>Take, for example, the country's largest vote-getter in 2020, Sinn F\u00e9in TD for Dublin Bay North, Denise Mitchell. Without a running mate, she took 21,344 votes, nearly a full 10,000 above the quota. When her surplus was redistributed, Independent Left and People Before Profit picked up 2,000 votes each, Social Democrats TD Cian O'Callaghan got 1,200, and Labour's Aodh\u00e1n \u00d3 Riord\u00e1in added 600. Fine Gael's Richard Bruton netted just 160.</p><p>The 'vote left, transfer left' idea was something that parties were espousing on the doors, but was more heavily backed on social media, where it trended in the days ahead of polling. In truth, there was no formal or even informal agreement among the parties.</p><p>In the end, while Sinn F\u00e9in claimed victory and the left spoke about the latent desire for change and some in the Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il benches said that Mary Lou McDonald's party could reach the 80-TD threshold for a majority, this was disingenuous.</p><p>Any coalition at that time would have asked the Green Party to work with the Healy Raes to work with People Before Profit to work with rural and regional independents. Not exactly the stability that covid-era Ireland was searching for.</p><p>In 2024, not much has changed in terms of pure numbers, but Sinn F\u00e9in is attempting to put in the work, meeting with the Social Democrats on Thursday and Labour likely next week.</p><p>The party's housing spokesman, Eoin \u00d3 Broin, is a key cog in that machine and denies that a Fianna F\u00e1il and Fine Gael renewal is a foregone conclusion.</p><p>\"Our focus is on government formation, you can see this isn't locked in,\" he told the <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Irish Examiner</emphasis>. \"Our approach is that we live in the real world, but we have to be ready to provide that alternative in the short, medium, and long term.</p><p>\"We're not talking about opposition at the moment.\"</p><h><emphasis typeStyle=\"bf\">Real world</emphasis></h><p>However, that real world is one where if Sinn F\u00e9in was able to woo Holly Cairns and Ivana Bacik sufficiently and if Roderic O'Gorman was minded to throw in his lot alongside nine (a generous number) Independents who may be willing to back such an arrangement, they would still be 14 seats short of a D\u00e1il majority.</p><p>Yes, Sinn F\u00e9in deserves credit for its due diligence, but the chances of a truly left government are slim. The only way those parties end up in government is with one or both of the Civil War parties, who look set to rely on Independents to get over the line.</p><p>If that does transpire, what is the left to do?</p><p>Now-retired former Labour TD Brendan Howlin is a veteran of the question of whether the left is a viable alternative. In 1997, the Labour Party ran much of its general election campaign on the basis that it was a choice between left and right, buoyed in large part by the election success of the resurgent British Labour Party under Tony Blair.</p><p>However, the party would lose half of its seats and oust leader Dick Spring, having been washed away by Bertie Ahern's popular and populist Fianna F\u00e1il, and would merge with Democratic Left within two years.</p><p>Just days after the first election which he did not contest in 42 years, Mr Howlin strongly believes that a left-wing alternative is possible - if the parties can stop fighting.</p><p>\"Of course a left-wing alternative could emerge,\" said Mr Howlin. \"There's real opportunity to build a serious alternative there. The old duopoly has been shattered of Fine Gael and Fianna F\u00e1il. But we have to present policies that are attuned to the needs of people. We have to explain what an interventionist state backed by taxation means.\"</p><p>Mr Howlin is also clear on one thing that some of the left find somewhat unpalatable - the Labour Party is part of the solution, not the problem. Following the 2011 coalition with Fine Gael, Labour has found its brand among many of the left to be toxic, but Mr Howlin says they're going nowhere.</p><p>\"The curse of the left has been seeing those closest to you as your enemy. The next D\u00e1il presents a chance to reverse this.</p><p>\"There was no outreach from Sinn F\u00e9in until late in this election campaign and even then it excluded Labour. The Labour Party is the anchor of that centre-left vote. We will be the anchor of that into the future and we need to build with a sense of confidence.</p><p>\"We've survived a century because the critical core will be there. Simple mathematics will tell you, you can't do it without us.

The ideology isn't miles apart, but the outlook is,\" said one Social Democrats source. A Labour Party source says that the pair joining forces would be \"pointless\" as it would merely dilute support.</p><p>\"We could absolutely work together in the future, but the best way of doing that is to get as many seats as possible,\" said a senior Labour figure.</p><p>Mr \u00d3 Broin agrees that co-operation on the left needn't mean coalition.</p><p>\"A lot of people are writing that for the left to grow it must coalesce, but the opposite is true,\" he said, pointing to an example in his own constituency where Labour's candidate was the popular local councillor Francis Timmons.</p><p>In 2020, Mr Timmons and the Labour Party combined for 2,600 first preferences, but as a Labour candidate this time, he pulled 2,200. The point, Mr \u00d3 Broin says, is that the assumption that combining forces improves appeal is not necessarily true.</p><p>\"PR allows you vote for the party you want.</p><p>\"There's also a lot of co-operation here in Leinster House that people don't see.

But, for acclaimed Indian writer Amitav Ghosh, childhood reading in the English-speaking world   including Golding s Lord of the Flies   has something to answer for here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These treasured texts of English literature are part of a story of belligerent individualism that readers  imbibe  from an early age, the Kolkata-born author argues. In recent years, Ghosh has emerged as one of the foremost anglophone voices writing about the climate crisis.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2018, he became the first English-language writer to receive the Jnanpith Award, India s highest literary honour. </p><p>The following year, Foreign Policy magazine named him one of the most important global thinkers of the preceding decade. Today, Ghosh is to deliver a lecture in Derry on one of his recent non-fiction works The Nutmeg s Curse (2021), coinciding with the launch of a new round of activity being set in motion by the Field Day Theatre Company.</p><p>The annual lecture is named after the late Seamus Deane, a driving intellectual force behind the original project. Along with Deane, actor Stephen Rea and the late playwright Brian Friel began Field Day in 1980 as an artistic and intellectual response to what seemed like intractable political crisis in the North, then gripped by the 30-year conflict now known as the Troubles.</p><p>This new round of work will examine more contemporary concerns: namely, accelerating climate breakdown and its roots in European colonialism, an intertwined history that Ghosh has long traced.</p><p>Rea told The Irish Times that some of the themes explored in his colleague and cofounder s most celebrated writing hold relevance for dispossessed communities at the front lines of the climate crisis today.  The issues we began to explore in Brian Friel s Translations   territory, belonging, language and dispossession through renaming   are still current around the world for indigenous peoples,  he says.</p><p> Amitav has made a singular contribution to our understanding of the ways in which issues such as climate justice are closely bound up with our histories of colonialism. </p><p>Ghosh also sees clear crossover between Field Day s work and his own.  Most of all, [in] questions of place,  he says.  How do we care for a place? How do we inhabit a place? And, equally, issues of humans and non-humans   how they interact with each other.</p><p> How do we tell stories about this? About human and non-human interactions. That s something I ve been very concerned with and, in that sense, there s an overlap with Field Day, I think.  The power of narrative is evidenced, Ghosh points out, in the developmental arc of man-made climate change itself. But while one dominant story, in particular, has driven the crisis, stories also offer possible ways out.</p><p> I think it s very important to tell stories,  he says.  I mean, that s partly because I m a storyteller.</p><p> But, in effect, if we look around us, if we look at the planetary crisis in the broadest possible sense, it is in a sense a crisis that has been brought about by a story: a story of endless profit, endless growth, of individualism.</p><p> And these stories are very deeply planted, especially within the anglosphere. Children begin to imbibe them from the time they re in school. They re made to read Lord of the Flies, for example, which is this whole idea ... that humans are by nature inclined to create a war against all. This isn t the case at all   it s just an anglo view of how the world is.</p><p> So I do think it s very important for us to create new kinds of narratives. And a lot of my work has been pushing in that direction. </p><p> An established set of narratives that Ghosh s work closely scrutinises are those surrounding European colonialism. Ireland is particularly germane to these concerns, he says, because it is  where the British created all their colonial methods, that s where they tried it out first .</p><p>One way he opens up these points for a contemporary audience is through a reconsideration of plant life, the cultural and economic histories tied up with plants and their figuring in language. In Ghosh s writing, organic matter is not something inanimate or mute. Plants are revealed to be historical subjects with an astonishing power to influence the events framing our lives.</p><p> I ve become really interested in the whole question of plant sentience,  he says.  There s a huge literature on it now. We do know that plants can actually experience certain kinds of emotions. They have certain sorts of responses and reactions. </p><p>In Ghosh s most recent work, Smoke and Ashes: Opium s Hidden Histories, as in The Nutmeg s Curse, plants such as the nutmeg and opium poppy   controlled, commodified and appropriated in the interests of empire   become historical subjects in their own right, shaping world events in critical ways. To illustrate his point, Ghosh underscores the historical roots of the British and Dutch imperial projects as  narco-states .</p><p> They used opium to finance themselves, especially in Asia, where their revenues rested largely on opium. But it s a very curious thing to see how opium creates these repetitive patterns throughout history. What opium did to China in the 19th century was to create an absolute political, moral and financial catastrophe for the country. And it took them decades and decades to finally recover in the 20th century. It s very striking to me today that, with the opioid crisis and the drug crisis in America, generally speaking, we see remarkably similar patterns emerging. </p><p>In 19th-century China as in the US now, Ghosh adds,  the areas that were most affected were areas with mines and the populations that were most affected were working-class people   miners, et cetera   people who did very heavy physical labour. And, so, I think when you see these patterns, you can t help but feel that this plant, the opium poppy, is actually a historical agent which is creating certain cyclical patterns in history .</p><p>More recently, the author says, instructive details concerning the development of the climate crisis could be spotted in the Covid-19 pandemic. The public health emergency not only reshaped domestic and international politics, in Ghosh s eyes, it was a  forerunner , or dry run, for the big political battles of the 21st century.</p><p>It also prompted a degree of undue optimism, he says, as one crisis gave way to other, deeper crises.  I think, on the whole, what we see is that epidemics actually don t lead to any kind of rethinking. So, for example, the 1918 influenza [Spanish flu] epidemic   immediately after that, you get this huge stock market bubble. People go back to doing whatever they were doing and they do it at triple intensity. And that s exactly what we see after Covid. </p><p>There were lessons, however, concerning western vulnerabilities to growing climate instability and a lack of preparedness. This has recently been underscored by the devastation wreaked by hurricanes in the US and flash floods in Spain. Covid-19 was, to Ghosh,  in many ways a forerunner of what s going to happen as climate change intensifies. And I think it shows us the patterns of certain outcomes .</p><p> So, for example, the standard narrative on climate change is that climate change will devastate poor countries, while allowing rich countries to come through and [find themselves] not being that badly affected. There was the same narrative around Covid.</p><p> You ll remember in 2019, there was a study done on which countries were the best-prepared for the pandemic and the results were published. Naturally, the US was on top, the UK second, and then a whole string of European countries. And, of course, African countries were right at the bottom.</p><p> But, in fact, the way that it played out was almost the opposite of what this study had found. Many African countries, like Senegal, had very good outcomes, comparatively speaking. Whereas the US and the UK had the worst outcomes   not just in terms of people dying of disease, but [also] the degree of polarisation that it created. </p><p>However, in another important sense, Ghosh believes the world is entering a new chapter   with potentially disastrous outcomes for those most vulnerable to the effects of climate breakdown.</p><p> For 400 years, Europe and the West have been dominant across the globe,  he says.  Now, suddenly, we re finding that it s no longer dominant   we find especially that Europe has become quite marginal to what s happening in global politics. </p><p>As UN climate talks concluded at the Cop29 summit in Azerbaijan, in the shadow of a second Trump presidency, Ghosh sees so-called developing nations increasingly adopting a  western, extractivist model  of economic growth. It is one of a number of consequences of 35 years of US global dominance, he says, adding that its decline may produce yet more damaging fallout.</p><p> I think it s very important to remember that half the greenhouse gases that are in the atmosphere have been put there since 1990,  he says.  That is, since the end of the cold war, since the  unipolar moment , since the establishment of American hegemony, and along with that went the Washington model   extractivism, rampant consumerism and so on.</p><p> It was that impetus that has really accelerated the climate crisis. It would have happened at some point, maybe, anyway. But since 1990, since that geopolitical moment, it has hugely accelerated.  </p><p> Ghosh even traces the big pollution events choking some of Ireland s most important freshwater bodies, at Lough Neagh and Lough Corrib, back to the growth-driven policy initiatives of this period.</p><p> Now, the curious thing, of course, is that it s in this period that the EU put in place these very market-oriented policies, especially in regards to agriculture, pushing models of industrial agriculture, which now have led to disaster.</p><p> In the Netherlands, for example, these huge lakes of nitrogen, which have built up because of industrial farming. So, all of that really goes back to that one geopolitical moment. </p><p>Diminishing US hegemony and a shift towards a multipolar world, however, will not mitigate climate breakdown, Ghosh reflects. Instead, a new contest for geopolitical supremacy will bring about a  massive intensification  of the crisis.</p><p> Basically, it s a disaster for the climate,  he says.  These wars that have broken out [in Ukraine and the Middle East], because, as we all know, the single most environmentally destructive environmental activity is war. </p><p> These wars are intensifying ... One thing these wars have made clear is where the world s priorities lie. </p><p>He adds:  Climate as an issue has now become completely marginal, even as we re seeing more and more climate disasters occurring all around us. We re living through an absolutely catastrophic conjuncture of events. </p><p><emphasis typeStyle=\"it\"/>The Seamus Deane Lecture 2024 is scheduled to take place at the Guildhall in Derry today.

Earlier this week, Dublin Castle hosted the National Economic Dialogue, a civil enough title for an event that is, to put it plainly, an annual polite fight between people in suits over what we should be spending money on.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The idea is that people from business lobby groups, trade unions, environmental groups and other NGOs meet up with the Government and discuss what the State's spending priorities should be. The event is also the soft launch of budget season: an all-consuming, and often quite tiring, political and media cycle that obsesses over predicting how and on what the Government is going to spend money. Even at a point in time when Ireland is in the fortunate enough position to have projected budget surpluses in the region of mind-boggling billions, there are more than enough compelling and competing demands being put on the Government which would, if ceded to, exhaust those coffers quite quickly.</p><p>Ireland is a bit of a weird dichotomy. The country is flourishing, while equity is withering. By a lot of meaningful metrics, the country is doing quite well. But below headline figures, inequality is festering. There is a yawning chasm between the quality of life experienced by different groups, particularly in areas like income and housing. We're often told that, internationally, Ireland is perceived as a successful country. But the State still staggers and fails on things that a lot of us would consider to be basic essentials: accessible healthcare, disability services, affordable housing.</p><p>People are exasperated with what they see as the State failing on the fundamentals. And this malaise is likely exacerbated by a cost-of-living crisis that is biting very hard. When it comes time for the finance minister to make big budget decisions, people are going to be hungry for some kind of financial respite. Politicians, greedy for electoral capital, understand that. That's why we've already had quite a few out flying kites in premature climates, tempting middle-income earners with the promise of tax cuts.</p><p>I sometimes find the budget coverage to be a little bit grubby. The budget is often portrayed not as a deeply serious set of decisions with long-term consequences, but as a kind of individualistic jamboree which we've all come to expect to get something from. The coverage in the days that follow is usually dominated by whatever group felt that they 'got' nothing. The budget's success or failure is decided by personal calculators, as we all rush to condemn or praise the spending plan for an entire nation based solely on the net benefit it brings to our own household.</p><p>Politicians can be equally as grimy. You would be forgiven for thinking that the budget was nothing more than a grand ceremony to showcase the ostentatious generosity of government TDs, who bless us all with a kindly 'giveaway' of money from their own deep pockets. But the money is not really theirs, they're just the present custodians of it. Those who want to spend a lot of money on popular ideas, with one eye on a looming election, seem to me like thieves who are raiding state funds and using it to invest in their own selfish future.</p><p>So prudence is important. But what is also more important this year is political bravery. We often associate hard choices with dark days and rainy days, days blackened by austerity and cutting back. But there is just as much necessity for hard choices when the sun is shining.</p><p>Last week, the Government published a piece of research called Ireland's Well-being Framework. It's a great idea: instead of just focusing on economic metrics, the people in charge try to use holistic measurements to understand how the country is really doing. The annual research analyses what our healthcare is like, how people use their time, how much knowledge and skills we enjoy, what our sense of community is. Of the 11 key areas measured, Ireland performed negatively in just one: the environment, climate and biodiversity.</p><p>Saving the world seems like a just political pursuit, until you consider the flaws of electoral politics: a system that punishes decisions that are excellent in the long term if they're painful in the short term.
