(\"GFL\" or the \"Company\") today announced that Green Infrastructure Partners (\"GIP\")has entered into a definitive agreement with funds managed by Energy Capital Partners, LLC (\"ECP\") to recapitalize its business at an enterprise value of $4.25 billion. GIP is a leading vertically integrated infrastructure company established in 2022 by GFL, funds managed by HPS Investment Partners Inc.

GFL will receive approximately $200.0 million of the $585.0 million shareholder distribution. Pro forma for the transaction, GIP's total equity value will be approximately $3.0 billion. After the distribution to GFL of approximately $200.0 million, GFL will own an approximate 30.1% interest in GIP valued at approximately $895.0 million. HPS and Mr. Dovigi will each also continue to hold a minority stake in GIP and support the company's future growth. The transaction is expected to close on or about September 2, 2025.</p><p>\"The recapitalization of GIP at an enterprise value of $4.25 billion is a testament to the quality of the business its management team has built since we startedGIP in April 2022,\" said Patrick Dovigi, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of GFL. \"The approximately $200.0 million in proceeds that GFL will receive from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including de-levering our balance sheet, executing on our organic and inorganic growth strategies, including our robust M&amp;A pipeline, and pursuing opportunistic share buybacks, subject to market conditions. This transaction allows GFL to monetize part of our position in GIP in a tax efficient manner, while still retaining a meaningful equity interest that will allow us to participate in what we expect to be continued value creation from the GIP business.\"</p><p>Mr. Dovigi continued, \"After a robust evaluation showing significant interest in GIP, the board of GIP selected ECP to partner with on this transaction. ECP is a leading investor in critical infrastructure, with deep expertise and a demonstrated track record of value creation for its stakeholders. We look forward to working with ECP on executing GIP's growth strategy.\"</p><p>Mr. Dovigi concluded, \"Over the years, I have re-iterated my belief that we could create $1.0 billion of value for GFL shareholders through our investment in GIP. Our original investment of approximately $250.0 million in 2022 has grown to approximately $1.1 billion in just over three years. That is a direct reflection of the strength of GFL's management team and the execution of our strategies to create long term shareholder value. We believe that this recapitalization positions GIP to significantly exceed our original value expectations in the near term and sets the company up for an exciting period of growth.\"</p><p>Scot French, Founding Partner and Co-President of HPS, said, \"We congratulate management on this significant milestone and thank our longstanding partners at GFL for their vision and steadfast execution in building Canada's premier infrastructure service provider. We are proud to invest in companies like GIP and GFL that play an important role in maintaining and improving the critical infrastructure and essential services that people rely on every day. We look forward to continuing to partner with GFL in unlocking additional shareholder value together with GIP in its next chapter of growth.\"</p><p>\"We see significant tailwinds for GIP's essential, vertically-integrated infrastructure offerings,\" said Drew Brown, Partner at ECP. \"This transaction will provide GIP with access to significant capital to execute on a compelling M&amp;A pipeline that we believe is particularly actionable in the near-term.

Announces Agreement to Recapitalize Green Infrastructure Partners at an Enterprise Value of $4.25 Billion with Investment from Energy Capital Partners", "published": "2025-08-07", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">VAUGHAN, ON and SUMMIT, N.J., Aug. 7, 2025 /CNW/ - GFL Environmental Inc. (NYSE: GFL) (TSX: GFL) (\"GFL\" or the \"Company\") today announced that Green Infrastructure Partners (\"GIP\")has entered into a definitive agreement with funds managed by Energy Capital Partners, LLC (\"ECP\") to recapitalize its business at an enterprise value of $4.25 billion. GIP is a leading vertically integrated infrastructure company established in 2022 by GFL, funds managed by HPS Investment Partners Inc. (\"HPS Investment Partners\" or \"HPS\") and Patrick Dovigi.</p><p>On the closing of the transaction, GIP will receive aggregate gross proceeds of $775.0 million, of which it intends to return approximately $585.0 million to its shareholdersand apply $175.0 million to its balance sheet to fund future growth. GFL will receive approximately $200.0 million of the $585.0 million shareholder distribution. Pro forma for the transaction, GIP's total equity value will be approximately $3.0 billion. After the distribution to GFL of approximately $200.0 million, GFL will own an approximate 30.1% interest in GIP valued at approximately $895.0 million. HPS and Mr. Dovigi will each also continue to hold a minority stake in GIP and support the company's future growth. The transaction is expected to close on or about September 2, 2025.</p><p>\"The recapitalization of GIP at an enterprise value of $4.25 billion is a testament to the quality of the business its management team has built since we startedGIP in April 2022,\" said Patrick Dovigi, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of GFL. \"The approximately $200.0 million in proceeds that GFL will receive from the transaction will be used for general corporate purposes, including de-levering our balance sheet, executing on our organic and inorganic growth strategies, including our robust M&amp;A pipeline, and pursuing opportunistic share buybacks, subject to market conditions. This transaction allows GFL to monetize part of our position in GIP in a tax efficient manner, while still retaining a meaningful equity interest that will allow us to participate in what we expect to be continued value creation from the GIP business.\"</p><p>Mr. Dovigi continued, \"After a robust evaluation showing significant interest in GIP, the board of GIP selected ECP to partner with on this transaction. ECP is a leading investor in critical infrastructure, with deep expertise and a demonstrated track record of value creation for its stakeholders. We look forward to working with ECP on executing GIP's growth strategy.\"</p><p>Mr. Dovigi concluded, \"Over the years, I have re-iterated my belief that we could create $1.0 billion of value for GFL shareholders through our investment in GIP. Our original investment of approximately $250.0 million in 2022 has grown to approximately $1.1 billion in just over three years. That is a direct reflection of the strength of GFL's management team and the execution of our strategies to create long term shareholder value. We believe that this recapitalization positions GIP to significantly exceed our original value expectations in the near term and sets the company up for an exciting period of growth.\"</p><p>Scot French, Founding Partner and Co-President of HPS, said, \"We congratulate management on this significant milestone and thank our longstanding partners at GFL for their vision and steadfast execution in building Canada's premier infrastructure service provider. We are proud to invest in companies like GIP and GFL that play an important role in maintaining and improving the critical infrastructure and essential services that people rely on every day. We look forward to continuing to partner with GFL in unlocking additional shareholder value together with GIP in its next chapter of growth.\"</p><p>\"We see significant tailwinds for GIP's essential, vertically-integrated infrastructure offerings,\" said Drew Brown, Partner at ECP. \"This transaction will provide GIP with access to significant capital to execute on a compelling M&amp;A pipeline that we believe is particularly actionable in the near-term. With two decades of investing in North American infrastructure, ECP is well-equipped to act as a value-add partner with GIP, and we look forward to working with the talented GIP and GFL leadership teams to execute on a shared vision for growth and margin enhancement.\"</p><p>About GFL</p><p>GFL, headquartered in Vaughan, Ontario, is the fourth largest diversified environmental services company in North America, providing a comprehensive line of solid waste management services through its platform of facilities throughout Canada and 18 U.S. states.

The contamination is primarily found in an area of approximately 363 acres where mine tailings were disposed. The goal of the project is to return the land and wetlands to a productive habitat similar to what it was before mining activities.</p><p>The cleanup will include excavating contaminated soils to a depth of two metres and placing the soil in impermeable containment cells that will be constructed on site.

These areas will also be covered with clean backfill.</p><p>Since 1991, provincial legislation in Nova Scotia requires mining companies to provide funds for reclamation   such as cash or bonds   before mining begins to cover full reclamation costs.

In Western Queens, one of the most pressing environmental concerns has been the Newtown Creek shoreline, a heavily polluted waterway that has long suffered from industrial waste and neglect. Recognizing the urgent need for action, Assemblyman Juan Ardila became a leading advocate for revitalizing the area, pushing for sustainable solutions that would benefit both residents and the environment.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">During his time in office, Ardila worked alongside community leaders and environmental activists to bring attention to the issue. His efforts culminated in a rally in Long Island City, where he and other elected officials called for long-overdue restoration efforts. As LIC Post reported, Ardila's leadership helped reignite the conversation around environmental justice in Queens.</p><p>The Environmental Crisis at Newtown Creek</p><p>Newtown Creek, which forms the border between Queens and Brooklyn, has a long history of industrial pollution. The waterway was designated a Superfund site by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 2010, meaning it requires extensive cleanup due to hazardous contamination. Decades of oil spills, toxic waste dumping, and sewage overflow have left the creek in a dire state, posing health risks to nearby communities.</p><p>\"For too long, the residents of Queens and Brooklyn have had to live with the consequences of corporate pollution and government inaction. It's time we change that,\" Ardila said at the rally.</p><p>The pollution in Newtown Creek affects air quality, water safety, and public health, with studies linking it to respiratory issues and increased cancer risks in nearby neighborhoods.</p><p>Ardila's Call to Action</p><p>Juan Ardila made the revitalization of Newtown Creek a central part of his environmental platform, advocating for:</p><p>- Stronger environmental regulations to prevent further industrial pollution.<br/>- Increased state funding for cleanup and green infrastructure projects.<br/>- The creation of waterfront green spaces for public use.</p><p>As reported by LIC Post, Ardila called on state and federal agencies to accelerate the cleanup process and ensure that local residents had a voice in shaping the future of the creek.</p><p>\"Environmental justice isn't just about cleaning up the past-it's about building a sustainable future,\" Ardila said.</p><p>Community Support and Grassroots Activism</p><p>Ardila's efforts were met with widespread support from environmental groups and community organizations.

Juan understands that this isn't just an environmental issue-it's a public health crisis.\"</p><p>Pushing for Green Infrastructure and Public Access</p><p>One of Ardila's key proposals was the development of green infrastructure projects along the Newtown Creek shoreline. This included:</p><p>- Restoring natural habitats by planting native vegetation.<br/>- Improving stormwater management to reduce sewage overflow.<br/>- Creating waterfront parks to provide recreational spaces for residents.</p><p>He also fought to ensure that any future development along the creek prioritized public access over private interests, preventing corporations from further polluting the area.</p><p>\"We cannot allow Newtown Creek to remain a dumping ground. It should be a clean, thriving space for everyone in Queens and Brooklyn,\" Ardila said.</p><p>Holding Polluters Accountable</p><p>Beyond advocating for restoration efforts, Ardila pushed for stricter regulations on industrial polluters to prevent further environmental damage. He called for increased enforcement of environmental laws and higher penalties for companies that violate pollution limits.</p><p>His stance earned him praise from environmental watchdogs who have long criticized the lack of accountability for corporate polluters.</p><p>Evrima Chicago is proud to collaborate with forward-thinking changemakers, shaping the conversation around leadership that prioritizes community needs.</p><p>For press inquiries, media coverage, or interview requests, reach out to us at pr@evrimachicago.com  .</p><p>SOURCE: Juan Ardila</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/government/juan-ardilas-fight-for-climate-action-revitalizing-the-newtown-creek-shoreline-1013003\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["The pollution in Newtown Creek affects air quality, water safety, and public health, with studies linking it to respiratory issues and increased cancer risks in nearby neighborhoods.

In addition to panel sessions and networking events, delegates participated in the annual policy session, where resolutions are debated and adopted to guide the BC Chamber\u2019s advocacy work for the year ahead. Of the 40 policy resolutions presented, 38 were approved and will be included in the upcoming 2025\u201326 Policies and Positions Manual.</p><p>A few examples of resolutions that resonated with our Chamber and for our business community include:</p><p>\u07e6 WorkSafe BC \u2013 Refund Overfunded Surplus to Employers. This was a renewing policy submitted by the Surrey Board of Trade and the Duncan Cowichan Chamber of Commerce, as this is still an issue as WorkSafe BC currently has a surplus of $1.9 billion and reserves of $5.1 billion. It is recommended that a framework be introduced for direct surplus distribution to employers while still maintaining system stability.</p><p>\u07e6 Ending the Patchwork Approach to Adoption of the BC Zero Carbon Step Code, where it was recommended the current 2030 timeframe be reviewed in consultation with industry and local government to develop a new, longer-term timeframe that is more appropriate and an achievable target. Also ensuring the energy choice remains available to businesses to homeowners by allowing the continued use of alternative low-emission energy sources such as renewable natural gas and hydrogen.</p><p>\u07e6 Equitable Access to Health Care Services for All British Columbians, which included the recommendation to allocate equitable health care funding from the 2025 bilateral agreement and a 5% annual top-up from the Federal government to underserved and underfunded regional health authorities in BC.</p><p>\u07e6 Strategic Investment in BC Ports and Transportation Corridors, which recommends the Federal government invest in green infrastructure Port and Rail projects that address future supply chain demands.</p><p>The conference also brought some positive news for the Cowichan Chamber network. President David Van Deventer was acclaimed as the new Vancouver Island and Gulf Islands representative on the BC Chamber Board of Directors. His appointment provides Cowichan with a direct voice in provincial policy discussions and decisionmaking at the board level.</p><p>In addition to policy work, delegates had the chance to hear from guest speakers, industry experts, and caucus members from both the BC Green Party and Conservative Party of BC. Topics ranged from interprovincial trade and small business support to clean energy development and housing infrastructure.</p><p>The Policies and Positions Manual willbe made public later this month and shared with government ministries and decision-makers at both the provincial and federal levels. For the Cowichan Chamber, the AGM was an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to the provincial conversation and ensure that local priorities are reflected in the year ahead.</p><p>To learn more about the work of the Duncan Cowichan Chamber of Commerce, or to find out how you can get involved, visit<url normalizedValue=\"http://www.duncancc.bc.ca\">www.duncancc.bc.ca</url> or contact the Chamber office at 250-748-1111 or <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:chamber@duncancc.bc.ca\">chamber@duncancc.bc.ca</email></p>", "publisher": "Cowichan Citizen", "instances": ["Also ensuring the energy choice remains available to businesses to homeowners by allowing the continued use of alternative low-emission energy sources such as renewable natural gas and hydrogen. \u07e6 Equitable Access to Health Care Services for All British Columbians, which included the recommendation to allocate equitable health care funding from the 2025 bilateral agreement and a 5% annual top-up from the Federal government to underserved and underfunded regional health authorities in BC.

Improving accessibility and sustainability are also key elements.</p><p>But at its core, the Revitalization project is a major infrastructure replacement effort.</p><p>Engineering evaluations have revealed serious issues beneath the surface. Existing watermains, composed of aging cast and ductile iron, have experienced three recent breaks. The storm sewer network is significantly deteriorated, showing corrosion, joint separation, and sediment accumulation. The sanitary sewer, which is made of vitrified clay, is extensively cracked.</p><p>The proposed upgrades include full replacement and upsizing of the watermain, sanitary, and storm systems to increase service capacity, ensure reliability, and mitigate flood risks during heavy rainfall.</p><p>The 30 percent design also introduces a range of public realm enhancements intended to improve user experience. Wider boulevard areas would allow for broader sidewalks, added landscaping, and more functional open spaces. Angled curb extensions and redesigned laneways are also planned to improve traffic flow, accommodate parking access, and facilitate bus operations.</p><p>However, traffic assessments presented at the open house found Main Street too narrow for dedicated bike lanes. Additional traffic data will be collected to guide future decisions on signalling and pedestrian crossings.</p><p>\u201cReaching the 30 percent design milestone means we\u2019ve established the foundational layout and functional elements of the revitalized Downtown,\u201d Mandy Paglia, Manager of Capital Projects, said in comments to Bullet Point News. \u201cThis includes confirming infrastructure needs, minimum lane configurations, and general streetscape concepts such as sidewalk widths, patio zones, and low-impact development strategies.\u201d</p><p>\u201cIt\u2019s about aligning the vision with technical feasibility,\u201d she added.</p><p>Presented design specifications call for 3.3-metre traffic lanes. The cross-section also displayed 1.5-metre sidewalks and a 1.4-metre landscape and streetlight buffer between pedestrians and the roadway. On-street parking would maintain its current orientation at 2.5 metres in width, with an additional 0.5-metre buffer separating parked vehicles from moving traffic.</p><p>Curb bump-outs and sidewalk extensions are prominently featured to improve pedestrian visibility and safety. Landscape elements under consideration include tree plantings, permeable paving options, and bioretention areas to help manage stormwater runoff.</p><p>The updated designs, now available in a document posted to the Town\u2019s consultation website, build on the earlier layout concept presented to the public in 2022.</p><p>\u201cThe current designs reflect updated technical assessments and renewed community engagement.

Kyla Knowles. \u201cBut I think it\u2019s the right direction.\u201d</p><p>Among the plan\u2019s key strategies is a citywide reduction in speed limits \u2013 dropping limits on residential roads to 30 kilometres per hour and exploring 40 kilometres per hour limits on major corridors. Another move calls for reallocating at least 10 percent of current road space from vehicles to green infrastructure, bike lanes, and pedestrian paths.\u00a0</p><p>Other measures include implementing smarter parking policies, investing in transit-friendly infrastructure like new overpasses near SkyTrain stations, and encouraging micromobility options like e-scooters and bike-sharing.</p><p>The updates are a direct response to the city\u2019s 2020 Climate Action Plan and come after more than two years of planning, public engagement, and debate.\u00a0</p><p>They follow the widely used \u201cAvoid-Shift-Improve\u201d framework, which prioritizes reducing unnecessary trips, promoting mode shifts to transit and active travel, and improving efficiency of unavoidable vehicle use.</p><p>Feedback from the first two phases of engagement showed strong support for prioritizing active transportation, expanding transit options, and improving safety and connectivity for pedestrians and cyclists. Safety, affordability, and accessibility were also recurring themes.</p><p>\u201cMany respondents would like to see improvement in vehicle flow, suggesting a reduction in vehicle movements, reallocating road space for vulnerable users and specified uses, and improving access to arterial roads,\u201d the city\u2019s engagement summary stated.</p><p>Absent from the strategy is any consideration to widen St. Johns Street.</p><p>Coun.

What works is to get people out of their cars,\u201d Lubik said.</p><p>Jeff Moi, the city\u2019s general manager of engineering and operations, noted that since 2017, studies have shown that any widening project would only provide temporary relief.</p><p>Moi added reducing vehicle traffic is linked to guiding development to areas already well-served by infrastructure, such as transit oriented areas around SkyTrain stations.</p><p>\u201cPlanning growth in the right areas is our best chance at shifting the modes,\u201d Moi said.\u00a0</p><p>Still, several councillors emphasized the importance of communicating the strategy effectively to the public, who have often complained about worsening traffic conditions along the city\u2019s main roads.</p><p>Coun.

That\u2019s going to add vehicles to the roads \u2013 no matter what.\u201d</p><p>Coun. Haven Lurbiecki said Port Moody\u2019s traffic woes will ultimately ultimately depend on council\u2019s land-use decisions, and how many parking spaces accompany new developments.</p><p>She also emphasized the importance of preserving industrial and employment lands, and aligning transportation with the city\u2019s economic development goals to reduce commuting.</p><p>\u201cPutting more condos around a SkyTrain does not mean someone doesn\u2019t have to go downstairs to get to their car to get to work,\u201d Lurbiecki said. \u201cWe can do what we can to have walkable amenities so that those car trips are less, but people will still be using those cars, and traffic will still get worse.\u201d</p><p>Couns. Samantha Agtarap and Lubik both noted shifting modes of transportation are already occurring, pointing to the rising utility of cargo bikes and car share programs.</p><p>\u201cThe mode shift, it doesn\u2019t have to mean you always ride your bike or you always walk, it\u2019s just making those trips easier and more desirable for people,\u201d Agtarap said. \u201cIt\u2019s very heartening to see that shift already occurring.\u201d</p><p>She also supported the speed limit reductions from a public safety perspective, noting Port Moody\u2019s aging population.</p><p>The next step is for staff to return to council with a detailed implementation and funding plan. The final cost of projects has not yet been calculated, though the city anticipates drawing on a mix of municipal, regional, and grant-based funding sources.</p><p>Information about the plan will be made available on the city\u2019s website, and staff have committed to continued public engagement as implementation begins.</p><p>Coun. Amy Lubik summed up the stakes: \u201cWhen we look at our community surveys, one of the biggest things that people talk about is traffic \u2013 and people sometimes forget that they are traffic.

With nearly 90 per cent of people in the Paris region engaged with the Games, the celebrations were spilling out into every street, venue and screen.

In Tahiti, surfers conquered the waves of Teahupo'o, showing how Paris 2024 expanded both the reach and meaning of the Games. Around five billion people around the world, 84 per cent of the potential audience, followed the magic of Paris 2024, making them the most followed Olympic Games ever.</p><p>In keeping with its motto, \"Games Wide Open\", Paris 2024 was the first edition fully aligned with the principles of the Olympic Agenda reforms - the IOC's strategic roadmap to make the Games more inclusive, more sustainable and better tailored to the needs of their host.</p><p>And Paris showed this Agenda in action - from planning and procurement to delivery and legacy. Every decision was guided by the question: how can the Games serve the city, its people and generations to come?</p><p>More sport for more people</p><p>Paris 2024 put sport at the heart of daily life - especially for young people. Through the \"Bouger Plus\" campaign, 30 minutes of daily physical activity are now being introduced into all French primary schools.

The \"Impact 2024\" Fund supported grassroots projects that brought sport and social innovation to 4.5 million people.</p><p>Over 5,000 municipalities across France took part in the \"Terre de Jeux\" programme, hosting over 50,000 sport-related events since 2019. Some 370 of those municipalities have been awarded the \"Ville Active et Sportive\" label, which recognises innovative sports policies and, to date, has been granted to towns and cities that between them are home to more than a third of France's population.</p><p>The Paris 2024 Organising Committee's EUR 76 million budgetary surplus will help carry the Olympic and Paralympic legacy further, with the Paris 2024 Endowment Fund responsible for the promotion and development of sport across France.</p><p>An inclusive celebration</p><p>Inclusivity ran through every detail of the Games. One million tickets were distributed free of charge to local residents. Every venue was designed or upgraded to improve their accessibility. Those with disabilities participated not just as athletes, but as fans, volunteers, organisers and performers.</p><p>Gender equality was a defining feature. Paris 2024 was the first Games to achieve full gender parity on the field of play - thanks to the quota places being distributed equally by the IOC to men and women. Twenty-eight of 32 sports reached full gender balance, and 196 delegations selected both a male and female flagbearer for the Opening Ceremony.</p><p>Across the country, thousands of community celebrations brought the Games into everyday life - proving that Paris 2024 truly belonged to everyone.</p><p>Delivering social and economic impact</p><p>The Games generated an estimated EUR 7 to 11 billion in net value for the Greater Paris region, boosting local industries, skills development and long-term investment. This impact was widely shared, making sure the Games contributed positively to local communities and integrated social considerations into economic opportunities. Over 181,000 people were employed across sectors and 90 per cent of suppliers were French, 80 per cent of which were small or medium-sized enterprises. More than 800 local businesses from the social and solidarity economy helped deliver the Games, bringing visibility and momentum to inclusive entrepreneurship.</p><p>Seine-Saint-Denis, one of France's most diverse and disadvantaged departments, was at the heart of the Games, hosting the Olympic Village and the Olympic Aquatics Centre. The Village is now being converted into a permanent eco-neighbourhood, with private and social housing, schools, nurseries and green public spaces. Having recently re-opened to the public, the Aquatics Centre is now a permanent public facility, creating opportunities for everyday sport in one of France's most underserved areas for sports infrastructure. To mark the first anniversary of the Paris 2024 Opening Ceremony, the centre will be open for free to the public on 26 July 2025, thanks to an initiative by the Greater Paris Metropolitan Area and Saint-Denis authorities.</p><p>Major upgrades to transport, green infrastructure and community services were accelerated. A former Paris 2024 fan zone, Parc Georges-Valbon, located in the heart of Seine-Saint-Denis, underwent its own transformation, becoming France's largest new urban park and offering residents long-overdue access to nature and recreation.</p><p>One of the most powerful symbols of regeneration is the Seine itself. After a century of pollution, the river was cleaned and reopened for public swimming - a major effort that was accelerated by the Games. On 5 July 2025, three new natural swimming areas - at Bras Marie, Bercy and Grenelle - opened to the public.</p><p>Throughout the capital, new green spaces, revitalised streets and a calmer urban environment are improving the quality of life - not just for visitors, but for Parisians themselves.</p><p>A lighter footprint</p><p>These benefits were delivered while also raising the bar for sustainability. Paris 2024 was the first edition of the Games aligned with the Paris Agreement on climate change, cutting the carbon footprint in half compared to the average of London 2012 and Rio 2016. Ninety-five per cent of venues were existing or temporary, with just three low-carbon new builds.</p><p>Nearly all six million assets used were reused, recycled or donated. The entire event was powered by renewable energy - with no diesel generators in use and even solar panels floating on the Seine.</p><p>Some 87 per cent of spectators used public or active transport, thanks to expanded bike lanes, better infrastructure and a Games plan designed around accessibility and efficiency.</p><p>A model, not a template</p><p>Paris didn't just host the Games - it redefined what hosting can mean.</p><p>At the core of this shift were the reforms of Olympic Agenda: a commitment to flexibility, relevance and long-term value. The Games are not a fixed model. Instead, they are shaped around the host's priorities - whether that's social inclusion, climate action, economic development or urban regeneration.</p><p>Paris 2024 brought that vision to life, proving that sport can be a catalyst for systemic change - when it is integrated, intentional and inclusive from the start.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from International Olympic Committee on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: International Olympic Committee<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/international-olympic-committee\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/international-olympic-committee</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: International Olympic Committee</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/business-and-professional-services/a-year-on-paris-2024-belongs-to-everyone-1051729\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["Having recently re-opened to the public, the Aquatics Centre is now a permanent public facility, creating opportunities for everyday sport in one of France's most underserved areas for sports infrastructure.

In 2001, K.B. Industries, a wholly owned subsidiary of AP&amp;I, was formed upon the birth of KBI Flexi-Pave. The history behind this technology also provides the reader clarity in the hurdles Bagnall faced for engineering acceptance as he first brought KBI Flexi-Pave to market in the United States as well as the valuable insight he gained into the product's passive nutrient removal capacity. Hailing from Barnsley, UK, Bagnall took his vision overseas in 2010, establishing KBI UK Ltd. Undergoing similar product engineering testing, Bagnall successfully created a new market for pervious paving in the United Kingdom, which still operates today.</p><p>June's newsletter also discusses trip and fall hazard litigation and mitigation. Trip and fall hazards are among the leading causes of injury in the United States, posing a public physical danger as well as a legal and financial liability to property owners. One of the most prevalent causes of trip and fall hazards is uneven surfaces, such as sidewalks and pathways, as a result of tree root intrusion, erosion and poorly executed repairs. As explained in this month's issue, KBI Flexi-Pave mitigates this problem by maintaining superior flexibility, even in extreme weather conditions. The expansion and contraction capabilities of KBI Flexi-Pave act as one big expansion joint, allowing stormwater to pass through the pore space at a rate of 3,000 gallons of water per square foot per hour.</p><p>This month's issue also highlights the \"Life-Cycle Cost Analysis for Traditional and Permeable Pavements\", as studied by Southern Illinois University's School of Engineering. In a Case Study of the City of Key West, Florida, the municipality was plagued by trip and fall hazard liability issues for years, especially in the Old Town historic district, a main thoroughfare for thousands of tourists visiting the coastal city every year. More than a decade ago, K.B. Industries installed KBI Flexi-Pave throughout the historic district and its surrounding areas and, as a result, successfully mitigated further trip and fall hazards for the City of Key West caused from uneven surfaces. This ultimately saved the City- and its taxpayers- hundreds of thousands of dollars in legal fees and settlements over the years.</p><p>Today, urban designers worldwide are actively implementing sustainable features such as pervious paving solutions as part of comprehensive green infrastructure strategies to enhance stormwater management, reduce flood risks, mitigate urban heat, and improve environmental quality in cities.

It marked the third time his home had flooded.</p><p>He wasn\u2019t the only one.\u00a0</p><p>Resident Karri Siemms watched as the creek behind her home surged over its banks and swallowed her backyard. Within minutes, water breached the Applewood Hills Greenbelt trail and rushed toward her house.</p><p>\u201cSo that ensued to panic,\u201d Siemms told The Pointer in May.\u00a0</p><p>She and her son raced to move electronics and try to shovel water away as it pushed into their basement. \u201cThe first one was pretty quick, and then it\u2019s like nothing happened,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBy 1:20, the sun\u2019s out. By five o'clock, we were sitting there going, \u2018Did that really just happen?\u2019\u201d\u00a0</p><p>But there was more to come.</p><p>On August 17 and 18, up to 170 millimetres of rain drenched parts of Mississauga and the GTA.\u00a0</p><p>For Siemms and her husband, Craig, it was a painful repeat of 2013; another basement lost to floodwater, another round of rebuilding.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cI lost so much,\u201d she said. \u201cSo much.\u201d</p><p>In both storms, streets and highways flooded, trapping residents in vehicles and forcing the evacuation of over 100 seniors from Tyndall Seniors Village. The damage to homes, businesses, and infrastructure was widespread and long-lasting.</p><p>For many, the financial toll has only compounded the trauma.\u00a0</p><p>One senior resident, who asked not to be named, shared that she and her husband lost \"everything\", washer, dryer, furnace, water heater, rugs, furniture and appliances, when 12 inches of sewer water filled their basement. Insurance covered a small portion of the loss.\u00a0</p><p>\u201cWe had no air conditioning, and we had no hot water for three weeks, which is a long time,\u201d she added.</p><p>Suazon echoed the same frustrations, still dealing with insurers months later. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to deal with these kinds of losses, especially when you've worked so hard, piece by piece, to build your life here as an immigrant,\u201d he said.</p><p>According to the Insurance Bureau of Canada, the flooding in Ontario this summer caused more than $1 billion in insured damage, with $940 million from the July storm alone, making it the second-costliest flood season in the province\u2019s history.</p><p>In September 2024, Mississauga Council approved a city-wide Flood Mitigation Action Plan, with targeted initiatives across multiple wards.</p><p>In Ward 1, where both Suazon and Siemms live, the City initiated a capacity review of the trunk storm sewer near Harvest Drive to address overflows from Little Etobicoke Creek.\u00a0</p><p>In Ward 3, staff began a comprehensive riverine flooding review upstream of Dixie and Dundas, including feasibility studies for detention ponds near the Tyndall Seniors Home and a possible creek diversion.</p><p>The City also moved ahead with land acquisition for the Dixie-Dundas Flood Mitigation Project, which includes replacing the Dundas Street East bridge, a key recommendation from a 2021 Toronto and Region Conservation Authority study. The project is fully funded in Mississauga\u2019s capital plan, with an estimated cost of $8.3 to $9.5 million.\u00a0</p><p>In Ward 5, the Historic Malton Village saw design work start for sewer upgrades on Cattrick and Hull Streets to reduce flooding and outlet blockages.\u00a0</p><p>In Ward 10, a downspout disconnection pilot moved ahead in Black Walnut Trail, and the design of the fourth pumping station was fast-tracked in Lisgar.</p><p>An investigation was launched for flooding in North Streetsville, with a sewer capacity review slated for this year in Ward 11.</p><p>To manage the flood response workload, Council also approved funding to hire more contract staff and, in November, backed a $30-million increase to the 2025 stormwater budget, which includes 20 new full-time positions for infrastructure maintenance and mitigation.\u00a0</p><p>Another $10 million was allocated to sewer upgrades in Malton.</p><p>Despite this progress, City officials issued a stark warning last year: Mississauga\u2019s stormwater reserves could be depleted by 2026 without new sources of revenue.\u00a0</p><p>At a council meeting in November, interim infrastructure planning director Emma Calvert said the City may need to increase stormwater charges or divert future provincial and federal grants to these critical projects.</p><p>Calvert also unveiled the City\u2019s 10-year capital plan, outlining $365 million in stormwater infrastructure investments through 2034 for projects like upgrades to storm sewers along the Dundas BRT corridor, drainage improvements in Port Credit, Credit River erosion control estimated at $2.8 million by 2029, and stormwater pond dredging and Cooksville Creek restoration projected to cost $7.8 million in 2032.</p><p>Some emergency work has already been completed, including the installation of a 1.2-metre temporary floodwall along Little Etobicoke Creek, a major sewer inlet upgrade near Tonolli Drive just north of the Queensway, and a check valve along Cooksville Creek to prevent dangerous backflow.</p><p>The City has also rolled out real-time monitoring for 1,300 stormwater inlets, identifying 70 as high-priority locations. These sites, once cleaned just twice annually, are now inspected weekly and cleared after every major rainfall.</p><p>Mississauga\u2019s Climate Change Action Plan warns that by 2050, storms like the ones in 2024 will occur every six years instead of every 40.

In the UAE and broader GCC region, this urgency is amplified by a unique mix of environmental sensitivity, ambitious development agendas, and climate-related risks. That's where \"building with nature\" comes in, a concept that is both innovative and deeply rooted in ancient wisdom.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">At Terra Nexus, this isn't just a philosophy, it's our practice. As an environmental consultancy firm specializing in infrastructure and the built environment, we help clients align growth with ecological stewardship, delivering real-world solutions that balance environmental priorities with development objectives.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">What Does \"Building with Nature\" Really Mean?</p><p>At its core, building with nature means designing infrastructure and urban developments in ways that harmonize with natural systems rather than working against them. It's about making strategic decisions that:</p><p>- Minimize environmental disruption<br/>- Preserve or enhance ecosystems<br/>- Build climate resilience into infrastructure<br/>- Unlock long-term benefits for both people and the planet</p><p>Globally, the construction sector is one of the largest contributors to climate change and resource depletion:</p><p>- The 2022 Global Status Report for Buildings and Construction (UNEP/GlobalABC) highlights that in 2021, the sector was responsible for over 34% of global energy demand and about 37% of energy- and process-related CO\u2082 emissions.<br/>- Climate Action Accelerator reports that the buildings sector (both construction and operation) accounted for 36% of global energy consumption in 2020, which aligns with the 30-32% range commonly cited<br/>- It is responsible for over 50% of raw material extraction worldwide (EU Analysis).</p><p>This scale of impact means our industry holds powerful potential for positive change. Read more about Green Building Certification here and the Top Green Building Benefits.</p><p>Localizing the Approach: The UAE and GCC Context</p><p>Across the Gulf region, massive infrastructure and urban planning projects are reshaping coastlines, deserts, and mountains capes. From NEOM to new waterfront masterplans in the UAE, growth is happening at an unprecedented pace. This makes environmental planning more essential than ever.</p><p>At Terra Nexus, we specialize in embedding environmental intelligence early in the development lifecycle. Our projects range from mixed-use mega-developments on thousands of acres to localized upgrades like improving marine water quality in a coastal marina.</p><p>Key point: Early involvement is critical. When we are brought into a project during the planning and design phase, we can make the most meaningful impact, steering decisions that avoid sensitive habitats, reduce construction impacts, and improve long-term sustainability outcomes.</p><p>Real-World Examples: Building with Nature in Action:</p><p>UAE Coastal Development Masterplan</p><p>In a confidential but large-scale coastal development in the UAE, Terra Nexus provided ecological mapping and strategic advice on land use. Our goal: identify which areas were suitable for development and which should be preserved due to environmental value.</p><p>Results:</p><p>- Protected kilometers of seagrass beds and coral reefs<br/>- Conserved ecologically valuable land from being cleared<br/>- Integrated blue-green infrastructure to mitigate flood risk and cool urban microclimates</p><p>By applying geospatial analysis and ecological assessments, we helped the project team design a world-class destination with a minimized environmental footprint.</p><p>Mountain Hospitality Destination in Saudi Arabia</p><p>In a mountainous, forested region of Saudi Arabia, Terra Nexus led the environmental framework for a new hospitality and residential masterplan. Despite its remote location, the project presented ecological challenges: flood-prone zones, erosion risks, and forested areas at risk of being cleared.</p><p>Some of the solutions that we implemented on the project included:</p><p>- Avoiding high-risk areas and integrating erosion protection measures<br/>- Creating ecological corridors for wildlife movement and habitat connectivity<br/>- Developing a native planting palette tailored to the site's climate and soil<br/>- Enhancing forest preservation within the development envelope</p><p>This case shows how even complex sites with rugged terrains can benefit from an approach that works with, not against, natural features.</p><p>Retrofitting Nature into Existing Projects</p><p>While early planning is ideal, building with nature isn't limited to greenfield sites. Even in already-developed areas, upgrades and rehabilitation projects can bring environmental and social value.</p><p>For example, we partnered with engineers to improve water circulation in a small UAE marina where stagnation had reduced water quality. With minor engineered interventions, marine health improved, benefiting both environmental quality and overall user experience.</p><p>In these retrofit scenarios, phasing and stakeholder coordination are key. Creative thinking, combined with empathy for operational realities, helps deliver win-win outcomes.</p><p>Key Benefits of Building with Nature</p><p>Whether you're working in the UAE or halfway around the world, here are five compelling reasons to adopt a building with nature strategy:</p><p>- Lower capital and operational costs - Leveraging natural topography, materials, and systems can reduce the need for expensive earthworks or engineered infrastructure.<br/>- Enhanced climate resilience - Nature-based designs reduce vulnerability to flooding, erosion, and extreme heat.<br/>- Improved livability and user experience - Green spaces, natural shade, and biodiversity improve wellbeing for residents and visitors alike.<br/>- Regulatory readiness - In regions like the UAE and KSA, environmental permitting is mandatory. Building with nature ensures compliance and competitive advantage.<br/>- Positive brand and investor perception - Sustainable, eco-sensitive developments are increasingly attractive to both stakeholders and the public.</p><p>This approach also makes business sense. Developers benefit from cost savings, long-term durability, and market differentiation.</p><p>Challenges, and How We Overcome Them</p><p>Implementing this philosophy isn't without hurdles:</p><p>- Speed of development: In the GCC, projects move quickly. You need nimble, adaptive strategies.<br/>- Changing mindsets: Some stakeholders remain rooted in traditional \"hard\" engineering methods.<br/>- Budget concerns: Upfront costs may appear high, even if long-term savings exist.</p><p>Our response:</p><p>- Use data visualization and GIS tools to show clear environmental risks and solutions.<br/>- Present a business case alongside ecological benefits.<br/>- Ensure recommendations are feasible, grounded in regulatory context, and matched to available resources.<br/>- Engage with design teams as collaborators, not enforcers, building trust and shared vision.</p><p>Why Local Expertise Matters</p><p>Environmental conditions are highly contextual. Soil, water, climate, regulations, community norms, these differ not only country to country but even city to city. That's why local knowledge is vital.</p><p>At Terra Nexus, our team understands:</p><p>- The intricacies of the region's unique climate, native species, and marine habitats<br/>- How to navigate permits and approvals with local authorities<br/>- The realities of contracting, supply chains, and land-use constraints</p><p>Partnering with Inogen Alliance gives us access to global tools and peer expertise, but it's our local insight that ensures success on the ground.</p><p>Final Takeaways</p><p>If you're just starting your journey into building with nature, here are two simple but powerful pieces of advice:</p><p>- Keep an open mind. Rethinking traditional infrastructure practices can feel disruptive, but it opens the door to smarter, more resilient development.<br/>- Get the right experts on board early. Cross-disciplinary collaboration, urban planners, ecologists, engineers, and regulators, is the key to success.</p><p>As we move toward a future of growing climate and resource challenges, the question isn't can we afford to build with nature, it's can we afford not to.</p><p>About the Author<br/>Nivine Issa is the Managing Director of Terra Nexus, an environmental consultancy based in Dubai and part of the Inogen Alliance.

Heatwaves, floods, fires, and storms are increasingly impacting urban areas, and our own region is no exception.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Addressing these challenges at the local level is crucial, and GreenUP is at the forefront of this effort in Peterborough. In 2024, Peterborough is among 27 communities across seven provinces participating in Green Communities Canada's Living Cities Canada Fund projects, with GreenUP leading the local implementation of transformative green infrastructure initiatives.</p><p>The Living Cities Canada Fund initiative supports projects that make Canadian communities like Peterborough more abundant, equitable, and thriving. These projects aim to reduce the urban heat island effect, improve stormwater management, mitigate flood risks, enhance local air quality, and promote the physical and mental well-being of residents by connecting them to nature, and adding new greenspaces in areas of need.</p><p>With a long legacy of programs like DePave, NeighbourPLAN and Sustainable Urban Neighbourhoods, GreenUP brings extensive experience and expertise to projects that improve our urban landscape. Laura Keresztesi, a program co-ordinator at GreenUP, has a wealth of experience in participatory engagement and co-design processes. Her leadership ensures that the projects not only meet environmental goals but also foster community involvement and support.</p><p>One of GreenUP's notable Living Cities projects this year is the School Yard Greening Project at Keith Wightman Public School. In collaboration with the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board, the initiative engages students and staff in the design of a planting project that will transform 150 square meters of the schoolyard. The project will plant shade trees and create green play areas that also serve to boost biodiversity. With planting scheduled for early October, the project will feature willow tunnels, a native grass maze, a shady grove of trees, and several small-scale \"Little Forests\" full of diverse species of trees and shrubs.</p><p>Meanwhile, at Thomas A. Stewart Secondary School, GreenUP is proudly working with older students to transform a 100-square-meter patch of non-native Kentucky Bluegrass (a typical lawn grass) into a dense pocket of biodiversity. More than 25 students and staff participated in soil preparation on June 13, moving compost and mulch to enrich the area where a not-so Little Forest will be planted in the fall.</p><p>A third significant project involves a partnership with One City to both enhance stormwater management and create edible infrastructure at Trinity Centre. Guests of One City programs have contributed ideas for rain gardens, fruit trees, pollinator gardens, and seating areas. Work is set to begin in August, with major planting activities planned for late September.</p><p>Projects like these not only enhance green infrastructure, but also work to build community. To achieve long-term success, new plantings must be nurtured by community members through their first three years. GreenUP is currently seeking Living Cities volunteers to be involved in tasks ranging from site preparation, planting, ongoing maintenance, to photography. Volunteers are also sought specifically for the Living Cities stewardship team to help with watering, weeding, and mulching. Additionally, projects welcome in-kind contributions such as professional landscaping services, compost, mulch, plant materials, fencing, or food and drink donations for volunteer appreciation. Anyone interested in getting involved in this work should contact Laura Keresztesi for more information.</p><p>GreenUP is grateful for the support of the Living Cities Canada Fund from Green Communities Canada, which supports these projects. To continue to bring community-led green initiatives to fruition, charitable donations are critical. Donations fund the purchase of necessary materials and services, ensuring the success of each project. And as a charity, a tax receipt is issued for any contributions that are made to GreenUP.</p><p>As Peterborough and 27 other Canadian communities work together through the Living Cities initiative, they pave the way for greener, more equitable, and resilient urban environments. The collaborative efforts of GreenUP, local residents, schools, organizations, and volunteers underscore the power of community to address climate challenges right here at home.</p><p>Interested in the broader impact of climate change on vulnerable communities?
