There is now a real concern that a number of species of plants and animals have been wiped off the face of the Earth by the bushfires that began in September. Ecologists from the University of Sydney now estimate some 480 million animals have been killed since September, per News.com.au. [1]  Tracy Burgess, a volunteer at Wildlife Information, Rescue and Education Services (WIRES), is very concerned they are not receiving as many animals as would be expected during this crisis, reports Reuters.[2]  'We're not getting that many animals coming into care,' she said, adding, 'So, our concern is that they don't come into care because they're not there anymore, basically.' </p><p>WIRES and other animal welfare groups usually discourage people from feeding wild animals but the scope of the wildfires has prompted them to change that advice - encouraging people to provide much-needed food and water when possible. With fires still raging across New South Wales and Victoria, horrendous scenes of kangaroos fleeing walls of fire, charred bodies of koalas and cockatoos falling dead out of trees have horrified the world as it tries to take in the scale of the unfolding disaster. Koalas have been especially hard hit by the fires. They are slow-moving and only eat leaves from the eucalyptus tree - which is filled with oil, making them highly flammable. Up to a third of NSW koalas have been killed in the fires to date - that is a number of around 8,.000. Notre Dame, a fucking church! burns and $1 billion is donated to fix a building.

'(Koalas) really have no capacity to move fast enough to get away' as the flames jumped from treetop to treetop, he said. Mr. Greene was addressing the NSW upper house inquiry concerning the status of the Koala population in light of the \"unprecedented\" unfolding disaster.

'We're getting a lot of lessons out of this and it's just showing how unprepared we are,' Dr. Leigh said. \"There's no procedures or protocols in place \u2014 even wildlife carers don't have protocols for when they can go in after the fire.'

More rain was forecast for Friday and the weekend which, if it does fall, would be the most sustained period of wet weather since the crisis began in September last year.Still, with January, February and March typically seeing some of the hottest weather in Australia, the bushfire crisis was far from over.\"We still have a long way to go,\" said Robyn Duell, a senior climatologist with the Bureau of Meteorology. \"And with higher temperatures, we'll continue to see an elevated risk of bushfires as we move through summer and early autumn.\"This week's rains could also make battles harder for firefighters in some cases, by making it harder for trucks to venture deep into forests on muddy tracks, authorities warned.Flash floods are another concern, with scorched mountains unable to hold the water and potentially sending torrents of muddy ash into waterways.- Climate change crisis -Australia endures bushfires every year, but they started much earlier than normal in 2019 and have lasted far longer. Forests and farming land were already extremely dry due to a prolonged drought, providing the foundations for the fire crisis when extreme hot weather hit well before the start of the southern summer.Australia experienced its driest and hottest year on record in 2019, with its highest average maximum temperature of 41.9 degrees Celsius (107.4 degrees Fahrenheit) recorded in mid-December.The fires have destroyed more than 2,000 homes and burnt 10 million hectares (25 million acres) of land -- an area larger than South Korea or Portugal.Scientists say the bushfires are the type of extreme disaster the world can expect more of as global warming intensifies.The past decade was the hottest on record globally, the United Nations said on Wednesday.\"What's happening is persistent, not a fluke due to some weather phenomenon,\" said Gavin Schmidt, director of NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, which provided one of the datasets for the UN report.\"We know that the long-term trends are being driven by the increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.\" </p><p/>", "publisher": "Digital Journal", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 22, "title": "Coulson Aviation 737 tanker crews back in the air fighting Australian bushfires", "published": "2020-01-27", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">A Vancouver Island-based fireflighting fleet is back in the air in Australia in the wake of a crash that killed three people last week.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Coulson Group CEO Wayne Coulson paid tribute to the flight crew killed Jan. 23 when their C-130 Hercules converted air tanker crashed in the Snowy Mountain region of New South Wales, Australia.</p><p>Coulson and his family flew to the crash site on Saturday and walked the nearly one-kilometre crash area where the wreckage of the aircraft remains.

But the after-effects will endure, and national soul searching has already begun.\"We know events like these can challenge the way we think about the world, undermine our perceptions of safety, and rupture social bonds,\" said disaster response expert Erin Smith. Dozens of families have lost loved ones, thousands of homes and farms have been gutted, swathes of the east coast are scarred charcoal-black and millions have had their sense of security shaken.\"It will likely take years and a great deal of imagination for us to figure out where we go from here,\" said Smith.The question of what is next for Australia is already being asked, most of all of political leaders, and it is being met mostly with finger-pointing and recrimination.- 'Heads above the parapet' -While scientists agree climate change created favourable conditions for the blazes, politicians of all stripes are acutely aware how sensitive the issue is in Australian politics.In an arid nation whose economic strength is intimately tied to the mining and export of fossil fuels, at least four prime ministers have been ousted in part over their climate policies.In recent weeks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison has seen his ruling conservative coalition threatened by members in rural constituencies demanding funding for more coal-fired power plants.At the same time, the centrist wing of his party has criticised his climate targets as inadequate.Meanwhile rebel members of opposition Labor met secretly to steer the centre-left party's leadership toward a more overtly pro-coal stance.The party's deputy leader awkwardly refused to rule out more coal subsidies, months after vowing they should end.\"They don't want to stick their heads above the parapet, at least when it comes to suggesting substantive policy,\" said Matt McDonald, an expert in climate politics from the University of Queensland.One reason, he explained, is that while the hot and dry Australian continent is uniquely susceptible to the impact of climate change, it is also a world-beating source of coal.Coal accounts for around 75 percent of Australia's electricity generation and exports of the fossil fuel are worth Aus$60 billion a year, the country's largest export after iron ore. </p><p>People in affluent suburbs may call for emissions cuts and green energy, but coal accounts for thousands of jobs in election-deciding districts of Queensland and New South Wales, and many more in the related aluminium smelting business.Independent MP Zali Steggall -- a former barrister and Olympic medal-winning skier -- who ousted climate-sceptic former prime minister Tony Abbott from his Sydney seat at the last election, wants to take some heat out of the debate.She has introduced a bill that would reduce Australia's carbon emissions to zero by 2050 and divert some contentious issues to an independent expert body.\"The debate has been very divisive,\" in part because of the blame game, Steggall told AFP. \"There was a certain defensiveness in the early days of this debate because the finger was so squarely pointed at coal and fossil fuels.\" \"You have to think about a generation that worked really hard at building Australia's prosperity on fossil fuels. You have to be very careful in the debate about apportioning blame. It's not like it was done on purpose.\"\"It's about recognising and being thankful for that contribution, but acknowledging that we do need to evolve,\" she added. \"We're all going to get there in the end.\"With bushfires projected to get ever more deadly and the next season a little over six months away, the risk, Steggall says, is that politicians take so long to reach consensus \"it will be too late to do anything\". </p><p/>", "publisher": "Digital Journal", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 73, "title": "From Bowmanville to the Australian bushfires", "published": "2020-01-15", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">CLARINGTON - When Bowmanville-raised Ashley Chrysler moved to Australia, she never imagined she would be living 13 km from a bushfire or evacuating her workplace after thick smoke enveloped the 30-storey building.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Chrysler, 28, moved to Australia with her fiancee and their young son, Logan, in September 2018 to be closer to his friends and family. They live in an apartment near the beach in Cronulla, just south of Sydney and just north of the city's Royal National Park.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Australia has been struggling to contain the damage from several huge bushfires that have been raging across the country for months.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Via email, This Week asked Chrysler what it's like to be living amid the blaze.</p><p>Q: How close to the fires are you?</p><p>A: We are about 130 km from the current South Coast fires you probably see on the news. There is also a huge fire to our west, about 76 km away. There has been a fire closer to us, about 13 km away in Loftus, and we are at risk being so close to the Royal National Park. We're always monitoring the 'Fires Near Me' app to keep updated on our area.</p><p>We have been connected to the fires in many other ways though. We vacationed on the South Coast just before the fires started in Durras North. It was the most beautiful place brimming with wildlife. The forests were lush and dense and there were hundreds of kangaroos on our property, on the beaches and drives. We got lucky that we went earlier in the summer season.</p><p>We also have friends and family who have lost their homes. Everyone knows at least one person who has been directly impacted by the fires whether it be damage to their property or being displaced.</p><p>Q: What has it been like to live there through the bushfires?</p><p>A: It's been really awful and scary. We had been in the thick of the fires for weeks before it was even picked up by international media.</p><p>It impacts us every single day in some way or another.</p><p>Physically, I have been really affected by the smoke. I've started using my inhaler again for the first time in 10-odd years. I have woken up with swollen, puffy eyes from walking through smoke and ash and soot the whole day prior. My lungs physically hurt. I've started getting headaches multiple times a week, which I've never had before. I feel guilty knowing that my two-year-old son is breathing in the same toxic air and worried about the impact that might have on him.</p><p>Socially, we have to be really careful where we go and what we do. I play outdoor soccer but that has been cancelled multiple times now because the air quality is so poor. The one night they said that the air quality was so bad, that one hour of outdoor exercise was like smoking a whole pack of cigarettes. Schools and daycares have been cancelled because they don't want people leaving their homes in the smoky conditions. I know that a lot of days, my daycare has had indoor play only (kind of like when it gets too cold back home!)</p><p>Q: What has been the scariest/lowest moment for you?</p><p>A: The scariest point for me was a couple weeks back. I work in a 30-storey building right in the city centre and had a meeting up on the 25th floor. We watched a very thick smoke roll in to the point where you could no longer see a single other building in the city. Our building's emergency evacuation alarm went off seconds later with a piercing siren saying to evacuate quickly.</p><p>Something had happened in the stairwell where we were unable to actually get down. There was a lot of confusion and chaos; no one really knew what was happening. It turned out that the smoke was so severe that it had tripped a number of smoke alarms in high-rises across the city. The smoke was so bad on the first and second levels of our building that the employees there were told to go home because it had become a health hazard.</p><p>Q: Have there been any moments that gave you hope or touched your heart?</p><p>A: I've been especially proud and touched by the efforts of Canadians back home. Sending a large number of firefighters over to help control the bush fires, people giving up their Christmases to come help, and even the big knitting group that's popped up; creating pouches for the animals that survive. It's really incredible and inspiring the extent people are going to to help a country to which they have no actual connection. It makes me so proud to be Canadian, and I feel like I'm being supported by my country and its people even here on the other side of the world.</p><p>Q: What is your biggest fear and biggest hope for the year ahead there?</p><p>A: My biggest fear has already happened I guess, the degree of destruction and death that the fires have caused. I'm scared it will get even worse and travel up the coast to the major cities. I'm also afraid of fires starting closer to where we live; in the national parks near us. Bush fires are such a foreign concept to me. I feel like I wouldn't know the first thing about when to leave and what to do if they got closer.</p><p>My biggest hope has also kind of already happened. That the world will see the disaster the fires have caused and rally in support. Australians can't do it alone so my hope will be that every single person helps contribute in some way - whether it's a $5 donation or sending a hand-knitted pouch in the mail. Every single action helps, no matter how small.</p><p>I also hope for rain. (At the time of filing this story, Chrysler added their area was getting a downpour of rain.) For conditions to be favourable to stop them from spreading further. I hope that Australians will have a positive attitude coming out of the fire season and will be able to rebuild and recoup some of the many losses. I hope for no more deaths, be it animals or humans.</p><p>Q: Is there one thing you want to make sure our readers here know?</p><p>A: That their efforts aren't going unnoticed and that they are making a true difference here. Donating is the best thing that you can do, but creating pouches and shipping provisions et cetera just shows the degree of care and commitment Canadians have to helping.</p><p>I think the other thing is the breadth of impact the fires have here. The fires themselves and the destruction they've created so far is immense, but people living outside of the fire regions are still also impacted every day by extreme smoke, dangerous air quality and the ash and soot. Many live in more imminent fear that the fires will reach their towns or properties.</p><p>Sidebar:</p><p>Canadian Red Cross</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.redcross.ca\">www.redcross.ca</url></p><p>Donations will be used to fund Canadian Red Cross support of the Australian Red Cross response to the devastating wildfires.</p><p>The Salvation Army</p><p><url normalizedValue=\"http://www.salvationarmy.ca\">www.salvationarmy.ca</url></p><p>Help support the emergency disaster work of The Salvation Army and those impacted by the fires.</p>", "publisher": "Toronto Star - Metroland Newspapers", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 8, "title": "Catching up with Delta Goodrem, AM: Australian entertainer", "published": "2024-01-27", "bodyText": "<p>The views expressed in any and all content distributed by Newstex and its re-distributors (collectively, the \"Newstex Authoritative Content\") are solely those of the respective author(s) and not necessarily the views of Newstex or its re-distributors.

People\u2019s experiences with any disaster event are influenced by social- and place-based vulnerabilities. For example, where you live affects your exposure to different hazards including wildfires and floods. </p><p>Pre-existing social vulnerabilities contribute to some populations having disproportionate impacts from these events, in both the short and long term. Social vulnerability factors that have a demonstrated effect on people\u2019s experience with disasters include income, health, disability, age, race, and gender. These factors also intersect in ways that increase vulnerability for certain populations. </p><p>Evidence suggests gender-based violence increases during disasters and in the years that follow. Further, the risk for women and LGBTQI populations is heightened when sheltering in place or evacuation from a community is required. </p><p>Evidence of gender-based violence during and after disasters can be reflected in increased calls from women to police and domestic violence helplines. However, it is estimated that 78 per cent of cases of sexual assault in Canada are not reported for a variety of reasons. </p><p>It is important to recognize that social vulnerabilities are not inherent individual traits, rather vulnerability stems from historic inequities over time that impact access to resources and marginalize people. </p><p>Government preparedness for and responses to disasters must consider and address how social vulnerabilities increase disaster risk and adverse outcomes for some populations.</p><p>Gaps in emergency management planning</p><p>My research examines how social vulnerabilities, gender and gender-based violence are addressed in government plans for responding to disasters and pandemics. In my research, I found that federal, provincial, territorial and local government emergency management plans in Canada acknowledge how social vulnerabilities contribute to the differential impacts of hazard events for households and communities. </p><p>Importantly, the federal government recently published two reports examining how social vulnerability contributes to disaster risk: the National Risk Profile and the report on Social Vulnerability to Natural Hazards in Canada. </p><p>However, my research also found these reports and plans do not address how gender influences the direct and indirect impacts of disasters, including the increase in gender-based violence during and following disasters. </p><p>While federal, provincial and territorial governments have made commitments to addressing gender inequities and the use of gender-based analysis tools such as GBA+, I found limited reference or commitment to the use of these tools. </p><p>GBA+ tools examine how gender intersects with other identity factors, such as age, ethnicity and income to differentiate experiences of women, men and gender diverse populations. </p><p>Public Safety Canada\u2019s Departmental Plan references GBA+ when addressing emergency management. However, the plans address social vulnerability more generally and no commitments are made to address gender specifically.</p><p>The only identified government funded report addressing gender and disaster in the Canadian context was a 2008 report by the Public Health Agency of Canada.</p><p>The federal and some but not all provincial and territorial governments took actions during the pandemic to address the increase in gender-based violence. However, there has been no concerted effort by Canadian governments to address the gendered impacts of disasters more generally.</p><p>Gender-based violence and disasters</p><p>There is an established body of research on gender-based violence during Australian bushfires. Researchers found domestic violence occurred in households where a woman had previously experienced violence, as well as in households were there had been stable non-violent relationships. </p><p>Further, those experiencing violence noted an increase of the severity of the violence following the disasters. These same patterns were noted in the pandemic in Canada.</p><p>The Australian research also found women\u2019s unemployment or homelessness during a disaster was exploited by men who return under the guise of offering assistance. In other instances, men\u2019s behaviour during disaster was excused by counsellors or police because of the stresses brought on by a disaster. The dismissal of violence in the context of a disaster harms women.</p><p>Another concern is that supports like counselling centres, women\u2019s shelters and sexual assault centres can be disrupted during a disaster. In the recent evacuation of Yellowknife, all these services would likely have been impacted. Further, communication infrastructure is also impacted by disasters, which can limit the ability to call for help. </p><p>The Canadian Women\u2019s Foundation recently supported the development of guidance to help these organizations prepare for service disruptions in the event of a disaster.</p><p>A call to action</p><p>We have a moral and ethical imperative to address the inequitable effects of disasters within society.  </p><p>Recommendations on how to address the gendered impacts of disasters, including gender-based violence, include The Gender Handbook for Humanitarian Action, Guidelines for Integrating Gender-Based Violence Interventions in Humanitarian Action, the Red Cross Minimum Standard Commitments to Gender and Diversity in Emergency Programming and the UN\u2019s Minimum Standards for Prevention and Response to Gender-based Violence in Emergencies. </p><p>Australia has made significant investments in addressing the gendered impacts of disasters. Their process offers an example of what is needed in Canada to advance gender and disaster practice. </p><p>The mandate to address gender inequities in Canada is already in place, as are plans to address gender-based violence. There is an urgent imperative to bring the work addressing gender-based inequity and violence into emergency management practice. These efforts need to be led by all orders of government and integrated into their action plans for improving emergency management practices in Canada.</p><p>Experts on the gendered impacts of disasters must become part of the emergency response effort. In addition to integrating gender analysis in planning activities, rapid gender analysis needs to be conducted at the outset of a disaster and throughout the recovery period.</p><p>Further, emergency management organizations need to work closely with counselling centres, women\u2019s shelters and sexual assault services to ensure they have the capacity to respond to disasters. These organizations must be recognized as an essential service when disasters occur.</p><p>___</p><p>Research funding recieved from the Canadian Women's Foundation. ___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

The stratosphere is the second layer of the atmosphere, right above the troposphere -- where we live. </p><p>\"For us it was a huge surprise\" to see such a significant effect, study co-author Ilan Koren, a professor at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel, told AFP. \"I never saw such an injection (of smoke) to the stratosphere,\" he said.The amount of smoke released into the atmosphere by the fires is comparable to that put out by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in the Philippines in 1991, which was the second-largest of the 20th century. Researchers noted that the smoke drifted away from Australia to the east, and then returned again from the west two weeks later. \"We could see the smoke completing a whole circulation in two weeks,\" Koren said. \"I never saw such a strong event spread so fast.\"The phenomenon can be explained by three factors, according to the study. First, the fires themselves were intense. Second, they occurred in an area of far southern Australia where the distance between the troposphere and the stratosphere is smaller than elsewhere. And lastly, the fires took place near strong storms, which helped draw the smoke up higher into the atmosphere. The fact that the smoke was able to billow so high is crucial to understanding its environmental impact: Usually, such smoke might only stay in the lower part of the atmosphere for a few days or weeks.\"But once it gets to the stratosphere, it stays between months to years,\" Koren explained. The winds are stronger up there, allowing the smoke to be dispersed farther and faster than might otherwise be possible. \"Basically what we get is a very thin smoke blanket that covers the whole hemisphere for many months,\" Koren said. - 'Not clear yet' -Researchers could see the smoke in the stratosphere for six months, from January to July 2020, via satellite monitoring. Eventually, it became too difficult to separate the smoke from the Australian bushfires from smoke in the stratosphere that might have come from other sources. \"But most likely there is still today a signature of the smoke in the stratosphere,\" Koren said. The main effect of the smoke staying in the atmosphere for so long is that it can reflect radiation coming from the sun. According to Koren, that \"definitely has a cooling effect overall,\" especially on the ocean, potentially disrupting processes such as algae photosynthesis in the southern hemisphere. The smoke can also absorb solar radiation, which can have a localized warming effect. \"The consequences of the warming of the smoke in the stratosphere are not clear yet,\" Koren said. </p><p/>", "publisher": "Digital Journal", "instances": ["\"Basically what we get is a very thin smoke blanket that covers the whole hemisphere for many months,\" Koren said. - 'Not clear yet' -Researchers could see the smoke in the stratosphere for six months, from January to July 2020, via satellite monitoring. \"But most likely there is still today a signature of the smoke in the stratosphere,\" Koren said.

The necessary response requires a major change and quick action by all parties, including utility companies.Dr. Shuli Goodman[1], the Executive Director of LF Energy[2], a non-profit organization bringing the energy industry together to jointly develop technology solutions to climate change, discusses with Digital Journal the challenges the energy industry faces to supply the clean energy we need to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 and how using open source technologies[3] allows energy companies to share ideas and reduce costs to develop the green technology needed more quickly. Digital Journal: How are the Australian bushfires serving as a major wake-up call to governments, citizens and businesses worldwide? Dr. Shuli Goodman: The climate crisis will look different everywhere and affect some areas more profoundly. </p><p>It is challenging to have a perspective about the scale and scope of the problem that the climate crisis poses. Some people think that the consequences of climate change are decades away, but for others, such as those in Australia, the climate crisis has already begun.  We all need to pay attention to these bushfires and to take them as a clear warning sign for how the next decades could unfold. We are going to see mass-migrations and major catastrophic events all over the world, similar to the Australian bushfires. As JP Morgan recently said[4] in a private client letter, without cooperative action we are increasingly heading for civilization collapse. Governments and businesses need to work alongside utility companies to provide the support and incentives necessary if we want to stand a chance to achieve our 100% global decarbonization goals. DJ: How important is it to meet the 2050 climate goals? Goodman: It is extremely important to meet the 2050 climate goals, because the biggest challenge climate change poses is the threat of extinction. We've reached the limits of being able to ignore the threats to our society, and if we fail to act, the number of habitable places will drastically reduce. This will lead to unstable governments and economies, as well as starvation due to droughts. It will put hundreds of millions of people on the path of a mass migration, which will lead to utter chaos. That's what we have to consider when pushing to meet climate goals within the next 30 years. DJ: What challenges does the world face as the energy industry strives to supply the clean energy we need to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050? Goodman:The speed of innovation needed to achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 is a major challenge. There's a myth called the Gordian Knot that helps explain the situation we are facing. In the legend, Alexander the Great faced a knot that, if you pulled on one end, it would only get tighter and tighter.  The challenge was to ultimately unravel the knot, which Alexander the Great achieved by using his sword to slice it in half. Traditionally, the energy sector was stable, persistent and slow-moving. That was actually a value and a designed benefit of the system, giving companies plenty of time for new tech adoption and investments. Now, if you pull on anything, every problem only gets tighter and tighter due to the complexity and connectedness of our power grids and economies. We must figure out how we can cut this knot and accelerate innovation to provide digital access to the electrical infrastructure.  DJ: How can using open source technologies allow energy companies to share ideas to develop the green technology we need more quickly? Goodman:Instead of trying to solve problems on their own, energy and tech companies can utilize open source to collaborate and share tools. By sharing resources, open source lightens the burden posed by the need for increased innovation. At LF Energy, we are curating an entire stack that addresses functional requirements and capabilities at the transmission, distribution, generation and demand levels. We provide neutral governance, coupled with infrastructure and events and a training and capacity building platform, to ensure that utilities develop the skills to engage in collaborative innovation. DJ: Can this approach also help to reduce costs? Goodman:Open source reduces the financial costs of innovation and technological development. By some measures, 50% of the problem will be hardware - PV, batteries, wind turbines, hydro, and the other 50% will be digital. Advances in digitalization, like cloud and 5G point to the reality that monolithic systems are in the past. The future of digitalization are light-weight, microservices using an open technology stack that when composed together address the functional requirements of the new energy future.  If you look at other industries - telecommunication in particular- you can see how open source shifted the economics of the industry towards cheaper, yet increased the value to end-users, and sped innovation cycles from years and months to weeks, hours, and minutes. That is the power of open source and open innovation.

The recent ANZ Job Ads and ANZ-Roy Morgan Australian Consumer Confidence reports provided an early signal of an identifiable economic impact.</p><p>Previous major bushfire events had a negligible impact on national output, noting that the loss of property wasn't captured in the calculation of GDP, added ANZ. Only short-term negative impacts on tourism, retail and employment at the national and state/territory level were observed. However, this masked the severe impacts at local/regional levels.</p><p>While the current bushfires were unprecedented, there were material offsets to the negative impact from insurance payments and assistance from the Commonwealth and state governments, according to the bank. Commonwealth and state government funding committed so far was likely to rise further.</p><p>ANZ wrote in a note that it though the support for affected communities during and following these tragic events, along with wider economic benefits that could be gained, justified current and additional fiscal loosening, as required.</p><p>This left the bank thinking that the immediate impact on GDP over Q4 of 2019 and Q1 of 2020 will be negative, but most likely not beyond 0.1-0.2ppt per quarter at most. This was necessarily a best first guess and it will be refined as more information became available. This initial impact will be offset (to at least some extent) in later quarters, as rebuilding got underway.</p><p>National disasters were more appropriately an issue for fiscal, rather than monetary, policy, noted ANZ. Government spending measures can be targeted on the areas and people most acutely affected, whereas monetary policy was a tool with a much broader impact.</p><p>There might be a case for a monetary policy response if the fires triggered ongoing national effects, such as a sustained loss in consumer confidence, wrote the bank.

He is a great friend. I love how he uses his platform for good causes. He and I care a lot about the same things. Blake is amazing,\" Manning said. He spoke about being a part of Brad Everett Young's Dream Loud campaign[4]. \"Brad is such a talented photographer and he really creates an environment where you can have fun and express yourself in different ways. I love the fact that he uses props since it makes the photoshoot a different experience. I love my shoots with him before,\" he said. Ever since he was a little kid, he expressed his love for Superman as his favorite superhero character. \"I have Superman books and a little Superman statue. I just love him,\" he said. Manning underscored the importance of people getting out and voting this November, in an effort to make their voices heard. \"We are seeing the end of the pandemic, at least for now. I would encourage people to stay positive and try to pick back up with their lives as best as they can. In terms of the riots and everything going on with the Black Lives Matter movement, I would hope the media covers the peaceful protests and the positive parts about the movement. I feel there is so much good coming from these protests and this movement,\" he said. To learn more about actor Mike C. Manning[5], follow him on Instagram[6].

Industry reports suggest at least 500 cows, thousands of pigs and over a hundred thousand birds perished.</p><p>Extreme weather events like the flooding and wildfires in B.C., have occurred in agricultural regions in Australia, the United States and elsewhere, and are likely to become more frequent as the planet warms and the climate changes. Although B.C. farmers are eager to get back to production, the provincial and federal governments must consider that there is more than climate behind these disasters.

And during the 2019-20 Australian bushfires, amid the coverage for loss of wildlife, few media stories surfaced about the thousands of farm animals \u201cconfirmed dead, burned in the fires or euthanized due to their injuries.\u201d </p><p>In the U.S., catastrophic hurricanes and floods often grip coastal states and harm farm animals. In 2018, Hurricane Florence led to the deaths of 5,500 pigs and nearly eight million poultry in North Carolina. </p><p>The nexus between extreme weather events and animal agriculture is further made relevant because of the farm model. Globally, the majority of poultry, pigs and cows are raised in what are called \u201cconcentrated animal feeding operations\u201d (CAFOs). </p><p>CAFOs are industrialized operations of thousands to millions of genetically similar animals. These operations confine animals whose vulnerability to disasters varies depending on their species, age or sex \u2014 a sow confined to a gestation crate, for example. Adjacent to the barns are stockpiles of manure and burial pits. </p><p>My research with Elisabeth Stoddard, an associate professor at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, in Massachusetts, has investigated some of the impacts of climate change \u2014 worsening floods and hurricanes \u2014 on the animal agricultural sector in North Carolina. In our recent report, commissioned by World Animal Protection, our conversations with producers and other agricultural workers found that the disaster measures were not applicable to their operations. What they meant was, there are too many animals for disaster interventions to work. </p><p>Disaster management guidelines</p><p>Producers and agricultural workers can refer to disaster management guidelines, often sector-specific handbooks, to prepare for and respond to a range of disasters. B.C.\u2018s guidebooks offer disaster advice, but do not address the scale of farming, making them unhelpful to producers and useless in their efforts to avert animal deaths and injuries.</p><p>As governments, companies and individuals make plans to adapt to climate change, the welfare of farm animals must become a priority that goes beyond updating disaster management guidelines to encourage producers to create farm emergency plans and maps, or invest in insurance. </p><p>What can farmers do to protect animals?</p><p>For the most part, producers have three options during extreme weather events: leave the animals in place, relocate them to safety or move them to market. The last option remains the most difficult as producers operate on a just-in-time production system with slaughter scheduled according to the animal\u2019s market-ready date.</p><p>Sheltering in place remains the most used strategy based on logistical constraints. As for relocating animals, producers retain some resiliency. One chicken producer relocated 40,000 chickens, but had to leave as many birds in a barn when it flooded.</p><p>The B.C. beef handbook says \u201cunconfined animals can usually take care of themselves during a flood.\u201d Early accounts from the Sumas Prairie suggest that those animals that were outside, roaming freely, fared better than those securely confined in a building or barn. But many \u201cfree\u201d animals still succumbed to flood waters, such as calves that drowned when waters rose past a metre. </p><p>Build back better</p><p>As the province cleans up, it will need to access and identify farms that require euthanasia for animals with injuries or disease, and mass mortality. </p><p>These issues become even more urgent when considering that buried carcasses could contaminate groundwater, produce methane gas or spread pathogens. Despite these challenges, B.C.\u2019s Minister of Agriculture Lana Popham said carcasses may be disposed of in landfills or incinerated. </p><p>In the wake of the disaster, B.C. must figure out how it will \u201cbuild back better.\u201d Here are three things it could do to address climate justice, Indigenous reconciliation and animal welfare: </p><p> - Prioritize climate commitments within the province such as those outlined in the B.C. Food Security Task Force\u2019s 2020 report. One of the climate and food security strategies B.C. is pursing is to diversify plant-based production, such as cellular agriculture. This directive should receive real commitment and funding that matches its potential to mitigate the threat of climate, environmental and farm animal disasters. </p><p>- Consult and deliberate with Animal Justice following its demands to limit the number of animals on confinement farms and to make animal rescue plans a legal requirement for producers, making them legally binding instead of vague encouraged practices. </p><p>- Return unceded land to Indigenous nations. The Sumas Prairie was once a shallow freshwater lake, and is part of the unceded, traditional territory of the Sumas First Nation that, like the water and other beings, was forcibly displaced by colonial land planning, when the lake was drained and isolated from nearby rivers between 1920 and 1924. Unceded land should be returned to the Sumas First Nation to uphold the province\u2019s commitments to reconciliation. </p><p>Going forward</p><p>In Filling the Ark: Animal Welfare in Disasters, Leslie Irvine, a professor of sociology and director of the Animals and Society Certificate Program at the University of Colorado Boulder, writes:</p><p> \u201cThe solution to the 'problem\u2019 of disasters and CAFOs does not involve making the rescue of farm animals a policy priority. Nor does it involve making stronger waste lagoons or creating strict building codes for CAFOs. Rather, the solution lies in changing the practices of factory farming so that animals, and the humans who share their environment, are less vulnerable.\u201d</p><p>Animal agriculture and colonial land practices contribute to climate change and create vulnerabilities that undermine human, animal and planetary well-being. B.C. has an opportunity to reclaim the ethos of \u2018build back better\u2019 from business-as-usual mentalities and choose a future that promotes and acts on justice principles for all.</p><p>___</p><p>Stephanie Eccles currently receives funding the from Fonds de Recherche du Qu\u00e9bec - Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 et Culture (FRQSC).

This first Earth Day led to the creation of the United States Environmental Protection Agency and the passage of environmental protection laws, with other countries following soon after. In 2016, the United Nations chose Earth Day as the day to sign the Paris Climate Agreement into force. The theme for Earth Day changes every year, and this year's theme will come as no surprise: climate action.</p><p>It can be hard to asses how changes to our climate will affect our individual lives. On New Years Day I sat by the radio at my family's property in rural NSW, Australia, anxiously awaiting updates on the status of the fires that surrounded us. At the time we had no power, no running water, no cell reception, and no road access out. The next day the fire would destroy the radio tower broadcasting these emergency updates to our region. Our retired firefighter neighbour gave us the advice to flee to the beach if the dark smoke,which glowed orange, transitioned to red. We were lucky, the winds changed direction and five weeks later the fires would be brought to an end by sweeping rain and floods, our community could be seen from space as a little region of green surrounded by black. Australia is now taking stock on the long road to recovery.</p><p>Attribution science quantifies the extent to which manmade climate change makes weather events more severe or likely to occur. A study published in the journal Nature has found that this fire season in Australia was made at least 30 per cent more likely by climate change. While a degree of wildfire activity is natural in both Canada and Australia, I hope that we never have to experience this same scale of devastation to our community in Fernie as I did at home this Christmas.</p><p>This Earth Day we will find ourselves in the midst of a global pandemic. This is a hard time for our local community. Many businesses have had to close, and everyone is working out how to be physically distant and stay home in a town built upon a love of the outdoors. I am touched by the ways in which our community has come together. Over 160 people have volunteered to join the Elk Valley Covid Support Team, delivering groceries and phoning to check in on those in isolation. Hand sanitizer has been donated to first responders as well as to the public, food parcels are being donated to those in need, free rooms are being offered to essential service workers, and local bands are hosting online concerts. This is far from over, but I am proud of how our little community has responded in the past month.</p><p>What these events have shown us is that we are capable of mobilizing and responding to significant threats to environmental, and human health and safety. Our actions have resulted in remarkable achievements. Over $500 million was donated in response to the Australian bushfires, vehicle companies are now making ventilators instead of cars, and scientists are sharing information in an unprecedented manner in the search to find a vaccine. This Earth Day we won't be rallying in the streets, but instead I encourage you to use your time at home to join the Citizens Climate Lobby, and write emails or letters to government representatives at all levels. Ask that bail outs for companies come with the requirement to invest in pollution reduction initiatives, ask that your district and council representatives join the climate caucus to develop and implement solutions at a local level. The pandemic has shown us that we should have done more to prepare in advance, and the same is true for climate change. As the head of the World Health Organization Climate Change Unit, Diarmid Campbell-Lendrum stated, \"If COVID-19 is a sprint to save lives, then acting on climate change is the marathon.\"</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:editor@thefreepress.ca\">editor@thefreepress.ca</email> Like us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p>", "publisher": "The Free Press (Fernie)", "instances": ["What these events have shown us is that we are capable of mobilizing and responding to significant threats to environmental, and human health and safety.

It's a 2012 photo from Indonesia. Young girl rescues koala? Actually an artist's impression. Social media is packed with powerful images of Australia's bushfires -- but many are fake. </p><p>As deadly blazes tear across southeastern Australia, false or deliberately misleading images and claims have proliferated online, in languages from Arabic to Hindi. AFP Fact Check works to debunk online misinformation. Here is a selection of recent fact checks on the deadly blazes: 1. Tiger tiger, burning brightA graphic photo that appears to show a tiger being devoured by flames has been shared tens of thousands of times in Facebook posts decrying the deaths of millions of animals in deadly Australian bushfires. Some estimates do indeed put the death toll from the blazes at nearly half a billion animals. But the image is actually a 2012 photograph of a taxidermied tiger that was burned by Indonesian authorities during a crackdown on wildlife smuggling.2. Young girl saves koala?An image of a young girl in a gas mask clutching a koala in front of a giant wall of flames and smoke has been shared tens of thousands of times in Instagram and Facebook posts that claim it is a real photograph. But the image was actually created by artist Thuie. \"My work was intended to represent what we are going through right now, the fires, the people affected by these fires and the masks that those who live in endangered areas must wear, and the fact that animals are as affected as humans,\" the artist told AFP. The image was created primarily from a photo of her daughter standing in water, she added.3. 'Roo rescue?Two viral videos showing women cuddling a kangaroo have been viewed tens of thousands of times in social media posts that claim they show the aftermath of a bushfire animal rescue. \"The kangaroo is so grateful that (it) just can't stop hugging the person who saved its life!\" the posts claim. But the claim is false: the videos were actually filmed at a kangaroo sanctuary located in Australia's Northern Territory, which has not been affected by bushfires. The sanctuary, which has more than one million followers on Instagram and regularly posts pictures and videos of their rescue animals, told AFP that both videos show Abigail, a kangaroo who has lived at the sanctuary since being rescued as a joey in 2006. \"We don't have fires here thankfully,\" the sanctuary told AFP in an email on January 7, 2020.4. Fresh rainfall brings firefighters joy?A video of Australian firefighters celebrating in the rain was viewed millions of times online after being tweeted by British newspaper The Sun on January 6, 2020. The footage has been shared on Facebook in multiple languages including Spanish and Sinhala, with many users claiming it was shot in January 2020 and shows new rain bringing relief to weary Australian firefighters. But the video is being shared in a misleading context: it was actually filmed in November 2019, according to the fire brigade who originally posted the footage on Facebook. 5. Family flees fires -- in 2013A dramatic photo of a woman and five children half-immersed in water next to a jetty under a bright orange, smoke-filled sky has been shared repeatedly on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, in posts which claim \"this is happening in Australia right now\".

Any purchases made under the Bid would, among other factors, reflect RNC's belief that its common shares trade at a significant discount to their underlying value.</p><p>Paul Andre Huet, Chairman &amp;CEO, commented: \"I am very pleased with our strong first quarter operating performance, which is reflected in the solid financial results reported today. Despite challenges associated with the Australian bushfires, the subsequent heavy rainfall and the current COVID-19 situation, RNC reported a strong start to 2020, with first quarter gold production totaling 24,816 oz. Not only did we deliver strong production, but we also continued our downward trend in AISC, in line with our US$1,000 per ounce target by the end of 2020. AISC of US$1,101 per ounce sold during the quarter was a US$30 per ounce improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019.</p><p>The continued improvements made in our AISC performance were achieved despite increased costs associated with the bushfires and inclement weather as well as the double-shifting of mining operations in excess of milling rates in order to continue to build stockpiles from Beta Hunt and Higginsville ahead of the mill. This is a remarkable achievement by our Australian operations and something I am personally very proud of.</p><p>While we currently do not anticipate any material impact on RNC's operations, including with respect to suppliers, service providers and employees due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, management continues to monitor developments in order to be in a position to take appropriate actions as needed. Management has elected to increase ROM stockpile levels, which now total 106,000 tonnes, should disruptions to the mine site or supply chain occur in the future. This strategy proved prudent ahead of the Australian bushfires, which affected both Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.</p><p>As a result of the proactive approach we've taken to manage these challenges over the last two quarters, we remain on track to achieve our 2020 gold production guidance of 90,000-95,000 ounces and AISC1 of US$1,050-$1,200 per ounce sold, assuming no significant interruption in operations as a result of the COVID-19 virus.</p><p>During the quarter, our operations continued to generate strong cash flow despite the significant logistical challenges. With a cash balance of $38.4 million, net of delivery of $5.3 million into our hedges, RNC is currently in the strongest financial position in its history and we look forward to continuing to deliver for our stakeholders this year.\"</p><p>COVID-19 Preparedness</p><p>Further to RNC's news release dated March 18, 2020, the Corporation has continued to maintain strict control measures at its operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Procedures are in place to ensure operating sites remain as prepared and responsive to the situation as possible. RNC has been actively monitoring the advice of local health authorities and has mandated that site personnel take precautions when traveling to and from site, along with isolation periods should anyone exhibit symptoms consistent with COVID-19. RNC's full-time nurse and supporting medical staff are monitoring the status of individuals entering and leaving site and the operations have been sealed off from any outside visitors not critical to business operations.</p><p>RNC will continue to adapt to this fluid situation, with its top priority being the health and safety of its employees and stakeholders.</p><p>Results of Operations</p><p>Table 1 - Highlights of operational results for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019 //st</p><p>For the three months ended March 31, 2020 2019</p><p>Gold Operations (Consolidated)</p><p>Tonnes milled (000s) 314 50</p><p>Recoveries 93% 92%</p><p>Gold milled, grade (g/t Au) 2.35 3.20</p><p>Gold produced (ounces) 24,816 4,778</p><p>Gold sold (ounces) 24,626 6,375</p><p>Average realized price (US $/oz sold) $1,493 $1,211</p><p>Cash operating costs (US $/oz sold)1 $965 $898</p><p>All-in sustaining cost (AISC) (US $/oz sold)1 $1,101 $1,030</p><p>Gold (Beta Hunt Mine)1</p><p>Tonnes milled (000s) 186 50</p><p>Gold milled, grade (g/t Au) 2.58 3.20</p><p>Gold produced (ounces)1 17,170 4,778</p><p>Gold sold (ounces) 17,078 6,375</p><p>Cash operating cost (US $/oz sold)1 $944 $898</p><p>Gold (HGO Mine)</p><p>Tonnes milled (000s) 128 -</p><p>Gold milled grade (g/t Au) 2.00 -</p><p>Gold produced (ounces) 7,646 -</p><p>Gold sold (ounces) 7,548 -</p><p>Cash operating cost (US $/oz sold)1 $1,013 - //st 1.

Mill availability remained in a stable range, averaging over 95% consistent with the prior quarter. Production during the first quarter of 2020 consisted of material from Beta Hunt underground, Baloo open pit, Fairplay North open pit and a small amount of stockpile material. The first quarter milled grade of 2.35 g/t was lower than the grade of 2.60 g/t in the prior quarter partially due to the processing of lower grade stockpile material to offset the impact of regional road closures during the Australian bushfires and subsequent flooding from heavy rainfalls.</p><p>Cash operating costs1 and AISC1 were US$965 and US$1,101 per ounce sold respectively on a consolidated basis for the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>Following the strong start to the year, RNC is maintaining its consolidated production and cost guidance for its Australian operations (Beta Hunt and HGO) of 90,000 to 95,000 ounces of gold at an average AISC1 of US$1,050 to US$1,200 per ounce sold. RNC continues to target AISC1 costs of approximately US$1,000 per ounce sold by the end of 2020. //st 1.

In addition to ongoing exploration at Baloo, where mining has been underway since the HGO acquisition last June, and Fairplay North where mining began in December 2019, a number of projects covered under the re-negotiated Morgan Stanley royalty are now considered high priority. These areas include Aquarius, Hidden Secret, Mousehollow, Pioneer, the Two Boys extension and the paleochannel deposits.</p><p>Figure 1: Plan view of active HGO mines and exploration projects</p><p>Please see previous announcements for drilling results and details accompanying the following brief summary of first quarter project developments.</p><p>On January 23, 2020, RNC announced that Baloo Stage 1 mining has been extended to June 2020. Stage 2 approvals were subsequently announced on January 29, 2020, which is expected to extend the open pit mine life through to January 2021. Development and mining of the Fairplay North open pit continued with Stage 1 expected to extend through July 2020, followed by Stage 2 through late 2020.</p><p>With respect to drilling, RNC announced that 20 resource definition holes totalling 492 metres and 19 exploration holes totalling 1,897 metres at Baloo had been completed since the acquisition of HGO. Drilling focused on the Eastern Footwall and down-dip plunge extensions of Baloo mineralization with the aim up increasing and upgrading the existing resource base.</p><p>Also on January 23, 2020, the Corporation announced it had completed 26 resource definition RC holes totalling 1,721 metres at Fairplay North. Drilling focused on upgrading the existing historical resource within and on the margins of an optimised pit shell. Assay results confirmed the extension of near surface supergene mineralization.</p><p>On January 29, 2020, RNC announced that a high-density gravity survey had identified a newly interpreted structure extending over 5 km in length and 5 km north of the previously mined high grade underground Trident gold deposit. Trident was mined by the previous owners, Alacer Gold, producing over 1 million ounces. The new structure is considered to have high potential for mineralization and will be part of HGO's 2020 exploration program.</p><p>On February 27, 2020, RNC announced the initial results from the 2020 exploration drilling program. Drilling at the Hidden Secret and Mousehollow projects returned strong results, driving the expansion of proposed open pit dimensions at both projects. Additionally, the ongoing review of the extensive historical database at Higginsville continued to return significant targets for future exploration including the high grade Aquarius Project located just 2.5 km south of the HGO plant.</p><p>Beta Hunt Mine</p><p>During the first quarter of 2020, 186,000 tonnes of Beta Hunt ore was milled at a grade of 2.58 g/t for production of 17,170 ounces of gold.</p><p>Beta Hunt production is mainly focused on the Western Flanks and A Zone mining areas. A number of stoping areas are being developed within the Western Flanks that will access some of the wider Beta Hunt stoping blocks (up to 20 metres wide). Mining rates at Beta Hunt are currently 50,000-55,000 tonnes per month (up from 40,000-50,000 tonnes per month in 2019). This rate is expected to continue as part of the Beta Hunt expansion plan.</p><p>Financial Highlights</p><p>Table 2 - Highlights of First Quarter Financial Results (in thousands of dollars except per share amounts) //st For the three months ended March 31, 2020 2019 Revenue $54,282 $10,863 Production and processing costs 27,286 6,498 Earnings (loss) before income taxes 884 (1,577) Net earnings (loss) 539 (1,577) Basic and diluted loss per share 0.00 (0.00) Adjusted EBITDA1,2 13,581 (166) Adjusted EBITDA per share1,2 0.02 (0.00) Adjusted earnings1 12,600 (373) Adjusted earnings per share1 0.02 (0.00) Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities 11,476 (3,759) Cash investment in property, plant and equipment and (7,702) (7,743) mineral property interests //st 1.

Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this news release and RNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>Cautionary Statement Regarding the Higginsville Mining Operations A production decision at the Higginsville gold operations was made by previous operators of the mine, prior to the completion of the acquisition of the Higginsville gold operations by RNC and RNC made a decision to continue production subsequent to the acquisition. This decision by RNC to continue production and, to the knowledge of RNC, the prior production decision were not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result, there may be an increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, which include increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that anticipated production costs will be achieved. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and future profitability. Readers are cautioned that there is increased uncertainty and higher risk of economic and technical failure associated with such production decisions.

Coulson operates from Port Alberni, in Australia and in the United States.</p><p>\"It was a very scary time,\" he said. \"We put every precaution in place that we could.\" That meant increased cleaning staff, split shifts to lessen the number of people in at any one time, and even physically moving desks around. \"Now our biggest challenge is moving people around. Travel is still down 90 percent so there are a lot fewer flights&amp;#x26;#8230;we have to crew change people every two weeks.\"</p><p>Different countries have different COVID-19 protocols in place too, Coulson Aviation general manager Matt Ralph said. Australia, for example, has a mandatory 14-day quarantine, paperwork varies from country to country and so do cleaning protocols.</p><p>Moving commercial freight has been challenging as well, since cargo flights have also been cut in half. Meantime, prices are going up.</p><p>\"It all adds time and cost,\" Coulson said.</p><p>Port Alberni is the hub for Coulson Aviation, with the conversion programs taking place at the hangar at Alberni Valley Regional Airport and administration at the Coulson headquarters in the Chances RimRock building.Expansion in Port Alberni</p><p>Coulson cleared land a year and a half ago near their hangar and are hoping to expand. \"We're looking at putting up a large manufacturing facility to support our USAF contract. We're looking at putting that up in the next few months.\"</p><p>The Coulsons purchased five C-130 from Norway that are due for expansion. One has been sent to a facility in Florida to start because the Port Alberni facility is too busy, Coulson said.</p><p>If all goes well, Coulson estimates they will grow 30 to 40 percent over the next couple of years. That would translate into more jobs for Port Alberni.Coulson heads to Indonesia</p><p>In early May, Coulson Aviation was awarded a 150-day contract with the Indonesian National Board for Disaster Management (BNPB) for the 2020 fire season. This is Coulson's first aerial firefighting contract in Asia Pacific.</p><p>One of Coulson's S-61 helicopters departed from their hangar in Bankstown, New South Wales, Australia, to support Indonesia.</p><p>\"We are really excited to be expanding into the Asia Pacific markets with our fleet,\" said Foster Coulson, co-president of Coulson Group. \"This market has been a longtime focus for our company and we are committed to growing our presence in Indonesia and the surrounding countries in the years to come.\"</p><p>Coulson Aviation was first introduced to the BNPB in 2015, when one of its next-generation large airtankers (Tanker 132) was used for firefighting. \"Having one of our C-130s fight fire in Borneo and Sumatra afforded us a great opportunity to get to meet BNPB,\" Britt Coulson said.Chinooks earn first contract</p><p>The Coulson-Unical CU-47 Chinook next-generation heli-tanker that was converted at the Alberni Valley Regional Airport in early March will start work on its first contract on June 15. One of them will be based in Laramie, Wyoming and another south of Lake Tahoe on the California side. A third is operating in San Bernardino, Calif.</p><p>The twin-rotor helicopter is a preferred aerial firefighting rotary machine because of its speed, size and payload.Martin Mars waterbombers update</p><p>While Coulson Aviation concentrates on its land-based rotary and fixed wing air force, the Martin Mars waterbombers remain landlocked at Coulson's tanker base at Sproat Lake west of Port Alberni. Coulson said interest in the waterbombers remains high, even though they have not been in the water for almost four years.</p><p>\"We're being very selective where the Philippine Mars is going to go,\" he said. \"We want to ensure the history is preserved.\"</p><p>The Philippine Mars has been repainted in its original US Navy colours; a deal had been tentatively struck in 2016 to send the aircraft to a Florida naval museum, but it fell through.</p><p>Wayne Coulson still has plans to bring the Hawaii Mars back to flying condition and offer flight tours, Britt Coulson said. The company wants to redesign the interior so it will include some seating, and has a crew of 14 working on conversion plans.</p><p>\"They're likely never going to continue as an air tanker again, but there is another life for them.\"</p><p>For more news from the Island and beyond delivered directly to your email inbox, click here.</p><p><email normalizedValue=\"mailto:susie.quinn@albernivalleynews.comLike\">susie.quinn@albernivalleynews.comLike</email> us on Facebook and follow us on Twitter</p><p>Want to support local journalism during the pandemic?

RNC Minerals (\"RNC\" or the \"Corporation\") (TSX:RNX) is pleased to announce its financial results and review of activities for the three months ended March 31, 2020. All amounts are expressed in Canadian dollars, unless otherwise noted. For additional information please refer to RNC's Management's Discussion &amp; Analysis (\"MD&amp;A\") and unaudited condensed interim consolidated financial statements for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2019. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Highlights</p><p> First quarter 2020 consolidated gold production of 24,816 ounces   2020 gold production guidance of 90,000 to 95,000 ounces is maintained (assuming no significant interruption in operations as a result of the COVID-19 virus). Proactive response to COVID-19: RNC has continued its proactive response to monitor the COVID-19 situation at its operations and implemented procedures that prioritize the health and safety of its employees and stakeholders. First quarter 2020 consolidated all-in-sustaining-costs (\"AISC\")1 of US$1,101 per ounce sold was inline with the 2020 guided range of US$1,050-$1,200 per ounce sold. RNC is targeting AISC costs of approximately USD $1,000 per ounce sold by the end of 2020. Adjusted earnings1 of $12.6 million, or $0.02 per share for the first quarter of 2020, down $1.1 million from $13.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to fewer ounces sold. Adjusted EBITDA1 was $13.6 million or $0.02 per share for the first quarter of 2020, down $0.8 million from $14.4 million in the fourth quarter of 2019, primarily due to fewer ounces sold. Strengthened Cash Position and Balance Sheet: RNC ended the first quarter of 2020 with a strong cash position of $38.4 million, and working capital of $30.7 million, improvements of $3.8 million and $4.2 million, respectively, from December 31, 2019. The first quarter cash balance is net of payments into gold hedge agreements totalling $5.3 million. Growing HGO Open Pit Pipeline: Recent drilling suggests the potential for mine life extensions of both the Baloo and Fairplay North open pits. Continued HGO Exploration Success following renegotiation of Morgan Stanley Royalty: Recent drilling combined with a review of the historical exploration database continues to identify a number of areas at HGO for further exploration, including: The high grade Aquarius Project (\"Aquarius\", formerly Corona Project). A newly interpreted 5km structure north of historic Trident Mine (which produced ~1 million ounces). Potential open pit expansions to both the Mousehollow and Hidden Secret projects, as previously announced on January 23, January 29 and February 27, 2020.Normal Course Issuer Bid Announced: On April 15, 2020 RNC announced that it had received the approval of the Toronto Stock Exchange (the \"TSX\") for a normal course issuer bid to purchase up to 30,415,198 of its issued and outstanding common shares (the \"Bid\"). Any purchases made under the Bid would, among other factors, reflect RNC's belief that its common shares trade at a significant discount to their underlying value.</p><p>Paul Andre Huet, Chairman &amp; CEO, commented: \"I am very pleased with our strong first quarter operating performance, which is reflected in the solid financial results reported today. Despite challenges associated with the Australian bushfires, the subsequent heavy rainfall and the current COVID-19 situation, RNC reported a strong start to 2020, with first quarter gold production totaling 24,816 oz. Not only did we deliver strong production, but we also continued our downward trend in AISC, in line with our US$1,000 per ounce target by the end of 2020. AISC of US$1,101 per ounce sold during the quarter was a US$30 per ounce improvement over the fourth quarter of 2019. </p><p>The continued improvements made in our AISC performance were achieved despite increased costs associated with the bushfires and inclement weather as well as the double-shifting of mining operations in excess of milling rates in order to continue to build stockpiles from Beta Hunt and Higginsville ahead of the mill. This is a remarkable achievement by our Australian operations and something I am personally very proud of. </p><p>While we currently do not anticipate any material impact on RNC's operations, including with respect to suppliers, service providers and employees due to the ongoing global COVID-19 pandemic, management continues to monitor developments in order to be in a position to take appropriate actions as needed. Management has elected to increase ROM stockpile levels, which now total 106,000 tonnes, should disruptions to the mine site or supply chain occur in the future. This strategy proved prudent ahead of the Australian bushfires, which affected both Q4 2019 and Q1 2020.</p><p>As a result of the proactive approach we've taken to manage these challenges over the last two quarters, we remain on track to achieve our 2020 gold production guidance of 90,000-95,000 ounces and AISC1 of US$1,050-$1,200 per ounce sold, assuming no significant interruption in operations as a result of the COVID-19 virus. </p><p>During the quarter, our operations continued to generate strong cash flow despite the significant logistical challenges. With a cash balance of $38.4 million, net of delivery of $5.3 million into our hedges, RNC is currently in the strongest financial position in its history and we look forward to continuing to deliver for our stakeholders this year.\" </p><p>COVID-19 Preparedness</p><p>Further to RNC's news release dated March 18, 2020, the Corporation has continued to maintain strict control measures at its operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Procedures are in place to ensure operating sites remain as prepared and responsive to the situation as possible.\u00a0 RNC has been actively monitoring the advice of local health authorities and has mandated that site personnel take precautions when traveling to and from site, along with isolation periods should anyone exhibit symptoms consistent with COVID-19. RNC's full-time nurse and supporting medical staff are monitoring the status of individuals entering and leaving site and the operations have been sealed off from any outside visitors not critical to business operations.</p><p>RNC will continue to adapt to this fluid situation, with its top priority being the health and safety of its employees and stakeholders.</p><p>Results of Operations</p><p>Table 1 - Highlights of operational results for the periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"480\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"72\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\"/><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the three months ended March 31,</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2020</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold Operations (Consolidated)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tonnes milled (000s)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">314</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">50</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Recoveries</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">93%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">92%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold milled, grade (g/t Au)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.35</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.20</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold produced (ounces)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24,816</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4,778</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold sold (ounces)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">24,626</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6,375</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Average realized price (US $/oz sold)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$1,493</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">$1,211</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash operating costs (US $/oz sold)1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$965</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">$898</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">All-in sustaining cost (AISC) (US $/oz sold)1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$1,101</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">$1,030</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold (Beta Hunt Mine)1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tonnes milled (000s)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">186</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">50</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold milled, grade (g/t Au)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.58</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3.20</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold produced (ounces)1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">17,170</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4,778</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold sold (ounces)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">17,078</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6,375</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash operating cost (US $/oz sold)1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$944</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">$898</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold (HGO Mine)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\"/><entry colname=\"col3\"/></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Tonnes milled (000s)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">128</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold milled grade (g/t Au)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold produced (ounces)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7,646</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gold sold (ounces)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">7,548</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash operating cost (US $/oz sold)1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$1,013</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">-</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"608\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Non-IFRS: the definition and reconciliation of these measures are included in the Non-IFRS Measures section 14 of RNC's MD&amp;A dated May 6, 2020</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\u00a0</p><p>On a consolidated basis, 314,000 tonnes were milled in the first quarter of 2020 at an average gold grade of 2.35 g/t, to produce a total of 24,816 ounces of gold.

Production during the first quarter of 2020 consisted of material from Beta Hunt underground, Baloo open pit, Fairplay North open pit and a small amount of stockpile material. \u00a0The first quarter milled grade of 2.35 g/t was lower than the grade of 2.60 g/t in the prior quarter partially due to the processing of lower grade stockpile material to offset the impact of regional road closures during the Australian bushfires and subsequent flooding from heavy rainfalls.</p><p>Cash operating costs1\u00a0and AISC1\u00a0were US$965 and US$1,101 per ounce sold respectively on a consolidated basis for the first quarter of 2020.</p><p>Following the strong start to the year, RNC is maintaining its consolidated production and cost guidance for its Australian operations (Beta Hunt and HGO) of 90,000 to 95,000 ounces of gold at an average AISC1 of\u00a0US$1,050\u00a0to\u00a0US$1,200\u00a0per\u00a0ounce sold.\u00a0RNC\u00a0continues\u00a0to\u00a0target\u00a0AISC1\u00a0costs\u00a0of\u00a0approximately\u00a0US$1,000\u00a0per\u00a0ounce sold\u00a0by\u00a0the end of\u00a02020.</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_3\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"608\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Reference\u00a0is\u00a0made\u00a0to\u00a0the\u00a0Non-IFRS\u00a0Measure\u00a0section\u00a014\u00a0of\u00a0RNC's\u00a0MD&amp;A dated May 6, 2020.\u00a0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\u00a0</p><p>A Growing HGO Project Pipeline and Exploration</p><p>Figure 1 below shows a number of areas where RNC is either actively advancing or evaluating as high-priority exploration targets at Higginsville. In addition to ongoing exploration at Baloo, where mining has been underway since the HGO acquisition last June, and Fairplay North where mining began in December 2019, a number of projects covered under the re-negotiated Morgan Stanley royalty are now considered high priority. These areas include Aquarius, Hidden Secret, Mousehollow, Pioneer, the Two Boys extension and the paleochannel deposits.</p><p>Figure 1: Plan view of active HGO mines and exploration projects</p><p>Please see previous announcements for drilling results and details accompanying the following brief summary of first quarter project developments. \u00a0</p><p>On January 23, 2020, RNC announced that Baloo Stage 1 mining has been extended to June 2020. Stage 2 approvals were subsequently announced on January 29, 2020, which is expected to extend the open pit mine life through to January 2021. Development and mining of the Fairplay North open pit continued with Stage 1 expected to extend through July 2020, followed by Stage 2 through late 2020.</p><p>With respect to drilling, RNC announced that 20 resource definition holes totalling 492 metres and\u00a019 exploration holes totalling 1,897 metres at Baloo had been completed since the acquisition of HGO. Drilling focused on the Eastern Footwall and down-dip plunge extensions of Baloo mineralization with the aim up increasing and upgrading the existing resource base. </p><p>Also on January 23, 2020, the Corporation announced it had completed 26 resource definition RC holes totalling 1,721 metres at Fairplay North. Drilling focused on upgrading the existing historical resource within and on the margins of an optimised pit shell. Assay results confirmed the extension of near surface supergene mineralization.</p><p>On January 29, 2020, RNC announced that a high-density gravity survey had identified a newly interpreted structure extending over 5 km in length and 5 km north of the previously mined high grade underground Trident gold deposit. Trident was mined by the previous owners, Alacer Gold, producing over 1 million ounces. The new structure is considered to have high potential for mineralization and will be part of HGO's 2020 exploration program.</p><p>On February 27, 2020, RNC announced the initial results from the 2020 exploration drilling program. Drilling at the Hidden Secret and Mousehollow projects returned strong results, driving the expansion of proposed open pit dimensions at both projects. Additionally, the ongoing review of the extensive historical database at Higginsville continued to return significant targets for future exploration including the high grade Aquarius Project located just 2.5 km south of the HGO plant.</p><p>Beta Hunt Mine</p><p>During the first quarter of 2020, 186,000 tonnes of Beta Hunt ore was milled at a grade of 2.58 g/t for production of 17,170 ounces of gold.</p><p>Beta Hunt production is mainly focused on the Western Flanks and A Zone mining areas. A number of stoping areas are being developed within the Western Flanks that will access some of the wider Beta Hunt stoping blocks (up to 20 metres wide). Mining rates at Beta Hunt are currently 50,000-55,000 tonnes per month (up from 40,000-50,000 tonnes per month in 2019). This rate is expected to continue as part of the Beta Hunt expansion plan.</p><p>Financial Highlights</p><p>Table 2 - Highlights of First Quarter Financial Results\u00a0(in thousands of dollars except per share amounts)</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"504\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"56\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the three months ended March 31,</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2020</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2019</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$54,282</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">$10,863</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Production and processing costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">27,286</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">6,498</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Earnings (loss) before income taxes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">884</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(1,577)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net earnings (loss)</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">539</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(1,577)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Basic and diluted loss per share</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.00</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(0.00)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted EBITDA1,2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">13,581</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(166)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted EBITDA per share1,2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.02</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(0.00)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted earnings1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">12,600</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(373)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted earnings per share1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.02</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(0.00)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">11,476</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(3,759)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash investment in property, plant and equipment and mineral property interests</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(7,702)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(7,743)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"608\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Non-IFRS: the definition and reconciliation of these measures are included in the Non-IFRS Measures section of RNC's MD&amp;A dated May 7, 2020.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\").</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\u00a0</p><p>Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted Earnings of $13.6 million and $12.6 million were up from $(0.2) million and $(0.4) million in 2019.

The Higginsville treatment facility is a low-cost 1.4 Mtpa processing plant which is fed at capacity from RNC's underground Beta Hunt mine and open pit Higginsville mine. At Beta Hunt, a robust gold mineral resource and reserve is hosted in multiple gold shears, with gold intersections along a 4 km strike length remaining open in multiple directions. HGO is a highly prospective land package totaling approximately 1,800 square kilometers. In addition, RNC has a 28% interest in a nickel joint venture that owns the Dumont Nickel-Cobalt Project located in the Abitibi region of Quebec. Dumont contains the second largest nickel reserve and ninth largest cobalt reserve in the world. RNC has a strong Board and management team focused on delivering shareholder value. RNC's common shares trade on the TSX under the symbol RNX. RNC shares also trade on the OTCQX market under the symbol RNKLF.</p><p>Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Statements</p><p>This news release contains \"forward-looking information\" including without limitation statements relating to the liquidity and capital resources of RNC, production and AISC guidance for 2020 and the potential of the Beta Hunt Mine, Higginsville Gold Operation and Dumont Nickel Project.</p><p>Forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties and other factors which may cause the actual results, performance or achievements of RNC to be materially different from any future results, performance or achievements expressed or implied by the forward-looking statements. Factors that could affect the outcome include, among others: future prices and the supply of metals; the results of drilling; inability to raise the money necessary to incur the expenditures required to retain and advance the properties; environmental liabilities (known and unknown); general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; results of exploration programs; accidents, labour disputes, labour and operational disruptions due to the COVID-19 outbreak and other risks of the mining industry; political instability, terrorism, insurrection or war; or delays in obtaining governmental approvals, projected cash operating costs, failure to obtain regulatory or shareholder approvals.

This decision by RNC to continue production and, to the knowledge of RNC, the prior production decision were not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result, there may be an increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, which include increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that anticipated production costs will be achieved. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and future profitability. Readers are cautioned that there is increased uncertainty and higher risk of economic and technical failure associated with such production decisions.</p><p>SOURCE  RNC Minerals</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2020/07/c2089.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2020/07/c2089.html</url></p>", "publisher": "Canada NewsWire", "instances": ["Any purchases made under the Bid would, among other factors, reflect RNC's belief that its common shares trade at a significant discount to their underlying value.

But many people see Australia as the \"poster child\" for the climate crisis.To put it in perspective, the area burned so far is almost the size of England, which is 13 million hectares. And if you think the 2018 California fires were huge, coming in at 800,000 hectares (1.978 million acres), guess again. The bottom line is this: Scientists say that many of those forests won't recover in today's warmer climate.  They are not just talking about Australia. </p><p>They include parts of the American west, the Mediterranean Basin and even the Amazon Rainforest region in South America. Some of these post-fire landscapes will shift to brush or grasslands.   And after losing close to one billion animals, birds and reptiles in the fires, those remaining will have drastically changed habitats. Water and food sources will be different or even absent for some species, and carbon emissions will rise because there are fewer trees to absorb CO2 out of the air and store it.Further Reading: The human 'fingerprint' is now detectable in everyday weather[1]Australia's fire historyEmeritus Professor Stephen J Pyne of Arizona State University is an expert on the history of fire as well as a former firefighter in the U.S. and has written a book about Australia called Burning Bush: A Fire History of Australia.[2] He notes that most of Australia's great or notable fires are usually designated by the day they occurred, such as the 2009 Black Saturday fires that claimed the lives of nearly 173 people. Interestingly, the most destructive fires happened in 1974 and burned 117 million hectares in central Australia.   But because they didn't impact on any communities, they were not given a name. 'The 1974/75 fires had almost no impact and much of the damage was found by satellite after the fact,' Professor Pyne told news.com.au.[3] While it is true that Australia has always experienced fire seasons, just as California and Canada have fire seasons, They have been occurring more frequently and have been more destructive in the last 20 years.  'Undoubtedly climate change is real and my sense is that it's acting as a performance enhancer,' Professor Pyne said. 'Fires are becoming more and more savage, and they are more frequent. They used to happen every 30 or 50 years, now they seem to be happening by the decade.'Further Reading: The climate crisis has pushed Earth to a critical 'tipping point'[4]  The climate change link is evidentThe link between global warming, forests, and wildfires is multifaceted but very clear, said Nerilie Abram, a climate researcher at Australian National University. This combination of factors creates an unending cycle of events. \"Increasing temperatures dry out fuel and lead to more days of extreme fire weather,\" she said. \"The poleward shift of the Southern Hemisphere westerly winds is drawing winter rainfall away from southern Australia, causing a long-term drying trend that makes the landscape more vulnerable to burning.\" Digital Journal has written about this link and the cycle that's created when drought and loss of forests cause higher temperatures over the land and lower humidity, which, in turn, worsens wildfire conditions. This is what may happen in Australia's Alps.   Australian National University climate scientist Christopher Brack explains: \"These fires burning through the Southern Alps (in Australia) at the moment are re-burning alpine and mountain ash trees that were regenerating from fires less than 20 years ago,\" Brack said. In the warming climate, the current forests are likely to be replaced by brush and other shorter-lived and more flammable species that will intensify the fire cycle, he said. In a recent Australian television interview, according to Inside Climate News,[5] Pennsylvania State University climate scientist Michael Mann said the heartbreaking loss of irreplaceable forests in Australia is a clear sign of a climate tipping point playing out before our eyes. Similar scenarios are apparent in forests around the world, he said.  Arsonists and the \"disinformation campaign\"Yes, it is true that 24 people have been charged with arson for starting some of the fires in Australia. However, bot and troll accounts are involved in a 'disinformation campaign' [6]aimed at exaggerating the arsonist claims and downplaying climate change as being a factor in the bushfires, according to social media analysts.  Queensland University of Technology senior lecturer on social network analysis Dr. Timothy Graham examined content published on the #arsonemergency hashtag on Twitter. Out of a total of 1,340 tweets, he found that 1,203 were unique - all coming from 315 accounts.  Using a Twitter bot detection tool[7], he assessed a random sample for bot-like characteristics. The analysis showed a 'current disinformation campaign' on Twitter's #arsonemergency hashtag due to the 'suspiciously high number of bot-like and troll-like accounts.\" He also found suspicious accounts under the hashtags #australiafire and #bushfireaustralia. 'Australia suddenly appears to be getting swamped by mis/disinformation as a result of this environmental catastrophe, and we are suffering the consequences in terms of hyped-up polarisation and an increased difficulty and inability for citizens to discern truth,' Graham told the Guardian.

Our usual fire season is about 3 months. It's already been three months, and there are two more months to go. </p><p>These fires are also on a scale never before seen. This season is the equivalent of multiple bad seasons. A new heatwave will hit tomorrow[1], with temperatures in the 40C range across much of the country. In a bone-dry drought, that means perfect fire conditions, no humidity, and of course the ever-present smoke and dust. The smoke travels hundreds of miles, turning the sun orange even far away from the fires. We've also been lucky so far in that the big cities aren't under siege from the usual summer fires. If they were, there would have to be redeployments of firefighters away from the current fires to those areas, which would be another instant disaster. The damage Before we get onto the sheer fury of people who've lost everything, some background. Please bear in mind these are just the basics: \u2022 An area bigger than Texas has been incinerated. The scope and scale of destruction is unprecedented. The fires are coast to coast, nationwide. \u2022 Towns have been burned out. The residents of Mallacoota, a famous and popular holiday spot for generations, are being evacuated by the navy. The Far South Coast of New South Wales, where I used to live has lost a lot of land. \u2022 Coastal tourist areas with hundreds of thousands of residents and visitors have been devastated. \u2022 A lot of high value commercial, rural and residential property has gone, from Queensland to Western Australia.\u2022 Rebuilding will take a very long time. The cost in time, as well as money to rebuild, may be deadly for some places. In the middle of a drought which was already murdering cashflow in rural areas, that's likely to be a backbreaker for many people. For perhaps the first time in history, nobody's even trying to estimate the cost of the damage. That's a worrying sign, because normally people know roughly how much the damage costs. This time, nobody knows or even pretends to know. The cost will obviously be far in excess of any previous year. \u2022 Insurers will take a massive hit. Some payouts may take years, court actions, etc. Any claim may be an issue where payments aren't automatically made. For some of these towns, that inevitable delay could destroy their economies, close businesses, and set off a cascade of business collapses. \u2022 The national economy as a whole will be hit in multiple ways, including food prices, lost business, etc. It's an inventory of serious hits, affecting all aspects of basic business and daily life. \u2022 The environment: An estimated 500 million animals[2] may have perished. (This number is debatable. Estimating numbers of Australian animals isn't an exact science at the best of times. Native animals are adapted to fire, but maybe not to this sort of national inferno. There have certainly been a lot of deaths, but it's a catastrophic hit whatever the actual figures.)We're hoping it's not that bad, but there's no way of knowing, yet. There is simply no adequate way of expressing how dangerous and destructive these very fast-moving fires are. Our all-too-obviously under-resourced fire and emergency services have achieved miracles. Given the national scale of the ongoing disaster, we've got off a bit better than a decade ago, when 147 people died in smaller fires. Bushfires can turn cars into puddles of metal and buildings into pathetic, totally trashed garbage dumps in a few minutes. Radiant heat can burn you from a hundred metres or so away. We've been fortunate to receive very much appreciated help from America and Canada. They've already done an incredible job and provided some relief for our horribly over-strained fire teams. The anger is hotter than the firesAustralia's unprecedented fires have generated equally hot, fully justified anger. Australian governments, state and federal, are seen as responding poorly at best: \u2022 Everyone knows how severely stretched the Australian emergency services usually are. \u2022 They have to raise money by donations. \u2022 They tried to do proper fuel clearance before the fire season, but had 'inadequate resources'. That's not even funny. We're a super-rich country, and we do nothing about basic common sense? \u2022 Only now are people talking about pay for them. \u2022 They have to travel constantly in fire season, working in impossible heat. \u2022 The military, only now called in to help, could have been called in a lot sooner, allowing the firefighters to recover. \u2022 No word of support for fire victims, financial or otherwise, is trickling into the mix.\u2022 The financial uncertainties are a cruelty on top of a disaster for many fire victims. Australian governments are generally and rightly regarded as furniture and despised accordingly depending on portfolios. We have the Lounge Suite for Education, the Sofa for Social Security, or in this case the China Hutch for Emergency Services. Government should:\u2022 Move immediately to manage financial issues. \u2022 Take action ASAP to free up whatever resources are required for the current fire season.\u2022 Immediately begin a nationwide upgrade of all emergency services, terms of service for firefighters and other operators. \u2022 Pay attention when told resources aren't up to scratch.\u2022 Make it standard procedure to put the ADF on standby to support emergency services. \u2022 Upgrade all fire services. They don't even have adequate respirators[3]. A no-brainer, for sure, but that's another total incompetence issue. This sloppy response is totally inadequate on every level. Get off your fat rich backsides and do the job properly for once, you bludgers.

ACVSMR, University of Calgary</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Catastrophic fires across the globe are increasing in both frequency and magnitude. The bushfires in Australia, fuelled by heatwaves and drought, have burned more than 10.7 million hectares, an area larger than Iceland.</p><p>Over one billion animals are estimated to have died in the Australian bushfires so far. This loss of life is devastating. Horses, dogs and other domestic animals are also being affected by the smoke generated by the wildfires.</p><p>As veterinarians who have cared for small animals following the California wildfires and researched the impacts of wildfires on horses in Canada, we have some perspective on how smoke can harm companion animals and what people can do to protect the animals in their care.</p><p>What is smoke?</p><p>The composition of smoke depends on what is being burned. The smoke from a house fire or a barn fire will contain different compounds than the smoke from wildfires or bushfires.</p><p>When an animal inhales smoke, it brings a combination of toxic gases, such as carbon monoxide and hydrogen cyanide, and particulate matter, a mixture of small liquid and solid particles, into its throat, nose and lungs.</p><p>Smoke inhalation can damage the respiratory tract in multiple ways; it can cause burns and lead to physical irritation, causing the airway to swell and become blocked.</p><p>Toxic gases can impair oxygen delivery and lead to death. Animals with immediate and close exposure to fires, such as barn or house fires, face this risk.</p><p>Exposure to bushfires or wildfires results in a sustained, lower-dose exposure to smoke. The major concern here is particulate matter. Very small particulate matter (less than four microns in diametre) can bypass the body's natural filters and reach the lower airways.</p><p>Smoke inhalation in horses</p><p>Our relationship with horses is unique in that they bridge the gap between livestock and companion animals. As athletic animals, air quality impacts horses' capacity to perform. The financial ramifications of impaired performance is not insignificant, given the economic impact of the horse industry in multiple countries.</p><p>Horses have a huge lung capacity. A horse moves more than 2,000 litres of air through its lungs every minute during strenuous exercise. With this air, horses also inhale a large number of pollutants, which is drastically increased during fires.</p><p>In 2018, Calgary was smothered in wildfire smoke for more than six weeks, with poor air quality warnings issued daily. During this period, we studied the impact of poor air quality on exercise performance in polo horses that were at a maintenance level of fitness at the end of the competition season. They continued the same training program throughout the trial, so all results are due to the improved conditions and not a conditioning effect.</p><p>Every horse involved in the study exhibited coughing at rest and during exercise, with owners complaining of decreased performance.</p><p>We performed a procedure called a lung wash on these horses to retrieve cells and particulate matter from their lungs. Every horse in the study showed inflammation of the respiratory tract. We also found large amounts of microscopic pollens and other debris trapped in the cells. These findings are diagnostic of asthma in horses, and were also commonly seen by veterinarians working in the affected area.</p><p>We also wanted to know how much the performance of these horses improved after prolonged smoke exposure. The gold standard technique to evaluate athletic performance is the measurement of maximum oxygen consumption, also known as VO2max.</p><p>After 2.5 weeks of improved air quality, horses had a 15 per cent increase in speed, as well as a 13.2 per cent increase in VO2max, compared to those measures on the first day of improved air quality. To put this into context, training two-year-old racehorses for eight weeks has been reported to result in a 6.7 per cent improvement in VO2max.</p><p>How to keep animals safe</p><p>There are many guidelines available for people when air quality is poor, but very little information for pet owners.</p><p>The air quality index (AQI) is used in Australia and the United States. The AQI is a single number presented on a scale of 0-500, ranging from excellent air quality to the most hazardous air pollution. Canada uses the Air Quality Health Index (AQHI), using a scale from 1 to 10.</p><p>The Australian Broadcasting Corporation reported several regions where AQIs had surpassed 500 in December 2019. Wildfires in northern Alberta in 2018 sent AQHI index past 11 in Calgary in May 2019.</p><p>Stay indoors</p><p>Where possible, animals should be kept indoors when the AQI is greater than 150 or AQHI is 10+ for multiple days in a row to reduce exposure to small particulate matter. The environment matters, however. For example, a dog in a tightly sealed home will have less exposure to airborne irritants than a horse in a stable.</p><p>Like human asthmatics, staying indoors might not prevent symptoms in animals with pre-existing respiratory conditions, especially when smoke persists for greater than five days. In addition, brachycephalic breeds such as pugs and bulldogs are likely to have a reduced tolerance to smoke.</p><p>Reduce outdoor physical activity</p><p>When animals exercise, they increase the amount of air they inhale, which increases the deposition of particles deep in the lungs.</p><p>Based on guidelines from multiple regulatory bodies and associations, we recommend limiting outdoor exercise in animals when smoke is visible. Moderate to intense exercise should be reduced when there is a high or very high risk rating (AQI exceeding 100; AQHI greater than 7). We recommend cancelling events (such as a Thoroughbred race) when there is a very high risk rating (AQI greater than 150 or an AQHI of 10+).</p><p>There's every indication that fire seasons are going to become longer and more frequent. When smoke starts to blanket the land, remember there are simple things you can do to protect the respiratory health of both you and your pets.</p><p>___</p><p>This article is republished from The Conversation under a Creative Commons license.

Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that anticipated production costs will be achieved. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and future profitability.

By the end of 2020, we should adopt an environmental policy like New Zealand did in 2019. In that country, 3.5 per cent of population were engaged in making a change. By 2023, we should criminalize and delegitimize the fossil fuel industry through crimes against humanity tribunals of fossil fuel executives, the document states.</p><p>Ken's wife Judy said they have marched five times now since September's Global Fridays for Future Climate Strike March initiated by Greta Thunberg; and have continued weekly Friday demonstrations outside the Parry Sound constituencies since March. She says their objective is to provide a regular presence in the region and further attention alongside ongoing international movements.</p><p>Last month the group submitted the signed provincial petition with over 1,000 signatures, asking MPP Miller to declare a climate emergency after international scientific consensus for governments to take action within the next 12 years.

With the acquisition of the Higginsville mine and mill in June, our company has matured into a growing, profitable gold producer with two operations feeding a centralized mill. Our fourth quarter results continue to build upon the success of the previous quarter despite the challenges associated with the bushfires in Australia in late 2019. I would like to take this opportunity to personally commend our personnel in Australia for an outstanding job, which ensured that despite these challenges our mill remained in operation with ample feed from our mines and stockpiles. These efforts were reflected in our results, driving both a beat to production guidance and finishing</p><p>With respect to current operations, we are now mining from three sources: Baloo, Fairplay North and Beta Hunt, with opportunities for expansion at all three mines. As we work through our open pit optimizations at Higginsville, we look forward to announcing an updated LOM plan for Higginsville later this year. With operations performing well YTD 2020, we remain on track to meet our previously reported 2020 guidance of 90,000-95,000 ounces and AISC1 guidance of US$1,050-US$1,200 per ounce.</p><p>I would also like to highlight our early 2020 exploration success. The renegotiation of the Morgan Stanley royalty in December unlocked our 1,800 km2 land package surrounding the mill and, as we announced during January and February, we are seeing outstanding results from the drilling bit and our review of the large historical HGO database. I am extremely excited to see what this year has in store with our large exploration program at Higginsville; the first of its kind in many years.</p><p>Lastly, and certainly not least, we have experienced significant impact in global financial markets both on our share price and that of our peers as a result of the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis. I remind our shareholders and stakeholders that we have taken careful steps at our operations to prepare for potential disruptions, and we remain in constant contact with the local, state and federal health authorities. As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our workforce and stakeholders.</p><p>We finished the year with an extremely strong balance sheet, nearly C$35 million in cash. We have continued to build stockpiles in front of the mill, just as we did ahead of the Australian bushfires last year. Once again, I would like to thank our personnel on site for their tireless efforts in preparing our operations during this period. I remain confident that with all our collective efforts we will get through this and all stakeholders can regain confidence once the global situation begins to improve and normalize.</p><p>Most importantly, I wish good health to all.\"</p><p>COVID-19 Preparedness</p><p>As announced in RNC's news release dated March 18, 2020, the Corporation has implemented strict control measures at its operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic.

RNC is carefully monitoring the advice of local health authorities and has informed site personnel of the precautions that need to be taken with respect to travel to and from site, along with isolation periods should anyone exhibit symptoms consistent with COVID-19.

Production during the fourth quarter of 2019 consisted of Beta Hunt underground, Baloo open pit and a small amount of stockpile material. The milled grade was 2.60 grams per tonne of gold (\"g/t Au\"), compared to 9.42 grams per tonne the fourth quarter of 2018. The higher grade in 2018 was the result of high-grade Father's Day Vein specimen gold production.</p><p>Consolidated AISC1 was US$1,131 per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2019, an improvement of 4% over the third quarter of 2019 and 12% over the first half of 2019. The</p><p>AISC1 costs were higher by US$446 per ounce sold compared to US$685 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included sales from coarse gold production from the Father's Day Vein discovery. //st 1. Non-IFRS: the definition and reconciliation of these measures are</p><p>included in the Non-IFRS Measures section of RNC's MD&amp;A dated March</p><p>25, 2020.</p><p>Cash operating costs were US$929 per ounce sold on a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of 2019, US$103 per ounce or 10% lower than in the third quarter of 2019.</p><p>With the HGO mill fed at 100% capacity, fourth quarter results from the combined Beta Hunt and Higginsville mines showed significant improvement over third quarter results,. This was despite significant challenges during December due to the Australian bushfires, which impacted the supply chain to the region. With critical supplies and tonnes stockpiled in front of the mill, processing operations were able to continue unabated.</p><p>Higginsville Gold Operation (HGO)</p><p>Gold production at Higginsville was 10,584 ounces at a milled grade of 1.75 g/t Au during the fourth quarter, an 84% increase from 5,756 ounces in the prior quarter. Grade was down slightly from the third quarter due to milling of lower grade Mt. Henry stockpiles during the Australian bushfires. The increase reflects the ramp up of mining operations at Higginsville, which now includes production from the both the Baloo and Fairplay North open pits.</p><p>At Higginsville, cash operating costs were USD $1,182 per ounce for the fourth quarter, US$504, or 74% higher, than in the prior quarter. The increased cash cost was largely due to the reallocation of processing costs inside the Western Australia business unit and several one-off items.</p><p>With Higginsville operations now fully integrated into the Western Australia business unit, internal processing charges have been normalized. This has resulted in the internal reallocation of processing charges between Beta Hunt and Higginsville. This is reflected by the reported cash operating costs in Table 1. Importantly this reallocation of costs does not change the consolidated rates for the Australian business such as cash operating costs and AISC.</p><p>Significant items, totaling approximately A$6 million, included work associated with the decision to build up run-of-mine (\"ROM\") stockpiles ahead of the significant bushfires in Western Australian during the month of December. In order to achieve this, the Company elected to double-shift at Baloo in order to fast track pre-strip development and build stockpiles while maintaining normal feed to the plant. Mining at Baloo also transitioned into the underlying fresh rock which resulted in additional drilling and blasting costs. Lastly, costs were also impacted with increased dewatering operations associated with larger water inflows into the pit during heavy rains early in the fourth quarter.</p><p>As previously announced, mining at Baloo Stage 1 is now forecast to continue to mid-2020 and Stage 2 will now be extended to January 2021. Recent drilling has the potential for Baloo to be extended even beyond January 2021.</p><p>At Fairplay North, located just 1 km from the HGO mill, mining is underway concurrently with Baloo, providing two sources of feed from HGO to the mill. An additional A$2.7 million in pre-stripping capital was associated with the Fairplay North pit during the fourth quarter as the renegotiation of the royalty at Higginsville allowed RNC to begin mining activities.</p><p>The Fairplay North pit will be mined in two stages, with Stage 2 expected to be completed by the end of third quarter 2020. However, as with Baloo, recent drilling has raised the potential for this to be extended.</p><p>Milling at Higginsville continued to perform well during the fourth quarter, with overall mill availability improving to 97% from 93% in the third quarter. This trend has continued during the first few months of 2020 and is expected to support RNC's continued cost reduction strategy.</p><p>See RNC's news release dated January 29, 2020 for more information on early drilling success at both Baloo and Fairplay North.</p><p>Beta Hunt Mine</p><p>Gold production at Beta Hunt was 16,290 ounces during the fourth quarter. Milled grades at Beta Hunt in the fourth quarter were 3.81 grams per tonne Au, higher than 2.93 grams per tonne in the third quarter but lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to production from the high-grade Father's Day Vein.</p><p>Beta Hunt gold production is mainly focused on the Western Flanks and A Zone mining areas. A number of stoping areas are being developed within the Western Flanks that will access some of the wider Beta Hunt stoping blocks (up to 20 metres wide). Combined production from Western Flanks and A Zone is forecast to increase to +50,000 tonnes per month while mining from these wider stoping blocks.</p><p>Table 2 - Highlights of Annual Financial Results (in thousands of dollars except per share amounts) //st For the years ended December 31, 2019 2018 Revenue $128,036 $128,770 Production and processing costs 78,836 82,742 Loss before income taxes (7,716) (7,911) Net loss (6,942) (8,396) Basic and diluted loss per share 0.01 0.02 Adjusted EBITDA1,2 18,284 17,979 Adjusted EBITDA per share1,2 0.03 0.05 Adjusted earnings1 15,913 13,886 Adjusted earnings per share1 0.03 0.04 Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities 15,179 (8,316) Cash investment in property, plant and equipment (25,391) (13,013) and mineral property interests //st 1.

(\"Morgan Stanley\") over a number of tenements at its Higginsville Gold Operations located in Western Australia. This revised royalty structure has allowed for a new strategic approach to many of the previously uneconomic mineralized zones throughout the HGO tenements.</p><p>In news releases dated January 23, January 29 and February 27, 2020, RNC announced comprehensive updates on exploration activities since the renegotiation of the royalty. Highlights include: //st * At Baloo, 20 resource definition holes totalling 492 metres and 19 exploration holes totalling 1,897 metres were completed. Drilling focused on the following target areas with the aim of increasing and upgrading the existing historical resource: * North Baloo (BLOR0003- 8.7 g/t over 3.0m from 63m)2 * Eastern Footwall mineralization (BLOR0033 - 4.8 g/t over 3.0 m, from 7</p><p>m)1 * Down-dip Infill of the Baloo mineralization (BLOR0009- 2.5 g/t over</p><p>18.5 m, from 14 m)1 (/ul) //st</p><p>1.

These efforts were reflected in our results, driving both a beat to production guidance and finishing 2H19 with AISC of US$1,144 per ounce, below our guided range of US$1,150-$1,250 per ounce. </p><p>With respect to current operations, we are now mining from three sources: Baloo, Fairplay North and Beta Hunt, with opportunities for expansion at all three mines. As we work through our open pit optimizations at Higginsville, we look forward to announcing an updated LOM plan for Higginsville later this year. With operations performing well YTD 2020, we remain on track to meet our previously reported 2020 guidance of 90,000-95,000 ounces and AISC1 guidance of US$1,050-US$1,200 per ounce. </p><p>I would also like to highlight our early 2020 exploration success. The renegotiation of the Morgan Stanley royalty in December unlocked our 1,800 km2 land package surrounding the mill and, as we announced during January and February, we are seeing outstanding results from the drilling bit and our review of the large historical HGO database. I am extremely excited to see what this year has in store with our large exploration program at Higginsville; the first of its kind in many years. </p><p>Lastly, and certainly not least, we have experienced significant impact in global financial markets both on our share price and that of our peers as a result of the ongoing global COVID-19 crisis. I remind our shareholders and stakeholders that we have taken careful steps at our operations to prepare for potential disruptions, and we remain in constant contact with the local, state and federal health authorities. As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our workforce and stakeholders. </p><p>We finished the year with an extremely strong balance sheet, nearly C$35 million in cash. We have continued to build stockpiles in front of the mill, just as we did ahead of the Australian bushfires last year. Once again, I would like to thank our personnel on site for their tireless efforts in preparing our operations during this period. I remain confident that with all our collective efforts we will get through this and all stakeholders can regain confidence once the global situation begins to improve and normalize.</p><p>Most importantly, I wish good health to all.\" </p><p>COVID-19 Preparedness</p><p>As announced in RNC's news release dated March 18, 2020, the Corporation has implemented strict control measures at its operations in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. A task force at RNC's Australian operations has been established to ensure the operating sites remain as prepared and responsive to this evolving situation as possible.\u00a0 RNC is carefully monitoring the advice of local health authorities and has informed site personnel of the precautions that need to be taken with respect to travel to and from site, along with isolation periods should anyone exhibit symptoms consistent with COVID-19. RNC has also proactively employed a full-time nurse specifically to monitor the status of people entering and leaving site. Additionally, RNC has also sealed off both operations from any outside visitors not critical to business operations.</p><p>In order to minimize potential disruptions to supply chains, RNC is building additional critical supplies beyond normal levels. As part of our ability to manage the fallout from the December bushfires, ROM stockpiles are now growing steadily from three sources: Baloo, Beta Hunt and Fairplay North.</p><p>RNC will continue to monitor this fluid situation, with our top priority being the health and safety of its employees and stakeholders.</p><p>  Table 1 - Highlights of operational results for the periods ended December

gold production of 26,874 ounces was 6,379 ounces higher than the corresponding quarter in 2018 (20,495 ounces). Production during the fourth quarter of 2019 consisted of Beta Hunt underground, Baloo open pit and a small amount of stockpile material. The milled grade was 2.60 grams per tonne of gold (\"g/t Au\"), compared to 9.42 grams per tonne the fourth quarter of 2018. The higher grade in 2018 was the result of high-grade Father's Day Vein specimen gold production. </p><p>Consolidated AISC1 was US$1,131 per ounce for the fourth quarter of 2019, an improvement of 4% over the third quarter of 2019 and 12% over the first half of 2019. The 2H19 AISC of US$1,144 per ounce came in below 2H19 guidance of US$1,150-$1,250 per ounce. This continued reduction in AISC was achieved despite the increased capital outlays arising as a result of the Australian bushfires, a major rebuild of an underground mining truck at Beta Hunt and pre-stripping capital costs associated with the ramp up of the Fairplay North open pit at Higginsville. </p><p>  AISC1 costs were higher by US$446 per ounce sold compared to US$685 per ounce in the fourth quarter of 2018 which included sales from coarse gold production from the Father's Day Vein discovery.\u00a0</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"608\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Non-IFRS: the definition and reconciliation of these measures are included in the Non-IFRS Measures section of RNC's MD&amp;A dated March 25, 2020.</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\u00a0</p><p>Cash operating costs were US$929 per ounce sold on a consolidated basis for the fourth quarter of 2019, US$103 per ounce or 10% lower than in the third quarter of 2019. </p><p>With the HGO mill fed at 100% capacity, fourth quarter results from the combined Beta Hunt and Higginsville mines showed significant improvement over third quarter results,. This was despite significant challenges during December due to the Australian bushfires, which impacted the supply chain to the region. With critical supplies and tonnes stockpiled in front of the mill, processing operations were able to continue unabated.</p><p>Higginsville Gold Operation (HGO)</p><p>Gold production at Higginsville was 10,584 ounces at a milled grade of 1.75 g/t Au during the fourth quarter, an 84% increase from 5,756 ounces in the prior quarter. Grade was down slightly from the third quarter due to milling of lower grade Mt. Henry stockpiles during the Australian bushfires. The increase reflects the ramp up of mining operations at Higginsville, which now includes production from the both the Baloo and Fairplay North open pits. </p><p>At Higginsville, cash operating costs were USD $1,182 per ounce for the fourth quarter, US$504, or 74% higher, than in the prior quarter. The increased cash cost was largely due to the reallocation of processing costs inside the Western Australia business unit and several one-off items.</p><p>With Higginsville operations now fully integrated into the Western Australia business unit, internal processing charges have been normalized. This has resulted in the internal reallocation of processing charges between Beta Hunt and Higginsville. This is reflected by the reported cash operating costs in Table 1. Importantly this reallocation of costs does not change the consolidated rates for the Australian business such as cash operating costs and AISC.\u00a0</p><p>Significant items, totaling approximately A$6 million, included work associated with the decision to build up run-of-mine (\"ROM\") stockpiles ahead of the significant bushfires in Western Australian during the month of December. In order to achieve this, the Company elected to double-shift at Baloo in order to fast track pre-strip development and build stockpiles while maintaining normal feed to the plant. Mining at Baloo also transitioned into the underlying fresh rock which resulted in additional drilling and blasting costs. Lastly, costs were also impacted with increased dewatering operations associated with larger water inflows into the pit during heavy rains early in the fourth quarter. </p><p>As previously announced, mining at Baloo Stage 1 is now forecast to continue to mid-2020 and Stage 2 will now be extended to January 2021. Recent drilling has the potential for Baloo to be extended even beyond January 2021. </p><p>At Fairplay North, located just 1 km from the HGO mill, mining is underway concurrently with Baloo, providing two sources of feed from HGO to the mill. An additional A$2.7 million in pre-stripping capital was associated with the Fairplay North pit during the fourth quarter as the renegotiation of the royalty at Higginsville allowed RNC to begin mining activities.</p><p>The Fairplay North pit will be mined in two stages, with Stage 2 expected to be completed by the end of third quarter 2020. However, as with Baloo, recent drilling has raised the potential for this to be extended.</p><p>Milling at Higginsville continued to perform well during the fourth quarter, with overall mill availability improving to 97% from 93% in the third quarter. This trend has continued during the first few months of 2020 and is expected to support RNC's continued cost reduction strategy. </p><p>See RNC's news release dated January 29, 2020 for more information on early drilling success at both Baloo and Fairplay North. </p><p>Beta Hunt Mine</p><p>Gold production at Beta Hunt was 16,290 ounces during the fourth quarter. Milled grades at Beta Hunt in the fourth quarter were 3.81 grams per tonne Au, higher than 2.93 grams per tonne in the third quarter but lower than in the fourth quarter of 2018 due to production from the high-grade Father's Day Vein. </p><p>Beta Hunt gold production is mainly focused on the Western Flanks and A Zone mining areas. A number of stoping areas are being developed within the Western Flanks that will access some of the wider Beta Hunt stoping blocks (up to 20 metres wide). Combined production from Western Flanks and A Zone is forecast to increase to +50,000 tonnes per month while mining from these wider stoping blocks. </p><p>  Table 2 - Highlights of Annual Financial Results\u00a0(in thousands of dollars except per share amounts)</p><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_5\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"488\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">For the years ended December 31,</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2019</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2018</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Revenue</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">$128,036</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">$128,770</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Production and processing costs</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">78,836</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">82,742</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Loss before income taxes</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(7,716)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(7,911)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Net loss</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(6,942)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(8,396)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Basic and diluted loss per share</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.01</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.02</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted EBITDA1,2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">18,284</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">17,979</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted EBITDA per share1,2</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.03</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.05</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted earnings1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15,913</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">13,886</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Adjusted earnings per share1</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">0.03</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">0.04</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash flow provided by (used in) operating activities</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">15,179</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(8,316)</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Cash investment in property, plant and equipment and mineral property interests</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">(25,391)</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">(13,013)</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><table frame=\"none\"><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_6\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"16\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"608\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">1.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Non-IFRS: the definition and reconciliation of these measures are included in the Non-IFRS Measures section of RNC's MD&amp;A dated March 25, 2020.</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">2.</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization (\"EBITDA\").</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><p>\u00a0</p><p>For the year ended December 31, 2019, revenues of 128.0 million decreased slightly by $0.7 million compared to 2018.

Factors that could affect the outcome include, among others: future prices and the supply of metals; the results of drilling; inability to raise the money necessary to incur the expenditures required to retain and advance the properties; environmental liabilities (known and unknown); general business, economic, competitive, political and social uncertainties; results of exploration programs; accidents, labour disputes, labour and operational disruptions due to the COVID-19 outbreak and other risks of the mining industry; political instability, terrorism, insurrection or war; or delays in obtaining governmental approvals, projected cash operating costs, failure to obtain regulatory or shareholder approvals. For a more detailed discussion of such risks and other factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements, refer to RNC's filings with Canadian securities regulators, including the most recent Annual Information Form, available on SEDAR at <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.sedar.com\">www.sedar.com</url>.</p><p>Although RNC has attempted to identify important factors that could cause actual actions, events or results to differ materially from those described in forward-looking statements, there may be other factors that cause actions, events or results to differ from those anticipated, estimated or intended. Forward-looking statements contained herein are made as of the date of this news release and RNC disclaims any obligation to update any forward-looking statements, whether as a result of new information, future events or results or otherwise, except as required by applicable securities laws.</p><p>Cautionary Statement Regarding the Higginsville Mining Operations</p><p>A production decision at the Higginsville gold operations was made by previous operators of the mine, prior to the completion of the acquisition of the Higginsville gold operations by RNC and RNC made a decision to continue production subsequent to the acquisition. This decision by RNC to continue production and, to the knowledge of RNC, the prior production decision were not based on a feasibility study of mineral reserves, demonstrating economic and technical viability, and, as a result, there may be an increased uncertainty of achieving any particular level of recovery of minerals or the cost of such recovery, which include increased risks associated with developing a commercially mineable deposit. Historically, such projects have a much higher risk of economic and technical failure. There is no guarantee that anticipated production costs will be achieved. Failure to achieve the anticipated production costs would have a material adverse impact on the Corporation's cash flow and future profitability. Readers are cautioned that there is increased uncertainty and higher risk of economic and technical failure associated with such production decisions.</p><p>SOURCE  RNC Minerals</p><p> View original content to download multimedia: <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2020/26/c1251.html\">http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/March2020/26/c1251.html</url></p>", "publisher": "Canada NewsWire", "instances": ["As always, our top priority remains the health and safety of our workforce and stakeholders.

In weekly club meetings, they talk about these concerns, including whether they will be able to have children and what jobs will be available for them.</p><p>To address this type of concern, countries such as New Zealand and Italy are introducing climate change curriculums, which try to address eco-anxiety. The idea is to emphasize the science behind climate change, while presenting strategies to better manage eco-anxiety.</p><p>In New Zealand, middle-school students are now being taught climate science, current international responses, local implications and how to join climate change movements.

But then she realized her neighbours were not, and that her university definitely wasn't and the restaurant she works at combines recycled bottles with garbage at the end of each night. This is an \"overwhelming feeling,\" she says.</p><p>Such feelings of helplessness are why experts warn against letting anxiety lead to burnout. When Howard first got involved in climate activism, she says, \"I was completely driven by anxiety instead of strategy.\" Today, she says \"if you want to make change, you have to be quite centred in your emotions.\"</p><p>Howard's involvement in the climate movement helped her feel less alone and find people in her community who were experiencing the same feelings of eco-anxiety.</p><p>Feather emphasizes that when it comes to anxiety, \"it's what you do with that anxiety that is important.\"</p><p>\"Anxiety is not necessarily a bad thing; it is a natural reaction to a threat,\" says Feather. Eco-anxiety is therefore a rational response, not something to suppress or ignore.</p><p>Payson, of the Canadian Mental Health Association, says \"stress can be a good motivator but if we maintain it for too long, it turns into distress and starts to impair us.\"</p><p>When she works with individuals experiencing eco-anxiety, she emphasizes \"that we have to take care of ourselves and we have to find ways to practise self-compassion.\"</p><p>Another important tool for managing eco-anxiety is ensuring correct resources are used, which means better media literacy for young people immersed in social media.</p><p>With little formal climate education in Canada, many young people instead rely on their own research to inform their opinions, the majority of which comes from social media.</p><p>This can be a great tool for young people to follow what is happening globally, like the fires in Australia, but it can also spread false information.</p><p>Exaggerated, overly dramatic or inaccurate news spreads quickly on social media and can have harmful impacts on people's mental health. Headlines claiming there are \"only five years left to save the planet\" can be especially terrifying to children.</p><p>Buchwald says the children she babysits often show her alarmist and unverifiable news on Instagram.</p><p>Howard says education in Canada needs \"to respect our children enough to be honest with them about the challenges we are facing.\"</p><p>Natasha Comeau is a Fellow in Global Journalism at the University of Toronto's Dalla Lana School of Public Health.

The Canada Sector consists of the Dairy Division (Canada), the USA Sector consists of the Cheese Division (USA) and the Dairy Foods Division (USA), the International Sector consists of the Dairy Division (Australia) and the Dairy Division (Argentina) and the Europe Sector consists of the Dairy Division (UK).</p><p>Consolidated revenues for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $3.891 billion, an increase of $313.6 million or 8.8%, as compared to $3.577 billion for the same quarter last fiscal year. The inclusion of the Dairy Crest Acquisition, the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition, for nine weeks, and the activities of F&amp;A Dairy Products, Inc. (F&amp;A Acquisition) contributed positively to revenues. The combined effect of a higher average block market** per pound of cheese and the fluctuation of the average butter market** price per pound increased revenues by approximately $148 million. The devaluation of the Argentine peso and the Australian dollar versus the US dollar in the export market had a positive impact on revenues. Additionally, higher international selling prices of cheese and dairy ingredients, a favourable product mix, as well as higher domestic selling prices in the International Sector due to the increased cost of milk as raw material, positively impacted revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes as a result of competitive market conditions in the fluid milk category in Canada and in the cheese category in the USA, and the decline of raw milk availability in Australia. The fluctuation of foreign currencies versus the Canadian dollar decreased revenues by approximately $81 million, mainly in the International Sector.</p><p>For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, revenues totalled $11.225 billion, an increase of $959.4 million or 9.3%, as compared to $10.265 billion for the same period last fiscal year. Revenues increased due to the contribution of recent acquisitions, including $534.5 million from the Dairy Crest Acquisition for the 37-week period ended December 31, 2019. The combined effect of a higher average block market per pound of cheese and the fluctuation of the butter market price per pound increased revenues by approximately $277 million. The devaluation of the Argentine peso and the Australian dollar versus the US dollar in the export market had a positive impact on revenues. Additionally, higher international selling prices of cheese and dairy ingredients, a favourable product mix, as well as higher domestic selling prices in the Canada and International Sectors due to the increased cost of milk as raw material, positively impacted revenues. These increases were partially offset by lower sales volumes as a result of competitive market conditions in Canada, mainly in the fluid milk category, and the decline of raw milk availability in Australia. Finally, the fluctuation of foreign currencies versus the Canadian dollar decreased revenues by approximately $221 million, mainly in the International Sector and partially offset by the USA Sector.</p><p>Consolidated adjusted EBITDA* for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $417.0 million, an increase of $95.8 million or 29.8%, as compared to $321.2 million for the same quarter last fiscal year. The contribution of the Dairy Crest Acquisition increased adjusted EBITDA by $34.7 million, and the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition also contributed positively to adjusted EBITDA. In addition, pricing initiatives in the USA Sector positively affected adjusted EBITDA through a better alignment of selling prices with costs related to warehousing, delivery and logistics. USA Market Factors had a positive effect of approximately $14 million. Furthermore, higher international dairy ingredient and cheese market prices also positively impacted adjusted EBITDA. Despite lower sales volumes, product mix optimization and improved operational efficiencies favourably impacted adjusted EBITDA. The adoption of IFRS 16, Leases positively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $16 million. The fluctuation of foreign currencies versus the Canadian dollar had a negative impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $15 million, mainly in the International Sector.</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. ** Refer to the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020.</p><p>For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, consolidated adjusted EBITDA totalled $1.169 billion, an increase of $223.2 million or 23.6%, as compared to $946.2 million for the same period last fiscal year. The contribution of the Dairy Crest Acquisition, for the 37-week period ended December 31, 2019, increased adjusted EBITDA by $96.5 million. Also, adjusted EBITDA increased due to the contribution of recent acquisitions for the full period, as compared to partial contributions for the same period last fiscal year, and the contribution of the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition for nine weeks in the period. Pricing initiatives in the USA Sector also positively affected adjusted EBITDA through a better alignment of selling prices with costs related to warehousing, delivery and logistics. The positive effect of higher international dairy ingredient and cheese market prices was partially offset by lower sales volumes of fluid milk in Canada, as a result of competitive market conditions. Despite lower sales volumes following the decline of raw milk availability in Australia, product mix optimization favourably impacted adjusted EBITDA. USA Market Factors also had a favourable impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $16 million. Furthermore, improved operational efficiencies positively impacted adjusted EBITDA. The adoption of IFRS 16, Leases positively impacted adjusted EBITDA by approximately $47 million. Lastly, the fluctuation of foreign currencies versus the Canadian dollar had an unfavourable impact on adjusted EBITDA of approximately $33 million, mainly in the International Sector and partially offset by the USA Sector.</p><p>Depreciation and amortization for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $121.8 million, an increase of $41.1 million, as compared to $80.7 million for the same quarter last fiscal year. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, depreciation and amortization expenses amounted to $339.4 million, an increase of $107.5 million, as compared to $231.9 million for the same period last fiscal year. These increases were mainly attributable to additional depreciation and amortization related to recent acquisitions and to additions to property, plant and equipment, which increased the depreciable base. Also, as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, depreciation of right-of-use assets represented an increase of approximately $13 million and $38 million for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, respectively.</p><p>Inventory revaluation resulting from a business acquisition for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, amounted to nil and $40.1 million, respectively. These revaluations were related to the Dairy Crest Acquisition, stemming from added value attributed to the acquired inventory as part of the purchase price allocation, and were fully amortized in the income statement as at September 30, 2019.</p><p>Acquisition costs for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, amounted to $9.4 million and $32.2 million, respectively. For the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, acquisition costs were mainly related to the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition, including approximately $9 million in stamp duty taxes. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, acquisition costs were mainly related to the Dairy Crest Acquisition and the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition.</p><p>Net interest expense for the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, increased by $13.0 million and $43.9 million, respectively, as compared to the same periods last fiscal year. These increases were mainly attributed to additional debt related to the Dairy Crest Acquisition and the Speciality Cheese Business Acquisition as well as higher bank loans denominated in Argentine peso, which bear higher interest rates. Also, as a result of the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases, interest expenses on lease liabilities pertaining to right-of-use assets represented an increase of approximately $4 million and $12 million, respectively.</p><p>In accordance with IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies, Argentina has been considered a hyperinflationary economy since July 1, 2018. For the three and nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, the gain on hyperinflation totalled $7.3 million and $16.9 million, respectively. These gains were derived from the indexation of non-monetary assets and liabilities.</p><p>Income tax expense for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $61.2 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 23.6% compared to 20.8% for the same quarter last fiscal year. During the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, the Company recorded an income tax benefit of $6.7 million related to a tax inflation adjustment pursuant to an Argentine tax legislation, as amended. Excluding the effects of the tax inflation adjustment in Argentina and the gain on disposal of assets realized during the third quarter of fiscal 2019, the effective tax rates for the three-month periods ended December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, would have been 26.2% and 26.8%, respectively. Income tax expense for the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $173.8 million, reflecting an effective tax rate of 26.0% as compared to 22.7% for the same period last fiscal year. Excluding the effects of the tax inflation adjustment in Argentina, the gain realized on disposal of assets and acquisition costs for both periods, the effective tax rates for the nine-month periods ended December 31, 2019, and December 31, 2018, would have been 26.4% and 26.1%, respectively. The effective tax rate varies and could increase or decrease based on the amount and source of taxable income, amendments to tax legislations and income tax rates, changes in assumptions, as well as estimates used for the computation of tax assets and liabilities by the Company and its affiliates.</p><p>Net earnings for the three-month period ended December 31, 2019, totalled $197.8 million, a decrease of $144.2 million or 42.2%, as compared to $342.0 million for the same quarter last fiscal year. For the nine-month period ended December 31, 2019, net earnings totalled $494.1 million, a decrease of $137.0 million or 21.7%, as compared to $631.1 million for the same period last fiscal year.

Profitability enhancement and shareholder value creation remain the cornerstones of the Company's objectives. Saputo has a long-standing commitment to manufacture quality products and will remain focused on operational efficiencies. The Company is committed to living up to the values on which its business was founded in 1954. It is these values that led to the development of the Saputo Promise - its 7-Pillar approach to social, environmental, and economic performance. With a strong foundation in place and clear strategic direction, the Company is continually looking for opportunities to improve its performance across each of the 7 Pillars: Food Quality and Safety, Our People, Business Ethics, Responsible Sourcing, Environment, Nutrition and Healthy Living, and Community. For Saputo, pursuing growth as a global dairy processor includes building a healthier future for its employees, consumers, customers, and those living in the communities where it operates. In fiscal 2020, the Company continues to focus on the execution of the Saputo Promise three-year plan launched earlier this year. As part of its efforts, Saputo intends to ramp up its commitment to responsible environmental practices with a key focus on climate, water and waste. Going forward, Saputo is committed to diversifying its product portfolio by pursuing more plant-based opportunities. The Company aims to capitalize on the growing consumer demand, and to leverage a common customer base, technology, manufacturing expertise, assets and supply chain. Saputo will look to increase its presence in this category through a series of investments in manufacturing, sales and distribution. To lead its plans, the Company has appointed a Senior Vice-President, Business Development, Plant-Based Food. For fiscal 2020, the Company continues to expect its business operations to deliver slightly higher adjusted EBITDA when compared to fiscal 2019. This excludes the positive contributions of the Dairy Crest Acquisition and the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition, as well as the adoption of IFRS 16, Leases in fiscal 2020. While benefiting from the contribution of other recent acquisitions, the Company expects to continue facing competitive market conditions in the USA, unsettled economic conditions in Argentina, volatility in international selling prices of cheese and dairy ingredients, and reduced availability of raw milk due to extreme weather in Australia. The Company expects, through increased efficiencies and pricing initiatives, to mitigate the impact of elevated costs in warehousing, logistics and transportation.</p><p>Canada Sector</p><p>While the competitive Canadian landscape continues to exercise downward pressure on financial performance, market conditions continue to show signs of easing, providing the Dairy Division (Canada) with an improved outlook for capturing profitable sales volumes. The Division will keep emphasizing its specialty and value-added products for both the retail and foodservice channels while building on its customer and consumer loyalty. The Dairy Division (Canada) will also continue to focus on increasing its operational efficiency, decreasing costs and optimizing its platform through strategic investments to mitigate low growth and consistently high warehousing, logistics and transportation costs. In an effort to pursue additional efficiencies and right-size both its manufacturing footprint and sales force, Saputo will be closing its Trenton, Ontario, and Saint John, New Brunswick, facilities in Canada. These closures are scheduled in September 2020 and January 2021, respectively, and the production of both these sites will be integrated into other Saputo facilities across Canada.</p><p>USA Sector</p><p>Although improving, domestic market conditions remain challenging, resulting in an excess supply of commodity products. The USA Sector will continue to focus on increasing operational efficiencies and controlling costs to mitigate the impacts of dairy commodity market fluctuations, competitive market conditions and consistently high warehousing, logistics and transportation costs, which will continue to affect its financial performance. The Company expects cheese markets to remain firm while the dairy ingredient market is expected to remain volatile until the first half of fiscal 2021. The Cheese Division (USA) will continue to focus on increasing operational efficiencies and controlling costs in order to mitigate the effect of competitive market conditions on adjusted EBITDA. It will focus on growing its specialty and value-added products business, pursuing operational efficiencies and ensuring customer demands are met in its commodity products business.</p><p>The Dairy Foods Division (USA) will continue to optimize its national manufacturing and logistics network, as well as its systems and processes. The Division will also focus on growing its business and utilizing the increased manufacturing capacity it is adding to its network.</p><p>International Sector</p><p>The International Sector will keep pursuing sales volume growth in existing markets, as well as the development of additional international markets. The Sector will continue to focus on controlling costs, evaluating overall activities to improve efficiencies and aim to maximize its operational flexibility to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in market conditions and their impact on financial performance. The Sector will also continue to focus on innovation, and the optimization of its product mix and customer portfolios, both domestically and internationally.</p><p>Despite the devaluation of the Argentine peso, the Dairy Division (Argentina) will continue to adapt to changing economic conditions.</p><p>The Dairy Division (Australia) continues to proceed with the integration of the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition which adds to and complements its current activities.</p><p>As a result of the decrease in milk production in Australia, the Dairy Division (Australia) expects increased competition in the sourcing of raw milk to persist and to continue to put pressure on margins. As such, the Division is implementing alternate measures to mitigate these factors. It will also continue to review operations to optimize the network at its disposal and benefit from its manufacturing flexibility. The Company aims to further capture opportunities derived from the operational combination of Murray Goulburn and Warrnambool Cheese and Butter under a single platform and from the wide portfolio of Australian brands inherited through the Specialty Cheese Business Acquisition.</p><p>At this time, the impact of the Australian bushfires on the Company's operations has been limited and its facilities are operating as usual. Saputo has been able to collect close to all the milk from farmers and continues to work on a variety of ongoing practical support initiatives for those suppliers that are affected. The Company has confirmed its support to disaster relief efforts through financial and product donations, and has supported employee initiatives to raise additional funds and volunteer.</p><p>For the first half of fiscal 2021, the Company expects prices to remain relatively stable in the cheese and dairy ingredient markets as there is a better equilibrium between supply and demand in the international market.</p><p>Europe Sector</p><p>For the remainder of fiscal 2020, the Company will continue its integration of the Dairy Division (UK) and focus on aligning processes, systems, and sharing best practices. The Division will pursue capital investments in its manufacturing facilities with the objective of increasing its cheesemaking capabilities and driving overall growth.</p><p>At present, the Dairy Division (UK) is a UK-focused business with a predominantly local supply chain and customer base, which mitigates the Division's exposure to risks surrounding Brexit.</p><p>Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Program</p><p>The Company will continue planning, designing and implementing activities for the migration to the new ERP system. In the first half of calendar 2020, the Company will start the deployment of the ERP program in the remainder of the Dairy Division (Australia) to ensure its alignment under a single system and begin the subsequent phases of the implementation within the Cheese Division (USA), having recently completed the first phase. The Dairy Division (Canada) implementation will begin during calendar 2021. The Dairy Division (UK) is not currently in the scope of Saputo's global ERP program and its business will continue to operate under its existing ERP system.</p><p>Trade Agreements</p><p>The Company expects to continue making an effective use of its interim quota allocation under the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) and intends to focus on importing dairy products that complement the current Canadian product offering. Provided final allocations of dairy import licences are handled in a manner similar to the initial allocation, the Company does not foresee the CPTPP having significant impacts on its operations and will seek to take advantage of export opportunities arising from Australia and Canada to other signatory countries.</p><p>The North American Free Trade Agreement will remain in force until the new Canada-United States-Mexico Agreement (CUSMA) is ratified by all three signatory countries. At this stage, Canada is the only country that has yet to complete this step. The Company does not foresee significant impacts on its operations upon formal adoption of the CUSMA, assuming the bulk of the import licences is allocated to dairy processors in Canada.</p><p>Finally, the goal remains to continue to improve overall efficiencies in all sectors, pursue growth organically and through acquisitions, and always strive to be a stronger and better operator.</p><p>INFORMATION BY SECTOR //st CANADA SECTOR (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal 2020 2019 years</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Revenues 1,049.0 1,029.4 968.8 924.8 1,059.6 1,047.7 1,011.0 Adjusted 111.7 103.2 98.5 90.0 113.8 104.4 105.5 EBITDA*</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020.</p><p>The Canada Sector consists of the Dairy Division (Canada). //st USA SECTOR (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal 2020 2019 years</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Revenues 1,848.7 1,792.4 1,757.7 1,616.6 1,678.5 1,618.0 1,594.6 Adjusted 172.1 175.4 173.6 134.2 122.4 133.8 154.3 EBITDA*</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. //st Selected factors positively (negatively) affecting financial performance (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 USA Market factors*, 1 14 10 (8) 4 (19) (7) 2 US currency exchange1 - 1 6 7 6 7 (8)</p><p>* Refer to the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 1 As compared to same quarter last fiscal year. //st Other pertinent information (in US dollars, except for average exchange rate) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Block market* price Opening 1.958 1.858 1.645 1.430 1.690 1.555 1.530 Closing 1.910 1.958 1.858 1.645 1.430 1.690 1.555 Average 1.971 1.912 1.711 1.520 1.453 1.605 1.603 Butter market* price Opening 2.128 2.410 2.255 2.218 2.320 2.268 2.215 Closing 1.950 2.128 2.410 2.255 2.218 2.320 2.268 Average 2.043 2.284 2.330 2.264 2.238 2.264 2.339 Average whey 0.326 0.352 0.370 0.443 0.452 0.387 0.279 market price per pound* Spread* (0.018) 0.029 0.061 0.054 0.021 0.095 0.135 US average 1.320 1.320 1.337 1.330 1.321 1.307 1.290 exchange rate to Canadian dollar1</p><p>* Refer to the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. 1 Based on Bloomberg published information.</p><p>The USA Sector consists of the Cheese Division (USA) and the Dairy Foods Division (USA). //st INTERNATIONAL SECTOR (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Revenues 797.0 657.0 790.3 695.1 839.1 754.7 662.2 Adjusted EBITDA* 98.5 80.2 59.7 50.9 85.0 79.3 47.7</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020. //st Selected factors positively (negatively) affecting financial performance (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Inventory write-down - - - (2) (1) - - Foreign currency exchange1 (14) (16) (10) (3) (5) - (7)</p><p>1 As compared to same quarter last fiscal year.</p><p>The International Sector consists of the Dairy Division (Australia) and the Dairy Division (Argentina). //st EUROPE SECTOR (in millions of CDN dollars) Fiscal years 2020 2019</p><p>Q3 Q2 Q1 Q4 Q3 Q2 Q1 Revenues 196.1 186.8 151.6 - - - - Adjusted EBITDA* 34.7 35.6 26.2 - - - -</p><p>* Non-IFRS measures are described in the \"Glossary\" section on page 24 of the Management's Discussion and Analysis for the third quarter of fiscal 2020.</p><p>The Europe Sector consists of the Dairy Division (UK) following the Dairy Crest Acquisition.

The effects of the fires were visible yesterday, with smoke like a solid cloud covering most of Western Sydney. Now the smoke is everywhere. </p><p>The smoke is now covering the entire city[1]. It's also heating up as summer starts, and that's not helping. The Big Drought has made the entire area ultra-dry, and since most Australian trees are pyrogenic, (using fire to reproduce), it means Sydney is covered in potential fuel.  Media coverage is updating every half hour [2]or so. The overall situation is getting worse, and horrific in terms of levels of possible risks. Australian bushfires can be all too lethal, and they can hit so fast people can't escape. The air quality is 'hazardous', which may be an understatement for some people.Health warningsHealth warnings have been issued [3]for all Sydney residents. These health warnings are no joke. Particularly at risk are people with respiratory conditions and of course asthma and hay fever sufferers. Even if you don't have a respiratory condition, try to restrict exposure to the very smoky air, which is full of particulates, ash, etc. Emergency Services advisory servicesThe Rural Fire Service 'Fires Near Me[4]' map is useful for both residents and people planning to travel. This map is current within half an hour. Also note that many areas have text fire alerts, so keep your phone handy. IMPORTANT - Travellers take extreme careTravellers please note: If you aren't sure about fire conditions in the areas in which you're travelling, check first. Emergency services are stretched, and it's far too easy to run into a fire zone with no help available. A record bushfire year? Let's hope not. This year's bushfire season is one of the worst in the last nearly 30 years. The drought is the main culprit, but the extreme dry conditions have created fire hazards on a scale rarely seen before. Although our fire services did carry out backburning about 2 months ago, the conditions are perfect for big fires. Sydney is quite literally surrounded by native bush. Sydneysiders love the bush, but it's not like we don't know the risks. During the 90s I was working in a place where we had a clear view of fires to the south. There was a gigantic mushroom cloud over the Royal National Park, looking exactly like an atomic bomb. The entire huge area was devastated. It was miraculous that nobody was killed, and that property damage was minimal. The problem is that this year could actually be worse. This drought is huge, unprecedented, and the fires so far have been big, fast and ferocious. Arson Some cases of arson, mainly by kids, have been reported. This, annoyingly, isn't uncommon, and is the cause of fires every year. The bushfire safety bottom lineThis is basic 'bushfire etiquette': Be ready to move fast if you're anywhere near a fire, like within 20km or if you're downwind of a fire. You will have no more than about an hour at most to get out safely. Try to be ready to move ASAP. Observe fire bans and don't light anything at all outdoors. (If you're a smoker, put the butt in your back pocket to make sure it doesn't start a fire. Serves you right if you didn't put it out properly, doesn't it?)Don't waste emergency services time. Just follow instructions. Tell emergency services if there are mobility-impaired or handicapped people in the area who'll need help to evacuate. Do what you can to assist and tell them about any possible risks. If you want to stay and fight the fire, be realistic. There's only so much you can do. Get the family out and be ready to run if necessary. If you see a suspected arson attack, report it immediately. Call emergency services on 000, and take whatever safety measures you need. Don't take the law into your own hands, tempting as it may be. Staying safe in fire-affected regions: Keep close track of any fires in adjoining areas, which may spread. Keep an eye out for anyone lost or in trouble, and help if you can, or get help for them ASAP.  THE BOTTOM LINE FOR BUSHFIRE SAFETY IS 'STAY SAFE'. JUST DO THAT, AND YOU'LL BE OK.

These big fires are relentlessly destructive. Communities have been shattered, at least 3 people are dead, and several are missing. </p><p> Bushfire reports are typically an ongoing series of events and numbers which keep going up, sometimes for days or weeks. So far the numbers are looking godawful, and the events are often beyond meaningful commentary. You can say 'X houses destroyed, X fires out of control\", and so on, but it barely gives a picture of what's happening. Australian bushfires can make puddles out of cars, obliterate homes in a minute or two, and can race across the country like burning trains at recorded speeds of at up to 125kmh. These fires hit very fast, in some cases, with even locals taken by surprise, and almost no warning but a big tower of smoke almost on the doorstep. Not much is left after these big fires go through. The fast movement also means they're like blowtorches, much hotter in the directions they travel. The heat incinerates extremely quickly. One man now has what is effectively a piece of scorched tin where he had a caravan. Air quality is horrible, and the smoky air looks like you're wearing yellow sunglasses. The basic stats barely tell the story:\u2022 There are 90 major fires in progress\u2022 42 communities in Queensland alone are at serious risk and a formal state of emergency\u2022 Northern New South Wales is in equally severe trouble, Numbers are starting to come in. 150 homes have been destroyed and 2 people have died. \u2022 A little town called Bobin was basically wiped out when even air bombing couldn't stop the fire which hit it. These areas are in the middle of a murderous and very long drought. Water to fight the fires is scarce enough. Economically, these areas were already under severe pressure. The farmers are still working the land as these fires roar past[2]. Tales of survival and miraculous escapes are always welcome, and there are already quite a few. We have another 3-4 months of this to come, and summer hasn't even started yet. With any luck, the Queensland wet season will help to block fire[3]s, but nobody's expecting much but more of the same.New to bushfires? A quick guide to staying out of troubleWe don't have too many 'fire groupies' in Australia. At least, not live ones. These fires are too dangerous to be spectator sports. The people most likely to get into trouble are tourists and people who don't know the risks. So, a few pointers: WHEN IN A BUSHFIRE ZONE:\u2022 DO NOT GET IN THE WAY OF EMERGENCY SERVICES OPERATIONS AT ANY TIME. \u2022 STAY OFF ROADS USED BY EMERGENCY VEHICLES. \u2022 POLICE WILL TELL YOU WHICH ROADS YOU CAN USE. INJURIES\u2022 If someone's injured or suffering from smoke inhalation, call 000 ASAP. Someone will show up to help as soon as they can. \u2022 Water can help with breathing issues. Injured people should only be moved when it's absolutely essential for their safety. (Fractures in particular are very dangerous, and should not be moved at all, if possible.) INSTRUCTIONS FROM EMERGENCY SERVICESFollow instructions from police and emergency services immediately, and go where they tell you to go. Don't waste time or breath on anything but asking them where to go to be safe. When they tell you to 'get out', do it ASAP. You may not get another chance. WHEN A BUSHFIRE'S COMING:\u2022 Even the smell of smoke is a signal to get everyone together and get ready to get out. \u2022 Make sure you know where everyone is at all times, and don't let kids out of your sight for a second.\u2022 Plumes of smoke are sometimes your only warning of big trouble. Get organised and get ready to move out of the area. \u2022 Do NOT approach ANY flames. Don't even think about getting close to them. A small flame could be the start of a 50-metre high wall of fire travelling at about 80kmh, and your chances of survival aren't likely to be good. By the time you turn around, the fire could be on you. Flames are incredibly hot at a surprisingly long range. \u2022 Make sure you can see where you're going when you're on the move. If you can't see, get into a position where you can. The risk is driving straight into the fire. \u2022 Cars are no protection at all against heat from flames. You're in an oven on wheels if you're in a burning area. Do NOT drive through any area where you can't see what's happening. \u2022 Take water with you, preferably at least 2 litres per person. Dehydration is a serious risk, particularly in hot weather above 35-40C. The heat alone can literally take the water out of your lungs, even without a bushfire to help.\u2022 You MIGHT be able to help others who are stuck or can't get away on their own. Whatever you can do, do it, but be very quick about it. \u2022 STAY ALERT. There are emergency service notifications on your phone, online and in the local media. Keep up to date on the situation at all times. Fires can spread in a wide arc beyond their main lines, and can start up new fires miles from the existing fires.You can follow the Twitter feed from the fires on this link[4].
