Home to diverse ethnic groups and local communities, Chiang Rai boasts well-known landmarks such as Phra That Doi Tung, Mae Sai border, the Golden Triangle, Doi Tung development project, Kok and Mekong rivers, hot springs, Doi Mae Salong, Phu Chi Fa, and Wat Rong Khun.</p><p>The province is also a key gateway for trade, investment, tourism and transport within the GMS economic grouping, generating roughly 100 billion baht in GDP and attracting more than 6 million visitors per year. Chiang Rai's vision is to become a 'creative, contemporary tourism city with high-value agriculture and a balanced environment, moving towards sustainability.'</p><p>Natural Disasters</p><p>Despite its strengths, Chiang Rai still faces many challenges. Droughts, floods, landslides, earthquakes and changing weather patterns affect agriculture, daily life and the local economy, especially in tourism and rural communities. The new project aims to help tackle these problems and support sustainable development for both the city and its tourism sector.</p><p>Siripakorn Cheawsamoot, Director of DASTA, said tourism is a leading source of income for Thailand, but it is also one of the most vulnerable sectors to climate change, with Thailand ranked 9th in the world for climate risk.</p><p>Local tourism, community-based tourism and nature tourism are especially at risk from floods, droughts, heatwaves and landslides, which are becoming more common due to climate change.</p><p>This has real impacts on local livelihoods and the continued growth of tourism in Chiang Rai. Thailand's National Adaptation Plan (NAP 2024) recognises tourism as a key sector for climate adaptation.</p><p>However, local capacity to manage these risks remains limited, so there is a pressing need to plan and act. DASTA is working together with the United Nations Industrial Development Organisation (UNIDO) and other partners to develop the 'Building Climate-Adapted Community-Based Tourism and Sustainable Supply Chains in Chiang Rai, Thailand' project.</p><p>This project is designed to boost climate readiness in Chiang Rai tourism through four main steps:</p><p>Gather and use local climate risk data to help plan tourism activities.</p><p>Adapt tourism services and infrastructure using nature-based solutions, seasonal planning and better zoning for high-risk areas.</p><p>Improve and fund tourism value chains to better handle climate impacts.</p><p>Share knowledge, track progress and promote learning at the regional level.</p><p>The project will directly help more than 25,000 people, including over 250 local tourism operators and community groups. It will also support ecosystem conservation, water access and gender equality.</p><p>The project's main focus is on Mae Fah Luang, Mae Chan, Mae Sai and Chiang Saen districts, where tourism has been hit hard by climate-related problems. These areas will become model zones for climate adaptation and sustainable supply chains in tourism.</p><p>Ms Virpi Stucki, Chief of Fair Production, Sustainability Standards and Trade at UNIDO, shared her enthusiasm for the joint initiative, calling it a significant step for all involved.

They are a stark preview of our weather - and world - to come.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The past 10 years have been the hottest on record, and 2024 was the most sweltering of all. Several maximum temperature records have already been broken this summer, including 21 in Ontario on a single day in June. Global climate predictions all but guarantee temperatures will continue to rise in the next five years. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Vulnerable populations, such as the elderly and the very young, people with chronic illnesses, those experiencing homelessness, and anyone with a lack of access to cooling, are particularly at risk.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The key is immediate and international action. In July 2024, the United Nations issued a global call to action on extreme heat, stating the need for a strategy that will mobilize leaders, prevent and reduce heat risk, increase resilience and mitigate the impact of extreme heat. </p><p>To help communities plan and adapt to this hotter reality, many cities around the world, including Athens, Dhaka, Freetown, Los Angeles and Melbourne, have appointed chief heat officers. </p><p>And Mayor Olivia Chow announced earlier this year that Toronto is considering adding a chief resiliency officer.</p><p>As the latest heat dome settles in, here's what you need to know about the risks of extreme heat, what you can expect in the years to come, and how you can be part of the solution. </p><p>How dangerous are heat waves? </p><p>Heat is the world's leading weather-related killer - each year it leads to more deaths than all the other hazards combined. And yet, even though the rates of illness and death are more severe, it isn't talked about in the same way as floods, tornadoes or wildfires. </p><p>There are a few reasons for this, says Caroline Metz, managing director of climate resilience and health at the Intact Centre on Climate Adaptation at the University of Waterloo.</p><p>\"Heat is a silent killer,\" she says. \"Its impact is almost invisible - if you look outside after a heat wave, on the surface everything looks pretty much the same as it did before.\" </p><p>And in colder countries like Canada, there's the added complication of habits and traditions.</p><p>\"Culturally, we tend to think of heat as something positive to look forward to. We think about going to the beach or the cottage or having ice cream,\" she says. </p><p>\"It's hard for us to consider how it could harm us or our families and neighbours, so we underestimate the danger.\" </p><p>How bad could it get </p><p>in years to come? </p><p>Canada is already warming at twice the global rate, a speed that is  projected to intensify and cause more frequent extreme weather events.</p><p>According to Metz, by mid-century, the number of days above 30 C in Canada will jump two to four times what we're used to, our maximum temperatures will increase three to five degrees, and the average length of heat waves will double or even triple. </p><p>On top of that, \"cities will get even hotter because of the way we develop - there's more buildings, more asphalt and fewer trees and vegetation\" says Metz.</p><p>That leads to a phenomenon called the heat-island effect, where urban spaces can be 10 to 15 degrees Celsius hotter than surrounding rural areas. </p><p>These high temperatures can lead to health complications such as dehydration, heat strokes, cardiovascular events, renal failure and more. </p><p>We're often told to stay inside when it's hot, but it's even hotter in my home. Are our buildings part of the problem? </p><p>We need to heatproof our buildings, says Eleni Myrivili, the UN's global chief heat officer.</p><p>Myrivili has the urgent task of helping cities adapt to extreme heat. Before she held this position, she was chief heat officer in Athens, where she worked on an innovative project to help cool the city by tapping into a 24-kilometre Roman aqueduct to irrigate parks and create water features.</p><p>More than most, Myrivili understands the power of leveraging what's already at our disposal, but she also believes that buildings need to be designed to fend off heat in the first place. \"When we didn't have fossil fuels, people built houses based on how they could cool themselves in passive ways, like having a central atrium, lattices, holes in the walls, white walls, white roofs,\" says Myrivili.</p><p>Many of Canada's buildings weren't designed with this hotter climate in mind.</p><p>Retrofitting existing homes and edifices by improving insulation, using external shades and using cool roofing materials can greatly improve their cooling capabilities.</p><p>\"Even a couple of degrees cooler can make an enormous difference,\" she says. </p><p>Why can't we all just get air </p><p>conditioning and call it a day? </p><p>Heat doesn't treat everyone equally - it disproportionately affects the most vulnerable.</p><p>\"If you are upper class or upper-middle class, you can leave the city, you can have air conditioning, you can work in an office,\" says Myrivili. The same isn't true for people who can't afford cooling or who have to work outdoors. </p><p>To make matters worse, air conditioning pushes out heat, exacerbating an already vicious situation.</p><p>\"People then need to use more air conditioning, and people who don't have air conditioning suffer from much more heat,\" says Myrivili. \"We have to figure out how to make the public space cooler so the buildings need less mechanical cooling.\" </p><p>How can technology help us </p><p>adapt to heat waves? </p><p>Forewarned is forearmed, as they say, and labs around the world are working on predicting global warming trends using data analytics.</p><p>\"There are so many things happening through technological innovation,\" says Myrivili. \"In India, for example, there are superlocal solutions that assess in real time which buildings are the hottest at any moment so as to inform people when to move to cooler buildings or parts of the city.\" </p><p>More traditional early warning systems, like the heat alert and response system set up by Environment and Climate Change Canada, are also crucial in protecting residents.</p><p>\"Municipalities will pick up the heat warnings and feed them to their community partners, setting off a series of actions,\" says Metz. \"It helps them figure out how, where and when to open cooling centres and splash pads.\"</p><p>If you're looking for widely available, user-friendly tools, Canadians can sign up for heat alerts through the federal government's app, WeatherCAN, and set custom notifications for high temperatures and humidex. </p><p>I'm just one person, but I'd like to do my part. Where should I start? </p><p>Preparedness is key.</p><p>Illness and death by heat are preventable, and we can be proactive by adapting our indoor environments and working together to protect vulnerable populations, says Metz. Waterloo's Intact Centre has produced free, downloadable infographics that detail actions homeowners and tenants can take to protect themselves against extreme heat. </p><p>Planting trees, installing green roofs and setting up balcony gardens, for instance, can help minimize urban heat islands.</p><p>Installing shading devices like shutters and awnings, using building materials that absorb heat and improving insulation can bring temperatures down.</p><p>And reaching out to neighbours and local residents who might need extra help to remain cool doesn't just improve physical health - it helps foster community.</p><p>\"The risk is just going to increase,\" says Metz.</p><p> \"So we need to be acting now to make that time in the future better, safer, healthier.\" </p><p>To find out more about how experts are working to help us prepare for extreme heat, listen to the latest episode of the MaRS podcast Solve for X: Innovations to Change the World. </p><p>St\u00e9phanie Verge writes about technology for MaRS.

As the CSOs offered clues about emerging trends at large global companies, the Economist's summary of results painted a picture of an informed and aware business community.</p><p>First, for better or worse, survey findings indicated that corporate sustainability behavior may be influenced less by the new U.S. political landscape than by urgent issues affecting companies - namely climate change. The Economist reported that across all three regions surveyed, \"the majority of CSOs \u2026 expect that sustainability will become a higher priority over the next five years as climate impacts set in.\"</p><p>In other words, businesses will likely take action to protect themselves against risks, including those increasingly posed by climate change. In the Asia Pacific (APAC) region, such action in the near term could mean spending to increase renewable sources as a share of their energy procurement. In Europe and the Middle East (EMEA), CSO budgets are expected to prioritize software for ESG data and reporting - which could signal both that tracking emissions is a prudent business practice, and that reliable emissions data is an anticipated requirement for regulatory compliance.</p><p>Across the surveyed group, budgeting for consulting and advisory services remained a top priority, which could signal recognition of the need for robust measurement and reporting, as well as for communicating to stakeholders about sustainability efforts.</p><p>Second, in the U.S., EMEA, and APAC, at least half of the CSOs surveyed expected their companies' emphasis on sustainability to grow in the next five years. The Economist suggested that when it comes to spending, prioritizing ESG could mean a need for more \"climate-smart employees,\" greater investment in employee training on sustainability, and taking on climate adaptation measures.</p><p>Lastly, but of utmost importance, a top priority for multinationals in all regions surveyed was to increase sustainability in the supply chain. This priority may be prompted by anticipated requirements to increase disclosure of Scope 3 emissions in various jurisdictions. Supply chain ambitions could also reflect wider awareness that suppliers pose less risk when they have credible emissions reduction programs and social responsibility credentials.</p><p>Trends in ESG/sustainability reporting and disclosure are the subject of G&amp;A's yearly flagship report on reporting among the Russell 1000\u24c7 universe of large- and mid-cap US corporations.

Historian Adam Tooze describes this phenomenon as a \"polycrisis.\"</p><p>As professionals dedicated to family health and well-being, community capacity and resilience, and public policy, it's critical we understand how these overlapping pressures affect the families we serve, and how we can respond with both urgency and compassion.</p><p>A polycrisis is a tangled web of overlapping crises that feed into, and amplify, one another. This intricate interplay of challenges complicates the management of simultaneous emergencies. Popularized by thinkers like Edgar Morin and Jean-Claude Juncker, it highlights the challenges of managing these stressors' complex situations.</p><p>It is the kind of moment that reshapes lives, tests communities, and forces us to ask hard questions about how we will navigate the future together. These intertwined crises have profound effects on families, disrupting caregiving structures, mental health, economic stability, and cultural connections.</p><p>Across the nation, Canadian families are experiencing localized manifestations of this poly-crisis. In British Columbia, wildfires have ravaged homes and communities, intensifying the trauma of pandemic isolation and shelter in place. In Quebec and Nova Scotia, flooding threatens infrastructure and displaces vulnerable populations, and the cost of home insurance skyrockets. Urban centres face soaring rental costs and food insecurity, placing immense pressure on families who navigate systemic barriers. Indigenous and northern communities grapple with environmental upheaval alongside longstanding health and social service disparities.</p><p>Grasping this intricate reality is vital for developing effective policies and practises. Health, social, housing, and environmental policies must be approached with an integrated perspective, acknowledging that these issues are interconnected. Investments in social infrastructure, such as affordable housing or mental health services, are essential for building community capacity, not just resilience. Frontline workers and educators require adequate protection and resources to support families amid ongoing social and political challenges. Mental health support must recognize the multifaceted grief families endure, including losses related to routine, relationships, and community life.</p><p>The urgency of the situation is clear. We can no longer treat these crises as separate issues. For Canadian families they are intricately linked, creating a complex web that jeopardizes collective well-being. Our policies, social services, and community support must reflect this interconnected reality.</p><p>This necessitates investing in social infrastructure that fosters capacity, not just resilience: affordable housing, accessible mental health care, climate adaptation, and education systems that support every child. We must empower frontline workers, caregivers, and communities with the resources and respect they deserve.</p><p>Most importantly, we must elevate the voices of families who bear these burdens daily. Their lived experiences must guide our responses. Policymakers, community leaders, and citizens must work together towards solutions grounded in equity, justice, and sustainability.</p><p>By embracing this challenge, Canadian families will weather this polycrisis, and emerge stronger, more connected, and better equipped for future challenges.</p><p>Our future depends on it.</p><p>Copyright 2025 Ashcroft Cache Creek Journal</p>", "publisher": "Ashcroft Cache Creek Journal", "instances": ["For Canadian families they are intricately linked, creating a complex web that jeopardizes collective well-being.

Johanna Wagstaffe explains the probability and why determining flood risk, including here in Canada, isn't always straightforward.</p><p><br/><br/>JOHANNA WAGSTAFFE (REPORTER):<br/>How worried are you about flooding? Because you could be living in a flood zone and not even know it. There are flood maps that you could check, but not all of them are up to date, detailed or account for all of the different ways that your home could flood. And older buildings may not have the same building codes as new ones. Here's how to figure out and understand the flood risks in your area. The thing is, it's kind of complicated. This is the river district in Vancouver. And if you were to search for the flood risk here, you'd probably end up with this map, but not every municipality if BC or Canada has a map as up-to-date or as detailed as this one.<br/><br/>ANGELA DANYLUK (CITY OF VANCOUVER CLIMATE ADAPTATION MANAGER):<br/>So, when we look elsewhere in the province, like flooding can come from a whole bunch of different sources, right, extreme rain, like those atmospheric rivers and rivers themselves, and groundwater. And so when we do this flood mapping, there's a whole bunch of different information that cities have to pull from. And so maps are going to look different because of that. It's going to look different because of the local geography and hydrology and also yes the historic record of flooding in that area.<br/><br/>JOHANNA WAGSTAFFE (REPORTER):<br/>Let's say that you find your map in whatever form that it takes. What do the numbers mean? Okay, let's go back to the river district. So flood hazard is often expressed in terms of the likelihood of a given flood event occurring. The areas in red are where we would see a major one in 500-year event. That does not mean that the size of flood will only happen once every 500 years. It actually means that there's a 0.2% chance of a flood that size happening in any given year. So if you're in a one-in-200-year floodplain, that means a 0.5% chance in any given year. and so on. One-in-100, one percent chance and so on. So yeah, sometimes a one-in-100-year flood can happen two years in a row. So why don't flood maps show all these flood risks, all of the different probabilities?<br/><br/>ANGELA DANYLUK (CITY OF VANCOUVER CLIMATE ADAPTATION MANAGER):<br/>It's interesting, like, Vancouver, we're a rainy city. Where are our maps? So engineering is actually mapping those risks now, because of climate change, we are seeing more flooding due to rain in the city of Vancouver. And so we hope to make that information available in the next year or so.<br/><br/>JOHANNA WAGSTAFFE (REPORTER):<br/>These maps take a lot of time and resources to produce, and climate change is stacking the deck in favour of these flood events happening more often. Also, and you knew that there was an 'also,' the flood risk changes each time that there is a flood. And the maps need to be readjusted to account for the changes in the river channel and the floodplain itself. So in the UK or the Netherlands, you can just type in your street address and get a clear picture of what your flood risk looks like. Now, the UK is a lot smaller than Canada but collaboration has started here. Until then, take a moment to Google and understand your current flood risk.<br/><br/>CHRISTINE BIRAK (CBC-TV):<br/>Statistics Canada says as of 2024, 80% of Canadian cities were located in a flood zone.<br/><br/><br/></p>", "publisher": "CBC (Broadcast)", "instances": ["This is the river district in Vancouver.

This perception gap persists despite a record-breaking summer of catastrophic weather events across Canada in 2024, which saw over $7.7 billion in insured losses and a 406% spike in insurance claims compared to the 20-year average2.

The Mendenhall Glacier \u2014 a thinning, retreating glacier that is a major tourist attraction in southeast Alaska \u2014 acts as a dam for a basin that fills each spring and summer with rainwater and snowmelt. The basin itself was left behind when a smaller, nearby glacier retreated.</p><p>When the water in the basin creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier, entering Mendenhall Lake and eventually the Mendenhall River.</p><p>The water level in the basin as of Friday stood at 1,353 feet (412 meters) and continues to rise, said Nicole Ferrin with the National Weather Service. It's just 15 feet (1.5 meters) from topping the ice dam.</p><p>The basin has been rising at an unpredictable rate, so there is no way to pinpoint when water would go over the top, she said.</p><p>\u201cSome days when there's no rain, it only rises by a foot (0.30 meters),\u201d she said. \u201cOther days when there is heavy rain or a lot of sunshine, it rises by 4 feet (1.22 meters), so it's a variable.\u201d</p><p>In some years, there has been limited flooding of streets or properties near the lake or river. But 2023 and 2024 marked successive years of record flooding, with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (0.3 meters) over the prior record set a year earlier, and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley.</p><p>Last year, nearly 300 residences were damaged in the flooding.</p><p>Capital City Fire/Rescue Chief Rich Etheridge warned people to stay away during flood stages because logs and other debris in the river can put would-be rescuers \u201cat extreme peril.\u201d</p><p>Once the water tops the dam, the city will set up a hotline where people can get information.</p><p>A large flood event can release up to 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center.

During last year's flood, the flow rate in the rushing Mendenhall River was about half that of Niagara Falls, the researchers say.</p><p>City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The installation of about 10,000, four-foot (1.2-meter) tall barriers is intended to protect more than 460 properties from flood levels similar to last year, said Nate Rumsey, deputy director with the city's engineering and public works department.</p><p>The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is at the start of what's expected to be a yearslong process of studying conditions in the region and examining options for a more permanent solution.

The event was held in collaboration with Green Light New Orleans, a nonprofit organization focused on providing simple, effective environmental solutions to residents.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Volunteers installed rain barrels at homes in the Hollygrove, Leonidas, and Fontainebleau neighborhoods, areas prone to flooding. The barrels, painted in bright, original designs, serve as practical tools for stormwater management by capturing rainwater, reducing runoff, and helping prevent property damage. Each barrel diverts an estimated 2,220 gallons of water annually from the city's overburdened drainage system.</p><p>\"As we observe the 20th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, we're not just reflecting, we're responding with action,\" said Deanna Rodriguez, president and CEO of Entergy New Orleans. \"This initiative reflects Entergy's commitment to resilience, not just as a company, but as a neighbor - helping families reduce the impact of heavy rainfall.\"</p><p>Laura Jayne, a Hollygrove resident and staff member at Loyola University, had been waiting nearly a year to receive a rain barrel for her home. She welcomed the delivery on Wednesday morning.</p><p>\"I have been wanting to get a rain barrel for a very long time,\" said Jayne. \"Even though I have not experienced extreme flooding, I think the rain barrels are great to help prevent potential flooding.\"</p><p>Since its founding in 2006, Green Light New Orleans has distributed and installed more than 3,000 rain barrels across the city. The barrels not only provide cost savings to residents but also reduce stress on drainage infrastructure and contribute to the city's long-term climate goals.</p><p>\"Entergy has been a partner with Green Light New Orleans since we first started in the wake of Hurricane Katrina and we deeply appreciate this enduring partnership,\" said Dr. Christian Ryan, executive Director at Green Light New Orleans. \"Together, we're working to help New Orleans residents make small changes that have a big impact.\"</p><p>This initiative is part of Entergy's broader commitment to community investment and environmental stewardship. Over the last two decades since Katrina's devastation, Entergy shareholders have invested $95 million to support nonprofit organizations in Orleans Parish while our employees in the area have completed more than 130,000 hours of volunteer service.</p><p>In partnership with Rebuilding Together New Orleans, Entergy will hold another employee-driven Day of Service on Aug. 29, commemorating the 20th anniversary of Katrina. That initiative will focus on home weatherization efforts to improve energy efficiency and lower utility costs for some of the city's most vulnerable residents.</p><p>Through acts of service and community partnership, Entergy continues to honor the past while investing in a safer, more resilient future for New Orleans.</p><p>For more information about Entergy's restoration efforts following Hurricane Katrina, visit entergy.com/Katrina20.</p><p>About Entergy New Orleans</p><p>Entergy New Orleans provides electricity to approximately 209,000 customers in Orleans Parish, Louisiana.

This has been a year of bold moves, agile responses, and powerful collaborations, all aimed at tackling climate challenges head-on and raising the bar for environmental sustainability across the beverage sector. From accelerating climate resilience to setting new benchmarks in industry standards, BIER and its members have turned ambition into action. Now, with the final quarter ahead, BIER is harnessing this momentum to close out the year with impact and step into 2026 on the strongest footing yet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Advancing Technical Guidance</p><p>The year began with the release of Beverage Industry Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Sector Guidance Version 4.3. This update aligned the sector with emerging standards such as the CSRD and SBTi's FLAG guidance, introduced enhanced methodologies for recycling, logistics, and cooling models, and strengthened protocols for data verification and disclosure. Collectively, these updates brought the industry one step closer to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040-2050.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, BIER published the Beverage Industry EUDR Interpretation Guide, a practical, sector-specific resource to help beverage companies navigate the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). With compliance deadlines beginning in late 2025 for larger operators, this guide provided actionable tools for mapping supply chains, assessing and mitigating risk, and integrating EUDR compliance with broader no-deforestation and climate commitments.</p><p>Innovation Through Collaboration</p><p>BIER's Sustainable Coolers Coolition continued to unite members in developing solutions that reduce the environmental impact of cooling systems while safeguarding technical and business performance. This initiative reinforced one of BIER's core commitments: advancing technologies that conserve energy and water without compromising quality or efficiency. In 2025, the Coolition also hosted the Cool Challenge, inviting passionate innovators to revolutionize commercial refrigeration for chilled, canned, or bottled beverages at their point of sale. The challenge pushed boundaries, sparked innovation, and inspired sustainable solutions to shape the beverage industry's future.</p><p>BIER's Charco Bendito Watershed Collaboration in Mexico also delivered tangible results in improving water quality and availability through multi-stakeholder action. In 2025, lessons from Charco Bendito began informing similar efforts in new geographies, demonstrating the scalability of BIER's collaborative water stewardship model.</p><p>Staying Ahead of Regulatory Change</p><p>This year, navigating an evolving regulatory landscape wasn't just a priority; it was a strategic advantage. Through the member-only Regulatory Round-Up and Ad-Hoc sessions, BIER kept members ahead of the curve on global disclosure standards, climate legislation, and emissions reporting expectations, not just tracking changes, but anticipating them. These quarterly sessions became a space for real-time intelligence sharing, where peers compared approaches, decoded new requirements, and identified opportunities to align sustainability ambitions with global expectations. The result? Members left not only informed, but equipped to turn regulatory challenges into catalysts for stronger, more credible sustainability strategies.</p><p>Highlighting Industry Leadership</p><p>Throughout 2025, BIER's Member Spotlight series shone a well-deserved light on the people turning sustainability ambition into measurable action. From Justin Merrell of LION to Ana Fernanda Romero of Diageo, and from Heineken's Nicolas Clerget - Chair of BIER - together with colleagues Hannah Hunt and Jade Mahuzier, to David Grant of PepsiCo - BIER's Co-Chair - each story revealed a unique path to driving environmental progress. Their insights, innovations, and on-the-ground impact showcased the many ways BIER members are translating commitments into results, inspiring peers across the global beverage sector.</p><p>Engaging In-Person for Greater Impact</p><p>In May, BIER members converged in the vibrant city of Sevilla, Spain, for the Spring 2025 Roundtable Meeting, hosted by Heineken at the inspiring Fundaci\u00f3n Cruzcampo. Over three days, the venue buzzed with forward-thinking discussions and collaborative problem-solving. Members dove deep into nature-positive strategies, explored innovative ways to measure water replenishment co-benefits, examined breakthroughs in renewable thermal energy, tackled the challenge of making zero-deforestation claims credible, and celebrated the power of industry coalitions in accelerating progress.</p><p>That momentum now carries into the Fall 2025 Roundtable Meeting, set for September in Louisville, Kentucky. Here, members will tackle another slate of high-priority topics, from discussing best practices for implementing Collective Action projects and utilizing green fertilizer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to essential discussions on how climate adaptation can be a business driver, with the same energy and focus that has defined the year. These sessions aren't just about sharing updates; they're about reinforcing commitments to watershed health, aligning on regulatory strategies, and charting sustainability roadmaps that will ensure BIER's collective voice remains a powerful force shaping the beverage industry's environmental future.</p><p>Looking to the Final Stretch of 2025</p><p>As we move into the year's final months, BIER is channeling the energy and achievements of 2025 into actionable next steps. Our shared focus is clear: finish strong, build resilience, and enter 2026 positioned to lead. With the dedication of our members and the momentum we've built together, the beverage industry is better equipped than ever to deliver on its sustainability promises, for our communities, our ecosystems, and our future. Together, BIER members are closing out 2025 not just with progress, but with a shared vision: a beverage sector that leads the way in building a sustainable future.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/beverage-industry-environmental-roundtable\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/beverage-industry-environmental-roundtable</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/business-and-professional-services/summer-reflections-fall-momentum-biers-2025-achievements-and-the-1063895\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["Members dove deep into nature-positive strategies, explored innovative ways to measure water replenishment co-benefits, examined breakthroughs in renewable thermal energy, tackled the challenge of making zero-deforestation claims credible, and celebrated the power of industry coalitions in accelerating progress.

This is a real, living force that is dramatically changing the world we live in. With increasing temperatures and shifting weather patterns, we are fundamentally changing the ecology and environment of our planet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">These changes will not only have ramifications for the natural world, but they will also have serious impacts on the stability of ecosystems, biodiversity, and human societies around the globe.</p><p>In this article, we'll take a deep dive into how global warming is reshaping the ecology and environment, exploring the causes, consequences, and potential solutions to one of the most pressing challenges of our time.</p><p>Understanding Global Warming and Its Causes</p><p>Global warming is defined as a long-term increase in Earth's average temperature across the climate system, primarily due to the buildup of greenhouse gases- including carbon dioxide (CO2), methane (CH4) and nitrous oxide (N2O)- in the atmosphere. These gases can trap heat from the sun, or the greenhouse effect.</p><p>In the past century, humans have been responsible for extremely high rates of greenhouse gas buildup through activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, industrial pollution, and high-intensity agriculture practices. The result? A planet that is getting warmer and changing rapidly with extreme weather events and disruptions, melting ice caps and glaciers, increasing sea levels, and ecosystem changes.</p><p>Impact on Biodiversity and Species Extinction</p><p>Species extinction is accelerating due to global warming. There are approximately one million animal vertebrate and plant species threatened with extinction, according to the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), many of which have been in decline for decades. It is driven by significant changes in habitats, climate stress, and invasive species in changing ecosystems.</p><p>Coral reefs are host to massive bleaching events due to rising sea temperatures. Coral reefs are biodiversity hotspots, coast protectors, and the foundation of marine food chains. Their decline has huge implications for aquatic species and coastal communities that count on them for food and income.</p><p>Oceanic and Atmospheric Changes</p><p>The oceans are essential for regulating the climate of Earth. However, global warming is causing the oceans to absorb significantly more heat, and it is affecting the oceans chemically by causing ocean acidification and decreasing oxygen levels. These changes are affecting all marine species, from the largest fish to the smallest plankton, and are affecting the global food web.</p><p>Furthermore, melting glaciers and polar regions are causing sea levels to rise, which is putting coastal populations and habitats at greater risk. In addition, as ocean temperatures increase, hurricanes and cyclone events become more intense and more destructive, resulting in increasingly frequent and extreme weather events.</p><p>The atmosphere is similarly affected by climatic extremes. Changes in temperature in different regions are changing the timing and amount of rainfall, resulting in extended droughts in some areas and prolonged flooding in other areas. The climate extremes will have direct effects on agriculture, water availability and public health.</p><p>Forests, Wildfires, and Ecosystem Collapse</p><p>Forests are among the most affected ecosystems when it comes to global warming. Rising temperatures and shifting precipitation patterns are leading to more frequent and intense wildfires. These fires not only destroy vast areas of forest but also release large amounts of carbon into the atmosphere, further fueling global warming in a vicious feedback loop.</p><p>In many regions, forests are struggling to regenerate due to changing climate conditions. This weakens their ability to act as 'carbon sinks', which are natural systems that absorb and store carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, crucial for maintaining the balance of the ecology and environment.</p><p>Human Influence and Environmental Stress</p><p>Human activities are deeply intertwined with ecological change. Urban expansion, industrialization, and infrastructure development are fragmenting habitats and reducing the resilience of ecosystems to climate change.</p><p>Agriculture, which depends heavily on stable weather conditions, is also being disrupted. Crop failures, water scarcity, and soil degradation are becoming more common, threatening global food security. In turn, this can lead to social instability, migration, and conflict over natural resources.</p><p>The most vulnerable communities-particularly those in developing countries-are bearing the brunt of these changes, despite contributing the least to global warming. This raises important questions about 'climate justice', which advocates for the fair treatment of all people and the equitable distribution of climate mitigation resources, regardless of their contribution to the problem.</p><p>Towards a Sustainable Future</p><p>Addressing global warming and its impact on the ecology and environment requires immediate and sustained action at all levels-individual, local, national, and global. Key strategies include:</p><p>Lower greenhouse gas emissions by using cleaner energy approaches (solar, wind, hydro, and nuclear).</p><p>Protect and regenerate natural ecosystems (forests, wetlands, oceans).</p><p>Encourage sustainable agriculture and responsible consumption.</p><p>Invest in climate adaptation and resilience, especially for at-risk areas.</p><p>Create community education programs to inform and engage people about climate change, encouraging them to take action.</p><p>However, much more needs to be done to meet climate goals and prevent further damage to the planet's life-support systems.</p><p>Conclusion:</p><p>The effects of global warming on the ecology and environment are deep, broad and increasing. Changing habitats, species extinction, rising seas and failing ecosystems are just a few consequences already in evidence around the world.</p><p>But through collaboration, scientific advancement and a dedication to living sustainably, we can lessen damage together and try to maintain an ecological balance on Earth for generations to come. The time to act is now - not just to ensure the health of the environment but to ensure the continued existence and health of all life on Earth.</p>", "publisher": "Chiang Rai Times", "instances": ["Protect and regenerate natural ecosystems (forests, wetlands, oceans).

The National Weather Service said it expected flooding to peak at 4 p.m. local time Wednesday.</p><p>\u201cThis will be a new record, based on all of the information that we have,\u201d Nicole Ferrin, a weather service meteorologist, told a news conference Tuesday.</p><p>Basin flooding is an annual concern</p><p>Flooding from the basin has become an annual concern since 2011, and in recent years has swept away houses and swamped hundreds of homes. Government agencies installed temporary barriers this year in hopes of protecting several hundred homes in the inundation area from widespread damage.</p><p>The flooding happens because a smaller glacier near Mendenhall Glacier retreated \u2014 a casualty of the warming climate \u2014 and left a basin that fills with rainwater and snowmelt each spring and summer. When the water creates enough pressure, it forces its way under or around the ice dam created by the Mendenhall Glacier and enters Mendenhall Lake and eventually the Mendenhall River, as it did Tuesday.</p><p>Before the basin reached the limit of its capacity and began overtopping, the water level was rising rapidly \u2014 as much as 4 feet (1.22 meters) per day during especially sunny or rainy days, according to the National Weather Service.</p><p>The city saw successive years of record flooding in 2023 and 2024, with the river last August cresting at 15.99 feet (4.9 meters), about 1 foot (0.3 meters) over the prior record set a year earlier, and flooding extending farther into the Mendenhall Valley. This year's flooding was predicted to crest at between 16.3 and 16.8 feet (4.96 to 5.12 meters).</p><p>Last year, nearly 300 residences were damaged.</p><p>A large outburst can release some 15 billion gallons of water, according to the University of Alaska Southeast and Alaska Climate Adaptation Science Center. That\u2019s the equivalent of nearly 23,000 Olympic-size swimming pools. During last year\u2019s flood, the flow rate in the rushing Mendenhall River was about half that of Niagara Falls, the researchers say.</p><p>Hatch and his wife saw floodwaters lap at their floorboards in 2023, inspiring them to lift their entire house by around 3-4 feet (1 meter). Last year, their neighbors\u2019 homes flooded by around 1 to 4 feet (0.3-1.2 meters).</p><p>A temporary levee is installed</p><p>City officials responded to concerns from property owners this year by working with state, federal and tribal entities to install a temporary levee along roughly 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) of riverbank in an attempt to guard against widespread flooding. The 10,000 \u201cHesco\u201d barriers are essentially giant sandbags designed to protect the neighborhoods completely during an 18-foot (5.5 meter) flood event, said emergency manager Ryan O\u2019Shaughnessy. The barriers are intended to protect more than 460 properties.</p><p>But Hatch fears that if the water crest exceeds predictions, or somehow seeps through, it will actually make flooding at his home worse.</p><p>\u201cIf it gets around the barriers, like, upriver, and flows down, we basically become a bathtub,\u201d Hatch said, adding that he\u2019ll stay behind to move valuables. \u201cMy wife just bought a new mixer.

This unprecedented heat wave, nicknamed \u201cThe Blob,\u201d stretched thousands of kilometres over North America\u2019s western coastal waters, affecting everything from the smallest plankton to the largest marine mammals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Between 2014 and 2016, when this heat wave occurred, water temperatures soared between two to six degrees c above average.</p><p>One would be forgiven for thinking this is no big deal. After all, temperatures fluctuate more than this on land most days. But not so in the ocean, where temperatures are normally much more stable because of the enormous amount of energy it takes to change them.</p><p>Although the duration of this multi-year warming event made it the first of its kind, it offers a glimpse into a future with climate change, where heat waves like this will be more frequent.</p><p>In our newly published systematic review, we synthesized the findings from 331 scientific studies documenting the ecological impacts of this marine heat wave across ecosystems, all the way from Alaska to Baja California.</p><p>Our results offer a stark warning for how profoundly ocean life can be upended by heat waves that are now a dominant signature of climate change.</p><p>Species on the move One of the most common responses to this extreme event was that marine species moved into places where they are not normally found as they searched for cooler water. Most headed north.</p><p>In total, we identified 240 species that were found outside of their normal ranges. More than 100 of these were found further north than they had ever been recorded before, with some moving up to 1,000 kilometres.</p><p>These species on the move included everything from fish and invertebrates to seabirds and marine mammals. But species don't all have the same discomfort level with warm water, and some species are more mobile than others so.marine communities didn't simply pick up and move together to avoid the heat.</p><p>Instead, marine heat waves like this one are causing a massive reorganization of ocean life, as new predators, prey and competitors intermingle for the first time. The newcomers have the potential to alter food webs and displace local species with far-reaching consequences.</p><p>Heatwave effects on linked species and fisheries One of the key lessons from this heat wave is that impacts on one species can have effects that ripple throughout entire ecosystems. For example, the shifting availability of key forage fish like anchovies and sardines contributed to mass die-offs of starving seabirds and whales.</p><p>Warm, nutrient-poor waters also triggered unprecedented blooms of toxic algae. This led to the closure of Dungeness crab fisheries on the West Coast that cost local economies tens of millions of dollars.</p><p>Widespread ecological disruption The marine heat wave also transformed coastal habitats, including kelp forests and seagrass beds. Kelp forests, sometimes called rainforests of the sea, were impacted along several thousand kilometres of coastline.</p><p>In some cases, local extinctions of these habitats have persisted for years following the event, with sustained impacts on the critters that rely on them. We still don't know whether these changes represent permanent losses or whether any of these ecosystems will be able to recover.</p><p>Diseases flourished in the warmer waters. The previously abundant sunflower sea star was hit particularly hard. Warmer waters likely increased the susceptibility of this species to an ongoing epidemic. This led to losses severe enough to have it listed as a critically endangered species.</p><p>Similarly, increases in seagrass disease contributed to declines in the health and abundance of the habitats these plants create.</p><p>Preparing for warmer water Our review highlights how we are unprepared to respond to these challenges in real time.</p><p>With marine heat waves becoming more prevalent, we need to prepare for what is coming. Climate models indicate that these events will only get stronger as greenhouse gas emissions continue to warm our planet.</p><p>Global ocean temperatures have continued to rise over the decade since The Blob, with several years since being declared the hottest on record in the ocean, only to be surpassed the following year.</p><p>Actions such as restoring lost habitat or reducing additional stressors, like overfishing, may help ecosystems cope with some of these shocks. However, these benefits may be limited and offer only a temporary solution to a problem that is worsening.</p><p>Our review demonstrates how unpredictably these heat waves can unfold across marine ecosystems and how widespread their impacts can be.

This isn\u2019t a rap song, this is a revolution.\u201d</p><p>She and her sister Khanzadi campaign on the ground and social media, protesting, visiting villages, and planting thousands of trees.

It is embedded in corporate sustainability, supply chains, and ESG mandates.<br/>- Finance is a critical enabler, with calls for creative, localized funding models and stronger integration into ESG and investment frameworks.<br/>- Collective action is essential but complex, requiring trust, transparency, and local ownership to succeed.<br/>- Communication matters-simplifying language and storytelling are vital to engaging stakeholders, driving action and breaking out of echo chambers.<br/>- Policy frameworks must catch up, with stronger integration of water into climate adaptation plans and global governance. Scalable impact will come from localized solutions, backed by strong partnerships between government, business, and finance<br/>- AWS Standard Version 3.0 introduces streamlined requirements, deeper integration of climate and biodiversity, and new expectations for collective action and water reuse.</p><p>As the climate crisis intensifies and biodiversity loss accelerates, water stewardship is emerging not just as a sustainability imperative-but as a strategic, economic, and social necessity. At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.</p><p>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay &amp; Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.</p><p>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:</p><p>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point</p><p>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.</p><p>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.</p><p>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"</p><p>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking</p><p>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health. This means moving beyond isolated site-level actions and embracing basin-scale collaboration, shared data, and nature-based solutions.</p><p>The updated AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this evolution, emphasizing healthy freshwater ecosystems and catchment-level resilience. The message was clear: stewardship must be credible, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact-not just short-term optics.</p><p>\"Watershed health is our indicator-are we moving the needle?\"</p><p>3. Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence</p><p>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.</p><p>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"</p><p>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact</p><p>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.</p><p>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"</p><p>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice</p><p>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.</p><p>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"</p><p>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice</p><p>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.</p><p>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"</p><p>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps</p><p>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.</p><p>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"</p><p>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship</p><p>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0. Some of the key changes in the draft include:</p><p>- Streamlined Requirements: The total number of requirements has been reduced by 32 in comparison to V2.0, improving clarity and auditability while maintaining rigor.<br/>- Climate and Biodiversity Integration: New emphasis on catchment-based climate resilience and the protection of Healthy Freshwater Ecosystems and Biodiversity.<br/>- Collective Action as a Differentiator: Now a requirement exclusively for Gold certification, reinforcing its importance in achieving meaningful impact.<br/>- Improved Alignment with ESRS: Enhanced interoperability with the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) on Water and Marine Resources (E3).<br/>- Focus on Innovation: Greater attention to water reuse, desalination, and their correlated impacts.</p><p>This evolution of the AWS Standard signals a shift toward more practical, scalable, and outcome-oriented stewardship-one that aligns with both business realities and ecological imperatives.</p><p>9. What's Next: From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems of Change</p><p>The closing message of the forum was both a challenge and an invitation: we must break out of our echo chambers. That means amplifying underrepresented voices, especially from the Global South and Indigenous communities. It means building bridges across sectors, geographies, and disciplines. And it means embracing water not just as a resource to manage-but as a foundation for resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.</p><p>Final Thoughts</p><p>The AWS Forum made one thing abundantly clear: water stewardship is no longer a niche concern. It is a global imperative that touches every sector, every community, and every future. As we move forward, let's remember that water connects us all-and that credible, collective action is our most powerful tool for change.</p><p>Stay tuned for more to come from our Global Water Working Group, including an upcoming podcast on the interconnection between water stewardship and climate resilience.

The Mojave Groundwater Bank is located at the base of a 2,000-square-mile watershed in California's Mojave Desert, where a naturally replenished aquifer holds an estimated 30-50 million acre-feet of groundwater-more than what's currently stored in both Lake Mead and Lake Powell combined.</p><p>\"This isn't just a water project-it's a blueprint for climate adaptation and social equity,\" said Susan Kennedy, CEO of Cadiz. \"For too long, infrastructure investments have bypassed the communities most vulnerable to water insecurity. We're changing that-using smart technology, unused pipelines, and deep partnerships with Tribal Nations to build a system that works for everyone.\"</p><p>The Mojave Groundwater Bank is the largest water infrastructure project in the Southwest in decades and the first large-scale project of its kind led in partnership with Tribal Nations off tribal lands. The Lytton Rancheria Tribe of Northern California was the first to commit investment, pledging up to $50 million toward the project. Additional Tribal Nation collaborations are in progress, creating a unique ownership model that helps ensure long-term access and equity for historically excluded communities.</p><p>A critical component of the project is its use of 180 miles of repurposed steel pipeline from the decommissioned Keystone XL oil project-an innovative move that reduces cost, timeline, and environmental disruption. Instead of building new infrastructure, Cadiz is cleaning and reinforcing existing fossil fuel pipelines to transport water from the Mojave Desert to communities across California's Inland Empire and Arizona.</p><p>\"Water scarcity isn't just about supply-it's about broken infrastructure,\" Kennedy said. \"The same regions that lack access to safe, affordable water are the ones that were pushed out of the system generations ago. This project is about righting that historic wrong while future-proofing our water grid.\"</p><p>In total, the Mojave Groundwater Bank will create 350 miles of pipeline connectivity, 2.5 million acre-feet of supply and storage capacity, and deliver water to some of the most climate-impacted areas in the Southwest. It is also permitted to store up to 1 million acre-feet of imported supplies, providing critical relief for the overstressed Colorado River and Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta systems.</p><p>The aquifer beneath Cadiz Ranch replenishes from rainfall in the High Desert and has the capacity to sustainably deliver 50,000 acre-feet of water per year for at least 50 years-enough to serve more than 400,000 people annually. With extreme climate events like atmospheric rivers, floods, and wildfires becoming the new normal, projects like this are essential to ensuring water security for generations to come.</p><p>About Cadiz<br/>Cadiz is a water solutions innovator based in Los Angeles, committed to delivering safe, reliable, and affordable water to underserved communities across California and the American Southwest.
