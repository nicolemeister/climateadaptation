In addition, Key Carbon's subsidiary, EU Soil Carbon Corp, will fund the expansion of InSoil's carbon farming business, which provides farmers with further technical and financial support in implementing regenerative practices.</p><p>\"As farmers across Europe face headwinds from climate change and global regulatory dynamics, financial and agronomic support from projects like these are critical to achieving the systemic shifts that achieve real impact in carbon sequestration and a more resilient food system that doesn't leave the stewards of our lands in the dust,\" said Laimonas Noreika, CEO of InSoil. \"Through this agreement with Key Carbon, we will be able to reach more farmers, accelerate climate-positive outcomes, and deliver the kind of high-integrity credits the carbon market increasingly demands. As institutional interest in nature-based solutions continues to grow, our work with Key Carbon will represent a model for blending sustainable finance with climate impact, and turning soil into both a climate solution and a revenue stream for European farmers.\"</p><p>Luke Leslie, CEO of Key Carbon, said: \"Corporate appetite for carbon credits is increasingly shifting towards high-integrity, removal-based and localised solutions to meet the evolving compliance standards. Our partnership with InSoil will provide increased access to funding for farmers, enabling the transition to regenerative agriculture and growing Key Carbon's supply of high-quality carbon credits. With its deep agronomic expertise and strong local networks, InSoil is uniquely positioned to deliver meaningful environmental outcomes and ensure the integrity of carbon credit generation. The partnership will also provide Key Carbon with access to millions of hectares of European farmland with the potential to deliver additional biodiversity monitoring.\"</p><p>With conventional agriculture accounting for more than 20% of global emissions and soil seen as a critical carbon sink, this collaboration aims to unlock funds that help farmers generate high-quality, nature-based carbon credits that are scientifically validated and third-party verified in alignment with the EU Carbon Removals Certification Framework (CRCF). As farmers transition to practices that align with regenerative agriculture principles (those that increase biodiversity, build soil health, and improve water cycles, resulting in more carbon drawdown and greater resilience to extreme weather events), InSoil's Measurement, Reporting, and Verification (MRV) framework is deployed to ensure accurate, transparent, and high-integrity carbon credit generation. These approaches include laboratory-grade soil sampling, advanced remote sensing technologies, expert agronomic assessments, and additional data-driven methodologies.</p><p>While InSoil's private debt arm has already deployed over  80 million in financing to over 3,000 farmers, this funding from Key Carbon will enable European farmers to regenerate their lands; benefit from diversified revenue opportunities through carbon credit generation; and establish productive and profitable agricultural operations into the future.</p><p>Cobaltand Abatable advised InSoil on the transaction.

The skies are sprawling and it's mostly sunny. They haven't seen much rain lately. The earth is dry and there's not much left for the cattle to graze. A few hours northeast, drought conditions are even worse, pushing the municipality of Big Stick to declare a local state of emergency. Corinne Gibson is the owner and manager of Six Mile Ranch, and Aubrey Reban is also a farmer joining us. Good morning to you both.</p><p><br/><br/>AUBREY REBAN: Morning.<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Good morning.<br/><br/>DM: Corinne, those are your cows that we heard off the top there. Tell us more about the drought conditions on your farm.<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Yes, well, we are facing our eighth year of drought here in southern Saskatchewan at the Six Mile Ranch. This year is possibly the worst year that we have lived through, and my husband and I have been owning and operating this ranch for 33 years now.<br/><br/>DM: Boy. What's that meant for your operations then, and for your cattle?<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Well, it's meant a lot of hard times, really. The cattle industry right now is seeing, you know, unprecedented high prices, which is helping, and we're very blessed for that. But we have had to downsize, obviously, and make a lot of changes in our management.<br/><br/>DM: How does the drought impact the cows in particular?<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Well, I mean, it's very hard on their condition. Luckily, we raise pretty hardy cattle, and we try to keep the most efficient ones. And that's one thing that we have seen, you know, over this eight-year span of drought is, man, have we ever selected for those easy fleshing hardy cattle.<br/><br/>DM: What are they eating?<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Well, I mean, there's still residual grass. This year, there was a lot of grass from last year. We pride ourselves on sustainability and we try to keep a stand of grass every year. So the older grass does have some nutrients. There's a small amount of green grass, but we are moving them constantly.<br/><br/>DM: And moving them off your farm as well, I understand.<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Yes. Well, in early May, we realized we were going to have an issue, so we made plans. And we have sent 200 herds so far to the Weyburn area, which is, you know, three hours away or, you know, about 300 kilometres away from us here on the ranch.<br/><br/>DM: Boy. So Aubrey, let me bring you into this conversation. How has the drought been impacting your farm? What have you experienced?<br/><br/>AUBREY REBAN: Yeah, I would say it's very similar. You know, if you go back eight years, you can start to see, you know, a really big deficit in our rainfall. We're further north in the province, so we, I think we've been getting more moisture. You know, if we go back to 2021, that was kind of our epiphany year or a high year where we decided, you know what, we don't ever want to do this again. It was so, it was so bad that we couldn't find straw. There was no, you know, whatever was coming out the back of combines was just powder and dust, and we couldn't actually even process or bail it or collect it in any fashion. So it was, and we don't usually feed straw. We usually feed, you know, higher quality forages like green feed or hay, but that wasn't an option. We'd already bailed every slough bottom in the RM basically, and there just wasn't enough there. So.<br/><br/>DM: You took a pretty dramatic step then, didn't you, Aubrey?<br/><br/>AUBREY REBAN: Yeah, yeah. I mean, we actually are situated right on the edge of the North Saskatchewan River here, and we see all this water, this great resource flowing east, and we said, hey, we've got to tap into this, and we've got to, you know, mitigate this chance of this happening ever again to us. So we said we're going to put in an irrigation system. Yeah.<br/><br/>DM: And what did that mean financially?<br/><br/>AUBREY REBAN: Oh, it's massive. It's a multi-generational expenditure. You definitely don't pay that off in a couple of years. So it's something we decided was going to make us sustainable as, you know, at Reban Farms here for the next generation to come.<br/><br/>DM: Put me in the head of a farmer, though, Aubrey. I mean, that's got to be scary to take on multi-generational debt.<br/><br/>AUBREY REBAN: For sure, for sure. But you know what, as farmers, we are used to debt. That's how we operate. I mean, we run a grain farm, and every year, we bet the bank that we're, you know, we put everything we've got into the ground, and then we sit back and we pray that it's going to rain so that we can recapture our inputs. So it's something that we're used to, but we certainly did do a lot of calculations and get a lot of advice. Yeah.<br/><br/>DM: Corinne, what have you been hearing from farmers across your part of the province about how the drought is affecting them? And are there many that are considering such a huge investment like Aubrey with the irrigation system?<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Well, we sure would like to have that opportunity. We don't have a large water source the way Aubrey does. So, you know, for many of us, that simply isn't an option. I know there are a few people who have tried some irrigation projects in the past with smaller water sources, such as springs or wells, but we just don't have that option here in Southern Saskatchewan for the most part. But, you know, we have looked into it. And like Aubrey said, it's a multi-generational debt. And if the opportunity came to some farmers around here, they certainly would. I think one of the scariest things right now is like I am hearing from neighbours and family in the areas that, you know, if things don't turn around soon, They don't know how much longer they can hang on. We're lucky here at Six Mile Ranch. I mean, we're able to hopefully, hopefully weather this storm, but it's desperate.<br/><br/>DM: What kind of toll does that take on you personally and on your family, Corinne?<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Well, it's been very challenging. I mean, I have three grandchildren. They're the fifth generation here at Six Mile. And the oldest is six, and they haven't even seen rain. So if it rains here, they're out there, like they're out there just like, what is this, you know? So that's how hard it's been. You know, the mental toll on farmers and ranchers is challenging because we do everything we can. We're businessmen. I know people think maybe otherwise, but we are businessmen and women. So we do plan, we do everything we can to safeguard our operation, but we do have that factor that is out of our control.<br/><br/>DM: And Aubrey, what about you? Again, when you talked about taking on that debt, I'm thinking about your grandchildren there. I mean, what kind of toll is it taking on your family right now?<br/><br/>AUBREY REBAN: You know, honestly, it's a lot easier now because we have, you know, some sustainability and, you know, we're guaranteed food for our animals. You know, as long as the power is running and I can run pumps, you know, I've always got feed now, and that's what we wanted. We wanted to go through that drought situation again where we couldn't physically find feed anywhere in the province. So it's been a lot easier for us. That's for sure. But I mean, yeah, go ahead.<br/><br/>DM: Yeah, I was just going to tell Corinne that we reached out to Saskatchewan's agricultural minister. They weren't available this morning, but last week, the provincial and federal governments announced new support through the Saskatchewan Crop Insurance Corporation. How helpful will a program like that be for you?<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Well, that's an interesting question. It certainly does help, and we do appreciate it. It will allow the local farmers to basically write off their crops sooner and make those crops available to us ranchers and cattlemen to use as feed. You know what, it still doesn't help us that much because we still as cattlemen, it helps the farmers. It really does, and we appreciate it. But then the farmers, you know, charge us to come in and take the feed off. So we're still paying for feed that, honestly, we should be producing ourselves. So it does help and we're appreciative, but it's just a drop in the bucket, really, of what we're looking at. We're looking at buying feed for, you know, all 650 herd of our cows plus their caps.<br/><br/>DM: And so you've reduced the number of your herd. Are you going to keep on reducing, Corinne?<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Well, we're kind of at the threshold where we feel, you know, we need to run this many cattle to service our debt and to, you know, keep our operation thriving and growing. But yes, we are having planning meetings. In fact, we'll have another one this morning that perhaps we'll have to downsize more. In 2021, as Aubrey said, we had a, you know, that was a devastating year province-wide, and we did reduce 300 herd. We had a large sale then. That might be in our future this fall.<br/><br/>DM: Aubrey, I'm looking at the forecast here in your area and there's still a lot of sun. Do you think, I mean, again, you've got the irrigation now, but do you think rain would make a difference to your neighbours and can it help at this point?<br/><br/>AUBREY REBAN: Oh, 100%. 100%. And don't get me wrong, like we don't have every, you know, acre irrigated. We still have all our pastures which aren't irrigated and all our hay land as well. So yeah, we definitely love to see rain in the forecast. It's a huge, you know, benefit when a rain cloud comes over and drops an inch of rain. And, you know, it doesn't change instantly. It takes a couple weeks for things to start, get kickstarted again and get growing again. But no, our livelihood depends on rain no matter what. So anytime it comes over, it just makes it a lot easier on, like you said, the mind and the body.<br/><br/>DM: Last question to you, Corinne. I just wonder, I mean, you mentioned fifth-generation farming. What are you thinking about the future of your farm and the future of your kids' farming?<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Well, I hope we've given them enough foundation here that, you know, we can weather the storm as per se or weather the drought. But I mean, I think the mental toll is challenging. You know, my son and my daughter and her husband are here, and they put in long, hard hours. And just when the cattle market turned, now we're faced with this drought. And it's quite devastating here, to tell the truth. So I mean, we haven't received, we've received maybe an inch, a little over an inch of rain since April. So that is extremely challenging. But I am still hopeful for the future. You know, we sit down and we plan and we make strategies. We'll take advantage of every opportunity that comes our way. And, you know, we've even considered perhaps buying land in a different part of the province where they do receive more plentiful rain. I mean, that would be difficult, but I mean, we want to keep going for the next five generations. So.<br/><br/>DM: I'm glad to hear that hope in your voice. Farmers are, if nothing, resilient. Thank you both for joining us, and I hope there's some clouds and rain in your future.<br/><br/>CORINNE GIBSON: Thank you.<br/><br/>AUBREY REBAN: Awesome.<br/><br/>DM: Corinne Gibson is the owner and manager of Six Mile Ranch, and Aubrey Reban is the Owner of Reban Farms. Blain Hjertaas has farmed in southeastern Saskatchewan for the last 50 years. His son has taken over their century-old farm, and that gives Blain time to work with other farmers through organizations such as Farmers for Climate Solutions. He's helping them become more resilient to the changing climate. Blain is in Redvers, Saskatchewan, near the Manitoba border. Good morning.<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Good morning, Duncan.<br/><br/>DM: What goes through your head, Blain, when you listen to what farmers like Corinne and Aubrey are going through?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: My sympathy goes out. There is nothing more psychologically hard to deal with than a drought because you don't think it will ever end. It's just on every day. Every day, the sun shines and the wind blows and it gets drier. You see the grass turning brown, and it's very difficult to deal with. So my heart goes out to them.<br/><br/>DM: You're speaking from experience there, Blain. I mean, you faced a drought 30 years ago, and that led to an epiphany for you. What happened then?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Well, what I started to learn was that the only way we can become truly resilient is to make our soil healthier. And so we have to be putting carbon back in, sequestering more carbon. Traditionally, agriculture has lost carbon. The tillage and some of the other practices that we do have tended to remove a lot of tillage, some of the grazing practices that have been done. I was very excited to hear Corinne saying she was moving cows because what we have to get back to is a system like the bison when they moved across the prairie. They weren't static. They continued to move across tightly in herds.<br/><br/>DM: And putting more manure into the land, correct?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Absolutely. So they consume the grass and deposit the manure right behind again. So it was plant-ready material.<br/><br/>DM: So when you started looking at the soil that your grandfather had passed on to you, what did you see 30 years ago?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Well, when my grandfather started 110 years ago, we had approximately 12% organic matter soil on our farm. After my grandfather, my father and myself before I smartened up, in many places, that was worked down to 2%. So we had lost 10% organic matter. And I said, this can't work. So I said, we have to start doing something different. And so over the last 30 years now, we've built some of that back up to 6 and 7% organic matter.<br/><br/>DM: The term for this, I understand, is regenerative farming. So how does that work on a big high-tech industrial farm in this day and age?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Well, it becomes a little more difficult because the key word is change. So what we have to do is basically, there's five very simple principles, they're universal, how the practices happen on each farm or ranch. But we just basically have to capture more sunshine, keep the land covered with plant material, littre, we call it. We have to have more diversity. And we need to disturb the soil less, whether that's from overgrazing or tillage or whatever. And then ideally, we would incorporate animals into the system.<br/><br/>DM: Explain that to me. You've got to grow more green plants, is that right?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Yes. So if you think about growing wheat or canola, we're only capturing sunshine for about 60, maybe 80 days of the year. We have the potential here to capture sunshine for 260 days. And really, the purpose of capturing the sunshine is for the plants to photosynthesize. They send root exudates down. The sugars go down into the roots, and they actually leak out what's called exudates, which feed the microbes, and it's the microbes that feed the plant. There's a complex system under there of signaling. And so these microbes then bring the food material back, the nutrients, the boron, the zinc, the copper, the nitrogen, all the things the plant needs. And in the process of doing that, they start to glue the soil particles together, which is called aggregation. And that, that reduces the compaction in the soil, which allows more water, more air, the soil to become more like a sponge. So when it does rain, the moisture will go in instead of running off and it will be held longer.<br/><br/>DM: You're talking about going old school here, aren't you?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Well, not really. I think it's new school. I think our great grandfathers understood this. But if you look at the history of agriculture, for 10,000 years, we've destroyed land and moved on. And now, we're to the point where there's nowhere to move to. So we need to really think about how we do agriculture and start to become regenerative. There's no place on earth, to my knowledge, that we haven't been able to fix by practicing regenerative agriculture. So that's pretty cool.<br/><br/>DM: And so if you saw, you know, your soil on your farm kind of come back to life again when you started practicing this, you mentioned how hard it is to get to make change happen. So should governments be supporting farmers to and incentivizing farmers to change their ways?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Maybe. I don't know. I always get nervous when governments start to do things for us.<br/><br/>DM: But what are farmers saying? What are farmers saying when you make your pitch to them?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Well, many, I probably work with a hundred different farmers in Saskatchewan and Manitoba primarily, and most of them, once they understand, they begin to make changes. And I'll just share my farm as an example. We have approximately 800 acres that my son runs now, but we've increased production two and a half times over those 30 years. So really, our farm is a 2000-acre farm. We're producing as much as the conventional farm on 2000 acres would on 800 acres.<br/><br/>DM: Just wrapping up, Blain, I just want, I mean, I wonder what's at stake for those of us who rely on you farmers to produce food. What are we looking at here?<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: Well, I think if we don't become more resilient, we're going to be more prone to drought. We saw issues with COVID with the food distribution system. You know, if we had a major, major drought across, you know, it's, you know, it's a fairly major one right now, but there still is areas that are relatively wet and are going to produce a lot of food this year. But, you know, I think it does have consequences for society.<br/><br/>DM: Okay. Blain, thank you very much for sharing your expertise and your thoughts today.<br/><br/>BLAIN HJERTAAS: You're very welcome. Thank you.<br/><br/>DM: Blain Hjertaas is a farmer in Saskatchewan. He works with Farmers for Climate Solutions.

Healthy soil is not only more productive but also resilient to droughts and floods, reducing the risks for farmers and stabilizing crop yields. These practices can also enhance the soil's ability to sequester carbon, turning farms into carbon sinks rather than sources of emissions. Regenerative agricultural practices not only mitigate the climate crisis in the first place, but can also help improve farmer crop yield, increase income, and provide a buffer to climate shocks.</p><p>However, the transition to regenerative agriculture is not without challenges. The shift often comes with financial and administrative burdens, especially for smallholder farmers who are pioneering these new practices. Farmers may need to invest in new machinery, seeds for cover crops, and time to learn new techniques as well as provide evidence of their climate impact - all of which come with financial inputs. Applying for grants, loans, or subsidies to support the transition can also be time-consuming and complex, placing an additional burden on farmers already juggling the day-to-day demands of running their farms. These challenges pose barriers to widespread adoption.</p><p>In 2021, the Cisco Foundation committed US$100 million over 10 years to fund nonprofit grants and impact investing in climate solutions. Across the Foundation, we apply a multi-sector approach across all our sector areas to create a world of equitable, resilient, and empowered communities contributing to a regenerative climate future. Meet four Cisco Foundation partners that are paving the way for regenerative agricultural practices to happen more efficiently, equitably, and at greater scale.</p><p>One Acre Fund: Climate resilience for Sub-Saharan African farmers</p><p>The majority of people living in poverty around the globe are smallholder farmers in Sub-Saharan Africa, who are increasingly caught between two of this century's defining challenges: extreme poverty and climate change. In Africa, these challenges are mutually reinforcing - farmers in poverty, lacking other income avenues, often resort to deforestation, land conversion, nutrient mining, and other unsustainable practices to survive. Over time, these actions degrade the environment, worsen climate change, lead to yield declines and higher risk to frequent shocks like floods and droughts. This cycle can devastate harvests, leaving smallholders without enough food for their families.</p><p>One Acre Fund (1AF) provides farmers with financing, training, and supplies to transform their harvests through a climate strategy focused on adaptation (building resilience to climate shocks) and mitigation (sustainably increasing yields and protecting resources). The strategy is based on four pillars: maximizing plant health; building soil fertility; crop and income diversity; and providing safety nets. The Cisco Foundation has supported 1AF to pioneer a new, tech-enabled approach to the data collection needed to drive this work forward at scale: remote sensing (RS).</p><p>RS technology is poised to significantly improve 1AF's ability to efficiently access and leverage robust and accurate data, enabling deepened climate resilience and impact for Africa's smallholder farmers. For example, RS data can increase the accuracy of insurance products, ensuring that farmers' investments are protected when their crops are lost to climate shocks. 1AF is using this technology to offer farmers precise field-level guidance on seed type, planting times, soil maintenance, and more, generating better results than current district-level guidance.</p><p>Mad Agriculture: Supporting Regenerative farmers in the United States</p><p>Founded in 2018, Mad Agriculture takes a holistic approach to helping farmers in the United States thrive in regenerative organic agriculture. The organization's mission is to create a regenerative revolution in agriculture, envisioning a world where land, sea, and people flourish together. Mad Agriculture offers a suite of services that help farmers and ranchers overcome technical, financial, and market barriers, and lifting their stories of success and challenge into wider society to spark cultural change.</p><p>To succeed, farming and ranching must be done in harmony with nature and the greater ecosystem. This can both reduce conventional farming's negative impact on the land and enhance the farm ecosystem, while ensuring the people involved are thriving. This agricultural revolution takes time and must be lasting, requiring more capital to address inequitable wealth distribution. Mad Agriculture engages with essential questions: What does the land need? How can agroecosystems be designed to honor people and place?

They were thinking about a business idea and they wondered, \u2018well why hasn\u2019t anyone done this yet?\u2019\u201d said Rehman. \u201cThey started looking into it and they found that it has been done in Europe and in the U.S., but that it hasn\u2019t been done in a way that helps the farmers themselves rather than just the big corporations.\u201d</p><p>With an idea underway, Rehman said the group got to work by building their plan and reaching out to as many farms as possible to see how many were already implementing some sort of sustainable agricultural practices.</p><p>\u201cWe talked to about 30 or so farmers in southern Ontario and found that only 19 per cent of the farms were implementing some sort of sustainable agriculture, but that they weren\u2019t going full scale,\u201d he said.</p><p>Rehman said they\u2019re now looking for farmers who are new to regenerative practices or have been considering working them into their operations. The ideal candidate are grain farmers working on sandy loam soil who can provide a 10 by 10 metre plot of land, in use or not, for the pilot study.</p><p>\u201cWe\u2019ll come and do soil tests to look at the carbon and nitrogen in the soil so that we have a baseline that is based on what their current practices are, then we\u2019re going to take those 10 by 10 metre plots and start implementing some of those non-invasive regenerative practice,\u201d he said. \u201cSo If they are already doing something like cover cropping, then we\u2019ll look at how much they till, and if we reduce the amount of tillage, can we keep the carbon in the soil? Each farm will basically have a customizable plan based on what they are or not already doing and so the practices are going to look different for each of the farms involved.\u201d</p><p>He said that the farmers involved won\u2019t have to worry about a thing. The group will provide free regenerative agriculture consultation and testing, free soil health tests, and all additional labour, equipment and input costs will be covered.</p><p>\u201cThe biggest incentive here is that we will cover everything and the farmers won\u2019t have to worry about anything, especially during the pilot test, which will run from September 2025 to April 2026,\u201d said Rehman. \u201cIn addition to that they will have priority access to the first carbon credits that we are going to be selling. So in our business model, we\u2019re going to be splitting the profits 50/50, and whatever share CarbFarm gets, will actually be reinvested back into expanding the program. As far as when the profits could come in, that could be starting in year one or in year five, it just depends where the carbon markets are because they\u2019re currently very slow, so it may take some time.\u201d</p><p>Understanding that this is something that could later expand throughout the rest of Ontario and even Canada, Rehman said it was important to have a knowledgeable team in place.</p><p>\u201cWe are a team of six people. Currently, we have two consultants who started CarbFarm and are helping us. We also have one researcher based out of the University of Guelph; she is amazing and she\u2019s really been our go to person. We\u2019re also planning to get another researcher as well,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re really trying to make sure that we build up the knowledge base that is needed for something like this. In terms of revenue stream, four of our team members all went to Ivey and they really understand what\u2019s happening with the credits. Currently we\u2019ve been following what Farm Credit Canada is doing in terms of their investments, and we are also following whatever is happening with Indigo and Microsoft as well.\u201d</p><p>For those who may be interested in participating in the pilot study, they can email Rehan at <email normalizedValue=\"mailto:mmuneebu@uwo.ca\">mmuneebu@uwo.ca</email>, or call 226-386-3313.

The Company is currently securing partners for a 5-year offtake agreement covering up to 100,000 tonnes per year of high-durability biochar carbon credits, undergoing alignment review with Alberta's TIER Protocol with )100-year permanence and also available on the Voluntary Carbon Market. * Technology Innovators Biochar tech companies offering mobile or modular pyrolysis systems for on-farm biomass conversion. Ideal partners enable field-level biochar deployment, turning agricultural waste into long-term carbon storage. This also supports seamless integration with MRV systems, enabling full traceability, auditability, and credit issuance across distributed farm sites. * Corporate ESG Leaders Community-Rooted Climate Partners - Companies looking to support circular, community-driven climate solutions. These partners can co-fund biochar deployment, purchase branded or unbranded carbon credits, or co-invest in regenerative agriculture infrastructure with measurable social impact, Indigenous engagement, and long-term carbon outcomes tied to Alberta-based projects.</p><p>\"We're already working with over a dozen farms in Alberta and we've verified more than 44,000 tonnes of carbon removal,\" said Darren Bondar, CEO of Hempalta. \"This isn't theory, it's the planned evolution and it's happening. It's one of the most scalable nature-based carbon models in Canada and will set the precedent for our other global partnerships that are already part of our regenerative agriculture program,\" said Darren Bondar, CEO of Hempalta.</p><p>\"By closing the loop on-farm, we reduce waste, regenerate soil, and create high-integrity, carbon credits designed to meet Alberta's TIER compliance standards with full traceability and permanence. Our credits are also structured to meet evolving global standards under the Voluntary Carbon Market and Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement, making them ideal for both Alberta-based emitters and international ESG buyers. We're now opening the door for more partners to scale it with us.\"</p><p>As Alberta navigates a wave of incoming data centers and industrial growth, Hempalta believes the province must also scale its carbon infrastructure in parallel. \"You can't unlock the next generation of digital infrastructure without climate infrastructure to balance it,\" Bondar added. \"Our project is that solution made in Alberta, built on nature, and future-proofed through technology.\"</p><p>Hempalta's carbon credits are verified under ISO 14064-2 by Control Union and tracked through its blockchain-enabled registry, Trusted Carbon.

For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches.</p><p>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved.</p><p>We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch.</p><p>CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY</p><p>We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050.</p><p>We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5\u00b0C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy.</p><p>In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO 2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway. (1)(2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions.</p><p>For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites.</p><p>For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities.</p><p>For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments.</p><p>We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF.</p><p>We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.)</p><p>STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON</p><p>At Mondele\u0304z International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions.</p><p>To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.</p><p>Completeness &amp; Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1)</p><p>To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures.</p><p>We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondele\u0304z International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation.</p><p>Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions.</p><p>Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO 2e emissions in base year 2018). (1)</p><p>CLIMATE RISKS &amp; RESILIENT COMMUNITIES</p><p>Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain.</p><p>Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches.</p><p>We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis.</p><p>The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to &gt;4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics.</p><p>The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements.</p><p>We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures.</p><p>For more details please read our Annual Report</p><p>STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION</p><p>Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies :</p><p>- Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights <br/>Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations.<br/>- Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025<br/>Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples<br/>and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights PolicyOur goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondele\u0304z International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach.Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level.Our full deforestation position is available on our website.<br/>- Increasing regenerative agricultural practices<br/>To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders.</p><p>ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS</p><p>ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS &amp; INGREDIENT SOURCING</p><p>RAW MATERIALS - COCOA</p><p>We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa.</p><p>- Read more about our deforestation position on our website</p><p>We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative.</p><p>Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues.</p><p>Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests</p><p>As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms.</p><p>Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices. (4)</p><p>We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms. (29)</p><p>Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry</p><p>Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia).</p><p>Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services:</p><p>- Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood.<br/>- Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility).<br/>- Biodiversity preservation.<br/>- Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot).<br/>- Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events.</p><p>We launched the carbon booster project in Co\u0302te d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nin\u0303o in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality.</p><p>We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring.</p><p>Understanding Our Impact on Forests</p><p>We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests.</p><p>In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Co\u0302te d'Ivoire and Nigeria.</p><p>Overall results in West Africa (Co\u0302te d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms .(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Co\u0302te d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate.</p><p>Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact</p><p>Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program.<br/>In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors.</p><p>Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes</p><p>As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana.</p><p>As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes.</p><p>RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY</p><p>To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk , Milka and Philadelphia , and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO 2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year.</p><p>Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs</p><p>We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO 2e emissions from baselines that Mondele\u0304z International began establishing in 2018.</p><p>Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain.</p><p>In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1.</p><p>In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO 2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions.</p><p>Australia on Its Way</p><p>Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 Mondele\u0304zAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term.</p><p>Emerging Technologies &amp; Innovations in Dairy</p><p>Our Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies,<br/>and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan.</p><p>As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation &amp; Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe.</p><p>In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future.</p><p>Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector</p><p>In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America.</p><p>Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025.</p><p>By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy.</p><p>RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL</p><p>Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG.</p><p>Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually.</p><p>Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction.</p><p>RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT</p><p>We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program.</p><p>Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives:</p><p>- Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation;<br/>- Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops;<br/>- Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and<br/>- Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health.</p><p>We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026.</p><p>Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact</p><p>Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint.</p><p>To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024.</p><p>In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems.</p><p>The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices.</p><p>This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform.</p><p>MANUFACTURING</p><p>We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023. (5)</p><p>We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity.</p><p>LOGISTICS OPERATIONS</p><p>Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO 2e emissions. (1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation.</p><p>We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing<br/>in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers.</p><p>Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia.</p><p>In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers.</p><p>PACKAGING</p><p>We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business.</p><p>These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio.</p><p>SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS</p><p>In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans.</p><p>First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO 2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi.</p><p>INNOVATION</p><p>During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include:</p><p>- Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings.<br/>- Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondele\u0304z International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins.<br/>- Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet<br/>our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050.<br/>- Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges.<br/>- EcoDesign Development: R&amp;D colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging.<br/>- Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition.</p><p>WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM</p><p>Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials. (1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients.</p><p>The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories.</p><p>Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year. (1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year. (1)</p><p>In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1 &amp; 2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year.</p><p>Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa. (1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap.</p><p>View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. </p><p>(1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach.

FIND OUT MORE ABOUT OUR: //st * Strategic approach * Action plans and progress HIGHLIGHTS //st * Approximately (37)% CO 2e emissions reductions across our manufacturing operations in 2024 (vs. 2018) (2) * Approximately (12)% GHG emissions reduction across our value chain (vs. 2018) (1) STRATEGIC APPROACH At Mondelez International, we are part of a broad movement across our sector that aims to bring about more sustainable ways of growing and operating business. For us, this involves aiming to reduce our environmental impact while helping to support resilience across our supply chains and the communities our business touches. </p><p>Our approach also links our carbon emission-reduction goals, our leadership in sourcing ingredients more responsibly, and our commitment to social sustainability and human rights across our value chain. Every element of our approach reinforces the other. Our ingredient sourcing programs are where most of our carbon emissions reduction work and social sustainability efforts live. So as part of our signature sourcing programs for our key ingredients, such as Cocoa Life for cocoa and Harmony Wheat for wheat, we are working towards supporting more resilient landscapes, communities, and robust human rights to help provide lasting economic, environmental, and social benefits for the communities involved. We focus on areas where we believe we can make the greatest positive difference for the long term. This is why we focus on limiting our environmental impact by contributing to climate change mitigation, across key focus areas within our operations and supply chain. Similarly, we work to identify and manage climate change-related risks which helps us to shape our adaptation strategies as we seek to reduce the impact of climate change both on our organization and on the communities we touch. CLIMATE RISK MITIGATION -OUR NET ZERO PATHWAY We've been on a path to reduce our carbon emissions for several years and took a key step in 2021 when we set our long-term goal of net-zero GHG emissions across our full value chain by 2050. We have signed the SBTi's Business Ambition for 1.5C, aligning our long-term emissions mitigation goals with the Paris Agreement's aim of limiting temperature rise. We've also joined the United Nations \"Race to Zero\" campaign to help build momentum toward a decarbonized economy. In April 2024, the SBTi successfully validated our full value chain goal to reduce absolute end-to-end CO 2e emissions by about 35% by 2030 and to reach net-zero by 2050 from a 2018 base year, including the reduction of absolute gross scope 1 and 2 GHG emissions by 50.4% within the same timeframe, in line with the 1.5oC reduction pathway. (1)(2) This followed a thorough review of our carbon accounting documentation, in line with both the GHG Protocol and SBTi standards and guidelines, as well as our commitment to continue transforming our operations and supply chains while transparently reporting progress. This exercise was developed with the input of multiple functions throughout the business - including Manufacturing, Logistics, Finance and Procurement - as well as collaboration with our external partners and suppliers in building a framework for more consistent carbon reporting across our Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions. For Scope 1, we identify and report on the combustion of fuels taking place in our own facilities and mobile operations, as well as any fugitive emissions from our sites. For Scope 2, measuring emissions involves assessing indirect emissions associated with the electricity, heat and steam we buy for our own facilities. For Scope 3, we measure the indirect emissions generated within our value chain, such as the emissions generated from materials and services we buy, emissions generated from activities associated with fuel and energy, and emissions generated from finished goods storage and transportation, as well as business travel and investments. We also strive to support cross sector sharing and collaboration when it comes to common challenges in decarbonizing supply chains. We actively participate in a number of global organizations focused on supply chain improvements, including the Toward Net Zero Coalition of Action (TNZ) and the Forest Positive Coalition of Action (FPC) as part of our membership with the CGF. We are implementing the SBTi reduction pathway following distinct phases as shown in Figure 1 above. (Find out more on SBTi's website.) STRATEGIES FOR REDUCING CARBON At Mondelez International, we focus our strategic efforts on three prominent drivers of carbon emissions at play in the food and beverage sector: the changing use of land, including deforestation; emissions related to farming; and use of fossil fuels. That's why we regard deforestation-free, regenerative agriculture and the avoidance of fossil fuels as key focus areas to help cut our emissions. To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging. Completeness &amp;Consistency in Determining Carbon Footprint Reporting (1) To help make our carbon footprint reporting more consistent, we expose our data to external verification and align our internal processes with the GHG Protocol standards. As part of this, we published our formalized Carbon Accounting Manual during 2023. And we continued to increase the internal processes we use to promote consistency of approach, in the form of a growing range of Standard Operating Procedures. We continue to keep our carbon inventory up to date, now including the recently acquired Chipita Global S.A. and Ricolino. Starting in 2024, Mondelez International partnered with Watershed to improve the GHG accounting process allowing for greater data granularity and streamlined calculation. Overall, our emissions continue to reduce over the years as we continue transitioning our materials to a number of new customized emissions factors, allowing us to reflect the strategic efforts following our three focus areas to reduce our emissions. Our end-to-end emissions are aligned with SBTi guidelines where we focus our initiatives on our most impactful and actionable GHG emissions across the value chain (approximately 90% of our end-to- end CO 2e emissions in base year 2018). (1) CLIMATE RISKS &amp;RESILIENT COMMUNITIES Operating at a global scale means we can have a meaningful positive impact by encouraging practices that respect land rights, and by investing in innovation and technology to increase transparency and measure impact at scale across our supply chain. Identifying and managing climate change-related risks is part of our ERM process, enabling us to expand and deepen our understanding of our impact on the planet, informing our strategies and ultimately sharpening and enhancing our approaches. We are in the process of reviewing our approach to assessing environmental dependencies, impacts, risks, and opportunities in alignment with evolving standards and regulations. For this, we collaborate with third-party expert Risilience and their partner, the Centre for Risk Studies at the University of Cambridge. Risilience specializes in providing the methodology and climate modelling platform that, in combination with their own data and assumptions, drives informed decision-making and impact analysis through climate-related risk assessment and scenario analysis. The platform offered by Risilience provides several configurable models that quantify the impact of various physical and transition risks under different emission pathways. These emission pathways range from a 1.5oC of warming to )4oC of warming as compared with pre-industrial levels. Physical risks include the increasing frequency of extreme weather events and natural disasters, effects on water availability and quality, and biodiversity loss. These can increase risks to the global food production and distribution system, and to the safety and resilience of the communities where we live, work, and source our ingredients. They could also further decrease food security for communities around the world. Transition risks include increased focus by federal, state, and local regulatory and legislative bodies around the world regarding environmental policies relating to climate change, regulating GHG emissions (including carbon pricing or a carbon tax), energy policies, disclosure obligations and sustainability, including single use plastics. The analytical output results of this tool are aligned with TCFD's (and similar) reporting requirements, which may be used as a foundation for future climate-related regulatory disclosure requirements. We continue to monitor this space so that our approach remains relevant and transparent, and we continue to strive to provide our stakeholders with relevant information on climate-related issues. We report on our metrics and goals annually in our Snacking Made Right reports and CDP questionnaire disclosures. For more details please read our Annual Report STRATEGIES FOR CLIMATE RISK ADAPTATION Looking at climate physical and transition risks, we strive to help support communities and landscapes to adapt and become more resilient. We do this through three key strategies : //st 1. Enhancing social sustainability and respecting Human Rights Resilient communities are better positioned to drive their own development. We strive to make sure that the rights of people in our value chain are respected and promoted, and that the communities where we operate are more resilient. To this end, we focus on key areas for greater impact, including addressing Human Rights risks in sourcing key commodities, and working to improve living wages and due diligence in our own operations. 2. Aiming to seek no deforestation across primary commodities by 2025 Deforestation is a risk because of its contribution to global climate change as well as its impact on indigenous peoples and local communities, and ecosystem services in affected areas. Therefore, we believe it is important to take action to help reduce deforestation and promote more sustainable land use practices which respect human rights, including land rights, in line with our Human Rights Policy Our goal is to seek no deforestation across our primary commodities following an approach starting with our European business in accordance with EU regulations and rolling out to our other regions by December 31, 2025, in accordance with SBTi guidance. The cutoff date was December 31, 2020, in accordance with EU regulations and SBTi guidance. This is the date after which deforestation is counted against a company's supply chain, meaning that products have to be produced on land that has not been subject to deforestation or forest degradation after December 31, 2020. In specific cases, e.g., where specific certification standards exist, we may apply cut-off dates set by those respective standards if they are the same or earlier in time. For cocoa and palm oil, two commodities we source that are considered at-risk when it comes to deforestation, we engage with our key suppliers to supply only deforestation-free cocoa and palm oil to Mondelez International. We also call on our suppliers to take efforts to end deforestation in their supply chains. While focus lies on cocoa and palm oil, we also consider soy1, pulp, and paper in our deforestation-free approach. Ending deforestation needs sector-level transformation. We support an approach in which key players along the value chain work collaboratively to tackle systemic issues at the industry, country and landscape-level. Our full deforestation position is available on our website. 3. Increasing regenerative agricultural practices To help improve agricultural resilience, we're working to transform agricultural production into regenerative systems while reducing carbon. We focus on agroforestry landscapes, biodiversity, and regenerative farming practices across our key ingredients, including cocoa and wheat. This involves participation in sector- wide initiatives and coalitions with multiple stakeholders. ACTION PLANS AND PROGRESS ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT THROUGH OUR OPERATIONS &amp;INGREDIENT SOURCING RAW MATERIALS - COCOA We engage with key suppliers to promote sourcing of deforestation-free cocoa. //st * Read more about our deforestation position on our website We also address challenges of climate change and deforestation in the cocoa supply chain through Cocoa Life by working with partners to advance the ambitions of the Cocoa and Forests Initiative. Particularly as supply of cocoa has been hindered largely due to weather with lower production causing a rise in the price of this important ingredient, we have continued our Cocoa Life focus to support our goal of a thriving cocoa sector that collaborates to tackle interrelated system issues. Cocoa Life Actions to Protect and Restore Forests As part of Cocoa Life, we believe in conserving the land and forests for today and for tomorrow. As part of our integrated approach, we focus on helping to protect and restore forests and seek no deforestation on Cocoa Life farms. Two key elements drive our cocoa emissions reduction: agroforestry and farming practices. Therefore, through Cocoa Life, we are working with partners and governments to help farmers grow more resilient farms through trainings on agricultural and environmental practices. These trainings are delivered to raise awareness, to build farming skills and to encourage activities that help increase cocoa yields while avoiding farm expansion into protected areas. We also help promote agroforestry techniques through planting non-cocoa trees to protect crops from excessive sun and heat. These trees also promote biodiversity and can provide farmers with additional income. By the end of 2024, we distributed ~10,665,000 economic shade trees, trained ~178,000 farmers in Good Agricultural Practices and trained ~571,000 community members in Good Environmental practices. (4) We are also applying farm mapping to monitor deforestation for communities. Farm mapping enables us to assess deforestation risks in our supply chain and gain a deeper understanding of farming community needs and farm boundaries. By the end of 2024, we have mapped more than 237,000 Cocoa Life farms. (29) Promoting Cocoa Agroforestry Carbon removals are key to meeting our carbon objectives as we cannot rely only on carbon reduction. We continue to remain in line with the GHG protocol and continue our efforts while we wait for the GHG Protocol's Land Sector and Removals (LSR) guidance. We have started a carbon booster project focusing on carbon removals to help sequester carbon from the atmosphere and have a bigger positive climate impact. This project focuses on agroforestry and in particular tree planting to sequester carbon. In some countries, this project also includes financial incentives (Payments for Environmental Services - PES) paid to farmers for the number of trees planted (Cameroon) or the survival rate of trees (Indonesia). Generally, research and practitioners expect agroforestry to provide a wide range of environmental, social and economic ecosystem services: //st * Income diversification for farmers: Trees planted are usually a mix of fruit and timber trees. If the tree is a source of income it is less likely the farmer will cut it down for wood. * Soil conservation (improves soil quality and reduces soil erosion, increases soil fertility). * Biodiversity preservation. * Natural barrier to pests (when planting along the borders of the plot). * Helps crops become more resilient to climate change and extreme climatic events. We launched the carbon booster project in Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, India, Indonesia and Brazil in 2023 and in Nigeria and Cameroon in 2024. While we continue to plant trees, we also see climate challenges - low rainfalls in India or El Nino in Brazil pose a higher risk of tree mortality. We currently use field monitoring for tree survival rates to confirm they are still sequestrating carbon. As we scale tree planting in the coming years, we intend to assess how to monitor tree survival leveraging remote sensing data to support the field monitoring. Understanding Our Impact on Forests We work with Satelligence, a remote sensing company, to help us understand the impact on natural forests of Cocoa Life farmers and communities. Satelligence applies satellite imagery to detect forest cover changes that can indicate likely deforestation events, and machine-learning to measure deforestation rates. Following sector practices in 2024, the methodology was adjusted to expand the scope to secondary forests in addition to primary forests. The new definition improves forest detection and helps us better protect already degraded area where forests have newly regrown in addition to primary forests. In alignment with our Cocoa and Forests Initiative ambitions, we look at deforestation signals from 2018 until the latest available data (2024). In 2024, the analysis focused on our impact on forests in Ghana, Cote d'Ivoire and Nigeria. Overall results in West Africa (Cote d'Ivoire, Ghana, Nigeria) show approximately 2.5% deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms .(3) The satellite monitoring results show near no deforestation on or closely around Cocoa Life registered farms in Cote d'Ivoire (~0.6%) and Ghana (~2.2%) since 2018. In Nigeria, the new detection approach indicates a level of approximately 19% with most detected occurrences located on potential secondary forest or agroforestry areas versus primary forest which was the focus of our 2023 analysis. We are in the process of engaging with supply chain partners to better understand what triggers the occurrences and, if required, follow up to do checks on the ground and assess the opportunity to rehabilitate impacted areas as appropriate. Understanding the Carbon Emissions Impact Building on our work from 2022, we're continuing to expand our list defining customized emission factors that will help us to understand our carbon emissions intensity, which helps to quantify the carbon reductions resulting from the Cocoa Life program. In doing so, we're using data to translate our interventions in deforestation prevention and agroforestry as well as farming practices into custom emission factors. In our major sourcing countries, this approach is resulting in lower emissions per tonne of product than we would obtain with generic emission factors. Working in Collaboration Across Landscapes As we seek forest protection and restoration, we work with farming communities, peers, sector partners and governments to drive solutions on a landscape level. This includes the CFI and multistakeholder landscape initiatives, such as the Asunafo-Asutifi landscape partnership in Ghana. As part of Cocoa LifeIndonesia's activities in Aceh and North Sumatra, we help protect and restore forests in the Leuser Ecosystem landscapes. RAW MATERIALS - DAIRY To better maximize our efforts, we have taken a two-pronged approach to help reduce carbon intensity in dairy: We work directly with farmers supplying our core brands Cadbury Dairy Milk , Milka and Philadelphia , and we closely collaborate with strategic processors. Thanks to first tracking their CO 2e emissions and then developing action plans to reduce them, some strategic suppliers have successfully completed their baselines and are delivering lower carbon intensity compared to their base year. Europe at the Helm of Dairy GHG Reduction Programs We are working with several of our dairy suppliers in Europe on ambitious farm-level GHG reduction programs with the goal of reducing CO 2e emissions from baselines that Mondelez International began establishing in 2018. Our goal is to gain a clear picture of GHG emissions and sustainability efforts across our shared value chain. We work with dairy suppliers, industry experts, and our carbon accounting partner, Quantis, to review the tools and methodologies used for measuring GHG emissions. This helps us to accurately assess our baseline and measure progress. A robust baseline, based on farm-level data, highlights environmental hotspots and solutions most relevant for our supply chain. In 2024, we kicked off phase 2 of our baselining efforts to cover more of our Europe supplier base and began to track annual progress for the baselines validated in phase 1. In Italy, our local supplier Fattorie Osella has taken another significant step forward in dairy sustainability. After becoming the first dairy company in Italy to obtain animal welfare certification for ~100% of its milk suppliers since 2016, Fattorie Osella has launched a three-year carbon reduction journey with xFarm Technologies. Through this collaboration, 17 farmers are expected to gain access to their on-farm carbon footprints, enabling them to design a tailored roadmap for reducing on-farm CO 2e emissions. Farmers will have access to an online platform that helps digitalize their operations and make informed sustainability decisions. Australia on Its Way Australia is on the dairy emissions-reduction journey, partnering directly with Cadbury dairy farmers in Tasmania. In 2024 MondelezAustralia completed baselines for on-farm carbon footprints and are now looking at ways to partner with farmers to develop reduction strategies for the short, medium, and long term. Emerging Technologies &amp;Innovations in Dairy Our Research &amp;Development (R&amp;D) organization continued our collaboration with the Scienta Group, a science and innovation consultancy, to stay informed on developments and support us in achieving our ambitions. This partnership has been instrumental in exploring the longer-term technical landscape, assessing the implementation readiness and efficacy of existing technologies, and identifying new areas for exploration through opportunities in academia and industry collaboration. Moreover, our work with Scienta has identified early Technology Readiness Level (TRL) technologies, which we will explore during 2025 to better understand how they can be leveraged to deliver against our plan. As part of our efforts with the Scienta Group, we are proud to have supported and secured approval for a European Institute of Innovation &amp;Technology (EIT) Food-funded project. This initiative focuses on exploring the application of the Marginal Abatement Cost Curve (MACC) to better understand the environmental and economic impacts of various dairy farm typologies across Europe. In addition, we have secured a Knowledge Transfer Partnership (KTP) with Queen's University Belfast, further enhancing our internal expertise in assessing end-to-end emissions on farms as technology interventions are implemented. These collaborations reflect our commitment to innovation and progress as we work towards a more sustainable future. Collaborating Across the Dairy Sector In 2024, we continued our partnership with the Sustainable Agriculture Initiative Platform (SAI Platform) and its Sustainable Dairy Partnership (SDP) to collaborate within the industry. This includes our efforts to scale the adoption of the SDP in Latin America. Through the SDP, we have worked to promote sector alignment on the reporting of sustainability topics and continuous improvement on key dairy issues. Along with a variety of stakeholders, processors and national programs (altogether representing about 30% of the global dairy volume), we are working to raise the bar in dairy sustainability. By recognizing existing programs, we are striving to avoid duplicating efforts, allowing more resources to help create positive impact at farm level. In 2024 we began to explore the option of using SDP data for baselining eligible suppliers. We intend to continue this work in 2025. By collaborating with producers, processors, and buyers like ourselves, we hope to support a more sustainable future for dairy. RAW MATERIALS - PALM OIL Our aim to seek no deforestation is building upon the company's POAP, which was first issued in 2014. We take into account learnings and experience realized in our Company's efforts to collaborate with suppliers to source deforestation-free palm oil and applies those learnings across primary commodities. In the future, this plan will also take into account current and impending regulation, as well as insights from external frameworks such as the SBTi and collaborative organizations such as CGF FPC and CGF POCG. Sourcing palm oil more sustainably means for us switching from broadly RSPO credit sourcing in prior years to sourcing RSPO physical certified starting in 2025. In conjunction we are also adopting NDPE's IRF and require our suppliers to submit NDPE IRF profiles annually. Shifting to deforestation-free sourcing supports our carbon footprint reduction. RAW MATERIALS - WHEAT We also work to help curb our supply chain footprint through our Harmony sustainable wheat program. Our strengthened charter, Harmony Ambition 2030, includes 20 mandatory farming practices plus 17 best practices, built in close collaboration with agronomic experts, NGOs and, of course, our wheat supply chain. To help mitigate climate change, our Harmony Regenerative Charter focuses on the following objectives: //st * Optimizing the use of nitrogen fertilizers, the main source of greenhouse gas emissions in wheat production, and a source of soil health degradation; * Diversifying crop rotation by introducing leguminous crops; * Keeping the soil covered between crops to help improve soil structure, store carbon and reduce the need for fertilizers; and * Reducing tillage to limit erosion, improve water retention and enhance soil health. We kick-started Harmony Ambition 2030 with a test-and-learn model in France. Participating farmers sowed Harmony wheat under our Regenerative Charter for harvest 2023. Encouraging results in France helped us to apply learnings to a wider European roll-out over the coming years, starting with Belgium for harvest 2024, Central Europe for harvest 2025 and finishing with Spain and Italy for harvest 2026. Strong Data Reporting System to Measure Our Impact Harmony has developed a strong and unique data reporting system on farming practices that allows for full traceability from Harmony wheat storage to factory. Our aim is to calculate and monitor a set of economic and agro-environmental performance indicators, such as nitrogen use efficiency, greenhouse gas emissions and pesticide use. Key results are shared with wheat supply chain partners to fuel a continuous improvement approach, and our charter is reworked to further reduce our environmental footprint. To confirm our Harmony-labeled products comply with requirements of the charter, certified third-party organizations (SGS, Bureau Veritas) conduct annual verifications. All mills and storage bodies as well as about 10% of partner farmers are audited every year with over 285 audits performed in 2024. In 2024, we decided to go further and kicked off a project to launch a new digital platform, developed by the technology company Improvin'. With the detailed farm-level data in the Harmony data platform, we will be able to more effectively track the overall progress of the program including factors such as reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. Designed with user simplicity in mind, the Harmony data platform features an intuitive interface and built- in compatibility with many Harmony partners' existing tools, including Farm Management Systems. The platform's advanced machine learning capabilities, using modeled data from sources such as satellite imagery, streamline the reporting process, allowing farmers to validate information rather than having to enter data manually. Furthermore, the Harmony data platform offers farmers valuable feedback on their performance and tailored support to enhance their regenerative practices. This Harmony data platform will be rolled out across Europe starting in 2025, covering more than 1,260 farms in seven markets by 2026: France, Belgium, Spain, Italy, Poland, Czechia and Hungary. In 2025, the French and Belgian Harmony partners will be the first to gain access to the new platform. MANUFACTURING We're focusing on increasing both our energy efficiency and our use of renewable energy (with a focus on electricity), so that we can go further in reducing our carbon emissions and our costs. In 2024, about 54% of the electricity we used in our manufacturing sites was renewable, compared to around 45% in 2023. (5) We are also continuing to make adjustments to how we operate. We are leveraging improved processing designs for enhanced efficiency. For example, we are replacing some natural gas baking ovens with low-carbon fuels or electricity. LOGISTICS OPERATIONS Outbound logistics activities (from manufacturing plants to customers) represent about 4% of our total company CO 2e emissions. (1) Most of our operations are outsourced, thus partnering with our suppliers is crucial to help deliver our net-zero emissions ambition. The main contributor to our emissions is truck transportation. We are working to reduce the emissions across our logistics operations across a range of activities. Efforts include investing in new and energy-efficient mobility solutions, as well as switching to renewable energy sources in our warehouses. We're also optimizing routes, reducing travel distances and improving the ways in which we use trucks and containers. Electric transportation continues to be piloted in a variety of markets, including China, the U.S.and Brazil and also in 2024 piloted for the first time in Czechia. In Europe, we run a program called Design to Transport which aims to enhance our transportation efficiency by improving vehicle utilization. Three pillars of this program are pallet height optimization, pallet loading optimization (e.g. double stacking) and our Pack Light Right program, which optimizes truck space utilization and drives air reduction in transport. The program initiated in 2023 and continued to thrive into 2024, successfully eliminating over 1,000 trucks annually that transit between our manufacturing facilities and distribution centers. PACKAGING We continue to strive to make our packaging more efficient in line with our strategy. This means working toward reducing the virgin plastic material used in our packaging, while not compromising the quality and integrity of our products. We have deployed packaging sustainability design requirements across our global business. These requirements are aligned with industry guidelines - such as the CGF's Golden Design Rules - to promote consistency with latest leading practices. By designing our packaging to be recyclable, evolving to more sustainable materials and increasing our use of recycled content, we are working toward improving carbon intensity across our packaging portfolio. SUPPLIER PARTNERSHIP PROGRAMS In the last year, we have continued to build two major partnerships that are helping us better understand our broader Scope 3 emissions, while recognizing their level of alignment with our net- zero plans. First, we continue working with EcoVadis, a leading provider of business sustainability ratings and second, we continue to partner with the Supplier Leadership on Climate Transition (Supplier LOCT), a consortium of world-leading businesses aiming to reduce supply chain emissions. Through this approach we are supporting our top suppliers in evolving or (where applicable) creating their Scope 3 footprint, setting CO 2e reduction goals, and reporting outcomes in line with the SBTi. INNOVATION During 2024, we've worked on many areas of innovation, which are aimed at helping us reduce our carbon emissions. Key examples include: //st * Conservation in Cocoa: We completed the first, comprehensive study of biochar's potential as a carbon dioxide removal technology in a smallholder cocoa farming in collaboration with the Alliance of Biodiversity International and CIAT (Centro Internacional de Agricultura Tropical). The results showed potential to simultaneously achieve decarbonization of cocoa, while also improving soil fertility, water retention, fertilizer use efficiency, and productivity. The most viable technologies and scaling models were identified and evaluated. Also, the community-based Payment for Ecosystems Services (PES) model developed under the Landscape for Sustainable Livelihoods (C4SL) pilot project in Ghana, has reduced the deforestation growth curve by over 70% compared to business-as-usual which means the conservation of about 7,000 tonnes of CO2 equivalent together with improved water recharge and hectares of biodiversity. Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings. * Wheat Regen Ag Pilot: Developing a three-year baseline alongside Michigan State University Extension to initiate a regenerative agriculture program in the 2025 planting season, looking at the use of regenerative agriculture in wheat for Triscuit recipes. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins. * Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey. Local sourcing is a critical enabler for our initiatives in China, and these varieties not only meet our quality standards but also lay the foundation for working towards our longer-term goal of net zero emissions by 2050. * Sustainable Futures Investment: Through our Sustainable Futures platform we have invested in eAgronom, a start up company that supports the transition to regenerative agriculture by helping farmers improve soil health, reduce carbon emissions and enhance financial resilience through sustainable practices. With over 1 million hectares already under sustainable farming practices, eAgronom enables farmers to access carbon credit markets, helping create additional revenue streams while helping strengthen their ability to adapt to climate-related challenges. * EcoDesign Development: R&amp;D colleagues throughout our business now have access to a digital EcoDesign tool to help them build reduced environmental impact into product and process innovations, reformulations and portfolio shifts. We also use our eQoPack, a packaging assessment tool developed by Quantis to help us design more sustainable packaging. * Reformulation Research: We are piloting a digital dashboard to help us capture the carbon-reduction potential available through reformulation. We also funded a project with The National Food Lab, Inc. to test the potential for taking dairy ingredients out of selected baked products with minimal impact on cost, taste or nutrition. WHERE OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT COMES FROM Similar to other food manufacturers, we see about 70% of our footprint driven by raw materials. (1) Cocoa and dairy are the two largest contributors to our footprint driven by our portfolio followed by: palm oil, sugar, wheat, other oils, nuts, and all other ingredients. The remaining approximately 30% is broken out across internal manufacturing linked to the production of our products plus related upstream fuel and energy related activities, packaging used to keep our products safe and protected during transportation and handling, logistics operations linked to storage and transportation of finished goods, and various other categories including emissions related to external manufacturing, investments, services, business travel, and small categories. Our end-to-end footprint has reduced by approximately (12)% compared to our 2018 baseline or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year. (1) Our Scope 1 and 2 emissions continue to decrease, reflecting our progress in renewable electricity and energy efficiency. We reduced our Scope 1 and 2 (market-based) emissions by approximately (28)% compared to our 2018 baseline and approximately (2)% compared to emissions in the prior year. (1) In the past we have been focused on reducing the carbon emissions across our manufacturing operations by 10% from a 2018 base year which has been successfully achieved thanks to our strategic approach in our operations though electrification, transitioning to renewable energy, and efforts towards more energy efficient processes. Our focus moving forward will be shifting to the reduction of absolute Scope 1 &amp;2 emissions by 50.4% by 2030 against a 2018 base year. Our Scope 3 emissions have decreased by approximately (11)% compared to our 2018 baseline, or approximately (9)% compared to emissions in the prior year as we continue to capture the positive effects of our various roadmaps, with the biggest impact coming from cocoa. (1) Our carbon reduction strategy is based on our focus areas, which each have a distinct roadmap. View the full 2024 Snacking Made Right Report. (1) In the reporting year 2024, our annual GHG emissions were accounted following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards and using the operational control approach. Reported information following Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi) guidelines for near-term target excludes Capital Goods, Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials, Employee Commuting, Downstream Transportation at Customer, and End of Life Treatment.The long-term target excludes these same categories, except for Upstream Transportation and Distribution of Raw Materials and Employee Commuting. We have recalculated our base year 2018 and most recent years (2023 and 2024) inventory following the GHG Protocol Corporate Standards. Recent updates incorporate acquisitions Chipita and Ricolino. The footprint includes all acquisitions and divestitures to date except for Evirth. For more details, please see the Carbon Accounting Manual. Reported information is verified by an independent third-party and available in our ESG Reporting &amp;Disclosure Reporting Archive. In the context of the Science Based Targets initiative (SBTi), an \"absolute target\" refers to a reduction in total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by a specific percentage or amount, measured against a baseline year, rather than a reduction per unit of production or activity. (2) Our near-term goal aligns with the latest standards and guidelines including the current SBTi Net Zero Standard (from March 2024) and the current SBTi FLAG (Forest, Land and Agriculture) Guidance (from December 2023) by setting near-term targets in line with limiting warming to 1.5C. (3) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 for West Africa includes Cte d'Ivoire, Nigeria and Ghana. (4) Reported information for the period from January 1, 2024 to December 31, 2024 covers Brazil, Cameroon, Cte d'Ivoire, Ecuador, Ghana, Indonesia, India, and Nigeria unless otherwise stated (which differs from prior years). (5) Reported information includes all divestitures to date and the following acquisitions (which were not included in previous years): Chipita, Clif bar, Give &amp;Go, Gourmet Foods, Ricolino and Tate's Bake Shop except for Evirth (subject to future data integration). We have recalculated our base year 2018 (where applicable) and most recent years (2023 and 2024) for year-over-year comparison.

To effectively bring these three strategies to life, we have identified our main focus areas and created reduction roadmaps for each which includes, shifting our ingredient supply chains away from sources where deforestation occurs; focusing on regenerative agriculture that uses ecological principles to sustain and restore degraded soils; and embracing renewable energy sources and low- impact, more sustainable packaging.

Additionally, we registered two high-yielding, resilient cocoa clones in Indonesia and established 4 budwood gardens in Sumatra, each with a capacity to distribute approximately 35,000 - 50,000 seedlings. Also, Mondelez International enlisted a Monitor, Reporting and Verification (MRV) partner to monitor, record and verify regenerative agricultural practices, as well as a crop warranty provider to help decrease risk during the transition to regenerative practices once the program begins. * Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey.", "* Wheat Breeding Program: We have been able to register two new soft wheat varieties in China, marking a significant milestone in our sustainability journey.

Regenerative agriculture is a production system that focuses on reducing water usage and other inputs as part of a larger attempt to prevent land degradation and deforestation. According to the organization GreenAmerica\u00ae, regenerative agriculture is designed to harness the power of photosynthesis in plants to sequester carbon in the soil. The ability to do that can improve soil health, crop yields, water resilience, and nutrient density.</p><p>Why should people be interested in regenerative agriculture? GreenAmerica\u00ae notes that regenerative agriculture draws down atmospheric carbon dioxide. That\u2019s a significant benefit, as Climate.gov, which is a product of various departments within the National Ocean and Atmospheric Administration, reports that adding more carbon dioxide to the environment is causing global temperatures to rise. In fact, observations from the NOAA Global Monitoring Lab in 2021 revealed that carbon dioxide alone was responsible for about two-thirds of the total heating influence of all human-produced greenhouse gases. GreenAmerica\u00ae reports that, at scale, regenerative agriculture could help to reverse the climate crisis by drawing down atmospheric carbon dioxide.</p><p>Another reason to consider regenerative agriculture is its connection to topsoil. GreenAmerica\u00ae reports that the world is on the cusp of running out of topsoil, which is vital to growing food. Re-generative agriculture rebuilds topsoil, which can lead to greater food security across the globe.</p><p>What are some regenerative agriculture practices? Regenerative agriculture practices include the usage of cover crops, a reduction in tilling, crop rotation, and spreading compost. GreenAmerica\u00ae notes that regenerative agriculture practitioners also avoid the use of synthetic fertilizers, pesticides, herbicides, and factory farming.</p><p>As the climate crisis continues to challenge the agricultural sector, regenerative agriculture could help farmers and the larger industry successfully confront those issues.</p>", "publisher": "East Kootenay eXtra", "instances": ["Climate change poses a threat to various industries, not the least of which is the agricultural sector.

This development is poised to accelerate the company's growth trajectory and solidify its position in the regenerative agriculture sector.</p><p>Strengthened Financial Position</p><p>The company has secured a $2.5 million revolving credit facility with a one-year term, renewable at the lender's discretion. This facility is interest-only, bearing an interest rate of prime plus 12%, and is secured against the company's assets. Additionally, Replenish Nutrients has obtained a $200,000 receivable factoring loan with a six-month term, featuring interest-only payments at a rate of 2% per month, also secured by specific receivables. The net proceeds from these financings are earmarked for completing final upgrades to the Beiseker granulation facility, purchasing inventory, and addressing other working capital requirements.</p><p>Strategic Implications for Growth</p><p>The infusion of capital through these financing arrangements is set to expedite the completion of the Beiseker facility's upgrades, aiming for full operational capacity between 20,000 and 25,000 metric tonnes of granulated fertilizer annually. These enhancements are projected to be finalized in the second quarter of 2025, with full operational capacity expected by late Q2 or early Q3 of 2025. The company has already secured purchase orders for the initial 6,000 metric tonnes of production at an average price of $575 per metric tonne, aligning with anticipated gross margins of 25% to 35%. This positions Replenish Nutrients to achieve positive EBITDA and operating cash flow on an annualized run-rate basis.</p><p>Reinforced Investment Thesis</p><p>For ESGFIRE this development significantly strengthens the investment thesis surrounding Replenish Nutrients. The expanded credit facility not only alleviates immediate financial constraints but also provides the necessary capital to complete critical infrastructure projects and scale operations effectively. This strategic move underscores the company's commitment to enhancing shareholder value through prudent financial management and operational excellence.</p><p>Alignment with Sustainable Agriculture Initiatives</p><p>Replenish Nutrients' advancements resonate with ESGFIRE's dedication to supporting sustainable and regenerative agricultural practices. By focusing on innovative fertilizer solutions that promote soil health and reduce environmental impact, Replenish Nutrients is well-positioned to meet the growing demand for sustainable farming inputs. The successful securing of these financial resources reflects the market's confidence in the company's vision and its capacity to contribute meaningfully to the evolution of sustainable agriculture.</p><p>In conclusion, ESGFIRE views Replenish Nutrients' expanded lending relationship as a pivotal development that enhances the company's financial flexibility, accelerates its growth initiatives, and reinforces its role as a leader in the regenerative agriculture sector. We remain optimistic about the company's future prospects and its potential to deliver substantial value to shareholders and the broader agricultural community.</p><p>About ESGFIRE</p><p>ESGFIRE is an investment company and research firm that focuses on ESG companies with either an environmentally friendly service or product.

As little as 10% of conventional phosphorus fertilizer is used by the crop. RhizoSorb offers a controlled release, avoiding tie up while decreasing nutrient leaching.</p><p>RhizoSorb Product Highlights</p><p>RhizoSorb patented technology is designed to replace conventional commodity fertilizers like monoammonium phosphate (\"MAP\") and diammonium phosphate (\"DAP\"), by enhancing nutrient use efficiency through its integration into dry-granule phosphate production. It offers the same ease of application as traditional granular fertilizers, requiring no changes to existing equipment or practices.</p><p>RhizoSorb increases phosphorus efficiency by up to 50%, allowing farmers to apply half the applied phosphorus of their traditional fertilizer while maintaining, and even improving yield. This efficiency translates to better grower return on investment, with potential savings of up to US$20 per acre by optimizing fertilizer inputs and reducing costs without sacrificing yield.</p><p>In addition to economic benefits, RhizoSorb delivers meaningful environmental advantages, reducing COe emissions by 45.2%, phosphorus runoff by 78%, and leaching by 84% compared to conventional MAP fertilizer.</p><p>\"With approximately 94.5 million acres of crop production that depend on phosphate, Canada is a key market,\" said Craig Dick, VP Sales and Marketing. \"We are proud to partner with MustGrow to deliver RhizoSorb to retailers and growers across Canada.\"</p><p>\"This partnership marks another major milestone in Phospholutions' journey,\" added Hunter Swisher, CEO of Phospholutions. \"Partnering to bring more cost-effective fertilizer solutions to the Canadian market supports our broader global expansion efforts.\"</p><p>\"MustGrow and Phospholutions share a common mission to improve the global food system through sustainable production solutions,\" said Colin Bletsky, COO of MustGrow. \"Phosphorus is the second-most-used nutrient in global food production, making its efficient and responsible use a top priority for both our companies and the growers we serve.\"</p><p>Benefits of Reduced-Rate Phosphate</p><p>RhizoSorb features a 38% lower salt index, promoting healthier soils and long-term productivity. Growers benefit from lower application rates, reduced input costs, and sustained yields. For retailers, it offers reduced storage and logistics costs along with stronger margins. Environmentally, RhizoSorb cuts CO emissions by reducing carbon-intensive ingredients during manufacturing, reducing logistics across import, retail, and farm.</p><p>About Phospholutions Inc.</p><p>Phospholutions' mission is to enhance global phosphorus use. It believes that sustainable production and responsible use of phosphorus is critical to support global food demands. RhizoSorb was developed to cut costs and reduce the environmental impact of fertilizer use by releasing nutrients in the soil more efficiently.

It requires systemic change, and as a recent panel discussion at Reuters Responsible Business 2025 highlighted, multi-stakeholder partnerships aren't just beneficial, they're crucial for accelerating sustainability goals.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Hosted by Antea Group USA and expertly moderated by our own Angie Dickson, the panel \"Beyond Silos: Driving Systemic Change Through Collective Action\" brought together leading voices from the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable (BIER) and the Healthcare Plastics Recycling Council (HPRC). Panelists included Matthew Blandford (Senior Manager Climate and Water, Suntory Global Spirits), Erica Pann (Executive Director, BIER), Milagro Lopez (Americas Marketing Lead, DuPont), and Adam Wozniak (Senior Manager of Sustainability, Ravago). Their insights offered a powerful look into how industry-driven forums are achieving impactful environmental progress.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Why Collective Action? It's About Shared Challenges and Scaled Solutions</p><p>The conversation kicked off by addressing the fundamental question: Why join a consortium? Matthew Blandford of Suntory Global Spirits shared that BIER, established in 2006, provided crucial alignment on sustainability metric measurement and reporting. Simple yet vital things like defining \"water use vs. consumption\" helped eliminate inconsistencies across their peer group, accelerating internal discussions and real progress. He emphasized that many challenges, from increasing recycling rates and securing recycled material availability to defining demand for low-energy coolers or scaling improvements in regenerative agriculture, simply \"cannot be solved by going it alone.\"</p><p>Erica Pann underscored that BIER formed because environmental challenges are \"too complex, too interconnected, and too urgent for any one company to tackle alone.\" Water, for instance, a core ingredient for the beverage industry, \"doesn't follow corporate boundaries,\" necessitating collective action, local alignment and long-term partnership for large-scale water stewardship projects and tackling climate resilience across the value chain.</p><p>Similarly, Milagro Lopez explained that DuPont, a founding member of HPRC in 2010, saw the value in understanding the broader value chain challenges in healthcare plastics. The coalition aims to enable safe, viable, and cost-effective recycling solutions for plastic products and packaging in healthcare, advocating for sustainability and a circular economy.</p><p>Adam Wozniak passionately articulated that HPRC embodies \"collaborative partnerships\" and \"flattens silos.\" This allows diverse companies, including competitors, to share questions and learn from each other in a highly regulated, complex industry. He highlighted that \"plastics unto itself is a challenging thing because of the different classifications and different types,\" and addressing these complexities demands a united front to deliver complementary technologies that offer carbon reduction solutions.</p><p>Tangible Progress Through Pre-Competitive Collaboration</p><p>The panel moved beyond theory, offering concrete examples of how collective action translates into real-world impact and amplifies efforts:</p><p>- Glass Recycling in Kentucky (BIER): Matthew Blandford shared a groundbreaking initiative where three BIER member companies with a strong footprint in Kentucky (a state with low recycling rates) partnered with a glass supplier and a third party. They collaboratively funded and created a new recycling entity focused on processing glass in the greater Louisville area. This effort directly provides recycled cullet back into the regional glass market, collectively driving up recycled content for the industry as a whole-a powerful example of pre-competitive collaboration for broader benefit.<br/>- Healthcare Plastic Circularity &amp; Advanced Recycling (HPRC): Adam Wozniak underscored that \"collaborative partnerships are critical to driving circularity in healthcare.\" HPRC unites hospitals, medical device manufacturers (MDMs), recyclers, resin producers, and policymakers to design smarter products and enable advanced recycling. He cited HPRC's work in conducting sortation studies and demonstrating that hospital plastics are \"very clean feedstocks,\" suitable for advanced recycling technologies. He emphasized HPRC's role in establishing crucial end markets and helping to create infrastructure, even advocating for the inclusion of advanced recycling in Extended Producer Responsibility (EPR) frameworks.<br/>- Accelerating Individual Company Goals: Milagro Lopez illustrated how HPRC participation accelerates DuPont's own sustainability journey. He shared an example of a new DuPont product, \"Tyvek\u00ae with Renewable Attribution (RA),\" which shifted from 100% fossil-based feedstock to incorporating 30% bio-circular feedstock. This innovation, informed by collaborative insights, directly contributes to a one-third reduction in CO2 emissions, addressing crucial Scope 3 emissions.</p><p>Navigating the Complexities: Building Trust and Sharpening Focus</p><p>Driving change collectively isn't without its hurdles. Erica Pann candidly admitted the work is \"super challenging,\" as member companies have unique realities including different business models, regulatory requirements, sustainability maturity. The key, she noted, is to aim for \"strategic coherence\"-finding \"just enough common ground to come together\"-rather than forcing full alignment.</p><p>Matthew Blandford powerfully added that in-person meetings twice a year are invaluable. These face-to-face interactions build relationships, and the trust needed to navigate difficult conversations. When discussions become too broad, BIER leadership will step back to \"narrow the scope\" and agree on what the consortium can and should address, ensuring actionable objectives.</p><p>Adam Wozniak discussed challenges like antitrust concerns with competitors at the table, emphasizing strict \"Chatham House Rules\" for discussions to maintain focus on shared sustainability goals. He stressed the importance of collaborating to understand \"design for recyclability,\" noting that 80% of a product's environmental impact is determined during the design phase.</p><p>The panel also addressed the challenge of supplier disclosure requests, acknowledging the \"20 questionnaires asking the same thing\" burden. While full alignment isn't yet achieved, BIER and HPRC are actively working with other consortia to standardize approaches, understanding that \"inaction is cost.\"</p><p>The Future is Action: Less Talk, More Impact</p><p>The conversation converged on a powerful, shared vision: action over talk.</p><p>Erica Pann underscored, \"If you're waiting for the perfect set of circumstances to arise, you might be waiting for a long time.\" She urged, \"Let's do it together.\" Matthew Blandford passionately concluded, \"Collective action is all about action, getting things done. The big issues of the day need big action and big solutions, not big talk.\" He emphasized that alignment and driving forward, even if not perfect initially, lead to \"larger, faster, and more repeatable impact.\"</p><p>Adam Wozniak echoed this sentiment, stating that \"collective action and collaborative partnerships are essential to solving some of the most pressing environmental challenges of our time.\" He framed advancing circularity as \"our generation's 'Race to Space',\" empowering true transformation and building new pathways to sustainability that deliver lasting social, economic, and environmental impact.</p><p>The panel left no doubt: while challenges exist, the benefits of shared vision, trust, and concerted effort through forums like BIER and HPRC far outweigh them. It's through this collaborative spirit that systemic change is unlocked, and progress toward a more sustainable future is truly accelerated.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Antea Group on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Antea Group<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/antea-group\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/antea-group</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: Antea Group</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/business-and-professional-services/beyond-silos-how-collective-action-drives-real-sustainability-im-1047541\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["Simple yet vital things like defining \"water use vs. consumption\" helped eliminate inconsistencies across their peer group, accelerating internal discussions and real progress.

These sessions combine table tennis events, hands-on training in producing sustainable sports equipment and environmental awareness education on topics such as preventing deforestation, waste management and regenerative agriculture.</p><p>Tanjun's contribution to gender equality is particularly noteworthy given the theme of this year's World Table Tennis Day: diversity and inclusion. It also builds on the impact of initiatives that have already engaged thousands of schoolchildren. Thanks to Tanjun, mixed doubles table tennis - once a rarity - is now the norm at Paradise Academy, one of its partner schools.</p><p>Delivering lasting social and environmental impact</p><p>Rekha Dey, a managing partner at Tanjun, explains why sport has been key to unlocking the project's potential. \"We are mobilising women in remote rural areas, who are primarily from lower-income groups and who come from communities where caste-based and gender discrimination is high,\" says Dey. \"Sport is a relationship-builder and acts as a powerful tool to reach out to these communities; it creates an environment of friendliness and fun and breaks down the barriers you often face.\"</p><p>The support from the IOC, through the Olympism365 Innovation Hub, has allowed Tanjun to increase the scale of its work and to benefit from a supportive network of social entrepreneurs in sport for development. \"Our footprint in the community has increased sizeably,\" says Dey. \"The grant has really helped us reach out and meet the targets we had set for ourselves. This project is about sustainable livelihood development, taking positive climate action and the development of environmentally friendly sports equipment.\"</p><p>Thanks to the Olympism365 Innovation Hub, Tanjun was also able to invest in research and develop further sustainable sports equipment out of bamboo, such as hand-woven jute nets, alongside its training programmes. By the end of this year, Tanjun aims to have built a 100 per cent bamboo-based table tennis table, and is also currently producing prototype equipment for badminton, volleyball and football.</p><p>Using these initiatives to spur continual growth is fundamental to Tanjun's approach. \"The products are environmentally sustainable and commercially viable. We aim to show women how they can develop a livelihood through these skills,\" says Dey. \"Successful prototypes will be donated to community schools, and we will be training more women to be involved in the manufacturing process as we scale up.\"</p><p>Working directly with vulnerable communities</p><p>Tanjun operates primarily in the states of Uttarakhand and Utter Pradesh, in a region increasingly vulnerable to the effects of climate change and where the importance of sustainable development is stark.</p><p>\"The Himalayas are the oxygen bank for the whole of northern India, and it provides water for the entire Indo-Gangetic plain,\" explains Dey. \"But human development is taking place at the cost of environmental degradation; deforestation is occurring, glaciers are melting, we are having extreme climate events every monsoon season. There has to be a solution-centric approach to development.\"</p><p>By embedding circular economy principles, Tanjun aims to deliver both environmental and social impact, empowering the communities most at risk. \"We are trying to work directly with the people that are most vulnerable and directly affected,\" says Dey. \"We want to help them stand for the protection of the areas they live in and embrace climate action initiatives.\"</p><p>Olympism365: A shared vision for sport for sustainable development</p><p>Tanjun is one of nine social enterprises that received IOC co-investment totalling USD 300,000 through the Olympism365 Innovation Hub - a collaboration between the IOC, Beyond Sport and Women Win - and its Enterprise365 funding stream. These enterprises promote sustainable finance solutions to advance sport for positive social change and contribute to Olympism365, the IOC's strategy to use sport as an important enabler of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (UN SDGs).</p><p>Representing Tanjun, Dey will attend the Olympism365 Summit: Sport for a Better World, which will be held in Lausanne, Switzerland, from 3 to 5 June 2025. The event will bring together representatives from the Olympic Movement, UN agencies, development and financing institutions, civil society, for-purpose business and safe sport community members who are working together to advance the UN SDGs through sport.</p><p>Dey is enthused by the chance to meet others who share Tanjun's commitment to sport for sustainable development. \"We're looking forward to exploring opportunities for collaboration and partnership,\" she says. \"I would also like to learn from other projects that are being implemented around the world, and from other Olympism365 Innovation Hub initiatives and innovators.\"</p><p>Find out more about World Table Tennis Day</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from International Olympic Committee on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: International Olympic Committee<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/international-olympic-committee\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/international-olympic-committee</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: International Olympic Committee</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/business-and-professional-services/turning-the-tables-for-sustainable-development-in-india-1041135\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["Tanjun aims to empower marginalised women from these areas by equipping them with the skills to develop sustainable bamboo sports equipment, encouraging not only environmentally friendly practices, but also lasting social change in the mountainous and forest-covered regions below the Himalayas.

Even when we're eating a meal, we're talking about the last one, and the next one.</p><p>I was especially interested in the products that people consume every day, and the impact it has on their lives. It's something I learned from my mom, who gave me a strong nutritional education at home, and over time we've only learned more about how important food and nutrition is to your health.</p><p>Originally, I studied engineering, because I was interested in how things work. I enjoyed learning about industrial engineering, manufacturing and supply chains, but I couldn't picture a career in it, so I went back to school to study marketing and communications.</p><p>How did you end up in Montreal?</p><p>I enrolled in a program organized by the French government that sent recent graduates to work for French companies based all over the world for a year and a half.</p><p>It's a great way to get on-the-job experience to bring back to France. I had always wanted to travel to Canada and there was an opportunity to work in Montreal, so I decided to go for it.</p><p>I always thought Canada was a fantastic country to visit, but I didn't think I would really fall in love with it like I did. I came here with my future wife after we had been together for six months, so this was the first step we made as a couple, and maybe that's why it became so important to me.</p><p>Why did you apply at Danone when you returned?</p><p>I wanted to work for a large French corporation that had a strong presence and a strong impact internationally, both because of the impact it could have, and because I wanted to go abroad again as soon as possible.</p><p>It took 17 years, but I ended up moving eventually, and I never got bored working for this company, even in France.</p><p>What do you like about it?</p><p>You don't stay at a company for 26 years unless you're passionate about the work you're doing.</p><p>Danone's mission is to improve people's health through food while improving the health of the planet. If you want to be a leader in sustainability, you need to be a certain size, and as a global company we can make a significant impact.</p><p>How does Danone promote sustainability and health?</p><p>The two largest parts of our environmental footprint are agriculture and packaging.</p><p>On the agricultural side, we are working with our upstream partners to promote regenerative agriculture to reduce the carbon emissions of milk production worldwide. Danone was also the first major food company to sign a pledge to reduce methane emissions from dairy production 30 per cent by 2030. </p><p>On the packaging side, we are working with stakeholders across the supply chain to ensure our packaging is recycled properly. Last month we announced a $9-million investment in our Boucherville plant to develop more sustainable packaging. In fact, Danone is Canada's largest consumer-facing B-Corp.</p><p>We call ourselves the \"health through food\" company, because nearly 87 per cent of Danone's global dairy, plant-based, water and aqua-drinks portfolio has at least 3.5 out of five stars on the international Health Star Rating system, which is unique in our industry.</p><p>We've accomplished that by focusing on making our foods healthier, and by promoting healthy food categories. For example, we've reduced the amount of sugar in our Canadian products by 30 per cent in the last seven years.</p><p>They say the second brain is in your gut, and we know that a healthy gut has benefits that go beyond digestive health, like mood and mental health. We develop products based on the latest in fermentation and gut health science.</p><p>Activia has been clinically proven to improve digestive health, and if you have Activia twice a day for 14 days in what we call the \"Activia Gut Health Challenge,\" nine people out of 10 report feeling the difference.</p><p>We've also seen a surge in products that are high in protein, which has been proven to not only help build muscle but promote healthier aging. Yogurt is a great way to deliver protein to people in a way that's convenient, versatile, affordable and nutritional, without sugar or fat, which is why we introduced Oikos Pro, a high-protein Greek yogurt, this year in Canada.</p><p>The same is true of plant-based milks, which were pioneered by Silk in the '70s, before being acquired by Danone in 2017.</p><p>It's not just for those who can't tolerate dairy. In fact, many Canadians prefer having their cereal with sweetened almond milk than regular milk because of the taste, but also because it doesn't have as much sugar.</p><p>This category really illustrates how we can have the best of nutrition and taste at once, and we continue to innovate in that direction.</p><p>How does a company that prides itself on health and quality end up connected to a listeria outbreak?</p><p>Those events have been devastating for all of us, because as you said we are a company that is based on health through food, so facing the reality that we might have missed something somewhere that led to these events was very hard.</p><p>This happened a few days after I landed in Canada, and I immediately faced one of the most tragic events in the company in many years.</p><p>The entire industry was caught off guard; we didn't think something like this could happen in this product category.</p><p>I'm proud of how quickly the team worked to protect the health of our consumers. After we made the recall, we discovered that the issues were from a factory of a co-manufacturer and so we completely changed all our sourcing and moved everything into our Danone factories.</p><p>It's been emotionally challenging for everyone, but I'm proud of how we managed to sustain production, raise the bar of all our products in terms of quality and safety, and created awareness across the industry.</p><p>Where does Danone Canada go from here?</p><p>We are operating in consumer goods categories that are growing faster than average, and we need to lead those categories and shape them in a way that meets consumer expectations.</p><p>Canadians want healthier products that take better care of the environment. They want transparency on what goes into them, the science behind them, and the values of the company. </p><p>We're going to double down on what we do best, which is crafting new recipes that not only taste good, but go one step further in terms of health and nutrition.</p><p>We are here to develop such products and to develop trust with our consumers. There is a lot of room for innovation, and we aim to lead those categories, not just to serve them. </p>", "publisher": "thestar.com", "instances": ["How does Danone promote sustainability and health?

Gross profit margins jumped (to ~19% vs 12% a year ago) even though revenues were seasonally lower . Management reports that demand remains robust and Q2 blended fertilizer sales have already topped last year's levels, signaling that the year-start softness was due to normal crop-cycle timing rather than weakening demand .</p><p>Key financial highlights are: //st * Revenue: C$0 .4 M vs C$1 .3 M (Q1'24) . The drop reflects expected seasonal cycling of crop nutrient needs, but demand is strong and customer volumes are rebounding. * Gross Profit &amp;Margin: C$0 .1 M vs C$0 .2 M (Q1'24); gross margin ~19% vs 12% a year ago . This ~7-point margin gain reflects higher selling prices and lower input costs per tonne. * Net Loss: C$1.2 M vs C$1.6 M (Q1'24) . The loss narrowed by C$0 .4 M, largely due to the improved gross margin and tighter cost control. * Operating Cash Flow: +C$0.1 M vs C$0.2 M (Q1'24) . Replenish turned positive cash flow from operations for the first quarter, reflecting the leaner cost structure and better margins. * Facility and Sales Commitments: The Beiseker granulation plant has completed interior upgrades and is in final commissioning. Full capacity (~2,000 tonnes/month) is on track by mid-2025 , and management already has firm orders for the first ~6,000 tonnes of output , ensuring a clear revenue ramp. * Sustainability (ESG) Strength: Replenish's fertilizer is 100% Canadian-made with almost 100% Canadian inputs . This fully domestic supply chain (supporting local agriculture and workers) adds ESG appeal and protects margins against global trade disruptions.</p><p>Building on Prior Strategy</p><p>These results validate the company's recent strategic moves. After FY2024, Replenish raised about C$5.6million (debt/equity) to complete the Beiseker plant and extend its distribution network . That capital infusion is now paying off: as we noted in our earlier FY2024 commentary, the company was already seeing gross-profit gains in late 2024 . The Q1 outcome shows this trend continuing the plant upgrades and broader market reach are driving better unit economics and a stronger customer pipeline.</p><p>Outlook for FY2025</p><p>We expect these early signs to translate into robust full-year results. Spring planting is underway, and management reports that early Q2 sales exceed last year's pace . Once Beiseker hits full output, annual run-rate volume could exceed 20,00024,000 tonnes, which at current margins would substantially boost revenue and profits. Moreover, the company's disciplined cost base suggests further margin expansion as scale grows. In our view, Q1's combination of improving gross margins, positive cash flow, and committed sales order book confirms that Replenish Nutrients is on track to meet its 2025 growth targets. We remain optimistic in our outlook given that the Q1 results underscore the company's strengthened financial profile and the long-term upside of its regenerative fertilizer platform. 2025 is set to be a big turn around year for Replenish Nutrients .</p><p>About ESGFIRE</p><p>ESGFIRE is an investment company and research firm that focuses on ESG companies with either an environmentally friendly service or product.

Within days of his arrival, however, the Canadian Food Inspection Agency issued a national recall of plant-based milk alternatives from a production facility that makes its flagship almond milk, Silk - among other brands - due to a suspected listeria outbreak.</p><p>Guichard says the company has spent the past year trying to regain the trust of Canadian consumers by investing in its health and safety practices, while furthering its sustainability efforts and developing new products to meet changing consumer preferences.</p><p>The Star recently spoke with Guichard from Danone Canada's headquarters in Boucherville, just outside Montreal, about the organization's long-standing commitment to taste, sustainability and health, and the challenges of confronting a tragedy that seemed to call those principals into question.</p><p>Did you always want to work</p><p> in the food industry?</p><p>As a French person, food is the only thing we talk about. Even when we're eating a meal, we're talking about the last one, and the next one.</p><p>I was especially interested in the products that people consume every day, and the impact it has on their lives. It's something I learned from my mom, who gave me a strong nutritional education at home, and over time we've only learned more about how important food and nutrition is to your health.</p><p>Originally, I studied engineering, because I was interested in how things work. I enjoyed learning about industrial engineering, manufacturing and supply chains, but I couldn't picture a career in it, so I went back to school to study marketing and communications.</p><p>How did you end up in Montreal?</p><p>I enrolled in a program organized by the French government that sent recent graduates to work for French companies based all over the world for a year and a half.</p><p>It's a great way to get on-the-job experience to bring back to France. I had always wanted to travel to Canada and there was an opportunity to work in Montreal, so I decided to go for it.</p><p>I always thought Canada was a fantastic country to visit, but I didn't think I would really fall in love with it like I did. I came here with my future wife after we had been together for six months, so this was the first step we made as a couple, and maybe that's why it became so important to me.</p><p>Why did you apply</p><p> at Danone when you returned?</p><p>I wanted to work for a large French corporation that had a strong presence and a strong impact internationally, both because of the impact it could have, and because I wanted to go abroad again as soon as possible.</p><p>It took 17 years, but I ended up moving eventually, and I never got bored working for this company, even in France.</p><p>What do you like about it?</p><p>You don't stay at a company for 26 years unless you're passionate about the work you're doing.</p><p>Danone's mission is to improve people's health through food while improving the health of the planet. If you want to be a leader in sustainability, you need to be a certain size, and as a global company we can make a significant impact.</p><p>How does Danone promote </p><p>sustainability and health?</p><p>The two largest parts of our environmental footprint are agriculture and packaging.</p><p>On the agricultural side, we are working with our upstream partners to promote regenerative agriculture to reduce the carbon emissions of milk production worldwide. Danone was also the first major food company to sign a pledge to reduce methane emissions from dairy production 30 per cent by 2030. </p><p>On the packaging side, we are working with stakeholders across the supply chain to ensure our packaging is recycled properly. Last month we announced a $9-million investment in our Boucherville plant to develop more sustainable packaging. In fact, Danone is Canada's largest consumer-facing B-Corp.</p><p>We call ourselves the \"health through food\" company, because nearly 87 per cent of Danone's global dairy, plant-based, water and aqua-drinks portfolio has at least 3.5 out of five stars on the international Health Star Rating system, which is unique in our industry.</p><p>We've accomplished that by focusing on making our foods healthier, and by promoting healthy food categories. For example, we've reduced the amount of sugar in our Canadian products by 30 per cent in the last seven years.</p><p>They say the second brain is in your gut, and we know that a healthy gut has benefits that go beyond digestive health, like mood and mental health. We develop products based on the latest in fermentation and gut health science.</p><p>Activia has been clinically proven to improve digestive health, and if you have Activia twice a day for 14 days in what we call the \"Activia Gut Health Challenge,\" nine people out of 10 report feeling the difference.</p><p>We've also seen a surge in products that are high in protein, which has been proven to not only help build muscle but promote healthier aging. Yogurt is a great way to deliver protein to people in a way that's convenient, versatile, affordable and nutritional, without sugar or fat, which is why we introduced Oikos Pro, a high-protein Greek yogurt, this year in Canada.</p><p>The same is true of plant-based milks, which were pioneered by Silk in the '70s, before being acquired by Danone in 2017.</p><p>It's not just for those who can't tolerate dairy. In fact, many Canadians prefer having their cereal with sweetened almond milk than regular milk because of the taste, but also because it doesn't have as much sugar.</p><p>This category really illustrates how we can have the best of nutrition and taste at once, and we continue to innovate in that direction.</p><p>How does a company that prides itself on health and quality end up connected to a listeria outbreak?</p><p>Those events have been devastating for all of us, because as you said we are a company that is based on health through food, so facing the reality that we might have missed something somewhere that led to these events was very hard.</p><p>This happened a few days after I landed in Canada, and I immediately faced one of the most tragic events in the company in many years.</p><p>The entire industry was caught off guard; we didn't think something like this could happen in this product category.</p><p>I'm proud of how quickly the team worked to protect the health of our consumers. After we made the recall, we discovered that the issues were from a factory of a co-manufacturer and so we completely changed all our sourcing and moved everything into our Danone factories.</p><p>It's been emotionally challenging for everyone, but I'm proud of how we managed to sustain production, raise the bar of all our products in terms of quality and safety, and created awareness across the industry.</p><p>Where does Danone Canada</p><p> go from here?</p><p>We are operating in consumer goods categories that are growing faster than average, and we need to lead those categories and shape them in a way that meets consumer expectations.</p><p>Canadians want healthier products that take better care of the environment. They want transparency on what goes into them, the science behind them, and the values of the company. </p><p>We're going to double down on what we do best, which is crafting new recipes that not only taste good, but go one step further in terms of health and nutrition.</p><p>We are here to develop such products and to develop trust with our consumers. There is a lot of room for innovation, and we aim to lead those categories, not just to serve them. </p>", "publisher": "The Toronto Star", "instances": ["How does Danone promote sustainability and health?
