Rising global temperatures are intensifying droughts, accelerating extreme weather events, and disrupting the availability and quality of freshwater across the world. These disruptions are no longer \"distant threats.\" They already impact operations, value chains, and local communities.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Despite this, many companies continue to treat water risk as a peripheral issue in their climate strategies. Water is often overlooked while carbon reduction and energy transitions take center stage. That approach is no longer sustainable.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">To ensure operational continuity, meet rising regulatory expectations, and build long-term business value, companies must treat water stewardship as a core pillar of their climate resilience planning.</p><p>Why Water Must Be Central to Your Climate Strategy</p><p>Water-related disruptions are escalating. In 2024 alone, the U.S. experienced 27 separate billion-dollar weather and climate disasters, including droughts, floods, and storms-nearly triple the long-term annual average. These events are no longer rare. Industries across the board are facing growing threats: factories halted due to flooding, supply chains broken by water shortages, and community tensions fueled by the overuse or contamination of shared water resources.</p><p>While climate change is a global crisis, water is often how we feel its impacts first-and most acutely. Drought, flooding, and water stress are amplifying in places already under strain. These disruptions can destabilize business operations faster than many other climate risks.</p><p>Importantly, water risk is not just a site-level issue. It's shaped by broader watershed dynamics-like upstream over-extraction, aging infrastructure, or shared pollution burdens-that extend far beyond a facility's fence line. On-site resilience alone isn't enough. Managing water as a shared resource means looking outside your operations and engaging with communities, governments, and local partners.</p><p>Related Resource:12 Companies Making A Real Difference In Corporate Water Stewardship</p><p>Understanding Physical and Transition Risks Through a Water Lens</p><p>Water risk isn't a single challenge, but a convergence of physical and transition risks that threaten business value in different ways.</p><p>Physical risks include:</p><p>- Droughts that reduce freshwater availability<br/>- Flooding and sea-level rise that damage infrastructure<br/>- Water pollution that affects both input water and discharge compliance<br/>- Infrastructure strain in areas with outdated or failing water systems</p><p>Transition risks, meanwhile, stem from evolving expectations and pressures, including:</p><p>- Stricter water regulations at the local, national, or regional level<br/>- Climate-related litigation that raises operating costs and exposes reputational vulnerabilities<br/>- Volatility in input costs, such as energy and raw materials, that can lead to major swings in operating expenses and financial performance<br/>- Increased pressure from consumers and civil society for responsible water use</p><p>Industries from tech to textiles to agribusiness are increasingly exposed to these threats. And while the specific risks vary by geography, the trend is clear: water is becoming a defining business constraint.</p><p>Related Case Study: Learn how companies in Europe and Central Asia are building water resilience</p><p>Regulatory and Market Expectations Are Rising</p><p>If water risk isn't already on your compliance radar, it will be soon.</p><p>The EU's Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) is one of the few mandatory frameworks that specifically requires companies to disclose water-related impacts as a standalone topic.</p><p>Elsewhere, an increasing number of national and subnational regulations are requiring disclosure of climate-related risks-including water-as part of broader environmental reporting. These often align with voluntary frameworks such as the ISSB's sustainability standards, which many jurisdictions are starting to adopt or reference.</p><p>Environmental management systems like ISO 14001 already require businesses to assess and mitigate water-related impacts. Meanwhile, investors and consumers increasingly demand transparency around water usage, pollution prevention, and watershed engagement.</p><p>Companies that don't proactively address water risk will find themselves playing catch-up and risking regulatory penalties, reduced access to capital, and reputational damage.</p><p>The Business Case for Water Stewardship</p><p>Addressing water risk is smart business beyond merely addressing compliance. Companies that invest in water stewardship often see measurable improvements in operational efficiency, cost savings, and brand equity.</p><p>- Water-efficient processes reduce utility bills and safeguard production continuity.<br/>- Proactive engagement in watershed management reduces the likelihood of shared crises like depleted aquifers or toxic runoff.<br/>- A strong water strategy improves ESG ratings and builds trust with stakeholders and communities.</p><p>Collective action also matters. Companies that collaborate with peers, governments, and civil society on local water issues help create more stable, predictable operating environments for entire regions.</p><p>Related Podcast: Listen to The Critical Role of Water Stewardship in a Changing Climate</p><p>Embedding Water into Your Climate Strategy</p><p>To meaningfully reduce exposure to water risk, companies must move from reactive compliance to a proactive, integrated strategy. This means:</p><p>- Assessing water risks across all priority supplier sites, using both physical data and stakeholder insight<br/>- Setting meaningful water use reduction targets, aligned with local watershed conditions and science-based thresholds<br/>- Embedding water into ESG and value chain integration, especially where value chains rely on water-intensive processes<br/>- Establishing governance, accountability, and reporting structures to track progress and drive continuous improvement</p><p>Water risk is a material business risk, and must be treated with the same rigor and urgency as carbon or energy.</p><p>Global Execution Requires Local Expertise</p><p>One of the greatest challenges in addressing water risk is that conditions vary widely by region. What works in one geography may fail in another due to regulatory, hydrological, or cultural differences.</p><p>Global companies need partners who can operationalize corporate water strategies at the local level-ensuring site-specific compliance, stakeholder engagement, and watershed alignment. Doing this effectively requires both broad geographic coverage and deep, region-specific expertise.</p><p>Inogen Alliance provides on-the-ground technical expertise and regulatory insight in over 150 countries, enabling companies to implement water strategies that meet local requirements, reduce risk, and build trust with regional stakeholders.</p><p>Water Risk Is Climate Risk</p><p>The bottom line is clear: companies that treat water as central to their climate strategy will be more resilient, more compliant, and better positioned to compete in a resource-constrained world.</p><p>Now is the time to take stock. Where does water sit in your climate risk assessments? Are you adequately prepared to manage disruptions across your operations and value chain? Do your policies address both site-level and watershed-level challenges?</p><p>Don't wait until the next drought, flood, or regulatory shift to act.

By integrating UK Climate Projections (UKCP) scenarios, investors can anticipate fluvial, pluvial, and coastal flood impacts, ensuring assets remain insurable, financially viable, and compliant with evolving regulations such as the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS S2), previously the Taskforce on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD).</p><p>Key Considerations for Investors and Developers</p><p>- Fluvial, Pluvial, and Coastal Risks - Understanding diverse flood risks ensures effective asset protection and strategic investment decisions.<br/>- Regulatory Evolution &amp; Market Dynamics - UK policy shifts demand climate resilience strategies for sustainable investments.<br/>- Insurance Feasibility &amp; Asset Value Implications - Flood-exposed properties face higher premiums, reduced liquidity, and exit strategy limitations.</p><p>Leveraging Flood Maps for Smarter Site Selection</p><p>Modern Flood Maps, including those from the UK Environment Agency and other geospatial providers, offer vital insights into flood zones, historical flood extents, and modelled projections. These visual tools help developers and investors make informed decisions about site selection and risk exposure. However, Flood Maps alone are not sufficient for due diligence. They should be used alongside bespoke flood risk assessments and other relevant third-party reports that account for future climate scenarios and site-specific variables such as elevation, soil type, and drainage capacity. By combining mapping with relevant analytical assessments, stakeholders can avoid undervaluing, or overexposing assets.</p><p>Mitigation Strategies for Resilient Investments</p><p>- Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS) - Critical for insurance and investment viability, SuDS reduce flood risk while enhancing environmental sustainability.<br/>- Resilient Site Design &amp; Adaptive Infrastructure - Flood-resistant materials, elevated structures, and site drainage enhancements protect assets from climate-driven risks.<br/>- Financial Risk Modelling for Investors - Incorporating flood exposure into financial forecasting supports accurate valuation and market positioning.</p><p>The Role of Flood Risk Assessments in ESG and Sustainability Reporting</p><p>Flood risk has become a key disclosure topic in ESG frameworks. Investors and publicly traded companies are expected to report climate-related risks, including flooding, in alignment with IFRS S2, CDP, and other global reporting standards. A thorough flood risk assessment supports transparency and demonstrates proactive risk management. These insights can also help companies meet stakeholder expectations and avoid reputational harm tied to climate inaction or underreported liabilities.</p><p>Who Needs a Flood Risk Assessment?</p><p>While commonly associated with large residential or commercial assets, flood risk assessments are essential across many sectors: retail, logistics, manufacturing, education, healthcare, and more. Transactions involving data centers, infrastructure assets, even brownfield with a view to redevelop in the future and often require flood risk evaluation, especially where Flood Maps demonstrate uncertainty or indicate moderate to high flood potential. Lenders, pension funds, and insurers may request an FRA during due diligence to assess long-term viability and ensure assets are not exposed to unmanaged risks.</p><p>Impact on Insurability, Site Value, and Long-Term Viability</p><p>Flood exposure influences capital investment, portfolio performance, and asset liquidity. Poor flood resilience can lead to:</p><p>- Higher financing costs due to lender risk concerns.<br/>- Decreased asset attractiveness for institutional investors.<br/>- Challenges in securing property insurance and market valuation stability.</p><p>Linking FRAs to Transaction Support</p><p>Flood risk isn't just a consideration; it is a transactional necessity. A thorough FRA ensures:</p><p>- Clear risk evaluation for buyers and sellers.<br/>- Transparent insurance feasibility for investment decisions.<br/>- Strategic positioning of assets in evolving financial landscapes.</p><p>The Antea Group UK Advantage</p><p>At Antea Group UK, we provide specialist flood risk advisory, supporting investors, asset managers, and lenders with:</p><p>- Comprehensive flood assessments tailored for transactions.<br/>- Climate resilience risk modelling to inform financial decisions.<br/>- Data-driven insights to protect asset liquidity and investment viability.<br/>- SuDS integration and resilience-based flood mitigation strategies.</p><p>Flood Risk Assessments Key Takeaways</p><p>- Flood risk is a financial risk - Climate-driven flooding impacts asset value, insurance availability, and investor confidence.<br/>- Standard Flood Maps are not enough - They must be supplemented with bespoke, forward-looking flood risk assessments that incorporate climate projections.<br/>- Flood Risk Assessments are critical for transactions and future development - From supporting acquisitions and divestments to securing planning permission, FRAs play a pivotal role.<br/>- Mitigation strategies protect asset value - Tools like Sustainable Drainage Systems (SuDS), resilient design, and adaptive infrastructure are essential for long-term viability.<br/>- Flood risk assessments support ESG reporting - They align with frameworks like IFRS S2 and demonstrate climate resilience to stakeholders.<br/>- Investors across all sectors benefit - FRAs are essential not only for large developments but also for logistics, retail, data centers, and institutional portfolios.</p><p>Conclusion: Why Proactive Flood Risk Assessments Matter</p><p>For investors, flood risk directly impacts financial performance, transaction success, and long-term asset viability.

It is embedded in corporate sustainability, supply chains, and ESG mandates.<br/>- Finance is a critical enabler, with calls for creative, localized funding models and stronger integration into ESG and investment frameworks.<br/>- Collective action is essential but complex, requiring trust, transparency, and local ownership to succeed.<br/>- Communication matters-simplifying language and storytelling are vital to engaging stakeholders, driving action and breaking out of echo chambers.<br/>- Policy frameworks must catch up, with stronger integration of water into climate adaptation plans and global governance. Scalable impact will come from localized solutions, backed by strong partnerships between government, business, and finance<br/>- AWS Standard Version 3.0 introduces streamlined requirements, deeper integration of climate and biodiversity, and new expectations for collective action and water reuse.</p><p>As the climate crisis intensifies and biodiversity loss accelerates, water stewardship is emerging not just as a sustainability imperative-but as a strategic, economic, and social necessity. At the recent Alliance for Water Stewardship (AWS) Forum, leaders from over 160 organizations across 39 countries gathered to explore the evolving landscape of water stewardship. There were diverse conversations across sectors and roles, impressive case studies, and the call to action unmistakable: water connects everything.</p><p>Inogen Alliance was a sponsor of the Forum for the third year, firmly establishing our local expertise with global coverage for water stewardship. Our Associate sponsors included: Antea Brasil, Antea GroupFrance, Antea Group UK, Antea GroupUSA, Baden Consulting in Switzerland, Chola MS Risk Services Limited (CMSRS) in India, HPC France, HPC Italy, HPC Germany, Hydrophil in Austria, Mediterra in Spain, Peter J. Ramsay &amp; Associates in Australia, and Tonkin + Taylor in New Zealand.</p><p>Here are the key insights that stood out from our Global Water Working Group:</p><p>1. Water Risk as a Strategic Starting Point</p><p>A recurring theme throughout the AWS Forum was the framing of water as a business risk-not just an environmental concern. Organizations are increasingly recognizing that water scarcity, quality degradation, and watershed instability pose direct threats to operations, supply chains, and long-term resilience. This risk-based lens is helping companies prioritize water stewardship as a strategic imperative.</p><p>Reliable data and transparent reporting were emphasized as foundational tools. By identifying high-risk areas and understanding water dependencies, businesses can make informed decisions that protect both their operations and the ecosystems they rely on.</p><p>\"Using risk to operations as a starting point, data and reporting are key.\"</p><p>2. From Box-Ticking to Basin Thinking</p><p>The forum also challenged the tendency to treat water stewardship as a compliance exercise. Speakers urged a shift from box-ticking metrics to outcome-based approaches that prioritize overall watershed health. This means moving beyond isolated site-level actions and embracing basin-scale collaboration, shared data, and nature-based solutions.</p><p>The updated AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this evolution, emphasizing healthy freshwater ecosystems and catchment-level resilience. The message was clear: stewardship must be credible, inclusive, and focused on long-term impact-not just short-term optics.</p><p>\"Watershed health is our indicator-are we moving the needle?\"</p><p>3. Water, Climate, and Biodiversity: A Triad of Interdependence</p><p>Water is no longer a siloed issue. It is deeply intertwined with climate resilience and biodiversity. Sessions emphasized that effective water stewardship must integrate ecosystem services, soil health, and nature-based solutions. The upcoming AWS Standard Version 3.0 reflects this shift, embedding climate resilience and biodiversity into its core requirements-marking a significant evolution in how we define and measure stewardship.</p><p>\"Water is a strategic entry point for broader conversations on biodiversity and ecosystem health.\"</p><p>4. Finance as a Catalyst for Scalable Impact</p><p>Finance emerged as a central enabler of stewardship. From blended finance models in industrial parks to calls for CFO engagement in water risk mitigation, the message was clear: we need creative, accessible, and localized financing mechanisms. The forum highlighted the need to mainstream water into investment decisions and align financial flows with watershed outcomes.</p><p>\"Water stability means financial stability. Stewardship must move from optional to strategic.\"</p><p>5. Collective Action: From Concept to Credible Practice</p><p>Whether in industrial parks, mining operations, or river basin initiatives, collective action was a recurring theme. But the forum also acknowledged the complexity: collective action is hard, messy, and often underfunded. Success stories-from a few different panels in attendance-show that trust, transparency, and local ownership are essential ingredients.</p><p>\"Stewardship is a handshake-steeped in diplomacy.\"</p><p>6. Communication: Giving Water a Voice</p><p>Technical jargon and ESG-heavy language can alienate the very stakeholders we need to engage. The forum emphasized the power of storytelling, inclusive language, and education to build momentum. Water needs a voice-one that resonates across sectors, cultures, and communities.</p><p>\"We need more than good words-we need to back up claims with action.\"</p><p>7. Policy and Governance: Bridging the Gaps</p><p>International policy dialogues revealed a fragmented landscape. While some progress has been made-such as the new water target at COP Baku-many global frameworks still fail to prioritize water. The call was for stronger integration of water into national adaptation plans, ESG regulations, and even defense strategies.</p><p>\"If we fail on water, we fail economically.\"</p><p>8. AWS Standard Version 3.0: Raising the Bar for Stewardship</p><p>One of the most anticipated updates at the forum was the upcoming launch of the AWS Standard Version 3.0, expected in Q4 2025. This revision reflects the growing complexity and urgency of water-related challenges. The Standard revision session served as part of the global public consultation on the second draft of the AWS Standard V3.0. Some of the key changes in the draft include:</p><p>- Streamlined Requirements: The total number of requirements has been reduced by 32 in comparison to V2.0, improving clarity and auditability while maintaining rigor.<br/>- Climate and Biodiversity Integration: New emphasis on catchment-based climate resilience and the protection of Healthy Freshwater Ecosystems and Biodiversity.<br/>- Collective Action as a Differentiator: Now a requirement exclusively for Gold certification, reinforcing its importance in achieving meaningful impact.<br/>- Improved Alignment with ESRS: Enhanced interoperability with the European Sustainability Reporting Standard (ESRS) on Water and Marine Resources (E3).<br/>- Focus on Innovation: Greater attention to water reuse, desalination, and their correlated impacts.</p><p>This evolution of the AWS Standard signals a shift toward more practical, scalable, and outcome-oriented stewardship-one that aligns with both business realities and ecological imperatives.</p><p>9. What's Next: From Echo Chambers to Ecosystems of Change</p><p>The closing message of the forum was both a challenge and an invitation: we must break out of our echo chambers. That means amplifying underrepresented voices, especially from the Global South and Indigenous communities. It means building bridges across sectors, geographies, and disciplines. And it means embracing water not just as a resource to manage-but as a foundation for resilience, equity, and shared prosperity.</p><p>Final Thoughts</p><p>The AWS Forum made one thing abundantly clear: water stewardship is no longer a niche concern. It is a global imperative that touches every sector, every community, and every future. As we move forward, let's remember that water connects us all-and that credible, collective action is our most powerful tool for change.</p><p>Stay tuned for more to come from our Global Water Working Group, including an upcoming podcast on the interconnection between water stewardship and climate resilience.

Douglas pointed out that as climate conditions shift, invasive species and competition for resources can lead to the loss of biodiversity. \u201cWe need to keep an eye on how climate might be promoting a narrowing of species diversity. If we don\u2019t act, less robust species could be lost, impacting the entire ecosystem.\u201d</p><p>Local Action and Economic Impacts</p><p>Beyond government-led initiatives, Mr. Douglas emphasized the role of local businesses and municipalities in preparing for climate risks. \u201cMany businesses already factor climate adaptation into their continuity planning, often without realizing it,\u201d he said. \u201cSupply chain disruptions, road closures, and extreme weather events all force businesses to think outside the box. But as these events become more frequent, adaptation needs to be even more intentional.\u201d</p><p>Municipal governments, too, are beginning to integrate climate adaptation into their policies. Douglas pointed to efforts by municipalities like Central Manitoulin and Billings Township, which have conducted risk assessments and begun developing strategies. \u201cThe fact that local governments are paying attention is encouraging. The next step is implementation.\u201d</p><p>The Role of Policy and Individual Action</p><p>While large-scale policy is necessary, Mr. Douglas stressed the importance of community-led climate action. \u201cBoth are equally important,\u201d he said. \u201cLocal knowledge brings a level of detail that policymakers can\u2019t always capture. But at the provincial and national level, government resources can enable resilience efforts by providing funding, guidelines, and regulations.\u201d</p><p>As for what individuals can do, Mr. Douglas encouraged people to take practical steps to safeguard their homes. \u201cHomeowners can check their sump pumps, improve grading around their foundations, and take other precautions to prevent flooding,\u201d he suggested. \u201cMore broadly, we need to hold our municipal and provincial governments accountable to keep climate resilience on the agenda.\u201d</p><p>Looking Ahead</p><p>Despite the challenges, Mr. Douglas remains hopeful. \u201cWhat gives me hope is that we\u2019re seeing action at multiple levels\u2014government, businesses, communities, and individuals.

Coast to coast, bad air quality and extreme heat are keeping Canadians confined indoors. In Nova Scotia, the threat of fire is so extreme that the government has levied a $25,000 fine  for going into the woods, hunting, fishing, camping, hiking. The things we want to enjoy as Canadians, in our brief, precious summers, are increasingly off limits in this hot, smoky, existential summer, which reminds us, yet again, that climate change is here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prime Minister Mark Carney was elected on the promise of three things: first, to chart a course for Canada that is separate from that of the U.S. Second, to build the economy. Third, and less tangibly, to restore a sense of national pride and purpose. And yet, there is something not yet on his agenda which we could pursue as a country that meets these three priorities. Bold, courageous, meaningful climate action.</p><p>Canadians are clear; the vast majority of us reject the self-destructive path the U.S. is on under Donald Trump. In addition to the autocracy, the racism, the chaos, this administration has taken a profoundly destructive path on climate, shuttering research, gutting pollution regulation, kneecapping renewable industries. It's ecocide, bought and paid for by the half-billion dollars given to Trump's campaign by the oil and gas industry.</p><p>And yet, as a sovereign nation, we have the chance to chart our own course. In response to this ecocidal turn from our neighbours, we could quietly fold our climate plans, give up on the future, stop looking our kids in the eye. Or we could get more ambitious, more bold, pursuing big renewable projects and upping our climate goals. This also has the positive trade implication of aligning more with the EU on this critical issue.</p><p>In terms of the economy, while the perception in the past has been that pursuing climate action comes at the expense of the economy, thanks to modern technology, that is no longer true. Solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of energy; switching to renewables provides savings for households and municipalities alike. Pursue bold projects such as an east-west energy grid, high speed rail, public transit, rooftop solar, home retrofits and climate resilience projects - all nation-building projects that would juice our economy.</p><p>By contrast, investing in further fossil fuel technology is a bet on disaster, as Carney himself warned repeatedly while at the Bank of England.  Those investing in fossil fuel are either choosing this path, or making an exceptionally risky financial bet on what will likely be a stranded asset, unsellable in a better future. Right now, Canada, and especially Alberta, are dangerously dependent on the fossil fuel industry economically. The way out of this is not to double down, to pour more into this risky single investment; it's to diversify.</p><p>Finally, care for the environment and the natural world is a deep and often unacknowledged part of our national identity. Poll after poll shows that a strong majority of us are concerned about climate change. And no matter where you go in this country - and as a touring musician, I've been everywhere - Canadians of all political stripes are people that love and care for the natural world. We may have rejected the carbon tax - a tax which, in a cost of living crisis, felt like one more burden. But we consistently tell pollsters that we want climate action.</p><p>This past election shows us that pride and a sense of national purpose matter.

Coast to coast, bad air quality and extreme heat are keeping Canadians confined indoors. In Nova Scotia, the threat of fire is so extreme that the government has levied a $25,000 fine on going into the woods, hunting, fishing, camping, hiking. The things we want to enjoy as Canadians, in our brief, precious summers are increasingly off limits in this hot, smoky, existential summer, which reminds us, yet again, that climate change is here.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Prime Minister Mark Carney was elected on the promise of three things: first, to chart a course for Canada that is separate from that of the U.S. Second, to build the economy. Third, and less tangibly, to restore a sense of national pride and purpose. And yet, there is something not yet on his agenda which we could pursue as a country that meets these three priorities. Bold, courageous, meaningful climate action.</p><p>Canadians are clear; the vast majority of us reject the self-destructive path the U.S. is on under Donald Trump. In addition to the autocracy, the racism, the chaos, this administration has taken a profoundly destructive path on climate, shuttering research, gutting pollution regulation, kneecapping renewable industries. It's ecocide, bought and paid for by the half-billion dollars given to Trump's campaign by the oil and gas industry.</p><p>And yet, as a sovereign nation, we have the chance to chart our own course. In response to this ecocidal turn from our neighbours, we could quietly fold our climate plans, give up on the future, stop looking our kids in the eye. Or we could get more ambitious, more bold, pursuing big renewable projects and upping our climate goals. This also has the positive trade implication of aligning more with the EU on this critical issue.</p><p>In terms of the economy, while the perception in the past has been that pursuing climate action comes at the expense of the economy, thanks to modern technology, that is no longer true. Solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of energy; switching to renewables provides savings for households and municipalities alike. Pursue bold projects such as an east-west energy grid, high speed rail, public transit, rooftop solar, home retrofits and climate resilience projects - all nation-building projects that would juice our economy.</p><p>By contrast, investing in further fossil fuel technology is a bet on disaster, as Carney himself warned repeatedly while at the Bank of England. Current global investments in fossil fuel are commensurate with disastrous, civilization-ending warming of three to five degrees. Those investing in fossil fuel are either choosing this path, or making an exceptionally risky financial bet on what will likely be a stranded asset, unsellable in a better future. Right now, Canada, and especially Alberta, are dangerously dependent on the fossil fuel industry economically. The way out of this is not to double down, to pour more into this risky single investment; it's to diversify.</p><p>Finally, care for the environment and the natural world is a deep and often unacknowledged part of our national identity. Poll after poll shows that a strong majority of us are concerned about climate change. And no matter where you go in this country - and as a touring musician, I've been everywhere - Canadians of all political stripes are people that love and care for the natural world. We may have rejected the carbon tax - a tax which, in a cost of living crisis, felt like one more burden. But we consistently tell pollsters that we want climate action.</p><p>This past election shows us that pride and a sense of national purpose matter. Real, bold climate action offers us a path not just to greater economic stability, but to a real sense of ourselves and our identity as a country that does the right thing.</p><p>Bold climate action is necessary for a livable future. It is also a way for our prime minister to realize his national goals all at once. The lack of action here is not just morally wrong; it's a massive missed opportunity for this government.</p><p>Tamara Lindeman is a climate activist and </p><p>musician performing under the name The Weather Station.

This has been a year of bold moves, agile responses, and powerful collaborations, all aimed at tackling climate challenges head-on and raising the bar for environmental sustainability across the beverage sector. From accelerating climate resilience to setting new benchmarks in industry standards, BIER and its members have turned ambition into action. Now, with the final quarter ahead, BIER is harnessing this momentum to close out the year with impact and step into 2026 on the strongest footing yet.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Advancing Technical Guidance</p><p>The year began with the release of Beverage Industry Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Sector Guidance Version 4.3. This update aligned the sector with emerging standards such as the CSRD and SBTi's FLAG guidance, introduced enhanced methodologies for recycling, logistics, and cooling models, and strengthened protocols for data verification and disclosure. Collectively, these updates brought the industry one step closer to achieving net-zero emissions by 2040-2050.</p><p>Shortly thereafter, BIER published the Beverage Industry EUDR Interpretation Guide, a practical, sector-specific resource to help beverage companies navigate the European Union Deforestation Regulation (EUDR). With compliance deadlines beginning in late 2025 for larger operators, this guide provided actionable tools for mapping supply chains, assessing and mitigating risk, and integrating EUDR compliance with broader no-deforestation and climate commitments.</p><p>Innovation Through Collaboration</p><p>BIER's Sustainable Coolers Coolition continued to unite members in developing solutions that reduce the environmental impact of cooling systems while safeguarding technical and business performance. This initiative reinforced one of BIER's core commitments: advancing technologies that conserve energy and water without compromising quality or efficiency. In 2025, the Coolition also hosted the Cool Challenge, inviting passionate innovators to revolutionize commercial refrigeration for chilled, canned, or bottled beverages at their point of sale. The challenge pushed boundaries, sparked innovation, and inspired sustainable solutions to shape the beverage industry's future.</p><p>BIER's Charco Bendito Watershed Collaboration in Mexico also delivered tangible results in improving water quality and availability through multi-stakeholder action. In 2025, lessons from Charco Bendito began informing similar efforts in new geographies, demonstrating the scalability of BIER's collaborative water stewardship model.</p><p>Staying Ahead of Regulatory Change</p><p>This year, navigating an evolving regulatory landscape wasn't just a priority; it was a strategic advantage. Through the member-only Regulatory Round-Up and Ad-Hoc sessions, BIER kept members ahead of the curve on global disclosure standards, climate legislation, and emissions reporting expectations, not just tracking changes, but anticipating them. These quarterly sessions became a space for real-time intelligence sharing, where peers compared approaches, decoded new requirements, and identified opportunities to align sustainability ambitions with global expectations. The result? Members left not only informed, but equipped to turn regulatory challenges into catalysts for stronger, more credible sustainability strategies.</p><p>Highlighting Industry Leadership</p><p>Throughout 2025, BIER's Member Spotlight series shone a well-deserved light on the people turning sustainability ambition into measurable action. From Justin Merrell of LION to Ana Fernanda Romero of Diageo, and from Heineken's Nicolas Clerget - Chair of BIER - together with colleagues Hannah Hunt and Jade Mahuzier, to David Grant of PepsiCo - BIER's Co-Chair - each story revealed a unique path to driving environmental progress. Their insights, innovations, and on-the-ground impact showcased the many ways BIER members are translating commitments into results, inspiring peers across the global beverage sector.</p><p>Engaging In-Person for Greater Impact</p><p>In May, BIER members converged in the vibrant city of Sevilla, Spain, for the Spring 2025 Roundtable Meeting, hosted by Heineken at the inspiring Fundaci\u00f3n Cruzcampo. Over three days, the venue buzzed with forward-thinking discussions and collaborative problem-solving. Members dove deep into nature-positive strategies, explored innovative ways to measure water replenishment co-benefits, examined breakthroughs in renewable thermal energy, tackled the challenge of making zero-deforestation claims credible, and celebrated the power of industry coalitions in accelerating progress.</p><p>That momentum now carries into the Fall 2025 Roundtable Meeting, set for September in Louisville, Kentucky. Here, members will tackle another slate of high-priority topics, from discussing best practices for implementing Collective Action projects and utilizing green fertilizer to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, to essential discussions on how climate adaptation can be a business driver, with the same energy and focus that has defined the year. These sessions aren't just about sharing updates; they're about reinforcing commitments to watershed health, aligning on regulatory strategies, and charting sustainability roadmaps that will ensure BIER's collective voice remains a powerful force shaping the beverage industry's environmental future.</p><p>Looking to the Final Stretch of 2025</p><p>As we move into the year's final months, BIER is channeling the energy and achievements of 2025 into actionable next steps. Our shared focus is clear: finish strong, build resilience, and enter 2026 positioned to lead. With the dedication of our members and the momentum we've built together, the beverage industry is better equipped than ever to deliver on its sustainability promises, for our communities, our ecosystems, and our future. Together, BIER members are closing out 2025 not just with progress, but with a shared vision: a beverage sector that leads the way in building a sustainable future.</p><p>View additional multimedia and more ESG storytelling from Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable on 3blmedia.com.</p><p>Contact Info:<br/>Spokesperson: Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable<br/>Website: <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/beverage-industry-environmental-roundtable\">https://www.3blmedia.com/profiles/beverage-industry-environmental-roundtable</url><br/>Email: info@3blmedia.com </p><p>SOURCE: Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable</p><p><br/><br/>View the original <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.accessnewswire.com/newsroom/en/business-and-professional-services/summer-reflections-fall-momentum-biers-2025-achievements-and-the-1063895\">press release</url> on ACCESS Newswire</p>", "publisher": "ACCESSWIRE", "instances": ["NORTHAMPTON, MA / ACCESS Newswire / August 21, 2025 / As the heat of summer gives way to the crisp focus of fall, the Beverage Industry Environmental Roundtable (BIER) reflects on a 2025 that has been nothing short of dynamic.

After selective logging of this block in the early 2000s, explains Angela, many of the retained Douglas firs became infested with Douglas fir bark beetles. This endemic pest can help to create more open and diverse forests, but in this case the dead and dying trees that the beetles left in their wake posed a heightened wildfire risk too close to Creston for comfort.</p><p>Sweat, sticks, and satisfying work</p><p>The YCC project aimed to minimize the risk of wildfire by cleaning up the landscape. The crew spent hours cutting, piling, chipping and burning woody debris. The days were hot, hard, and sweaty. But crew members agree it was worth every second of hard work.</p><p>\"I really enjoyed the exercise, finding interesting plants, and spending time with my amazing coworkers,\" said crew member Alina. \"The days were long and often had hard moments, but everyone kept a positive attitude and helped each other out. I really appreciate getting to work with people who have the same values as I do, and they change my outlook on life in little ways every day.\"</p><p>The project not only offered experience with on-the-ground wildfire mitigation but also opened doors for young people to explore careers in forestry, fire management, and even agriculture.</p><p>\"It made me think about firefighting as a future summer job, and confirmed my interest in wildfire mitigation,\" said crew member Maya.</p><p>Passersby likely won't notice much of a change in the landscape now that the work on Goat Mountain is done. But, Angela says, that's kind of the point.</p><p>\"There isn't sometimes a huge change in how we make the ecosystem look. Ecosystems tend to be a little messy \u2013 it's not raked ground or rows of trees. We want to keep them that way, just more resilient.\"</p><p>Circular economy</p><p>Where terrain allowed, the crew chipped wood to deliver to local farms, helping support a circular economy that connects forestry waste to soil-building practices in this agriculture-rich community.</p><p>In early June, the YCC team spent a week helping out on farms that received wood chips, giving them the opportunity to both learn and support sustainable agriculture and rural land stewardship. The wood chips were used for a variety of farm projects including mulching fruit trees, landscaping, and as a mix-in with compost.</p><p>A model for rural climate resilience</p><p>The Goat Mountain project is part of a broader Wildsight initiative to explore how rural communities can build economic resilience while responding to a changing climate.</p><p>The work was funded by the Province of B.C.'s Rural Economic Diversification and Infrastructure Program and RBC Foundation, with the goal of supporting local economies while tackling urgent environmental challenges.</p><p>Through this pilot, Wildsight and partners, including CCF, are exploring the feasibility of producing biochar from forestry waste. Biochar, a form of carbon-rich charcoal, can be used to enhance soil health and sequester carbon. It could be the solution to the \"waste\" left behind from B.C. forestry operations if the methods are proven both feasible and economical. Not only would it add value to forestry operations, biochar would also support wildfire mitigation and a stronger agriculture sector.</p><p>\"The question we're asking is: can this kind of circular economy \u2014 where waste from one sector becomes a resource for another \u2014 help rural communities thrive?\" said Brianna Thompson, West Kootenay YCC co-ordinator.</p><p>Initial research, including interviews with local farmers and forestry experts, suggests multiple potential uses for biochar that extend beyond agriculture and include on-site forest and tree health benefits and many other applications including energy production, building materials, and as a reclamation resource on contaminated sites.</p><p>However, biochar quality varies greatly depending on how it is produced and all of those contacted highlighted the importance of regional research using biochar to find the most suitable benefit.

When we are brought into a project during the planning and design phase, we can make the most meaningful impact, steering decisions that avoid sensitive habitats, reduce construction impacts, and improve long-term sustainability outcomes.</p><p>Real-World Examples: Building with Nature in Action:</p><p>UAE Coastal Development Masterplan</p><p>In a confidential but large-scale coastal development in the UAE, Terra Nexus provided ecological mapping and strategic advice on land use. Our goal: identify which areas were suitable for development and which should be preserved due to environmental value.</p><p>Results:</p><p>- Protected kilometers of seagrass beds and coral reefs<br/>- Conserved ecologically valuable land from being cleared<br/>- Integrated blue-green infrastructure to mitigate flood risk and cool urban microclimates</p><p>By applying geospatial analysis and ecological assessments, we helped the project team design a world-class destination with a minimized environmental footprint.</p><p>Mountain Hospitality Destination in Saudi Arabia</p><p>In a mountainous, forested region of Saudi Arabia, Terra Nexus led the environmental framework for a new hospitality and residential masterplan. Despite its remote location, the project presented ecological challenges: flood-prone zones, erosion risks, and forested areas at risk of being cleared.</p><p>Some of the solutions that we implemented on the project included:</p><p>- Avoiding high-risk areas and integrating erosion protection measures<br/>- Creating ecological corridors for wildlife movement and habitat connectivity<br/>- Developing a native planting palette tailored to the site's climate and soil<br/>- Enhancing forest preservation within the development envelope</p><p>This case shows how even complex sites with rugged terrains can benefit from an approach that works with, not against, natural features.</p><p>Retrofitting Nature into Existing Projects</p><p>While early planning is ideal, building with nature isn't limited to greenfield sites. Even in already-developed areas, upgrades and rehabilitation projects can bring environmental and social value.</p><p>For example, we partnered with engineers to improve water circulation in a small UAE marina where stagnation had reduced water quality. With minor engineered interventions, marine health improved, benefiting both environmental quality and overall user experience.</p><p>In these retrofit scenarios, phasing and stakeholder coordination are key. Creative thinking, combined with empathy for operational realities, helps deliver win-win outcomes.</p><p>Key Benefits of Building with Nature</p><p>Whether you're working in the UAE or halfway around the world, here are five compelling reasons to adopt a building with nature strategy:</p><p>- Lower capital and operational costs - Leveraging natural topography, materials, and systems can reduce the need for expensive earthworks or engineered infrastructure.<br/>- Enhanced climate resilience - Nature-based designs reduce vulnerability to flooding, erosion, and extreme heat.<br/>- Improved livability and user experience - Green spaces, natural shade, and biodiversity improve wellbeing for residents and visitors alike.<br/>- Regulatory readiness - In regions like the UAE and KSA, environmental permitting is mandatory. Building with nature ensures compliance and competitive advantage.<br/>- Positive brand and investor perception - Sustainable, eco-sensitive developments are increasingly attractive to both stakeholders and the public.</p><p>This approach also makes business sense. Developers benefit from cost savings, long-term durability, and market differentiation.</p><p>Challenges, and How We Overcome Them</p><p>Implementing this philosophy isn't without hurdles:</p><p>- Speed of development: In the GCC, projects move quickly. You need nimble, adaptive strategies.<br/>- Changing mindsets: Some stakeholders remain rooted in traditional \"hard\" engineering methods.<br/>- Budget concerns: Upfront costs may appear high, even if long-term savings exist.</p><p>Our response:</p><p>- Use data visualization and GIS tools to show clear environmental risks and solutions.<br/>- Present a business case alongside ecological benefits.<br/>- Ensure recommendations are feasible, grounded in regulatory context, and matched to available resources.<br/>- Engage with design teams as collaborators, not enforcers, building trust and shared vision.</p><p>Why Local Expertise Matters</p><p>Environmental conditions are highly contextual. Soil, water, climate, regulations, community norms, these differ not only country to country but even city to city. That's why local knowledge is vital.</p><p>At Terra Nexus, our team understands:</p><p>- The intricacies of the region's unique climate, native species, and marine habitats<br/>- How to navigate permits and approvals with local authorities<br/>- The realities of contracting, supply chains, and land-use constraints</p><p>Partnering with Inogen Alliance gives us access to global tools and peer expertise, but it's our local insight that ensures success on the ground.</p><p>Final Takeaways</p><p>If you're just starting your journey into building with nature, here are two simple but powerful pieces of advice:</p><p>- Keep an open mind. Rethinking traditional infrastructure practices can feel disruptive, but it opens the door to smarter, more resilient development.<br/>- Get the right experts on board early. Cross-disciplinary collaboration, urban planners, ecologists, engineers, and regulators, is the key to success.</p><p>As we move toward a future of growing climate and resource challenges, the question isn't can we afford to build with nature, it's can we afford not to.</p><p>About the Author<br/>Nivine Issa is the Managing Director of Terra Nexus, an environmental consultancy based in Dubai and part of the Inogen Alliance.

Building materials are classified from A to D based on how far and how quickly flames spread across their surface materials. The Class A flame-spread rating signifies a material with the highest resistance to flames.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In addition to the Class A flame spread rating, TimberTech describes its decking as Advanced PVC because it has a four-sided cap around a durable core made from a blend of virgin and recycled polymers. The decking doesn't contain any wood or organic fillers, which the company says can compromise long-term performance in the core or cap and opens up competitor boards to rot.</p><p>The TimberTech brand was part of Azek Co. until July 1, when James Hardie Industries plc completed its acquisition of Azek in a cash and stock transaction representing a value of $8.4 billion.</p><p>With $990 million in estimated annual related sales, Azek Co.'s TimberTech brand is No. 8 in Plastics News' ranking North American pipe, profile and tubing extruders.</p><p>In the new video, as a disclaimer, the announcer says the TimberTech test was done for demonstration only and isn't representative of the actual ASTM E-84 surface flame spread test.</p><p>In the controlled-environment demonstration, after the burners were lit, the video shows flames reach up between the test boards of all three types of decking materials.</p><p>At one minute, all the burners are turned off, which comes at about the 40-second point of the video, which is just over a minute long.
