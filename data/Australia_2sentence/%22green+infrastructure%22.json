If temperatures rise above 31\u00b0C for the same amount of time, the risk becomes even more severe-what the researchers call a level two threat.<br/>The new system could help local governments, health agencies, and emergency responders know exactly where help is needed most.<br/>For example, if a neighborhood shows dangerously high indoor temperatures, officials could send out cooling tools like fans or check in on residents at risk.<br/>Dr. Plinio Morita, director of UbiLab, said that while not everyone can afford a smart thermostat, public health programs and government subsidies could make them more accessible. Long-term solutions might also include investing in green infrastructure or offering financial support to communities that lack air conditioning.<br/>Morita also emphasized the need for better public communication.

FERC, No. 24-1199 (D.C. Cir. Aug. 1, 2025), the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit (D.C. Circuit) upheld the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission's (FERC) approval of a 1,000-foot natural gas pipeline segment crossing the United States-Mexico border (the Border Pipeline) under section 3 of the Natural Gas Act (NGA), rejecting environmental groups' challenges that FERC improperly limited its analysis under both the NGA and the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), as related to a 155-mile intrastate \"Connector Pipeline\" constructed upstream of the Border Pipeline in Texas.</p><p>Critically, the court embraced the U.S. Supreme Court's Seven County Infrastructure Coalition v. Eagle County (Seven County) precedent, holding that FERC's scope-of-review decisions were entitled to \"substantial deference\" so long as they fell within a \"broad zone of reasonableness\" and bore a \"reasonably close causal relationship\" to the federal action at issue. Applying Seven County, the court emphasized that FERC was not obligated to assess upstream or downstream environmental impacts-such as emissions from the broader pipeline-because those effects were not within its control or causally linked to its decision concerning the Border Pipeline.</p><p>August 06: Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP: Patent Damages Based on Avoided Costs Do Not Invoke the Entire Market Value Rule</p><p>In ruling on a recent motion to strike, a judge in the Eastern District of Texas permitted a damages expert to rely on a damages theory based on defendant's \"avoided costs,\" holding that this theory did not run afoul of the \"entire market value rule.\"</p><p>When a product accused of infringement includes both the patented feature and other, non-patented features, the general rule is that royalties must be based not on the entire product, but rather on the \"smallest saleable patent-practicing unit.\" This rule is derived from a concern that calculating a royalty based on the entire product will improperly compensate the patentee for non-infringing components. The entire market value rule provides a limited exception, however, allowing royalties to be based on revenue or profits for the entire product where the patentee proves that the patented feature drives demand for the entire product.</p><p>In this particular case, the patented technology concerned wireless telephone technology, and the smallest saleable practicing patent unit was the actual devices that practice the asserted patents. Plaintiff's damages expert, though, did not base his opinion on the revenue from those devices. Instead, Plaintiff argued that the patented technology allows wireless carriers to avoid the purchase and use of additional spectrum and based its damages theory on a variety of large financial figures, including the revenue and costs associated with the FCC auctions and secondary market sales of spectrum, the total value of the defendant's spectrum holdings, and the total spectrum saved due to the asserted patents.</p><p>August 06: Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP: Timeline of Effective Dates of Health Care Provisions of OBBBA is Key to Understanding Impacts</p><p>Over 35 health care provisions were included in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025. These provisions span Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces, Medicare and commercial insurance. The majority of provisions alter eligibility and spending for health care coverage under Medicaid - and take effect over the next three years. All health provisions of OBBBA will have notable impacts on coverage and care delivery in the U.S. when they take effect. The timeline of effective dates, presented in this Alert, are essential to understanding the cost and coverage impacts.</p><p>To comply with the law, states will need to build and operate numerous additional Medicaid and ACA eligibility checks and systems by certain deadlines. Adults who live in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA will face narrowed eligibility for Medicaid, and they may need to report monthly their hours of work or community engagement to maintain Medicaid coverage when their state implements this provision. Children of these adults could retain Medicaid eligibility separately - and need to take steps to remain enrolled. Providers will also be closely responding to implementation of the OBBBA as health provisions will impact funding, coverage for their patient populations and the amount of uncompensated care delivered in their communities.</p><p>The following table shows the statute's effective dates for all health provisions.</p><p>August 06: Latham &amp; Watkins Advises on Icahn Enterprises L.P.s US$500 Million Senior Secured Notes Offering</p><p>Icahn Enterprises L.P.

Cal. Judge Reverses Prior Order Barring Device Art \"Materially Identical\" to Printed Publications After Federal Circuit Adopts Narrower View of IPR Estoppel</p><p>A Northern District of California judge recently granted a motion to reconsider his summary judgment ruling that defendant was barred from raising certain \"device art\" due to IPR estoppel under 35 U.S.C. (Section) 315(e)(2). In the original ruling, the judge adopted the broader rule that IPR estoppel applies to device art that is \"materially identical\" to patents or printed publications that petitioners raised, or could have raised, in an IPR. Following that ruling, however, the Federal Circuit issued its Ingenico decision adopting the narrower view that IPR estoppel applies only to \"grounds\" based on patents and printed publications and not to device-based grounds. Citing Ingenico as a \"change of law,\" defendant moved for reconsideration of the court's ruling, and the court granted the motion.</p><p>In a patent infringement suit related to wearable camera devices, the patentee requested summary judgment that defendant was estopped from asserting invalidity theories based on certain physical camera devices. The patentee argued that IPR estoppel under (Section) 315(e)(2) applied to the device art because all \"material limitations\" of the devices were disclosed in product manuals cited by defendant's expert, and the manuals qualified as \"printed publications\" that could have been raised in defendant's related IPRs.</p><p>August 05: Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP: Licensing Evidence of Nonobviousness Does Not Require Claim-Specific Nexus</p><p>The Federal Circuit recently vacated a decision by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board after concluding that the board's analysis of licensing evidence offered as a secondary consideration of nonobviousness constituted legal error and was not supported by substantial evidence. According to the court, the board applied a more exacting and improperly heightened nexus standard than is required by law for license evidence.</p><p>After the board issued final written decisions concluding that claims of the challenged patent were unpatentable as obvious, patentee appealed. Among the issues raised on appeal, patentee contended that the board erred in analyzing nexus for two secondary considerations of nonobviousness: industry praise and licensing.</p><p>Regarding industry praise, the court upheld the board's finding that the patentee failed to establish a nexus between the challenged claims and a joint press release as well as an agreement. Although the press release directly named the challenged patent and the agreement concerned products using the patent, the board found that the praise was directed to the patent generally-not to the specific challenged claims.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 4296155293</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p>", "publisher": "News Bites - Private Companies", "instances": ["GFL Environmental Inc. 25 billion.

His nature-inspired work links high-tech with sustainability and has the potential to significantly contribute to the development of circular electronics. With EUR500,000 in funding, the Joachim Herz Prize is one of the most highly endowed science awards in Germany. The prize will be awarded on September 30 in Hamburg.</p><p>Each year, around 62 million tons of electronic waste are generated worldwide - and about 60 percent of it consists of printed circuit boards. These are found in almost every electronic device, from smartphones to computers, and serve to connect the electronic components inside. Conventional circuit boards pose two major problems: they are made from non-renewable raw materials and are difficult to recycle. In the research project \"UnbeLEAFable\", Dr. Hans Kleemann and his team at TU Dresden are pursuing an alternative solution. Using bio-based materials and inspired by the structure of natural leaf skeletons, they are developing sustainable circuit boards for circular electronics.</p><p>The innovation of this research lies in using nature's synthesis capabilities as a model to help solve a man-made problem. The delicate vascular structure of leaves is used as a natural framework and filled with bio-based plastics. This results in a novel material for sustainable circuit boards that could replace conventional components. If successful, the project could make a major contribution to a fossil-free future: manufacturing would require less energy and no fossil resources, and the resulting circuit boards would be biodegradable, allowing the remaining components to be reused.</p><p>June 30: Off to Lindau: TUD scientist Uliana Tsiko participates in Nobel Laureate Meeting.</p><p>The chemist Dr. Uliana Tsiko from the Institute of Applied Physics at TUD Dresden University of Technology is one among excellent 600 young researchers who have been selected for participation in the 74th Lindau Nobel Laureate Meeting taking place from 29 June to 4 July 2025.

These findings challenge classical theories and could improve how we design materials for engineering and technology. The results have recently been published in the scientific journal \"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS)\".</p><p>Polycrystalline materials are made up of many tiny crystals called grains and are found everywhere, from rocks in nature to metals and ceramics in engineering.

Understanding what drives these changes, especially the role of internal stresses inside the material, is key to explaining how materials behave and to designing better ones for specific uses.</p><p>Using advanced computer simulations and theoretical modeling, Marco Salvalaglio and his team demonstrate that shear deformations and internal mechanical stresses- emerging as grain boundaries move-play a crucial role in how microstructures evolve.</p><p>June 26: TU Dresden 6 years of the Dresden University School trial: first large graduating year</p><p>On Friday, June 27, 2025, the school year somes to close at Dresden University School (USD) with the ceremonial presentation of certificates.

United States and Johnson v. United States, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit reversed wire fraud convictions that were based on theories resembling insider trading.1 In both cases, the government invoked the wire fraud statute, and not a securities fraud statute, because the products at issue (non-fungible tokens and spot foreign currency) were not securities. These cases mark the latest developments in a long-running, ongoing and sometimes head-spinning debate in the courts concerning the breadth of the federal property fraud statutes.</p><p>In Chastain, the court held that confidential business information obtained by an employee that lacks commercial value to the employer is not a \"traditional property interest\" under the wire fraud statute. This decision can be seen as a logical extension of United States v. Blaszczak, a Second Circuit decision from 2022, which held that confidential government information was not property for purposes of the federal fraud statutes because the information did not have commercial value to the government. The Chastain majority also criticized a different jury instruction administered by the district court-which permitted the jury to convict the defendant if he \"conducted himself in a manner that departed from traditional notions of fundamental honesty and fair play in the general and business life of society\"-as overbroad because this language would effectively criminalize almost any deceptive act.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>August 15: Akin Named 2025 Best Law Firm of the Year Finalist by The American Lawyer</p><p>Akin has been named by The American Lawyer as a finalist for Best Law Firm of the Year in the 2025 American Lawyer Industry Awards.

FERC faulted the operator for providing a Section 311 transportation service without timely filing a Statement of Operating Conditions (SOC) and obtaining FERC's approval for the transportation rates. Section 311 permits intrastate pipelines to transport interstate gas \"on behalf of\" interstate pipelines without becoming subject to FERC's more extensive Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction, but requires the intrastate pipeline to have an SOC stating the rates and terms and conditions of service on file with FERC within 30 days of providing the interstate service. Under the NGPA, Section 311 rates must be \"fair and equitable\" and approved by FERC.

FERC faulted the operator for providing a Section 311 transportation service without timely filing a Statement of Operating Conditions (SOC) and obtaining FERC's approval for the transportation rates. Section 311 permits intrastate pipelines to transport interstate gas \"on behalf of\" interstate pipelines without becoming subject to FERC's more extensive Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction, but requires the intrastate pipeline to have an SOC stating the rates and terms and conditions of service on file with FERC within 30 days of providing the interstate service. Under the NGPA, Section 311 rates must be \"fair and equitable\" and approved by FERC. In Skye, FERC stated that the operator began providing Section 311 service on certain pipeline segments in Mississippi in May 2023, following their acquisition from another Section 311 operator, but did not file an SOC with FERC until April 2025.</p><p>August 14: Akin Ranked Among Top Firms in The American Lawyers 2025 A-List</p><p>Akin has once again earned a spot on The American Lawyer's 2025 A-List, ranking No. 13 overall.

FERC faulted the operator for providing a Section 311 transportation service without timely filing a Statement of Operating Conditions (SOC) and obtaining FERC's approval for the transportation rates. Section 311 permits intrastate pipelines to transport interstate gas \"on behalf of\" interstate pipelines without becoming subject to FERC's more extensive Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction, but requires the intrastate pipeline to have an SOC stating the rates and terms and conditions of service on file with FERC within 30 days of providing the interstate service. Under the NGPA, Section 311 rates must be \"fair and equitable\" and approved by FERC. In Skye, FERC stated that the operator began providing Section 311 service on certain pipeline segments in Mississippi in May 2023, following their acquisition from another Section 311 operator, but did not file an SOC with FERC until April 2025. The order ties the penalty to the approximately two-year delay between commencement of the Section 311 service and the SOC filing date. The pipeline operator was also ordered to provide an annual compliance report and to abide by additional verification requirements related to the filing of its FERC Form No. 549D, the Quarterly Transportation &amp; Storage Report for Intrastate Natural Gas and Hinshaw Pipelines.</p><p/><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>August 15: Akin Named 2025 Best Law Firm of the Year Finalist by The American Lawyer</p><p>Akin has been named by The American Lawyer as a finalist for Best Law Firm of the Year in the 2025 American Lawyer Industry Awards.

FERC faulted the operator for providing a Section 311 transportation service without timely filing a Statement of Operating Conditions (SOC) and obtaining FERC's approval for the transportation rates. Section 311 permits intrastate pipelines to transport interstate gas \"on behalf of\" interstate pipelines without becoming subject to FERC's more extensive Natural Gas Act (NGA) jurisdiction, but requires the intrastate pipeline to have an SOC stating the rates and terms and conditions of service on file with FERC within 30 days of providing the interstate service.

The project, valued at $200 million, will feature a 90,000-square-foot ballroom that aligns with the architectural heritage of the existing White House, according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. This announcement was made on 5th August 2025 and is set to enhance the White House's capacity for hosting events.</p><p>The new ballroom will replace the current East Wing and is designed to accommodate 650 guests, a considerable increase from the East Room's current capacity of 200. Press Secretary Leavitt emphasized that the ballroom will be \"innately designed and carefully crafted,\" ensuring that its theme and architectural style closely mirror that of the main building. AECOM, recognized as the top design firm in the Engineering News-Record's 2025 rankings, will play a critical role in the engineering aspects of this project.</p><p>Construction is expected to commence in September, with the completion timeline anticipated to fall well within President Trump's current term. The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and expanded in the 1940s, will undergo modernization as part of this initiative. During construction, staff currently located in the East Wing will be temporarily relocated to facilitate the work, which aims to preserve the historical significance of the White House while enhancing its functionality.</p><p>Jim McCrery, CEO of McCrery Architects, which is part of the project team alongside AECOM, expressed commitment to maintaining the elegance and classical design of the White House. The project has garnered funding commitments from President Trump and unspecified private donors, reinforcing its importance to the administration.</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> Click <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">http://www.buysellsignals.com</url></p>", "publisher": "Global Round Up - Sectors", "instances": ["The company''s largest sources of revenue come from its Design and Consulting Services segment, which includes architecture, engineering, and planning for transportation, water, and environmental projects, and its Construction Services segment, which focuses on building and infrastructure construction management.

There is uncertainty in the market and it is difficult to predict how economic conditions will be in 2025 and beyond as well as what the impact of those conditions may be on AECOM.

We don't want just green around the edges.\"</p><p>Moir's projects include Harbourside - where developer Mirvac's Stuart Penklis says landscaping is one of the most important pillars - as well as the Parks for People Program and the Macquarie Street East precinct. Others are the Western Ridges Walk (or Gabrugal Yana) at the Western Sydney Parklands and the Bridges Hill Park Playground at Cessnock in the Hunter Valley.</p><p>Planning from the ground up Across the world, landscape architects are at the fore.

These provisions span Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces, Medicare and commercial insurance. The majority of provisions alter eligibility and spending for health care coverage under Medicaid - and take effect over the next three years. All health provisions of OBBBA will have notable impacts on coverage and care delivery in the U.S. when they take effect. The timeline of effective dates, presented in this Alert, are essential to understanding the cost and coverage impacts.</p><p>To comply with the law, states will need to build and operate numerous additional Medicaid and ACA eligibility checks and systems by certain deadlines. Adults who live in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA will face narrowed eligibility for Medicaid, and they may need to report monthly their hours of work or community engagement to maintain Medicaid coverage when their state implements this provision. Children of these adults could retain Medicaid eligibility separately - and need to take steps to remain enrolled. Providers will also be closely responding to implementation of the OBBBA as health provisions will impact funding, coverage for their patient populations and the amount of uncompensated care delivered in their communities.</p><p>The following table shows the statute's effective dates for all health provisions.</p><p>August 06: Latham &amp; Watkins Advises on Icahn Enterprises L.P.s US$500 Million Senior Secured Notes Offering</p><p>Icahn Enterprises L.P.

These provisions span Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces, Medicare and commercial insurance. The majority of provisions alter eligibility and spending for health care coverage under Medicaid - and take effect over the next three years. All health provisions of OBBBA will have notable impacts on coverage and care delivery in the U.S. when they take effect. The timeline of effective dates, presented in this Alert, are essential to understanding the cost and coverage impacts.</p><p>To comply with the law, states will need to build and operate numerous additional Medicaid and ACA eligibility checks and systems by certain deadlines. Adults who live in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA will face narrowed eligibility for Medicaid, and they may need to report monthly their hours of work or community engagement to maintain Medicaid coverage when their state implements this provision. Children of these adults could retain Medicaid eligibility separately - and need to take steps to remain enrolled. Providers will also be closely responding to implementation of the OBBBA as health provisions will impact funding, coverage for their patient populations and the amount of uncompensated care delivered in their communities.</p><p>The following table shows the statute's effective dates for all health provisions.</p><p>August 06: Latham &amp; Watkins Advises on Icahn Enterprises L.P.s US$500 Million Senior Secured Notes Offering</p><p>Icahn Enterprises L.P.

The majority of provisions alter eligibility and spending for health care coverage under Medicaid - and take effect over the next three years. All health provisions of OBBBA will have notable impacts on coverage and care delivery in the U.S. when they take effect. The timeline of effective dates, presented in this Alert, are essential to understanding the cost and coverage impacts.</p><p>To comply with the law, states will need to build and operate numerous additional Medicaid and ACA eligibility checks and systems by certain deadlines. Adults who live in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA will face narrowed eligibility for Medicaid, and they may need to report monthly their hours of work or community engagement to maintain Medicaid coverage when their state implements this provision. Children of these adults could retain Medicaid eligibility separately - and need to take steps to remain enrolled. Providers will also be closely responding to implementation of the OBBBA as health provisions will impact funding, coverage for their patient populations and the amount of uncompensated care delivered in their communities.</p><p>The following table shows the statute's effective dates for all health provisions.</p><p>August 06: Latham &amp; Watkins Advises on Icahn Enterprises L.P.s US$500 Million Senior Secured Notes Offering</p><p>Icahn Enterprises L.P.

The project, valued at $200 million, will feature a 90,000-square-foot ballroom that aligns with the architectural heritage of the existing White House, according to Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt. This announcement was made on 5th August 2025 and is set to enhance the White House's capacity for hosting events.</p><p>The new ballroom will replace the current East Wing and is designed to accommodate 650 guests, a considerable increase from the East Room's current capacity of 200. Press Secretary Leavitt emphasized that the ballroom will be \"innately designed and carefully crafted,\" ensuring that its theme and architectural style closely mirror that of the main building. AECOM, recognized as the top design firm in the Engineering News-Record's 2025 rankings, will play a critical role in the engineering aspects of this project.</p><p>Construction is expected to commence in September, with the completion timeline anticipated to fall well within President Trump's current term. The East Wing, originally built in 1902 and expanded in the 1940s, will undergo modernization as part of this initiative. During construction, staff currently located in the East Wing will be temporarily relocated to facilitate the work, which aims to preserve the historical significance of the White House while enhancing its functionality.</p><p>Jim McCrery, CEO of McCrery Architects, which is part of the project team alongside AECOM, expressed commitment to maintaining the elegance and classical design of the White House.

(August 11, 2025) - Tax attorney Andrew Siracuse has joined Holland &amp; Knight's Washington, D.C., office as a partner in the Public Policy &amp; Regulation Group. Previously, he spent nearly two decades with U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the Finance Committee and former Republican Whip, where he served as senior tax counsel and actively worked on policy related to appropriations, the federal budget, taxation, banking, insurance, retirement, pensions and Senate procedure.</p><p>\"In the next few years, new tax rules will be written as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Andrew's arrival significantly strengthens our extremely busy tax team at this crucial moment,\" said Rich Gold, the leader of Holland &amp; Knight's Public Policy &amp; Regulation Group. \"His deep understanding of tax policy, along with his vast network of legislative and executive contacts, will be invaluable to current and future clients during the rulemaking process and beyond.\"</p><p>Mr. Siracuse brings more than 25 years of experience navigating the legislative and rulemaking process to advance policy goals in a variety of sectors, including energy, technology, manufacturing, private equity and financial services. His extensive Capitol Hill experience includes serving as a legislative assistant for Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), a budget and tax analyst for the U.S. Senate Budget Committee and a legislative correspondent for Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). Mr. Siracuse began his career as a research assistant with the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, where he assisted in the development of a reform plan enacted into law in July 1998. In 2024, Punchbowl News noted Mr. Siracuse as one of the longest-serving tax aides among Finance Republicans.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HOLLAND &amp; KNIGHT LLP PUNCHING IN: TRUMP'S LABOR DEPARTMENT PICKS AWAIT SENATE'S RETURN</p><p>Labor and employment attorney Timothy Taylor was highlighted in a Blooomberg Law article providing an update on the status of nominations for positions at the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL). The U.S. Senate must approve the nominees for DOL leadership roles such as the Solicitor of Labor and Wage and Hour Division leader, and most of the 10 slots have yet to be brought to the floor for a vote. Mr. Taylor noted that though the agency can continue pushing forth policy positions and proposing or rescinding rules, lacking confirmed leadership could affect litigation.</p><p>\"It does complicate some things when it comes to such issues as who needs to sign off on rules, who needs to sign off on policies, questions around proper succession, proper exercise of authority, and occasionally those things can trip people up in litigation if it's not properly done,\" he remarked.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HOLLAND &amp; KNIGHT LLP TRUMP COLLEGE-ATHLETE MANDATE SEEKS DOL INPUT AMID CASES</p><p>Labor and employment attorney Timothy Taylor was quoted in a Law360 article on President Donald Trump's executive order directing the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to issue guidance on the employment status of college athletes. Per the order, titled \"Saving College Sports,\" Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will \"clarify the status of collegiate athletes\" in terms of classifying them as employees or non-employees. The order comes as courts have issued various rulings on the matter, including a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down NCAA rules restricting education-related compensation and benefits for student-athletes. Mr. Taylor explained the guidance will likely come from the DOL's Wage and Hour Division and could take one of several forms: informal guidance documents, opinion letters or an administrator's interpretation, in addition to amicus briefs in litigation. Another option, he said, is updating the division's field operations handbook, an internal manual containing agency statutory interpretations.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HOLLAND &amp; KNIGHT LLP WATERFRONT BUILDING OFFERS HIGH DEMAND, BUT COMPLEX REVIEW</p><p>Land use and zoning attorney Kyrus Lamont Freeman was interviewed for a Law360 article examining the challenges surrounding waterfront development. The multifaceted nature of these properties - a natural resource also used for recreation, transport and commerce - raises a host of issues, from environmental considerations to ownership rights to public access. Mr. Freeman noted that in addition to local zoning and building codes, federal environmental reviews from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can also enter the picture. He added that developers should determine whether a property is located in a special zone, such as a nature conservation area or historic preservation district, which would implicate another level of permitting, paperwork and balancing multiple jurisdictional requirements. Overall, he emphasized the importance of working with a multidisciplinary legal team to shepherd a project through its entire life cycle, from the initial proposals to groundbreaking to grand opening.</p><p>\"You've got to have the wherewithal, the experience, the ability to get a good team - a good legal team, if you're in a jurisdiction that requires lobbying, then a good lobbying team, a good architecture team, a good environmental team. A good team to figure out how to navigate the process, because the process can be tough,\" he commented.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p>", "publisher": "News Bites - Private Companies", "instances": ["Advice was provided on tax matters by partners Pardis Zomorodi and Katharine Moir and on executive compensation, employment, and benefits matters by partner Julie Crisp.

(August 11, 2025) - Tax attorney Andrew Siracuse has joined Holland &amp; Knight's Washington, D.C., office as a partner in the Public Policy &amp; Regulation Group. Previously, he spent nearly two decades with U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the Finance Committee and former Republican Whip, where he served as senior tax counsel and actively worked on policy related to appropriations, the federal budget, taxation, banking, insurance, retirement, pensions and Senate procedure.</p><p>\"In the next few years, new tax rules will be written as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Andrew's arrival significantly strengthens our extremely busy tax team at this crucial moment,\" said Rich Gold, the leader of Holland &amp; Knight's Public Policy &amp; Regulation Group. \"His deep understanding of tax policy, along with his vast network of legislative and executive contacts, will be invaluable to current and future clients during the rulemaking process and beyond.\"</p><p>Mr. Siracuse brings more than 25 years of experience navigating the legislative and rulemaking process to advance policy goals in a variety of sectors, including energy, technology, manufacturing, private equity and financial services. His extensive Capitol Hill experience includes serving as a legislative assistant for Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), a budget and tax analyst for the U.S. Senate Budget Committee and a legislative correspondent for Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). Mr. Siracuse began his career as a research assistant with the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, where he assisted in the development of a reform plan enacted into law in July 1998.

The U.S. Senate must approve the nominees for DOL leadership roles such as the Solicitor of Labor and Wage and Hour Division leader, and most of the 10 slots have yet to be brought to the floor for a vote. Mr. Taylor noted that though the agency can continue pushing forth policy positions and proposing or rescinding rules, lacking confirmed leadership could affect litigation.</p><p>\"It does complicate some things when it comes to such issues as who needs to sign off on rules, who needs to sign off on policies, questions around proper succession, proper exercise of authority, and occasionally those things can trip people up in litigation if it's not properly done,\" he remarked.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HOLLAND &amp; KNIGHT LLP TRUMP COLLEGE-ATHLETE MANDATE SEEKS DOL INPUT AMID CASES</p><p>Labor and employment attorney Timothy Taylor was quoted in a Law360 article on President Donald Trump's executive order directing the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to issue guidance on the employment status of college athletes. Per the order, titled \"Saving College Sports,\" Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will \"clarify the status of collegiate athletes\" in terms of classifying them as employees or non-employees. The order comes as courts have issued various rulings on the matter, including a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down NCAA rules restricting education-related compensation and benefits for student-athletes. Mr. Taylor explained the guidance will likely come from the DOL's Wage and Hour Division and could take one of several forms: informal guidance documents, opinion letters or an administrator's interpretation, in addition to amicus briefs in litigation. Another option, he said, is updating the division's field operations handbook, an internal manual containing agency statutory interpretations.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HOLLAND &amp; KNIGHT LLP WATERFRONT BUILDING OFFERS HIGH DEMAND, BUT COMPLEX REVIEW</p><p>Land use and zoning attorney Kyrus Lamont Freeman was interviewed for a Law360 article examining the challenges surrounding waterfront development. The multifaceted nature of these properties - a natural resource also used for recreation, transport and commerce - raises a host of issues, from environmental considerations to ownership rights to public access. Mr. Freeman noted that in addition to local zoning and building codes, federal environmental reviews from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can also enter the picture. He added that developers should determine whether a property is located in a special zone, such as a nature conservation area or historic preservation district, which would implicate another level of permitting, paperwork and balancing multiple jurisdictional requirements. Overall, he emphasized the importance of working with a multidisciplinary legal team to shepherd a project through its entire life cycle, from the initial proposals to groundbreaking to grand opening.</p><p>\"You've got to have the wherewithal, the experience, the ability to get a good team - a good legal team, if you're in a jurisdiction that requires lobbying, then a good lobbying team, a good architecture team, a good environmental team.

(August 11, 2025) - Tax attorney Andrew Siracuse has joined Holland &amp; Knight's Washington, D.C., office as a partner in the Public Policy &amp; Regulation Group. Previously, he spent nearly two decades with U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the Finance Committee and former Republican Whip, where he served as senior tax counsel and actively worked on policy related to appropriations, the federal budget, taxation, banking, insurance, retirement, pensions and Senate procedure.</p><p>\"In the next few years, new tax rules will be written as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Andrew's arrival significantly strengthens our extremely busy tax team at this crucial moment,\" said Rich Gold, the leader of Holland &amp; Knight's Public Policy &amp; Regulation Group. \"His deep understanding of tax policy, along with his vast network of legislative and executive contacts, will be invaluable to current and future clients during the rulemaking process and beyond.\"</p><p>Mr. Siracuse brings more than 25 years of experience navigating the legislative and rulemaking process to advance policy goals in a variety of sectors, including energy, technology, manufacturing, private equity and financial services. His extensive Capitol Hill experience includes serving as a legislative assistant for Sen. Norm Coleman (R-Minn.), a budget and tax analyst for the U.S. Senate Budget Committee and a legislative correspondent for Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa). Mr. Siracuse began his career as a research assistant with the National Commission on Restructuring the Internal Revenue Service, where he assisted in the development of a reform plan enacted into law in July 1998.

The U.S. Senate must approve the nominees for DOL leadership roles such as the Solicitor of Labor and Wage and Hour Division leader, and most of the 10 slots have yet to be brought to the floor for a vote. Mr. Taylor noted that though the agency can continue pushing forth policy positions and proposing or rescinding rules, lacking confirmed leadership could affect litigation.</p><p>\"It does complicate some things when it comes to such issues as who needs to sign off on rules, who needs to sign off on policies, questions around proper succession, proper exercise of authority, and occasionally those things can trip people up in litigation if it's not properly done,\" he remarked.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HOLLAND &amp; KNIGHT LLP TRUMP COLLEGE-ATHLETE MANDATE SEEKS DOL INPUT AMID CASES</p><p>Labor and employment attorney Timothy Taylor was quoted in a Law360 article on President Donald Trump's executive order directing the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) to issue guidance on the employment status of college athletes. Per the order, titled \"Saving College Sports,\" Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will \"clarify the status of collegiate athletes\" in terms of classifying them as employees or non-employees. The order comes as courts have issued various rulings on the matter, including a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down NCAA rules restricting education-related compensation and benefits for student-athletes. Mr. Taylor explained the guidance will likely come from the DOL's Wage and Hour Division and could take one of several forms: informal guidance documents, opinion letters or an administrator's interpretation, in addition to amicus briefs in litigation. Another option, he said, is updating the division's field operations handbook, an internal manual containing agency statutory interpretations.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HOLLAND &amp; KNIGHT LLP WATERFRONT BUILDING OFFERS HIGH DEMAND, BUT COMPLEX REVIEW</p><p>Land use and zoning attorney Kyrus Lamont Freeman was interviewed for a Law360 article examining the challenges surrounding waterfront development. The multifaceted nature of these properties - a natural resource also used for recreation, transport and commerce - raises a host of issues, from environmental considerations to ownership rights to public access. Mr. Freeman noted that in addition to local zoning and building codes, federal environmental reviews from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can also enter the picture. He added that developers should determine whether a property is located in a special zone, such as a nature conservation area or historic preservation district, which would implicate another level of permitting, paperwork and balancing multiple jurisdictional requirements. Overall, he emphasized the importance of working with a multidisciplinary legal team to shepherd a project through its entire life cycle, from the initial proposals to groundbreaking to grand opening.</p><p>\"You've got to have the wherewithal, the experience, the ability to get a good team - a good legal team, if you're in a jurisdiction that requires lobbying, then a good lobbying team, a good architecture team, a good environmental team.

Previously, he spent nearly two decades with U.S. Sen. John Cornyn (R-Texas), a senior member of the Finance Committee and former Republican Whip, where he served as senior tax counsel and actively worked on policy related to appropriations, the federal budget, taxation, banking, insurance, retirement, pensions and Senate procedure.</p><p>\"In the next few years, new tax rules will be written as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). Andrew's arrival significantly strengthens our extremely busy tax team at this crucial moment,\" said Rich Gold, the leader of Holland &amp; Knight's Public Policy &amp; Regulation Group. \"His deep understanding of tax policy, along with his vast network of legislative and executive contacts, will be invaluable to current and future clients during the rulemaking process and beyond.\"</p><p>Mr. Siracuse brings more than 25 years of experience navigating the legislative and rulemaking process to advance policy goals in a variety of sectors, including energy, technology, manufacturing, private equity and financial services.

The U.S. Senate must approve the nominees for DOL leadership roles such as the Solicitor of Labor and Wage and Hour Division leader, and most of the 10 slots have yet to be brought to the floor for a vote.

Per the order, titled \"Saving College Sports,\" Labor Secretary Lori Chavez-DeRemer and the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) will \"clarify the status of collegiate athletes\" in terms of classifying them as employees or non-employees. The order comes as courts have issued various rulings on the matter, including a 2021 U.S. Supreme Court decision that struck down NCAA rules restricting education-related compensation and benefits for student-athletes. Mr. Taylor explained the guidance will likely come from the DOL's Wage and Hour Division and could take one of several forms: informal guidance documents, opinion letters or an administrator's interpretation, in addition to amicus briefs in litigation.

The multifaceted nature of these properties - a natural resource also used for recreation, transport and commerce - raises a host of issues, from environmental considerations to ownership rights to public access. Mr. Freeman noted that in addition to local zoning and building codes, federal environmental reviews from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers can also enter the picture. He added that developers should determine whether a property is located in a special zone, such as a nature conservation area or historic preservation district, which would implicate another level of permitting, paperwork and balancing multiple jurisdictional requirements. Overall, he emphasized the importance of working with a multidisciplinary legal team to shepherd a project through its entire life cycle, from the initial proposals to groundbreaking to grand opening.</p><p>\"You've got to have the wherewithal, the experience, the ability to get a good team - a good legal team, if you're in a jurisdiction that requires lobbying, then a good lobbying team, a good architecture team, a good environmental team.

These provisions span Medicaid, the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplaces, Medicare and commercial insurance. The majority of provisions alter eligibility and spending for health care coverage under Medicaid - and take effect over the next three years. All health provisions of OBBBA will have notable impacts on coverage and care delivery in the U.S. when they take effect. The timeline of effective dates, presented in this Alert, are essential to understanding the cost and coverage impacts.</p><p>To comply with the law, states will need to build and operate numerous additional Medicaid and ACA eligibility checks and systems by certain deadlines. Adults who live in states that have expanded Medicaid coverage under the ACA will face narrowed eligibility for Medicaid, and they may need to report monthly their hours of work or community engagement to maintain Medicaid coverage when their state implements this provision. Children of these adults could retain Medicaid eligibility separately - and need to take steps to remain enrolled. Providers will also be closely responding to implementation of the OBBBA as health provisions will impact funding, coverage for their patient populations and the amount of uncompensated care delivered in their communities.</p><p>The following table shows the statute's effective dates for all health provisions.</p><p>August 06: Akin Gump Strauss Hauer Feld LLP: FDA Moves Forward on Fluoropolymers</p><p>On August 6, 2025, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) became the latest governmental agency to confirm that fluoropolymers are both safe and necessary.
