But many green groups and scientists say that this is still not good enough. Biden's initiative may have won praise from political allies, but these campaigners want to see a different calculus rooted in history and ethics. To keep the world from tilting into catastrophic warming, they argue, developed nations that got rich burning fossil fuels must face their historic responsibility for the climate crisis -- and pay for it, too. </p><p>When countries struck the landmark Paris Agreement in 2015, they committed to limit global temperature rises to \"well below\" two degrees Celsius (3.6 Farenheit) compared to pre-industrial levels.  Nations also agreed to strive for a safer warming cap of 1.5C through voluntary emissions-cutting plans, known as National Determined Contributions, or NDCs, that would be ratcheted up in scope and ambition every five years. \"What they refused to allow was any assessment of how the individual pledges compared to each other,\" Brandon Wu, director of policy and campaigns at ActionAid USA, told AFP.  The concept of \"fair share\" emissions cuts has been gaining traction among environmental and human rights organisations for several years AFP / SAUL LOEB \"As civil society, we thought that was a really crucial piece of the puzzle -- it's important both whether all the pledges add up to the 1.5C goal, but it's also important whether they're fair relative to one another.\"The concept of \"fair share\" emissions cuts has been gaining traction among environmental and human rights organisations for years.  The methodology is simple enough: calculate the amount of carbon currently in Earth's atmosphere attributable to a specific country's historic greenhouse gas emissions, then factor in that country's capacity -- measured in wealth -- to help other nations reduce their own emissions.  This year a coalition of around 175 climate groups launched US Climate Fair Share. Far from an emissions cut of 50 percent by 2030, the groups said the US's \"fair share\" would be equivalent to 195 percent of 2005 levels. Chart showing the \"fair share\" concept of US carbon emission cuts, which takes into account a country's economic clout, as well as historic emissions. AFP / John SAEKI That means the US would need to nearly completely decarbonise its own economy, then facilitate significant emissions cuts in countries around the world through investment in clean energy and infrastructure.  \"Even if we go 100-percent zero emissions -- not net-zero, but real zero -- by 2030, that's still not our fair share, because we have such a historical legacy of climate pollution,\" said Wu. \"We're not calling for negative emissions or anything like that. We're calling for international finance to support reductions elsewhere.\"Climate Action Tracker, a think tank that compiles and evaluates national emissions reduction plans, found that the pledges made during last month's summit would, if fully implemented, knock 0.2C off projected warming.  US President Joe Biden was praised by political allies for his emissions cutting pledges AFP / JIM WATSON But the \"emissions gap\" between what has been promised and what is needed to stay below 1.5C remains enormous: even the latest round of commitments would -- if honoured -- still see Earth warm 2.4C this century. Michael Mann, director of Penn State's Earth System Science Center and author of \"The New Climate War\", told AFP that the emissions gap does not account for \"fair share\" cuts. \"It simply tells us what the global reductions in carbon emissions must be to achieve certain critical targets -- for example to avoid dangerous 1.5C warming,\" he said.  \"How they are divided up is a matter of policy, politics and ethics,\" he added.  \"Speaking as a concerned citizen, and not just a scientist, I do think countries like the US with a legacy of two centuries of producing carbon pollution have a special obligation to lead.\" The US is by far history's largest emitter, accounting for more than 28 percent of all carbon pollution since 1850. Yet it is far from alone in having an outsized historical contribution to climate change.  The Climate Equity Reference project, launched by think tanks EcoEquity and the Stockholm Environment Institute, applies the bedrock UN climate treaty principle of \"common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities\" to managing Earth's remaining carbon budget. Climate vulnerable nations with virtually no responsibility for historic emissions, can 'fairly' continue roughly along current emissions lines and still keep 1.5C in play AFP / MUNIR UZ ZAMAN Their fair-share calculator shows that -- in a scenario where 1.5C is achieved through emissions cuts alone -- the European Union should reduce its carbon pollution by the equivalent of 170 percent.  In total, high-income countries would need to slash emissions by 136 percent, the calculator shows. Conversely, climate vulnerable nations with virtually no responsibility for historic emissions, can \"fairly\" continue roughly along current emissions lines such that 1.5C remains in play. \"It sounds dry and complex but it's really just basic ethics,\" said Wu. \"OK, who made this mess? You have to clean it up.\" \"And if you have more wealth and more privilege than your neighbours, then you should correspondingly do a little more.\"Most wealthier nations plan to deploy carbon cutting schemes to help achieve their net-zero emissions targets.  In 2019, then-prime minister Theresa May pledged that Britain would \"eradicate its net contribution to climate change by 2050\". A subsequent report by the Chatham House think tank said there were \"many reasons to question\" Britain's path to net-zero, which relies heavily on carbon dioxide removal projects.  \"We have to be careful about what is hidden or swept under the rug in commitments of 'net-zero',\" said Mann.  \"Are promises of massive carbon capture based on as-yet untested -- at scale -- technology being used to excuse excessive burning of fossil fuels now? If so, then 'net-zero' is pretty hollow rhetoric.\" But even if Britain were to entirely eradicate its emissions overnight, the carbon it has polluted since the Industrial Revolution is still in the atmosphere, still influencing the climate today. Sriram Madhusoodanan, US Climate campaign director at industry watchdog Corporate Accountability, said that fair share emissions cuts were not just about doing \"what's right\", but also about keeping 1.5C a viable target. \"Without keeping fossil fuels in the ground, drastically reducing emissions immediately, and advancing real, accessible solutions at scale, we are on track to blow past the goals of the Paris Agreement,\" he said.The US Climate Fair share organisers calculated that it should reduce emissions by 70 percent by 2030 -- only 20 percent off Biden's pledge. But given its status as the richest nation on Earth, the coalition calculated that the US should also pay to cut a total of 9 billion tonnes of CO2 globally by 2030.  Since the cost of zero-carbon technologies varies greatly between countries, the math involved in putting a cost figure on such action is challenging.  But the NGOs arrived at what Wu termed a \"bare minimum\" figure: $800 billion this decade.  \"That would make a real impact and send a signal internationally,\" said Wu, while pointing out that the US's military budget currently stands at $750 billion in the next fiscal year alone.  \"Morals aside, unless we do this the climate crisis does not get solved and we have no chance of achieving 1.5C,\" he said.  \"And because we have this international system where everything is voluntary, if countries don't see that other countries are pulling their weight then they have no incentive to participate,\" Wu added.  \"We've had this 'first mover' problem forever.\" </p><p/>", "publisher": "International Business Times Australia", "instances": ["The US is by far history's largest emitter, accounting for more than 28 percent of all carbon pollution since 1850.

He won the 2016 election against a sure-bet Democrat with a political pedigree and the global media on her side. He won the second-biggest popular vote in US electoral history last week despite a four-year onslaught by the political media elite. On present numbers, he has increased the Republican share of Hispanic voters and improved his standing among African-Americans. Trump has forever changed American politics and the breadth of his achievements impresses where his style, and his handling of the pandemic fail.</p><p>The 45th US president restored law and order by defending police against militant racists and nominating black-letter lawyers to the Supreme Court. He chipped away at left-wing orthodoxy in the public service and on campus by testing the limits of free speech. He demanded equal treatment for America in foreign policy by telling free-riding allies to boost their military spending and pay their fair share for defence. He called the bluff of bully states and withdrew US money from the Paris Agreement, which rewards totalitarian regimes with Western workers' money. He protected Americans from illiberal enemies by closing the border to terrorist-producing states. He defended Israel by negotiating the most celebrated Middle East peace deal in recent history. He encouraged the revival of American manufacturing in towns gripped by unemployment and sliding into the despair of intergenerational opioid addiction. And he worked to restore the democratic norms established by the founding fathers. Trump stood for the millions of Americans that globalists treat like an unpleasant aftertaste of the industrial era. For all of that, the politically correct will forever regard him as an enemy.</p><p>As the votes rolled in on Wednesday night, Trumpism was the topic of discussion on the ABC. Although the host noted the Democrat landslide had failed to materialise (again), he could not resist describing Americans who support Trump as a cult. But the description is more aptly used for Democrat voters given their call to blacklist political dissenters in the wake of the election. Democrat congresswoman Alexandra Ocasio-Cortez suggested the names of people who worked with the US president should be recorded for their \"complicity.\" Michael Simon, a former Obama administration staffer, affirmed that a group was recording the names of \"Every (Trump) administration staffer, campaign staffer, bundler, lawyers who represented them - everyone\". He is in league with another former Democrat staffer, Emily Abrams, who tweeted on November 6: \"We're launching the Trump Accountability Project to make sure anyone who took a paycheck to help Trump \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 is held responsible.\" In other media, journalists worked hard to define the contours of Trumpism to confirm their bias against him. They regurgitated speaking points from the 2016 Clinton campaign, smearing the Republican base as uneducated, white, working-class and stupid. In other words, deplorable.</p><p>Ahead of the election, The Guardian's David Smith lamented that even if Trump were to lose, it would not \"defeat Trumpism\". Smith characterised crowd support for the former president on the campaign trail as \"cult-of-personality\" rallies. Consistent with many articles against Trump, an academic was used to strengthen the prosecution. Eddie Glaude, author of Democracy in Black, said Trump flourished because of white voters.</p><p>In The Sydney Morning Herald, Peter Hartcher interviewed Francis Fukuyama, an academic whose end-of-history idea was one of the most popular and spectacularly flawed theories of the late 20th century. Like many globalists who dreamed of a virtuous internationalist order that never was, Fukuyama stereotypes Republican voters as a \"narrow and unrepresentative base of white, working-class, poorly educated people resentful about all the changes going on in society\". When globalists so belittle conservatives, the charge of resentfulness is an exercise in projection.</p><p>Despite the many headlines celebrating Joe Biden as a moderating force, the future of America under the Democrats is not centrist in any meaningful sense of the word. Even if Biden were to remake himself in the image of Arthur Schlesinger's centrism, the challenge of containing Chinese communist aggression abroad and tempering the increasingly belligerent left in government would remain. He has shown little talent for either.</p><p>To get a taste of the political struggle to come, consider how Ocasio-Cortez uses race as a weapon. In a congressional hearing, she said: \"The people who are producing climate change \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 [are] predominantly white, correct?\" In August, vice-president elect Kamala Harris and Ocasio-Cortez jointly introduced the Climate Equity Act, which uses climate change as a rationale to embed inequality and anti-democratic processes in policy. It would introduce an equity score for environmental legislation based on race and economic status. In a press release, Harris explained the Act would require climate legislation and grants be developed by a designated office and \"frontline communities\", defined as: \"Those that have experienced systemic socioeconomic disparities, environmental racism \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 low-income communities, indigenous peoples and communities of colour\". Ocasio-Cortez took it a step further and openly embraced the new form of apartheid, demanding: \"Environmental policies must be written by the black, brown and low-income people \u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 just like the Green New Deal envisioned.\" This is not a case of white supremacists headbanging for Hitler and tattooing each other in a backyard shed. It is the incoming government of the US. When Trump won the 2016 election, the shock was registered on the downcast expression of TV anchors worldwide. The public berated pollsters who got it wrong while journalists rushed to revise their crude liberal bias for fear of being seen as irrelevant. Now the tables have turned and so has the media, whose barely concealed contempt for dissent has been liberated by the prospect of a Democrat president.

This debate plays to the music of many axes grinding. Not everyone will be pleased.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Nevertheless, this is a very creative and accessible report. In suggesting that global warming is occurring faster than predicted due to high global economic growth driven by China, Garnaut paints a bleak picture of the future unless we take significant action now. Garnaut has gone further than expected by proposing extreme reductions in emissions, and that Australia lead by example.</p><p>Garnaut lines up with current scientific opinion in endorsing a target of stabilising atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases to limit the average temperature rise this century to about two degrees. This ambitious target, which has been endorsed by the EU, reflects a concern that a rise of even that could trigger some kind of tipping point. It also recognises that the mood of the international community is shifting rapidly in favour of taking significant remedial action.</p><p>In terms of how we get there, Garnaut swims in the economic mainstream, favouring an emissions trading scheme with increasingly tight caps on emissions. Extending the scheme internationally will provide a range of cheaper abatement options and Garnaut suggests that Australia should work with Indonesia and Papua New Guinea. He also argues for government subsidies for research and development in low-emission technology and for investment in essential network infrastructure.</p><p>When Garnaut moves from efficiency to equity, as his terms of reference require, his review becomes more contentious. Domestically, Garnaut argues that high emitters should not be compensated for the introduction of a price on carbon because he says far-sighted investors should have provided for a carbon price and there is no tradition in Australia of compensating for policy changes.</p><p>Garnaut argues that industries that were subject to reductions in tariff protection in the 1980s and 1990s were not \"compensated\", but acknowledges that those most disadvantaged were provided with \"adjustment assistance\". This is splitting hairs. Owners of capital in the highly protected car and textile, clothing and footwear industries were given substantial ongoing support. The motor vehicle industry will receive about $2 billion in the five years to 2010.</p><p>Garnaut's judgement on international equity also differs significantly from Australia's long-standing position. By embracing the \"contraction and convergence\" approach favoured by developing countries and based on converging per capita emissions, Australia would effectively shoulder a greater abatement task than any other country. Our per capita emissions are the second highest in the developed world, but we also have a relatively high rate of population growth. Reducing per capita emissions over time to the level of India (whose emissions would be permitted to grow for many years) would require Australia to reduce its emissions by about 90% by 2050. This is not likely to be practical or efficient.</p><p>\u00b7 It is important to break the nexus between carbon intensity and economic wellbeing. This means developing low-emission technology that can support high living standards anywhere.</p><p>\u00b7 The most efficient way of reducing emissions is to establish a global target with a market mechanism such as emissions trading. While developed countries need to take action first, this global target needs to be introduced as soon as possible.</p><p>\u00b7 If a global scheme is inequitable between countries, that is best tackled with appropriate compensation rather than allowing some countries to increase emissions.</p><p>\u00b7 Not only would Garnaut's approach have severe implications for the Australian economy, it ensures ongoing US opposition - probably the most important argument against it.</p><p>Garnaut's review will greatly increase the community's understanding of the complexities of climate change and will be of considerable benefit to policymakers. It is when he steps off the well-trodden path of economic efficiency and into the equity jungle that Garnaut will have a tough argument on his hands.</p><p>Jon Stanford is a partner with Deloitte Economics in Melbourne.</p>", "publisher": "The Age (Melbourne, Australia)", "instances": []}, {"relevance_score": 19, "title": "Foreign investors looking at Spain option", "published": "2018-05-05", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Foreign investors are losing interest in local bank shares due to the fierce scrutiny of Australia's finance sector and are instead looking at options such as Spain's banks, National Australia Bank says.</p><p>As banks' reputations are battered by the royal commission, NAB chief executive Andrew Thorburn and finance chief Gary Lennon yesterday said the scrutiny was affecting sentiment among offshore equity investors.</p><p>However, they stressed there has not been any impact on overseas debt markets, which are arguably far more important for the local banking system, which is reliant on foreign capital for some of its funding.</p><p>Macquarie Group chief executive Nicholas Moore also said yesterday that he had not received any \"untoward\" feedback from overseas markets in response to the reputational damage experienced by banks here.</p><p>With the royal commission dominating public discussion about banks, Mr Lennon signalled that his conversations with foreign investors suggested they had little appetite for buying shares in the Australian banks in the current climate.</p><p>\"Equity investors offshore are going 'what is going on?' and 'Geez, we quite like the Spanish banks at the moment'.

Prime Minister Kevin Rudd promptly ratified the Kyoto Protocol as his first act of government and rightly was met with accolades at Bali. But what comes next?</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Rudd's visit to Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands tomorrow provides the perfect opportunity to raise the prospect of a South Seas climate pact to propel and co-ordinate action against global warming in our region. To date, only one regional body - the European Union - has formed a \"carbon bubble\" under the Kyoto Protocol. As a result, by 2010 the EU will meet its ambitious initial collective emissions mitigation target of 8% below 1990 levels. It is confidently aiming for a subsequent target of minus 30% by 2020.</p><p>These targets are made possible through \"burden-sharing\" among EU members, enabling a more equitable and efficient approach to reducing emissions among countries of varying economic and institutional capacity.</p><p>The EU approach has also involved creating a regional carbon market that is now the centrepiece of the Kyoto carbon market, assembling a coherent regional energy strategy, and defining regional energy efficiency standards. Lastly, via the example of its leading members, it has enhanced the diffusion of institutional innovation and the implementation of renewable energy technologies.</p><p>There are some Australian precedents for a regional climate pact. Australia's most extensive multilateral climate agreement, but extensive only on paper, is the Asia Pacific Partnership on Clean Development and Climate. More important is the Global Initiative on Forests and Climate, which promises a massive reduction in Indonesia's forestry-related carbon dioxide emissions, which are about 3 billion tonnes each year. Our bilateral initiatives are small, barely funded, and show no evidence of substantive outcomes.</p><p>Under John Howard, Australia had no substantial climate-related foreign policy strategy. Labor must be more ambitious. It should propose a means to co-operatively and equitably improve our region's capacity to reduce its collective emissions and to increase regional capacities for climate-related adaptation.</p><p>Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, East Timor, New Guinea and other near-Pacific Islands drawn from Melanesia and Polynesia (including Fiji, the Solomons, Vanuatu, the Cook Islands) are close neighbours. But the reasons for including them in a near-Pacific pact go beyond the accident of geography. They are based in equity, efficiency, ecological protection and environmental security.</p><p>First, Australia and New Zealand are wealthy developed countries, better able than most to meet the challenges of climate mitigation and adaptation. The others are poor and highly vulnerable to global warming. In terms of climate equity, the pact would direct assistance from some of the richest to some of the poorer countries in the world, including certain Pacific island nations that have contributed least to global warming, are under greatest threat from inundation, and have the least capacity to respond. Second, the region contains some of the planet's major emitting nations. Indonesia is third on the global list, Australia is 13th. A pact offers opportunities for a globally meaningful, regionally co-ordinated mitigation effort: Indonesia's and New Guinea's forests are major carbon sinks threatened by illegal (and legal) logging.</p><p>Third, these forests are threatened by rising temperatures, as are Pacific reefs, such as Australia's Great Barrier Reef. Finally, environmental security is an issue best considered pre-emptively and co-operatively. If sea levels rise and access to fresh water and food deteriorates, environmental insecurity associated with the displacement and mass migration of people will become a significant concern within our region.</p><p>The provisions of the Kyoto Protocol suggest several possible forms for such a pact. The most elaborate would involve the establishment of a new regional economic organisation along EU lines to deal with climate mitigation and adaptation. It would have its own unified emissions target to which member states contribute through national allocation plans.</p><p>Under the least formal arrangement, the pact's member states would co-ordinate their targets and activities in a way that does not depend on a regional economic organisation and therefore is not formally recognised in the Kyoto Protocol. We should aim for something between these options.</p><p>With a formal Climate Council involving national ministers, a well-funded secretariat, a collective emissions reduction target, and substantial resources to assist meeting this target, the South Pacific climate pact would be a critical focus for co-ordinated action.</p><p>Enduring institutional innovation to tackle climate change, beyond Labor's pledge of $150 million in Pacific climate aid, would greatly improve regional relations and prospects.</p><p>Peter Christoff teaches climate policy at the University of Melbourne and is Vice-President of the Australian Conservation Foundation.</p>", "publisher": "The Age (Melbourne, Australia)", "instances": ["First, Australia and New Zealand are wealthy developed countries, better able than most to meet the challenges of climate mitigation and adaptation.
