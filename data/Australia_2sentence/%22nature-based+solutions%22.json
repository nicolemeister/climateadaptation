It is estimated that approximately three-quarters of the Earth's land and nearly two-thirds of its marine environment have been substantially altered by human impact[3].

The Mayo Clinic has been ranked as one of the best hospitals in the US, since 1990, and the best hospital in the world for the past seven years.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In 2015, Mayo launched the Destination Medical Centre (DMC) campaign to make Rochester a global medical destination. The plan included new biotechnology incubator precincts, regeneration of housing near healthcare facilities, and improved transportation networks from airports and regional communities. Rochester's success provides a model that Tasmania could follow for specialised medicine and economic development.</p><p>In 2025, Mayo employs 33,000 people in Rochester and generates $US1.5bn ($2.3bn) annual tax revenue. The larger Mayo Clinic health system has patients from more than 130 countries each year. Visitors provide a boost to the local economy each time they visit and pay out-of-pocket for the healthcare, rather than draining Medicare.</p><p>In addition to The Mayo Clinic, I have also worked at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, Maryland, which was the No. 1 ranked hospital in the US from 1991 to 2011. The striking difference was that Johns Hopkins was in the centre of a large industrial city, whereas Rochester was nestled into a midwestern farm community setting. This contrast shows that great healthcare can be delivered in very different socio-economic settings.</p><p>We have great people working in the Tasmanian health system, but resources are lacking in many key areas. The relatively new K Block building at the Royal Hobart Hospital was a great step forward.</p><p>When my youngest son was born, the K Block was basically a hole in the ground we could see out the window of the hospital. I watched the K Block rise and supply many design and construction jobs before diversifying into the hundreds of jobs needed to operate and maintain the new building. This made me wonder: Could Tasmania become a global medical destination?</p><p>Tasmania doesn't have a globally high-ranking hospital like The Mayo Clinic or Johns Hopkins as a foundation for a DMC. However, Tasmania is a unique and wonderful place to live and raise a family.</p><p>The true wilderness at our urban doorsteps in Tasmania is an experience to behold, and promotes outdoor lifestyles with great wellbeing benefits.</p><p>This wild beauty could be at the heart of a similar campaign here which could be titled Destination Medical Tasmania (DMT). Integrating what is special about Tasmania with current healthcare, research, and industry specialisations could make DMT a reality.</p><p>Specialisations are the key to developing a DMT; we can't be the best at everything, but we can be the best in some things and good in many others.</p><p>The University of Tasmania (UTAS) has world class neuroscience research and teaching programs. For example, UTAS has developed several massive online open courses (MOOCs) for dementia, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease, Parkinson's, and traumatic brain injury that have enrolled more than 500,000 participants from around the world since 2013.</p><p>Dementia was the second leading cause of death in Australia in 2023, and is one of the most challenging diseases for patients' families. Likewise, Tasmania has one of the highest multiple sclerosis rates in the world. A key aspect of specialty care for these debilitating neurological diseases would be teaching people how to care for their family members and themselves in the early stages of these debilitating diseases.</p><p>What better place to do this than Tasmania, with a view of kunanyi/Mt Wellington during the day and the gentle sounds of pademelons hopping around at night?</p><p>Nature-based solutions that not only extend lives, but also improve the quality of life for patients and families is an emerging field.</p><p>Programs like the dementia-inclusive nature hubs can help to address the growing need for dementia care and training. While dementia is one of the leading causes of death, mental health issues are among the most rapidly expanding quality of life issues on a global scale.</p><p>Nature based-solutions will play a key role in addressing mental health issues. Tasmania is an ideal setting to attract global patients and families to a DMT specialisation in nature-based solutions, which can fuel small businesses like \"Nature. Be in it\".</p><p>Additional specialisations could include One Health training centres, which focus on the links between human, animal, and environmental health, and trauma medicine to address the growing global popularity of Tasmania as a mountain biking and wilderness adventure destination.</p><p>As we are considering how to invest in the future of Tasmania, shouldn't we be considering what our most pressing needs are now and what they will be in the future? Such a Destination Medical Tasmania would ensure our health infrastructure supports our urban and regional communities, harness and conserve the omnipresent nature on our beautiful island, while contributing to a steady stream of well-paid, long-term jobs.</p><p>Dr Andy Flies is an Australian Research Council future fellow and associate professor of Immunology at the Menzies Institute for Medical Research, University of Tasmania</p>", "publisher": "Hobart Mercury/Sunday Tasmanian (Australia)", "instances": ["A key aspect of specialty care for these debilitating neurological diseases would be teaching people how to care for their family members and themselves in the early stages of these debilitating diseases.

First, oyster mushrooms are grown on maize stover, producing protein-rich food using a widely available and low-cost substrate. The spent mushroom material then feeds earthworms, which convert it into additional high-quality protein and nutrient-rich compost. Farmed earthworms were found to have a protein content and amino acid profile comparable to or better than commonly farmed insects, making them a promising alternative protein source. At the same time, the compost they produce helps maintain soil carbon content-without the need for extra land. This circular system could strengthen local food security and support soil health in maize-based farming systems across Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the face of population growth, land scarcity, and climate-related stress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 20: Wageningen University &amp; Research: Light, Roots, and Nutrients: Understanding Nitrate Uptake Regulation in Hydroponic Systems</p><p>My PhD research explored nitrate uptake regulation in hydroponics-a system where plants grow in nutrient-rich water without soil, offering sustainable production potential. Experiments with Arabidopsis showed that plants absorb most of the available nitrate but retain only what is needed, releasing the rest back almost simultaneously-a dynamic balance between uptake and use. Plants also prioritize internal nitrogen balance by adjusting allocation between root and shoot, rather than reacting immediately to external changes. Mechanical disturbance of roots, common in hydroponic systems due to oxygenation, significantly reduced growth without affecting nitrate uptake. After conducting extensive hydroponic experiments, I recognized the need for a practical tool to support hydroponic system planning. I developed a dynamic model that estimates how long a setup can sustain plant growth, and whether issues like rising EC, nutrient depletion, or imbalanced nutrient ratios may occur under different environmental conditions, system sizes, and replenishment strategies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>July 04: Wageningen University &amp; Research: NWA funding for research into quinoa, lupin and aardaker: promising meat alternatives that also benefit the soil</p><p>A plate of vegetables that not only nourishes people but also helps restore biodiversity, improve soil health and make our diets more climate-friendly.

Scheduled for August 29 and 30, the event will take place at URI's Fascitelli Center for Advanced Engineering, located at 2 East Alumni Ave. on the Kingston Campus. Among the highlighted keynote speakers is Dr. Temple Grandin, a respected animal behavioral scientist, bestselling author, and a prominent advocate for individuals with autism spectrum disorders. \"Dr. Grandin's early career success as an animal scientist was because she thought differently and saw things that others did not see,\" says Anthony Marchese, the dean of the College of Engineering at URI.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">+   UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND HIGHLIGHTS RISING VACCINE EXEMPTIONS AND ASSOCIATED RISKS FOR SCHOOLCHILDREN</p><p>Despite the established safety and effectiveness of vaccines in preventing communicable diseases, vaccination rates among young students have been on a gradual decline in recent years as more parents opt for exemptions from school vaccine mandates. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, exemption requests reached unprecedented levels last year, with a record 3.6 percent of kindergarten students being exempted from vaccine requirements, an increase from 3.3 percent the previous year. The CDC reports that only 92.5 percent of kindergarteners were vaccinated against highly infectious diseases such as measles, rubella, and mumps during the 2024-25 school year. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, vaccination rates among kindergartners were above 95 percent, a threshold necessary to prevent outbreaks.</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND PROFESSOR RECEIVES NSF GRANT TO EXPLORE NATURE-BASED SOLUTIONS FOR COASTAL HAZARDS</p><p>According to the Coastal Resources Management Council, Rhode Island's coastline is eroding at an alarming rate of nearly two feet per year, with certain regions experiencing losses exceeding that figure. The most significant erosion is occurring in high-energy wave zones along the state's southern coast, which is particularly vulnerable due to its exposure. Recently, Che-Wei Chang, an Assistant Professor at the University of Rhode Island, has secured a National Science Foundation grant for his research project titled Experimental Investigation of Vegetation Effects on Coastal Wave and Current Dynamics. \"Our research addresses the growing need for effective and sustainable shoreline protection strategies,\" said Chang, a professor in the ocean engineering department. \"By understanding how coastal vegetation interacts with waves and currents, we can better evaluate its role in protecting coastal communities.\"</p><p>+   URI INTRODUCES NEW ACADEMIC PROGRAMS FOR THE 2025-26 ACADEMIC YEAR</p><p>The University of Rhode Island will commence its fall semester classes on Sept. 3, unveiling a range of new academic programs for the upcoming academic year. Among the new undergraduate offerings is a B.A. in Business Studies, an online RN to BSN degree, and an online Interdisciplinary Studies major. Additionally, five new master's degrees will be introduced this fall in areas such as Management, Educational Leadership and Policy, Public Health, Mental and Behavioral Health Counseling, and Engineering Management &amp; Leadership. Two new graduate certificates in College Teaching and Community Planning will also be available. The URI Graduate School has experienced an 11% rise in fall applications compared to the previous year, and a significant 29% increase from two years ago, with over 5,300 inquiries regarding the University's graduate programs.</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF RHODE ISLAND STUDIES ALASKAN SALT MARSHES FOR INSIGHTS INTO DYNAMIC COASTAL ECOSYSTEMS</p><p>The most powerful earthquake in U.S. history struck Alaska's south coast on March 27, 1964, registering a magnitude of 9.2 on the Richter scale. This seismic event triggered a tsunami that affected regions as far south as California and significantly transformed the Alaskan landscape. When the earthquake modified the elevation of land in areas like Anchorage and the Copper River Delta, it resulted in a complex new coastal wetland landscape. Since then, salt marshes have reestablished themselves, creating vital habitats for species such as shorebirds, salmon, beaver, and moose. These wetlands play a crucial role in wildlife support, coastal flood mitigation, pollutant filtration, nutrient distribution, and carbon sequestration, yet there remain unanswered questions regarding their geological and ecological characteristics.</p><p>+   URI STUDENT OVERCOMES ADVERSITY WHILE PURSUING PASSION FOR SHIPWRECK EXPLORATION</p><p>Inspired by his father's career as a naval architect, Jake Bonney has aspired to work in ocean science since childhood.  \"Growing up, I went into the office with him and tagged along on boat launches and stability tests,\" said Bonney. \"My father printed out drawings of the ships he was working on, and I colored them in.\"  Years later, Bonney's father joined him on visits to universities that offered ocean engineering programs.

First, oyster mushrooms are grown on maize stover, producing protein-rich food using a widely available and low-cost substrate. The spent mushroom material then feeds earthworms, which convert it into additional high-quality protein and nutrient-rich compost. Farmed earthworms were found to have a protein content and amino acid profile comparable to or better than commonly farmed insects, making them a promising alternative protein source. At the same time, the compost they produce helps maintain soil carbon content-without the need for extra land. This circular system could strengthen local food security and support soil health in maize-based farming systems across Sub-Saharan Africa, particularly in the face of population growth, land scarcity, and climate-related stress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>June 20: Wageningen University &amp; Research: Light, Roots, and Nutrients: Understanding Nitrate Uptake Regulation in Hydroponic Systems</p><p>My PhD research explored nitrate uptake regulation in hydroponics-a system where plants grow in nutrient-rich water without soil, offering sustainable production potential. Experiments with Arabidopsis showed that plants absorb most of the available nitrate but retain only what is needed, releasing the rest back almost simultaneously-a dynamic balance between uptake and use. Plants also prioritize internal nitrogen balance by adjusting allocation between root and shoot, rather than reacting immediately to external changes. Mechanical disturbance of roots, common in hydroponic systems due to oxygenation, significantly reduced growth without affecting nitrate uptake. After conducting extensive hydroponic experiments, I recognized the need for a practical tool to support hydroponic system planning. I developed a dynamic model that estimates how long a setup can sustain plant growth, and whether issues like rising EC, nutrient depletion, or imbalanced nutrient ratios may occur under different environmental conditions, system sizes, and replenishment strategies.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>July 01: Wageningen University &amp; Research: From university idea to EdTech success: the spin-off story of Wageningen University &amp; Research and Peek</p><p>How does a successful spin-off emerge from a university setting?

Experiments with Arabidopsis showed that plants absorb most of the available nitrate but retain only what is needed, releasing the rest back almost simultaneously-a dynamic balance between uptake and use. Plants also prioritize internal nitrogen balance by adjusting allocation between root and shoot, rather than reacting immediately to external changes.

Experiments with Arabidopsis showed that plants absorb most of the available nitrate but retain only what is needed, releasing the rest back almost simultaneously-a dynamic balance between uptake and use. Plants also prioritize internal nitrogen balance by adjusting allocation between root and shoot, rather than reacting immediately to external changes. Mechanical disturbance of roots, common in hydroponic systems due to oxygenation, significantly reduced growth without affecting nitrate uptake. After conducting extensive hydroponic experiments, I recognized the need for a practical tool to support hydroponic system planning.

Yet beneath the surface of these seemingly straightforward arrangements lies a complex web of competing priorities, stakeholder interests, and financial considerations that can make or break a project's success.</p><p>As construction managers at the center of these negotiations, we've witnessed firsthand how the delicate balance between public facility investment and private team ownership creates both opportunities and challenges that extend far beyond traditional project delivery. The key to success lies not just in managing budgets and timelines, but in understanding how to align divergent stakeholder priorities while maximizing return on investment for all parties involved.</p><p>The Market-Size Dynamic One of the most significant factors influencing PPPs in sports infrastructure is market size, and this relationship often defies conventional wisdom.

Vitamin D - often called \"the sunshine vitamin\" - is an essential nutrient for good health. Your body produces it when your skin is exposed to UVB rays from sunlight. Despite its natural source, many people don't get enough, which can lead to a deficiency that affects bones, muscles, mood and more.</p><p>Vitamin D plays several critical roles. It helps your body absorb calcium and maintain phosphorus levels. Both are vital for keeping your bones strong and healthy.</p><p>This important vitamin also supports your immune system and is linked to a lower risk of chronic conditions, including heart disease and diabetes. Yet, despite its importance, studies show more than 40% of Americans have vitamin D levels below what many experts consider optimal for overall health, and about 1 in 4 have levels considered deficient.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    TLT (N.I.)

For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation.

Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation.

Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

Trump cited New Delhi's continued imports of Russian oil as the reason behind this newest measure, sharply escalating tensions between the two countries after months of negotiations over a possible limited trade agreement fell through.</p><p>The new tariffs on some Indian goods would be among the steepest faced by any U.S. trading partner. Trade analysts warned the tariffs could severely disrupt Indian exports, according to Reuters. The president's order says the additional 25% tariff will go into effect 21 days after the previously-announced 25% tariff, which was set to take hold Aug. 7.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>August 08: Yale University: Summer picks: Where do our early childhood memories go? podcast</p><p>It's a mystery that has long puzzled researchers.

Bringing Ourselves into the Experience of Art</p><p>The first research lesson is that art's power to inform and enlighten isn't just about the artwork itself. Instead, the viewer plays an essential role.</p><p>To examine what makes art memorable, researchers asked art viewers to reflect on experiences with art and describe aloud what the art they remembered looked like, where they were when they saw it, how they felt, and what else they thought about. From the responses, the team gleaned that memorable art experiences are marked by intense concentration, awareness of a variety of bodily sensations, and people making connections to personal experiences or events from their lives.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>SECTION 4 YALE UNIVERSITY: DEMOGRAPHY</p><p>4.1 Employees Demography</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"2\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_4\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"232\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"392\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Gender</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Percentage</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Men</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">52</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Women</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">48</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p>", "publisher": "News Bites - Private Companies", "instances": ["In the global effort to decarbonize, the conversation is often dominated by high-tech solutions like electric vehicles, advanced batteries, and smart grids.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience.

Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve.

From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC BUILDING CONSTRUCTION CAREERS FOR THE WORKFORCE OF TOMORROW</p><p>In the past decade, the construction industry has nearly doubled in size, with the top 400 contractors reporting $600 billion in revenue last year, as compared to $344 billion in 2015, according to Engineering News-Record. Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience. With fewer experienced mentors, apprenticeship-style training is impacted, further widening the gap.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities. The answer, we believe, lies in collaboration, creativity, and a focus on delivering spaces that inspire. This is evident in two baseball renovation projects on Florida's Atlantic Coast: Jackie Robinson Ballpark and Roger Dean Chevrolet Stadium.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC [3 Press Releases]</p><p>+   ROBOTICS AT HITT: POWERED BY CURIOSITY, DRIVEN BY PEOPLE</p><p>At HITT, we've always embraced construction technology that helps us build smarter, safer, and more efficiently.

From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

Across the U.S., demand for construction is soaring, but finding the skilled workforce is more challenging than ever. Associated Builders and Contractors estimates that by 2027, the industry will need to add more than 500,000 new workers to keep pace with the industry's growth.</p><p>The labor shortage in construction is not driven by business cycles or economic conditions: the causes are structural and persistent and won't be solved by economic recovery or time. The war for talent can be traced to the 2008 financial crisis, when the industry shed more than 2 million jobs by 2010. Over the next 10 years, as demand recovered and job openings mounted, the gap in available talent widened. Baby Boomers, the largest workforce generation in history, are retiring in record numbers, creating an influx of job openings, especially in field roles that require years of on-the-job experience.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation. Our approach combines deep sports construction expertise with a commitment to innovation, equity, and long-term value. Whether it's a Division I university or an MLB spring training facility, we treat every project as a chance to build something bigger than the venue itself.</p><p>This current investment in baseball represents a key moment to redefine what these spaces mean for athletes, fans, and communities.

Today, robotics in construction are transforming how we deliver projects nationwide-from drones flying over excavation sites to four-legged robots walking through interiors. But make no mistake-robots aren't here to replace humans. In fact, the more we integrate robotics into construction, the clearer it becomes: people are more essential than ever.</p><p>Building Smarter with Robotics HITT's Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) team is pushing boundaries of what robotics in construction can achieve. At our new headquarters office jobsite-a ground-up, Class A base building project in the Washington, DC area-we're piloting the use of both aerial drones and ground robotics to capture high-accuracy data that helps track progress and improve decision-making.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HITT CONTRACTING INC SHOWING APPRECIATION FOR SUBCONTRACTOR PARTNERS NATIONWIDE</p><p>Summer at HITT is a time to celebrate our subcontractor partners!

Each HITT office hosts a local event to recognize the invaluable contributions of our subcontractors.</p><p>Building lasting relationships with our partners is a top priority for us.

From drones that map entire jobsites in minutes to robots that capture on-the-ground conditions or interior progress, robotics are fundamentally changing how we track, measure, and manage complex builds. The goal? Smarter decisions, safer jobsites, and better results.</p><p>At HITT, we're building a new headquarters in Falls Church, Virginia, but it's far from the average base building project. The ground-up Class A office building project will serve as a test for these technologies in real-world conditions, helping shape the future of how we build. One way is by integrating robotics into our daily field operations, using cutting-edge technology to support and supplement the work of our superintendents and project teams.</p><p>This project marks the first HITT jobsite where both aerial and ground robots are being used simultaneously and in coordination to capture data from all areas of the site. Aerial drones collect exterior views, while Spot, the four-legged ground robot, navigates the jobsite from the ground and, eventually, in interior spaces. What sets this apart from previous robotics efforts is how we're tying these technologies together into a single, highly accurate digital platform that provides a comprehensive, real-time view of progress.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>+   KBR, INC.

With 58 stadium and 27 arena projects at the collegiate level slated for completion in 2025 - that's up from 53 and 19 the year prior - and a surge in minor league ballpark upgrades, we are currently amid a record wave of investment in baseball infrastructure. In fact, according to the Sports Business Journal, 2025 and 2026 will be the highest ballpark investment spending years in Minor League Baseball history at $572.2 million and $1 billion, respectively.</p><p>A big part of the reason for this investment is the previously instituted MLB facility standard requirements aimed to help ensure a consistent and safe environment for players, staff, and fans. For instance, per the facility standards, home and visiting clubhouses must be at least 1,000 SF, on-site weight rooms are required for player development, and player venues must have dedicated dining facilities. But beyond compliance, owners are seizing the opportunity to elevate the fan experience, integrate sustainability, and create venues that serve as economic catalysts.</p><p>At Barton Malow, we're proud to be at the forefront of this transformation.

The Nikon Imaging Center at Heidelberg University contributed to the molecular findings by providing three-dimensional imaging of the pancreatic tissue to display the nerve network.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HEIDELBERG UNIVERSITY PREDICTING THE KINETIC ENERGY OF MOLECULAR QUANTUM SYSTEMS USING ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE</p><p>Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung funds research project at the interface of chemistry, physics and AI research Artificial intelligence methods are to assist in predicting the kinetic energy of electrons in molecules based on their electron density. That is the concern of an interdisciplinary research project at Heidelberg University, located at the interface of chemistry, physics and AI research. The goal of the project \"Quantum Chemistry without Orbitals\" is to forecast the properties of much more complex systems than has as yet been possible. The project was initiated by Prof. Dr Fred Hamprecht and Prof. Dr Andreas Dreuw from the Interdisciplinary Center for Scientific Computing and Prof. Dr Maurits W. Haverkort from the Institute for Theoretical Physics. The Carl-Zeiss-Stiftung has allocated more than 745,000 euros to fund the research work for a period of two years.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   HEIDELBERGER BRUCKE: CLIMATE ACTION IN TIMES OF GLOBAL CRISES AND SOCIAL UPHEAVALS</p><p>Environmental science colloquium features online and in-person events Action to mitigate climate change in times of global crises and upheavals in society will be addressed at the colloquium \"Heidelberger Brucke\" taking place in the 2025 summer semester.

These include a new programme providing GCSE mathematics mentoring to students who show promise for the subject, and an innovative 'online school' that gives 14-19-year-olds the opportunity to learn maths and physics at a deep level.</p><p>Together, they will support disadvantaged students starting their GCSEs right through to those finishing their first year at Oxford, with each programme designed to address specific challenges these students experience when choosing to study STEM subjects.</p><p>The donor, who has opted to remain anonymous, has also made a gift to the University of Cambridge to support projects aimed at increasing participation and attainment in STEM subjects. While the programmes will be administered separately, the universities will work together - sharing online resources and materials, as well as academic tutors - to ensure maximum impact for participating students.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD NEW 50M MRC CENTRE LAUNCHED TO STUDY HOW ENVIRONMENTAL EXPOSURES CAUSE CHRONIC INFLAMMATORY DISEASES</p><p>A new Medical Research Council Centre of Research Excellence (MRC CoRE) will investigate how the environment interacts with our immune system to trigger chronic inflammatory diseases, such as asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD) and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).</p><p>Chronic inflammation-related diseases have been estimated to cause over half of all deaths worldwide, so unlocking the processes behind these diseases is crucial to saving lives through developing better prevention and treatments.</p><p>The MRC CoRE in Exposome Immunology will receive up to Pound50 million over 14 years, leveraging the combined strength of teams at The University of Oxford and The University of Manchester in immunology, big data, and environmental science.</p><p>The 'exposome' describes the many environmental factors a person encounters throughout their life, ranging from pollution and occupational hazards to diet and infectious diseases. This has a huge impact on health and wellbeing, with an estimated 30,000 deaths attributed to air pollution every year in the UK, and increasing rates of inflammatory diseases in children. However, very little is known about the mechanisms by which the exposome causes disease.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD PAST THEIR PRIME TOOL USE DECLINES WITH AGE IN WILD CHIMPANZEES</p><p>Wild chimpanzees show reduced participation and performance in their tool-use behaviours as they grow older, according to the long-term video observations used in the new study. This provides solid evidence that old age leads to gradual withdrawal from tool use, and is a contributing factor to lower efficiency in chimps' stone tool selection and use.</p><p>The findings also indicate that chimpanzees mirror human beings in how the aging process affects their ability to carry out dextrous and cognitively-challenging daily tasks. Similar to humans, the effects of old-age varied considerably between individuals, with some chimpanzees struggling to use tools, whilst others maintained excellent performance into later life.</p><p>Wild chimpanzees use tools during some of the most cognitively and physically demanding foraging behaviours observed in non-human animals. While the behavioural changes that occur with aging have been widely studied in humans and some captive primates, exceptionally little is known about how growing older affects the lives of elderly wild apes. This includes how the capacity to address technical, real-world tasks changes as chimpanzees become progressively older.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url></p>", "publisher": "News Bites - Private Companies", "instances": ["The Heidelberg Center for the Environment (HCE), the environmental research center of Heidelberg University, is hosting the events under the general heading \"Pushed to the Sidelines?

It's a beautiful part of the world, but reconciling that beauty with what is happening on the ground is getting harder by the week. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Lake Macquarie City Council (LMCC) continues to actively pursue population growth ('<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8971556/lake-macquarie-council-criticised-for-90k-spend-on-sydney-promo/\"> Lake Mac woos Sydney millennials with $90,000 coffee and VR </url>', <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NH</emphasis> 21/5) and heralds every growth milestone as a triumph, as if it's business as usual, while the climate crisis escalates.</p><p>In the past six months alone, Lake Macquarie has been declared a natural disaster area twice, first in January and again in May. Torrential rain, violent storms, and widespread flooding inundated homes, severed roads and racked up millions in damage. These are not \"once-in-a-generation\" events. They are the new normal, warning signs: loud, frequent, and increasingly devastating.</p><p>Last week, LMCC unveiled its draft <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">Teralba to Toronto (T2T) Climate Resilience Plan</emphasis>, which paints a sobering picture of what residents in the city's west can expect as climate impacts intensify. The projections are stark: severe fire weather days up 45 per cent by 2030 and 130 per cent by 2090 (relative to 1995); extreme rainfall events up 10 per cent by 2030 and almost 20 per cent by 2050; lake level rise of 40cm by 2050, enough to inundate 251 homes and threaten another 565.</p><p>These statistics aren't future hypotheticals. They describe what my neighbours, colleagues, and family are already experiencing: more frequent storms, longer recovery times, and a creeping sense of insecurity about the place we call home. But instead of treating this as a wake-up call, some councillors fret about its tone ('<url normalizedValue=\"https://www.newcastleherald.com.au/story/8988842/lake-macquarie-climate-plan-will-cost-residents-warns-pauling/\"> More difficult': Councillor issues warning on climate plan's impact </url>, <emphasis typeStyle=\"it\">NH</emphasis> 10/6). Cr Jason Pauling criticised the strategy for being \"all doom and gloom,\" arguing that spelling out the science would make life \"more difficult\" for residents.</p><p>Facing reality isn't the problem; inaction is.</p><p>As the founder of The Groundswell Collective, a sustainability organisation, I work with communities every day who are already feeling the effects of these changes. They don't need sugar-coating; they need leadership. </p><p>Because while the T2T plan rightly identifies the risks, it does little to address the root causes. What good is a resilience plan if the council continues to push for and approve developments in high-risk floodplains and heat-affected suburbs, clearing the bushland that naturally soaks up water, cools streets and stores carbon? </p><p>Rather than drafting PDFs with scant follow-through, why not prioritise proven nature-based solutions and stop chasing short-term economic wins?</p><p>\"Resilience\" has become a buzzword, too often used to applaud communities for bouncing back instead of preventing harm in the first place. But how long can people keep bouncing back when the ground beneath them, literally and figuratively, is being eroded? </p><p>Real resilience is not about recovery alone; it demands bold, upstream decisions that reduce risk before disaster strikes.</p><p>Is the T2T plan an uplifting bedtime read? No. But it is an honest assessment of what lies ahead if we stay on the current course. </p><p>Climate change is not a distant threat; it is here, accelerating and reshaping our lives.</p><p>The pressing question is whether the council's strategies are being matched with tangible action on the ground. Residents are urged to \"prepare your home, have a plan, be more resilient\", but there is only so much a household can do. Personal preparedness matters, yet it cannot offset the consequences of systemic planning decisions.</p><p>Meanwhile, the economic costs of inaction are mounting. </p><p>Disaster recovery, road repairs, rising insurance premiums and health impacts already strain household and government budgets. Continuing to prioritise short-term development gains over long-term sustainability only amplifies those bills. Rethinking spending priorities is not merely a climate imperative; it is sound financial governance.</p><p>We cannot grow our way out of this crisis. It is time Lake Macquarie City Council aligned its budgets with climate reality, rethought its spending priorities and matched its bold words with bold action before the next \"once-in-a-generation\" disaster arrives, right on schedule.</p><p>Anna Noon is a Lake Macquarie resident with a background in social and environmental justice.</p>", "publisher": "Newcastle Herald", "instances": ["Because while the T2T plan rightly identifies the risks, it does little to address the root causes.

This provides solid evidence that old age leads to gradual withdrawal from tool use, and is a contributing factor to lower efficiency in chimps' stone tool selection and use.</p><p>The findings also indicate that chimpanzees mirror human beings in how the aging process affects their ability to carry out dextrous and cognitively-challenging daily tasks. Similar to humans, the effects of old-age varied considerably between individuals, with some chimpanzees struggling to use tools, whilst others maintained excellent performance into later life.</p><p>Wild chimpanzees use tools during some of the most cognitively and physically demanding foraging behaviours observed in non-human animals. While the behavioural changes that occur with aging have been widely studied in humans and some captive primates, exceptionally little is known about how growing older affects the lives of elderly wild apes.

Yet it underpins virtually every aspect of daily life-from food and healthcare, to communication and transport. Globally, it enables sustainable development by improving educational outcomes, increasing clean water availability, and building climate adaptation capacity. Its centrality in the UN Sustainable Development Goals underscores a shared understanding: equitable development hinges on universal energy access.</p><p>Achieving this goal, however, is far from straightforward. Though policy-making and planning tends to focus on national-scale grid extension, this is not a panacea. The estimated 750 million people who remain without electricity access globally are predominantly located in rural, remote areas, where traditional grid expansion is neither technically nor financially viable. Even where grids are present, households may lack the means or motivation to connect, or the appliances to make use of their connection. Alternative solutions are needed to close this gap.</p><p>Source: Company website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF OXFORD MAJOR INVESTMENT FOR NEXT-GENERATION BATTERY RESEARCH FOR HEAVY INDUSTRIES</p><p>Since 2017, Prosperity Partnerships have provided investment for academic institutes and businesses to co-create and co-deliver a programme of research activity that directly addresses a clear industrial need.</p><p>For the new project 'Energy storage for decarbonisation', the University of Oxford will partner with Fortescue Zero, a global leader in zero emissions solutions and electrifying mining equipment, to develop safer, longer-lasting, and more efficient industrial batteries for vehicles in difficult-to-decarbonise industries.
