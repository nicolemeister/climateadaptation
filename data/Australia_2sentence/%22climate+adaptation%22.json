As stated by Stephen Anderson, chief strategy &amp; technology officer at PwC Middle East, on 18th August 2025, the region must focus on coordinated policies that build trust, reduce risk, and align with long-term national priorities. These efforts should encompass responsible AI integration, climate adaptation, investment in human capital, and fostering trust in technology and institutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 'Value in Motion' report outlines three possible futures for the Middle East, influenced by the region's navigation of AI adoption, climate action, and economic reinvention. The 'trust-based transformation' scenario presents the highest growth potential, projecting a GDP of $4.68 trillion, driven by effective collaboration and sustainability measures. In contrast, the 'tense transition' scenario anticipates a GDP of $4.61 trillion, while the 'turbulent times' scenario forecasts a GDP of $4.45 trillion, highlighting a $232 billion gap between the best and worst case outcomes. The report emphasizes that AI could contribute an additional 8.3% to GDP growth under the trust-based scenario, although decarbonization efforts may simultaneously reduce GDP by 5.2% due to stranded assets.</p><p>PwC notes that the Middle East's capacity to lead in solar power generation could provide additional benefits in decarbonization efforts. Emerging sectors such as green fuels, agritech, and renewable-powered data centers present untapped opportunities that could further enhance regional economic growth. The report posits that a trust-based transformation would see AI and climate solutions working in tandem to drive productivity growth and climate resilience. Conversely, the tense transition scenario depicts a more fragmented approach to sustainability and technology adoption, while the turbulent times scenario highlights the risks of geopolitical instability undermining trust in technology and limiting its economic benefits.</p><p>The report does not predict a fixed trajectory but offers a framework for assessing potential outcomes. Current trends in AI investment, renewable energy, and digital infrastructure align with elements of the trust-based transformation scenario. The future will ultimately depend on how effectively AI is harnessed, how Middle Eastern economies manage the energy transition, and the economic implications of decarbonization. Achieving the ambitious goal of a $4.68 trillion GDP requires a holistic approach focused on embedding AI responsibly, accelerating climate adaptation, and investing in human capital, as emphasized by PwC.</p><p>Furthermore, the report underscores the importance of establishing clear regulatory frameworks to bolster public confidence in AI. Public-private partnerships will be crucial in scaling energy and digital infrastructure, while targeted incentives can stimulate domestic innovation in critical areas such as AI chips and clean technology manufacturing. By prioritizing workforce development in AI education and green skills, the Middle East can ensure a steady pipeline of talent for future-ready industries. Ultimately, a trust-based, integrated approach to policy can unlock sustainable growth, productivity, and climate resilience, paving the way for the Middle East to achieve its ambitious GDP target by 2035.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 3 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS RANKING</p><p>SECTION 1 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwC), headquartered in London, UK, is a leading global professional services network, formed in 1998 through the merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, with origins in the 19th century.

As stated by Stephen Anderson, chief strategy &amp; technology officer at PwC Middle East, on 18th August 2025, the region must focus on coordinated policies that build trust, reduce risk, and align with long-term national priorities. These efforts should encompass responsible AI integration, climate adaptation, investment in human capital, and fostering trust in technology and institutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 'Value in Motion' report outlines three possible futures for the Middle East, influenced by the region's navigation of AI adoption, climate action, and economic reinvention. The 'trust-based transformation' scenario presents the highest growth potential, projecting a GDP of $4.68 trillion, driven by effective collaboration and sustainability measures. In contrast, the 'tense transition' scenario anticipates a GDP of $4.61 trillion, while the 'turbulent times' scenario forecasts a GDP of $4.45 trillion, highlighting a $232 billion gap between the best and worst case outcomes. The report emphasizes that AI could contribute an additional 8.3% to GDP growth under the trust-based scenario, although decarbonization efforts may simultaneously reduce GDP by 5.2% due to stranded assets.</p><p>PwC notes that the Middle East's capacity to lead in solar power generation could provide additional benefits in decarbonization efforts. Emerging sectors such as green fuels, agritech, and renewable-powered data centers present untapped opportunities that could further enhance regional economic growth. The report posits that a trust-based transformation would see AI and climate solutions working in tandem to drive productivity growth and climate resilience. Conversely, the tense transition scenario depicts a more fragmented approach to sustainability and technology adoption, while the turbulent times scenario highlights the risks of geopolitical instability undermining trust in technology and limiting its economic benefits.</p><p>The report does not predict a fixed trajectory but offers a framework for assessing potential outcomes. Current trends in AI investment, renewable energy, and digital infrastructure align with elements of the trust-based transformation scenario. The future will ultimately depend on how effectively AI is harnessed, how Middle Eastern economies manage the energy transition, and the economic implications of decarbonization. Achieving the ambitious goal of a $4.68 trillion GDP requires a holistic approach focused on embedding AI responsibly, accelerating climate adaptation, and investing in human capital, as emphasized by PwC.</p><p>Furthermore, the report underscores the importance of establishing clear regulatory frameworks to bolster public confidence in AI. Public-private partnerships will be crucial in scaling energy and digital infrastructure, while targeted incentives can stimulate domestic innovation in critical areas such as AI chips and clean technology manufacturing. By prioritizing workforce development in AI education and green skills, the Middle East can ensure a steady pipeline of talent for future-ready industries. Ultimately, a trust-based, integrated approach to policy can unlock sustainable growth, productivity, and climate resilience, paving the way for the Middle East to achieve its ambitious GDP target by 2035.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 3 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS RANKING</p><p>SECTION 1 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwC), headquartered in London, UK, is a leading global professional services network, formed in 1998 through the merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, with origins in the 19th century.

A four-year, $7 million grant from the National Science Foundation (NSF) through the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) program was awarded on 16th August 2025. This funding aims to establish a comprehensive network that will unite researchers, land managers, and communities in New Mexico, focusing on sustainable forest and watershed management.</p><p>New Mexico's forested watersheds are vital for water supply, carbon storage, and cultural significance, yet they are increasingly threatened by climate change, wildfires, and competing land uses. The most affected areas include the Rio Grande and Pecos River Basins, which primarily serve Indigenous and rural communities reliant on surface water for agriculture and daily life. The combined effects of diminishing snowpack, fluctuating precipitation patterns, and intensified wildfire activity present significant challenges for watershed management, making this initiative timely and necessary.</p><p>The NSF EPSCoR Research Incubators for STEM Excellence (E-RISE-RII) project, titled 'Forest Research for New Mexico Water and Carbon Management' (FOR-NM), intends to integrate expertise from various fields. By combining knowledge in ecology, hydrology, remote sensing, and machine learning with social sciences, the project aims to provide actionable insights into watershed management. Lead Principal Investigator Marcy Litvak, a UNM Biology Professor, emphasized the project's dual focus on gathering critical ecological data and fostering economic and workforce development through community engagement.</p><p>FOR-NM will target New Mexico's Top 500 priority watersheds and will utilize advanced technologies such as high-resolution satellite data and machine learning models to evaluate forest management impacts. The initiative will monitor two watersheds intensively, including the Santa Fe Watershed, to examine how management practices influence hydrologic connectivity and ecological outcomes. This research will also pilot a Guided Transformation framework that merges scientific findings with community needs, aiming to deliver practical climate-adaptation solutions.</p><p>The ARID Institute at the University of New Mexico is poised to set a precedent in forest, water, and carbon management not only within the state but also as a model for similar ecosystems in the Southwestern United States and globally.

On 19th August 2025, the foundation, in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative (AD Data Initiative), announced an A.I. competition offering a $1 million prize for innovative solutions targeting Alzheimer's and related forms of dementia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Alzheimer's Insights A.I. Prize is designed to galvanize the global innovation community to address the urgent need for advancements in dementia research. Niranjan Bose, the interim executive director of the AD Data Initiative, emphasized the transformative potential of A.I. in his statement, noting that the technology could significantly enhance the speed and scale of research efforts. \"A.I. has the potential to revolutionize the pace and scale of dementia research-providing an opportunity we cannot afford to miss out on, especially with so many lives at risk,\" said Bose.</p><p>Bill Gates, who has been an advocate for Alzheimer's research since the founding of the AD Data Initiative in 2020, has a personal connection to the cause, having lost his father to the disease. \"We are closer than ever before to a world where no one has to watch someone they love suffer from this awful disease,\" Gates remarked in a recent Father's Day post. The competition aims to attract A.I. and machine learning engineers, computational biomedicine experts, and clinical specialists, thereby broadening the scope of collaboration in the field.</p><p>Alzheimer's disease presents unique challenges due to its complex nature, with multiple causes and biological pathways that complicate research efforts. The AD Data Initiative believes that agentic A.I. can autonomously analyze vast datasets, uncovering insights that human researchers might overlook. Gregory Moore, a senior advisor at both Gates Ventures and the AD Data Initiative, highlighted the shift that A.I. could bring to Alzheimer's research, moving from reactive to predictive methodologies. This includes identifying novel biomarkers, optimizing clinical trial designs, and revealing new opportunities for drug development.</p><p>Over the years, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has invested billions into public health initiatives. Gates' personal contributions to Alzheimer's research have included substantial donations aimed at supporting novel treatments and improving diagnostics. With the launch of this new A.I. competition, the foundation seeks to catalyze further innovation and progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease.

The review reveals a troubling evolution in climate disinformation tactics. Denialism is giving way to more insidious strategies - such as sowing doubt about renewable energy, exaggerating scientific uncertainty, and reframing climate action as elitist overreach. These tactics are increasingly networked and algorithmically amplified, muddying public understanding and delaying urgent policy responses.</p><p>Our analysis identifies five dominant narrative frames used to distort climate science: denial of anthropogenic causes; distraction through unrelated crises; attacks on climate advocates; promotion of false solutions; and strategic amplification of uncertainty. These frames are not random - they are often deployed by powerful actors with vested interests in fossil fuel economies and political polarisation.</p><p>The United Nations has declared that access to information about climate change is a human right. They've even outlined a set of global principles for maintaining the integrity of publicly available information about climate change. Our study shows that misleading information is adding to the climate crisis.</p><p>Take, for example, the way in which critics swiftly blamed solar and wind energy for the massive blackout in Spain and Portugal on April 28. This was amplified on social media for weeks before the Spanish government finally declared that the national grid operator and private power generation firms were responsible due to the power grid's lack of capacity to control grid voltage. According to one of the lead authors of the report, Professor Klaus Jensen, mis and disinformation erodes public trust and impairs collective decision-making. It not only obstructs emissions reduction efforts but also delays climate adaptation.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY SYDNEY PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 1 UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY SYDNEY PATENTS</p><p>1.1 Previous UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY SYDNEY Patent title:</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"112\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"240\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"128\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Issue Date</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">Issuing Office</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Patent Title</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">Patent Number</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Sep 28, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">EPO</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Non-Clifford Quantum Gates</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">20240289676</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>1.2 Previous UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY SYDNEY Patent abstract:</p><p>September 28, 2024 University of Technology Sydney issued patent titled \"Non-Clifford Quantum Gates\"</p><p>ABSTRACT</p><p>This disclosure relates to processing encoded quantum information in a quantum computer using a stabilizer quantum error correction code.

Competition for Alzheimer's Breakthroughs August 20, 2025", "published": "2025-08-22", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation is spearheading a new initiative aimed at accelerating research into Alzheimer's disease, a condition currently affecting more than 7 million Americans. On 19th August 2025, the foundation, in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative (AD Data Initiative), announced an A.I. competition offering a $1 million prize for innovative solutions targeting Alzheimer's and related forms of dementia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Alzheimer's Insights A.I. Prize is designed to galvanize the global innovation community to address the urgent need for advancements in dementia research. Niranjan Bose, the interim executive director of the AD Data Initiative, emphasized the transformative potential of A.I. in his statement, noting that the technology could significantly enhance the speed and scale of research efforts. \"A.I. has the potential to revolutionize the pace and scale of dementia research-providing an opportunity we cannot afford to miss out on, especially with so many lives at risk,\" said Bose.</p><p>Bill Gates, who has been an advocate for Alzheimer's research since the founding of the AD Data Initiative in 2020, has a personal connection to the cause, having lost his father to the disease. \"We are closer than ever before to a world where no one has to watch someone they love suffer from this awful disease,\" Gates remarked in a recent Father's Day post. The competition aims to attract A.I. and machine learning engineers, computational biomedicine experts, and clinical specialists, thereby broadening the scope of collaboration in the field.</p><p>Alzheimer's disease presents unique challenges due to its complex nature, with multiple causes and biological pathways that complicate research efforts. The AD Data Initiative believes that agentic A.I. can autonomously analyze vast datasets, uncovering insights that human researchers might overlook. Gregory Moore, a senior advisor at both Gates Ventures and the AD Data Initiative, highlighted the shift that A.I. could bring to Alzheimer's research, moving from reactive to predictive methodologies. This includes identifying novel biomarkers, optimizing clinical trial designs, and revealing new opportunities for drug development.</p><p>Over the years, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has invested billions into public health initiatives. Gates' personal contributions to Alzheimer's research have included substantial donations aimed at supporting novel treatments and improving diagnostics. With the launch of this new A.I. competition, the foundation seeks to catalyze further innovation and progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease. Semi-finalists are expected to be announced in December, with finalists competing in March at the Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Conference in Copenhagen.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: MARK SUZMAN CEO &amp; Director</p><p>SECTION 2 BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 3 BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: MARK SUZMAN CEO &amp; Director</p><p>As CEO of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Mark Suzman leads the organization in service of our mission - to help every person have the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life.

On 19th August 2025, the foundation, in collaboration with the Alzheimer's Disease Data Initiative (AD Data Initiative), announced an A.I. competition offering a $1 million prize for innovative solutions targeting Alzheimer's and related forms of dementia.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Alzheimer's Insights A.I. Prize is designed to galvanize the global innovation community to address the urgent need for advancements in dementia research. Niranjan Bose, the interim executive director of the AD Data Initiative, emphasized the transformative potential of A.I. in his statement, noting that the technology could significantly enhance the speed and scale of research efforts. \"A.I. has the potential to revolutionize the pace and scale of dementia research-providing an opportunity we cannot afford to miss out on, especially with so many lives at risk,\" said Bose.</p><p>Bill Gates, who has been an advocate for Alzheimer's research since the founding of the AD Data Initiative in 2020, has a personal connection to the cause, having lost his father to the disease. \"We are closer than ever before to a world where no one has to watch someone they love suffer from this awful disease,\" Gates remarked in a recent Father's Day post. The competition aims to attract A.I. and machine learning engineers, computational biomedicine experts, and clinical specialists, thereby broadening the scope of collaboration in the field.</p><p>Alzheimer's disease presents unique challenges due to its complex nature, with multiple causes and biological pathways that complicate research efforts. The AD Data Initiative believes that agentic A.I. can autonomously analyze vast datasets, uncovering insights that human researchers might overlook. Gregory Moore, a senior advisor at both Gates Ventures and the AD Data Initiative, highlighted the shift that A.I. could bring to Alzheimer's research, moving from reactive to predictive methodologies. This includes identifying novel biomarkers, optimizing clinical trial designs, and revealing new opportunities for drug development.</p><p>Over the years, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation has invested billions into public health initiatives. Gates' personal contributions to Alzheimer's research have included substantial donations aimed at supporting novel treatments and improving diagnostics. With the launch of this new A.I. competition, the foundation seeks to catalyze further innovation and progress in the fight against Alzheimer's disease. Semi-finalists are expected to be announced in December, with finalists competing in March at the Alzheimer's Disease and Parkinson's Disease Conference in Copenhagen.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: MARK SUZMAN CEO &amp; Director</p><p>SECTION 2 BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 3 BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 1 BIOGRAPHY: MARK SUZMAN CEO &amp; Director</p><p>As CEO of the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, Mark Suzman leads the organization in service of our mission - to help every person have the opportunity to live a healthy, productive life.

Usually linked to daydreaming, recalling memories, or planning for the future, this network also helps us transfer motor skills, for instance, from one hand to the other, or apply them in new situations. Not where we expected</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For decades, experts believed that the motor parts of the brain, especially areas controlling movement, were mainly responsible for learning and applying new skills. But recent research led by associate professor in the Department of Psychology Jason Gallivan and his team at Queen's University challenges that idea. When people practice a task with one hand and then perform the same task with the other, the motor areas aren't the main drivers of this skill transfer. Instead, the DMN - a collection of higher-level brain regions associated with internal thoughts - plays a key role.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Source: Company Website</p><p>+   QUEEN'S UNIVERSITY: FUNDING SUPPORTS RESEARCH ON MAJOR HEALTH CHALLENGES</p><p>Six research projects at Queen's University have been awarded a combined $5.8 million in funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), supporting advances in patient care, health equity, and therapeutic innovation.</p><p>The funding includes five Project Grants, which support investigator-led research across all areas of health, and one Priority Announcement award.

They point out odd visual details, like a professional video camera in the middle of the Wimbledon audience or a man in the background holding a tennis ball in front of his right eye, and question: 'Does it make him see the match better?'</p><p>Mia's viral Wimbledon imagery, including the Pimm's glass, sparked debates around potential branded partnerships, but there is no evidence of sponsorship or affiliate-based content. Although Mia's bio invites collabs, her team seems not to have monetised her following yet, although who can be sure?</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY SYDNEY: TELESCOPES AND MICROSCOPES</p><p>The facts of the Hulk Hogan privacy saga are stranger than fiction. In 2012, a sex tape appeared online showing Hogan having sex with a model who was married to his best friend, a radio DJ. The sex was apparently consensual. The twist was the DJ was the one filming, with Hogan (and the model) saying they didn't know they were being filmed. Hogan sued the couple and settled out of court.</p><p>Then, when the Gawker website published an excerpt from the tape, Hogan sued the website for an invasion of privacy, intentional infliction of emotional distress and infringement of personality rights. Gawker refused to take down the clip, citing freedom of speech and the First Amendment. But in 2016 Hogan was awarded a staggering $212 million by a jury, which was later reduced to $47 million. The judgment bankrupted the Gawker website. It also set an enduring legal precedent: even in the US, where freedom of speech is highly protected, celebrities can successfully sue for some privacy invasions. The whole saga is complicated further because Hogan's privacy lawsuit was bankrolled by Peter Thiel, co-founder of data giant Palantir, which has attracted controversy for its involvement in government surveillance.</p><p>In Australia, we're in the middle of major privacy reform. Just last month, the new statutory tort for serious invasions of privacy came into effect. This belatedly brings Australia into line with comparable jurisdictions. However, journalists have an exemption from the tort, just as they do in the Privacy Act itself. This means you have little recourse if your privacy is invaded by journalists, even when such an invasion is not in the public interest.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   UNIVERSITY OF TECHNOLOGY SYDNEY: HOT AIR AND HARD TRUTHS</p><p>The Information Policy and Integrity Exchange (IPIE) has released a landmark review on climate misinformation and disinformation, synthesising a decade of research across 300 studies. The review reveals a troubling evolution in climate disinformation tactics. Denialism is giving way to more insidious strategies - such as sowing doubt about renewable energy, exaggerating scientific uncertainty, and reframing climate action as elitist overreach. These tactics are increasingly networked and algorithmically amplified, muddying public understanding and delaying urgent policy responses.</p><p>Our analysis identifies five dominant narrative frames used to distort climate science: denial of anthropogenic causes; distraction through unrelated crises; attacks on climate advocates; promotion of false solutions; and strategic amplification of uncertainty. These frames are not random - they are often deployed by powerful actors with vested interests in fossil fuel economies and political polarisation.</p><p>The United Nations has declared that access to information about climate change is a human right. They've even outlined a set of global principles for maintaining the integrity of publicly available information about climate change. Our study shows that misleading information is adding to the climate crisis.</p><p>Take, for example, the way in which critics swiftly blamed solar and wind energy for the massive blackout in Spain and Portugal on April 28. This was amplified on social media for weeks before the Spanish government finally declared that the national grid operator and private power generation firms were responsible due to the power grid's lack of capacity to control grid voltage. According to one of the lead authors of the report, Professor Klaus Jensen, mis and disinformation erodes public trust and impairs collective decision-making. It not only obstructs emissions reduction efforts but also delays climate adaptation.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   POWERED BY PURPOSE: UTS STUDENTS FINDING MEANING THROUGH VOLUNTEERING</p><p>For Amelia Grace Wilson-Williams and Mahir Munot, volunteering isn't just something they do - it's part of who they are.</p><p>Through volunteering, both Amelia and Mahir have found ways to give back to their communities, meet new people, and grow personally and professionally.

Over the past year, the homes have been made future-proof: well-insulated, more comfortable, and more sustainable. But most importantly: residents feel at home in their renewed homes - and that's what it's all about.</p><p>Ready for the future The 21 apartment blocks on Bongerd, Dotterlei, Wingerd and Wilgenhoek were built in the 1960s. The homes were due a major upgrade. Havensteder, in collaboration with BAM Wonen, improved insulation with HR++ glazing, new opening windows and balcony doors, new balcony panels, and roof insulation. New ventilation grilles and a CO\u2082-controlled ventilation system now ensure a healthier indoor climate.</p><p>The installations have also been upgraded and made ready for a gas-free future. A heat interface unit now provides hot water and heating. Old boilers were removed, and residents received new radiators and individual thermostats. Thanks to a collaboration between Havensteder and the Municipality of Capelle, solar panels were installed on the roofs - four per home, providing individual energy yield.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+   BAM PPP BV MODULAR EXPANSION OF GOOR HIGH-VOLTAGE SUBSTATION FOR A RELIABLE ELECTRICITY GRID</p><p>In the province Overijssel in the east of the Netherlands, we have started the initial construction works for the expansion of the Goor high-voltage substation. On a new site adjacent to the existing station, we are delivering, on behalf of Omexom and with TenneT as the end client, the civil works for a completely new 110 kV installation field. This is essential to future-proof the electricity grid and ensure continued reliability for the region. The works are part of the national Bay Replacement Programme (BRP), through which TenneT is replacing outdated high-voltage substations more quickly, intelligently, and with less disruption, and expanding them where possible. We expect to complete our works by early 2027, with commissioning scheduled for early 2028.</p><p>Through the Bay Replacement Programme (BRP) TenneT is accelerating the modernisation of high-voltage substations in the Netherlands.

Knowing that we cannot achieve that mission alone, he brings a deep commitment to building partnerships and ensuring that the culture of the foundation directly enables the impact we aspire to have. Mark serves as a member of the foundation's board of trustees in his role as CEO.</p><p>Mark's upbringing in apartheid South Africa instilled in him a desire to use the advantages afforded to him to help tackle injustice and inequality. He began his career doing that through journalism, writing for the Johannesburg Star and then the Financial Times, where he covered international trade policy, welfare reform, and political issues, including the historic 1994 election of Nelson Mandela. In 2000, Mark joined the United Nations, where he was part of the effort to implement the Millennium Development Goals under the leadership of then Secretary-General Kofi Annan. He held multiple positions at the UN over his six-year tenure, including senior advisor for policy and strategic communications in the Office of the Secretary General, and policy director in the Office of the Administrator of the United Nations Development Program.</p><p>Mark joined the foundation in 2007 as director of Global Development Policy, Advocacy, and Special Initiatives. Prior to becoming CEO, he served as managing director of Country Offices, president of Global Policy and Advocacy, and chief strategy officer. In these roles, he built and oversaw the development of the foundation's offices in India, China, Africa, and Europe, and managed the foundation's relationships with government, private philanthropists, and civil society. He also implemented a new system for how the foundation measures impact and manages tradeoffs across its strategic priorities.</p><p>Mark holds a doctorate in international relations from Oxford University, where he was a Rhodes Scholar. He earned his bachelor's degree, summa cum laude, from Harvard University.</p><p>SECTION 2 BILL AND MELINDA GATES FOUNDATION PROFILE</p><p>2.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, founded in 2000 by Bill Gates and Melinda French Gates, is a global philanthropic organization headquartered in Seattle, Washington.

Usually linked to daydreaming, recalling memories, or planning for the future, this network also helps us transfer motor skills, for instance, from one hand to the other, or apply them in new situations. Not where we expected</p><p>For decades, experts believed that the motor parts of the brain, especially areas controlling movement, were mainly responsible for learning and applying new skills. But recent research led by associate professor in the Department of Psychology Jason Gallivan and his team at Queen's University challenges that idea. When people practice a task with one hand and then perform the same task with the other, the motor areas aren't the main drivers of this skill transfer. Instead, the DMN - a collection of higher-level brain regions associated with internal thoughts - plays a key role.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>PermID: 4297020324</p><p>Created by <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.buysellsignals.com\">www.buysellsignals.com</url> for News Bites Finance</p>", "publisher": "News Bites - Private Companies", "instances": ["The Phytotron includes six climate-controlled greenhouse zones, 30 environmental growth chambers, and a lab.
