As stated by Stephen Anderson, chief strategy &amp; technology officer at PwC Middle East, on 18th August 2025, the region must focus on coordinated policies that build trust, reduce risk, and align with long-term national priorities. These efforts should encompass responsible AI integration, climate adaptation, investment in human capital, and fostering trust in technology and institutions.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The 'Value in Motion' report outlines three possible futures for the Middle East, influenced by the region's navigation of AI adoption, climate action, and economic reinvention. The 'trust-based transformation' scenario presents the highest growth potential, projecting a GDP of $4.68 trillion, driven by effective collaboration and sustainability measures. In contrast, the 'tense transition' scenario anticipates a GDP of $4.61 trillion, while the 'turbulent times' scenario forecasts a GDP of $4.45 trillion, highlighting a $232 billion gap between the best and worst case outcomes. The report emphasizes that AI could contribute an additional 8.3% to GDP growth under the trust-based scenario, although decarbonization efforts may simultaneously reduce GDP by 5.2% due to stranded assets.</p><p>PwC notes that the Middle East's capacity to lead in solar power generation could provide additional benefits in decarbonization efforts. Emerging sectors such as green fuels, agritech, and renewable-powered data centers present untapped opportunities that could further enhance regional economic growth. The report posits that a trust-based transformation would see AI and climate solutions working in tandem to drive productivity growth and climate resilience. Conversely, the tense transition scenario depicts a more fragmented approach to sustainability and technology adoption, while the turbulent times scenario highlights the risks of geopolitical instability undermining trust in technology and limiting its economic benefits.</p><p>The report does not predict a fixed trajectory but offers a framework for assessing potential outcomes. Current trends in AI investment, renewable energy, and digital infrastructure align with elements of the trust-based transformation scenario. The future will ultimately depend on how effectively AI is harnessed, how Middle Eastern economies manage the energy transition, and the economic implications of decarbonization. Achieving the ambitious goal of a $4.68 trillion GDP requires a holistic approach focused on embedding AI responsibly, accelerating climate adaptation, and investing in human capital, as emphasized by PwC.</p><p>Furthermore, the report underscores the importance of establishing clear regulatory frameworks to bolster public confidence in AI. Public-private partnerships will be crucial in scaling energy and digital infrastructure, while targeted incentives can stimulate domestic innovation in critical areas such as AI chips and clean technology manufacturing. By prioritizing workforce development in AI education and green skills, the Middle East can ensure a steady pipeline of talent for future-ready industries. Ultimately, a trust-based, integrated approach to policy can unlock sustainable growth, productivity, and climate resilience, paving the way for the Middle East to achieve its ambitious GDP target by 2035.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 2 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS TOP MANAGEMENT</p><p>SECTION 3 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS RANKING</p><p>SECTION 1 PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>PricewaterhouseCoopers International Limited (PwC), headquartered in London, UK, is a leading global professional services network, formed in 1998 through the merger of Price Waterhouse and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, with origins in the 19th century.

Diagnosis usually relies on specialised tests such as imaging scans or biopsies, which can be expensive or difficult to access in some regions.</p><p>More rapid, low-cost and non-invasive test options could help us diagnose blood cancers earlier, when treatment has a higher chance of success. They could also help monitor the disease and track how well treatments are working.</p><p>\"Previous studies have shown the value of using breath tests to detect lung cancer.

A new study from the University of Nottingham suggests that may soon be possible, thanks to a new type of solar sail that uses sunlight in a smarter way.</p><p><br/>Solar sails are not a new idea.<br/>For decades, scientists have imagined using large, ultra-thin sheets to catch the momentum of sunlight to propel spacecraft, much like wind pushes a sailboat. Traditional designs rely on reflecting sunlight to generate thrust.<br/>The Nottingham team, however, is developing a new class of sails that don't just reflect light-they bend it.<br/>These \"transmissive solar sails\" are covered in microscopic refractive patterns that steer and accelerate spacecraft using light alone. Because they don't need engines or fuel, they could enable long-duration space missions, reduce costs, and open the door to more sustainable space exploration.<br/>The research, published in Acta Astronautica, introduces an optimization framework that helps scientists design and test these tiny patterns. By fine-tuning how the patterns bend light, the team achieved far greater efficiency and control than earlier concepts.<br/>Ph.D. student Samuel Thompson, who led much of the technical development, explained how the team modeled the sails. \"I developed a ray-tracing simulation to characterize and optimize patterned, refractive solar sails to maximize their acceleration and stability,\" he said.<br/>Because the light behavior is complex and unpredictable, Thompson also built a reinforcement learning algorithm to test thousands of possible designs and automatically improve them.<br/>This approach means the sails could be customized for specific missions-whether to push a small satellite through low-Earth orbit or to propel a deep-space probe on a long journey. They could even be redesigned mid-development to match changing mission needs.<br/>The Nottingham researchers believe these sails may be especially valuable for sustainable space operations. One promising use is clearing out space debris, since solar sails could move small, uncontrolled objects out of Earth orbit without requiring expensive propulsion systems.<br/>Beyond space exploration, the work may also have planetary applications. The team has contributed to international research exploring the idea of solar sail-enabled \"planetary sunshades.\" These giant sails, positioned in space, could reflect or diffuse sunlight to help cool Earth's climate as part of global geoengineering strategies.<br/>University of Nottingham researcher Dr. Cappelletti recently presented this concept at a United Nations event on climate innovation, highlighting its potential role in future climate resilience.<br/>Meanwhile, the NottSpace research team is already integrating transmissive sails into real-world missions. Their in-house CubeSat projects, WormSail and JamSail, will use these sails for experiments ranging from mapping GPS jamming signals to supporting pharmaceutical research in space.<br/>By reimagining how spacecraft can harness sunlight, Nottingham's transmissive solar sails point to a future where we can travel farther, explore longer, and even help protect our planet-all without using a drop of fuel.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Knowridge Scientific Report", "instances": ["These giant sails, positioned in space, could reflect or diffuse sunlight to help cool Earth's climate as part of global geoengineering strategies.

This announcement was made on 6th June 2025 and represents a significant increase of $118.3 million, or 19.2%, over the previous record of $615.7 million set in fiscal year 2024. The funding, which comes from various external agencies including the federal government, industry, and nonprofit organizations, supports essential research and training initiatives conducted by the University of Hawai\u02bbi's faculty and staff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">UH President Wendy Hensel emphasized the importance of this achievement in a time of growing concerns regarding federal research support. \"This year marks another record-breaking milestone in federal support for the University of Hawai\u02bbi, highlighting the excellence of our researchers and our university system,\" Hensel stated. However, the backdrop of this success is troubling, as 66 grants worth over $89 million have been terminated due to shifting federal priorities. The anticipated cuts in federal budgets affecting major research funding bodies like the National Science Foundation and the National Institutes of Health add to the complexities of securing future funding.</p><p>The University of Hawai\u02bbi Manoa, the flagship campus of the UH system, led the way with $570.4 million in extramural awards. The UH System as a whole brought in $98.7 million, while UH Community Colleges, UH Hilo, and UH West O\u02bbahu contributed $31.3 million, $23.9 million, and $9.7 million, respectively. Interim Provost Vassilis L. Syrmos commended the UH Manoa research community for their significant contributions, noting that their dedication drives the university's research enterprise, which is vital for the well-being of both the state and the wider world.</p><p>An economic impact report from the University of Hawai\u02bbi Economic Research Organization indicated that research-related expenditures at UH reached $476.8 million in fiscal year 2020, contributing significantly to the state economy. This year's record in extramural funding reflects the university's ongoing commitment to addressing critical issues such as health disparities and climate resilience. Governor Josh Green emphasized the importance of UH as a key driver of innovation and economic resilience in Hawai\u02bbi. He stated, \"This record-breaking year of research funding underscores UH's essential role in tackling our most pressing challenges.\"</p><p>Despite the positive funding news, stakeholders remain cautious about the future funding landscape. U.S. Senator Brian Schatz and other congressional representatives highlighted the need for continued support for the University of Hawai\u02bbi in light of potential federal funding cuts. As the institution celebrates its record achievement, the focus will be on navigating the challenges ahead to maintain the momentum of its research initiatives, ensuring that the university continues to play a pivotal role in the advancement of both local and global communities.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII SYSTEMS PROFILE</p><p>SECTION 1 UNIVERSITY OF HAWAII SYSTEMS PROFILE</p><p>1.1 ACTIVITIES</p><p>The University of Hawai''i System consists of three university campuses, seven community college campuses, and several job training and research centers.
