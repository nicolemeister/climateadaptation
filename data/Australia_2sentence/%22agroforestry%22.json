Credit: Mike Rowley.<br/>Scientists have discovered that some fig trees in Kenya can absorb carbon dioxide (CO\u2082) from the air and turn it into stone-like material inside their trunks and the soil around them.</p><p><br/>This unusual ability could offer a new way to help fight climate change by locking away carbon for long periods of time.<br/>The research, led by a team from Kenya, Switzerland, Austria, and the United States, was presented at the Goldschmidt geochemistry conference in Prague.<br/>They focused on three species of fig trees growing in Samburu County, Kenya.<br/>These trees use a natural process called the oxalate-carbonate pathway, which is known to exist in some plants but has rarely been studied in fruit trees.<br/>All trees absorb CO\u2082 through photosynthesis and store it as organic carbon in their leaves, trunks, and roots.<br/>That's why planting trees is seen as a way to reduce CO\u2082 levels. But fig trees go a step further. They also use CO\u2082 to make tiny crystals of calcium oxalate.<br/>When the tree's parts decay, certain bacteria and fungi break down these crystals and turn them into calcium carbonate-the same material found in chalk and limestone.<br/>Unlike organic carbon, which can return to the atmosphere as trees decay, calcium carbonate is a stable form of inorganic carbon that stays locked in the soil for much longer. This makes it a powerful form of long-term carbon storage.<br/>Dr. Mike Rowley, a senior lecturer at the University of Zurich, said this pathway has been known for some time, but its potential to fight climate change hasn't been fully appreciated.<br/>He believes that if we're planting trees for food and reforestation, we should also consider their ability to store carbon in stone form.<br/>The team used advanced imaging tools at Stanford University to study the trees in detail. They found that calcium carbonate was forming not just on the outside of the tree trunk but also deep inside the wood.<br/>As this mineral formed, it made the surrounding soil more alkaline, which can improve nutrient availability for plants.<br/>Among the three species studied, Ficus wakefieldii was the most effective at turning CO\u2082 into calcium carbonate.<br/>The team now plans to study how much water this tree needs, how much fruit it produces, and how much CO\u2082 it can store under different conditions. This will help determine if it's a good choice for agroforestry-growing trees that produce both food and environmental benefits.<br/>While this research focused on trees in dry regions, Dr. Rowley says the process can also happen in wetter areas.<br/>Since many plants create calcium oxalate, and the microbes that help complete the process are widespread, the potential for more trees to store CO\u2082 this way is likely much larger than we realize.<br/></p>", "publisher": "Knowridge Scientific Report", "instances": ["Among the three species studied, Ficus wakefieldii was the most effective at turning CO\u2082 into calcium carbonate.

Michael's grandparents Walter and Pat Taylor started tree planting in the 1960s, responding to ecosystem degradation and loss of livestock shelter.</p><p>His parents Jon and Vicki accelerated the program after the 1980s drought, transforming the landscape.</p><p>Michael and his sister Kath have returned to the family farms to continue this legacy.</p><p>\"If you told my parents they'd have to plant a quarter of a million trees to get to 23 per cent tree cover, they would likely have said it's too hard, but over the years, it adds up,\" Michael said.</p><p>Early plantings focused on immediate needs - shelter along fence lines - but experience soon taught some better approaches and they started planting on hilltops and in plots.</p><p>\"By the early 1990s, they had started experimenting with planting out a whole paddock and those are the plantings we do now - contour planting or engineered woodlands,\" Michael said.</p><p>ECONOMIC RETURNS Today, 80ha of managed forest generate timber income while maintaining livestock carrying capacity of 5-6 dry sheep equivalents/ha despite the tree coverage.</p><p>The property sequesters more than 500 tonnes of Co2 equivalent per year. Michael's sawmill, purchased in 2004, transforms the investment into profit by creating treated square pine sleepers to sell wholesale and retail locally.</p><p>The on-farm processing eliminates \" Continued Page 46 \" From Page 45 the middleman while capturing value that would otherwise disappear into transport and handling margins.</p><p>\"My trailer load of timber is worth more than the B-double load of logs,\" Michael said.</p><p>He has harvest figures showing some pulp logs selling for just 50 cents per cubic metre due to cartage costs.</p><p>\"One 4.2m log at 250mm diameter was selling for 10 cents,\" he said. \"If I took that log and cut one landscape grade square board (100x100mm at 4.2m) I could sell it for $25.20.</p><p>\"That's a 25,200 per cent increase in value.</p><p>\"Why wouldn't I do that?\" FINANCIAL RESILIENCE The timber enterprise now contributes 25 per cent of farm income alongside cattle, with wool generating 70 per cent and tourist accommodation adding 5 per cent.</p><p>Diversification has provided security.</p><p>\"It's nice knowing the sheep market can completely collapse and I can still go and cut a couple of grand worth of timber a day if I need income,\" Michael said. But the tree-planting program revealed a puzzling paradox during Michael's 2024 Nuffield scholarship research into adoption barriers.</p><p>\"None of this stuff is new, we've been banging on about planting trees for 40 years, there are loads of good examples and plenty of published scientific advice,\" Michael said.</p><p>\"My question is, what are the barriers still? Why, after the millions of trees planted, why are some farmers sitting at less than 5 per cent tree cover - yet we could lift our property back to over 23 per cent?</p><p>\"We have objective data of the benefits - what's holding people back?\" GLOBAL INSIGHTS Through his research, Michael discovered successful businesses worldwide shared one characteristic.</p><p>\"They took control of their supply chain in one way or another,\" he said. The realisation sparked Michael's awakening to supply chain control beyond timber and he followed his ultrafine wool out the front gate.</p><p>\"Last year I sent wool all the way to Italy to see what price we would get,\" he said.</p><p>The exercise revealed both opportunities and frustrations.</p><p>\"There are all these barriers in the supply chain,\" he said. \"Farmers are kept in the dark or simply don't have the resources and knowledge to add value up the supply chain.\" Michael discovered brands \"desperate to connect with farmers\" but unable to bridge the gap created by complex supply chains.</p><p>At industry conferences, he found Australian wool struggling against negative perceptions.</p><p>\"To go overseas as an Australian sheep farmer, it's embarrassing, brands say to your face, we aren't interested in dealing with Australia because we still mules,\" he said.</p><p>These frustrations have led Michael to connect up with other growers that are committed to progress including non-mulesed production and nature-friendly farming practices.</p><p>Already an unofficial group representing upwards of 100,000 kilograms of wool has formed to better understand the challenges and share knowledge on ultrafine wool production.</p><p>\"Wool growers and graziers in general are said to be making only about 0.5 per cent of a margin on average over the last five years,\" Michael said.</p><p>\"We need to do more marketing and networking ourselves to bring back that connection.\" PREMIUM PRODUCTION The Taylor family runs 3500 ultrafine Merinos, including stud ewes and rams, producing 13,000kg of greasy wool each year.</p><p>The flock has been non-mulesed since 2009 and selection for fly resistance continues to play a big part in breeding selection.</p><p>Sheep have been selectively bred over time to reduce micron, increase yield and produce stylish, soft handling traditional bright wool that has been bought and used by many of the top processors and spinners in the world.</p><p>Over the past 20 years, their wool has sold directly to well known Italian processor Giovanni Schneider and most recently to REDA in Italy.</p><p>Wool from Taylor's Run has gone into some of the finest fabrics in the world including Carlo Barbera and Vitale Barberis.</p><p>This premium wool marketing success has been underpinned by the farm's integrated forestry system, which provides both security and sustainability to their wool operation.</p><p>TESTING RESILIENCE During the 2013-14 drought, rather than destock, the Taylors used containment areas and hand fed stock but almost ran out of water.</p><p>Afterwards, Michael made a commitment not to hand feed again, instead matching numbers to rainfall and carrying capacity, and focused on pasture production.</p><p>\"In 2019 our numbers dropped to 1100 head in line with an annual rainfall of only 230mm compared with an average of 710mm and the sheep continued to graze,\" Michael said.</p><p>What happened next vindicated decades of tree-planting work. While surrounding landscapes turned to dust, Taylor's Run maintained its pastures and generated income from harvested timber.</p><p>\"We still had ground cover - every half millimetre of rain we got wasn't lost, it went to growing new feed - and we weren't losing dry food in the wind either because of the trees,\" Michael said.</p><p>\"It became really apparent then.\" Despite increasing tree coverage, the property maintains the same stocking rate as it did in the 1980s, with shelter compensating for lost grazing land.</p><p>Now Michael, a Master Tree Grower who has also been heavily involved with the Farming For The Future natural capital accounting research, teaches others to plant their own hope, starting with practical advice.</p><p>\"Map your property really well and make some plans,\" he said. \"It's easy to do with Google Earth, anybody can do it for free. Your eight-year-old child can jump on and map the farm.</p><p>\"Start small. That might be 100 trees - that's fine - in 30 years that makes a big difference.\" LIVING PROOF Today on Taylor's Run, spero meliora means more than hoping for better things, it means planting them, processing them, marketing them, and sharing the knowledge to transform an industry one farm at a time.</p><p>The Taylors' 185-year journey from Scottish emigrants with 1000 sheep to integrated agroforestry pioneers proves that hope without action remains just a motto.</p><p>\"Managing trees on farms for production and conservation for me is the low hanging fruit for improving farm resilience and natural capital accounts of which carbon emissions are just one part,\" Michael said.</p><p>\"Doing is the catalyst for change if you haven't already reached a tipping point that has left you with no choice.\"</p><p>MICHAEL AND MILLY TAYLOR TAYLOR'S RUN, URALLA, NSW PRODUCE 16.5 micron ultrafine Merino wool PLANTED more than 250,000 trees over four decades PURCHASED a sawmill to value add the timber THE flock has been non-mulesed since 2009</p>", "publisher": "The Weekly Times", "instances": ["The Latin motto carved into the Taylor family's farming identity, dating back 185 years, has possibly never been more relevant than it is today on their New England Tablelands property.

A chance meeting with a chef introduced him to black garlic in 2018, launching his original business, Flinders Black Garlic.</p><p>\"We were building that up quite nicely, and then Covid hit,\" Nick said. The pandemic forced a pivot.</p><p>\"The first lockdown, everyone was excited and still getting paid so people were cooking at home - we sold lots of garlic online,\" he said.</p><p>As restaurants closed, Nick and Jay transitioned to fresh garlic production, which proved less labour-intensive than black garlic processing.</p><p>Today, their garlic operation spans 1.2ha, with plans to expand to up to 3ha next season and capping at 6ha in the longer term.</p><p>However, rising costs have presented economic challenges.</p><p>\"I found my cost of production was three times higher doing organic than conventional,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"Our cost of production per hectare is about $60,000 for organic, whereas for conventional it is about $20,000.</p><p>\"When we first started growing organic, there was a price differential - our costs were double what they were for conventional but we were getting double the money so it made economic sense.\" REDUCING GREEN WASTE Their biggest costs are labour and the extensive use of weed matting, which is essential for organic production but presents its own environmental concerns.</p><p>\"Weed gunnel is used extensively for weed management, but it's expensive and cannot be reused when growing garlic at scale,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"Currently, the only method of disposal is sending it to landfill. \"This contributes to the reason organic garlic is so expensive - it's the high cost of production.\" This challenge sparked his successful application for a 2024 Nuffield Scholarship to help solve the environmental paradox of organic garlic farming and find ways to reduce waste and costs.</p><p>The benefits would be two-fold.</p><p>\"It would encourage producers to consider growing garlic using organic methods, which improves the quality of the garlic and soil health,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"It would also make buying organic garlic more affordable for consumers and open it up to a bigger number of shoppers.\" Organic garlic currently retails for between 25 and 40 per cent more than conventional garlic.</p><p>CUTTING COSTS Nick has already completed extensive international travel for the scholarship, including visits to Indonesia, France, Denmark, California, and Chile.</p><p>The scholarship research focuses on finding economically and environmentally sustainable methods for organic garlic production.</p><p>Nick, who is on the board of the Australian Garlic Industry Association, said the research aligned with the industry's strategic plan to help address supply, production, climatic and sustainability challenges.</p><p>His immediate plan on the farm is mechanisation.</p><p>\"We're in transition from doing it all by hand to mechanising,\" Nick said. \"Currently, it takes a week to roll out all the weed matting with eight to 12 people.</p><p>\"For planting, it can take three to five days, so it's a two-week process just to get the garlic in the ground.\" At a cost of between $5000 and $7000, Nick hopes to purchase a basic mechanical planter and harvester and have them operational by May 2026.</p><p>\"I'm not looking to spend a huge amount of money but the most important thing is you could do it with two people and in a short space of time,\" he said, cutting labour costs by more than 80 per cent.</p><p>For weed management, he is exploring cutting-edge technologies from Germany that use rubber tynes between rows.</p><p>\"There is all sorts of new technology coming out from laser weeding to precision farming and we are looking to bring some of that to our farm from next season,\" he said.</p><p>STRATEGIC MARKETING They have trialled a variety of seedstock over the years with soft neck Italian purple and Dunganski proving the most successful on the clay-loam soil and with their average annual rainfall of 700mm to 800mm.</p><p>Growing conditions have been drier than average in recent years and while garlic is not a water intensive crop, irrigation from dams and a bore is available to draw on towards the end of the growing season in spring and early summer.</p><p>Soil and leaf analysis tests are conducted for targeted fertiliser application and mixed species cover crops are planted in resting paddocks.</p><p>They plant about half a tonne of garlic per hectare and harvest 10 tonnes or more annually.</p><p>A third of each harvest is retained as seedstock for the following year. Ninety per cent of their garlic is sold to a chain of greengrocers in Melbourne via large weekly orders, while the remainder is sold at the farm gate and local retail outlets.</p><p>\"Australian growers account for only 15 to 20 per cent of garlic consumed in Australia,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"A lot is imported from China.</p><p>\"In terms of price, we couldn't even come close to competing. \"But the difference in the product is immeasurable. Fresh Aussie garlic versus Chinese - it's like chalk and cheese.\" ALIGNING WITH DEMAND Nick has observed shifting consumer preferences that align with his business model.</p><p>\"There's been a shift from consumers - not necessarily organic, but where the garlic comes from,\" he said.</p><p>\"The provenance or locale of it has become as important as the organic side.\" Nick and Jay maintain a focus on soil health and sustainability. \"We want to leave the property in a better shape than when we first got it,\" he said.</p><p>Their soil health has improved significantly with less compaction, weed pressure and improved pH levels.</p><p>\"We had a great interest in regenerative agriculture and that's where cover cropping came in,\" Nick said.</p><p>\"We put in radish - it has a big strong root to help break up the soil and that has helped.</p><p>\"The next step would be to integrate some livestock before we replant into it.\" The couple has a keen interest in agroforestry and together with local Landcare groups, they have planted shelter belts around the perimeter of the farm.</p><p>DIVERSITY IS KEY While running multiple enterprises on the farm can be a juggle, Nick said their strategic diversification across premium garlic production, flower growing and agritourism had created a resilient business model capable of weathering both market fluctuations and seasonal challenges.</p><p>Two hectares are dedicated to flowers including sunflowers, dahlias, snapdragons, ranunculus, delphinium and poppies.

The children in the vegetable garden with their hands in the soil' in which Antonio Ferrante, full professor in Horticulture and Floriculture at the Institute of Crop Science of the Sant'Anna School, participated, offering his contribution as a volunteer. The project involved the participation of about 25 people with motor and/or cognitive disabilities in activities and lessons focused on nature and agriculture, to develop working, social, cognitive and emotional skills, create meaningful relationships and make them feel part of a group. Indeed, agricultural work in its many forms encourages the active participation of everyone and cooperation with other group members. The project allowed for the creation of a stimulating and structured environment, within which the various group activities brought important benefits to people as well as making them achieve the highest possible degree of autonomy and organisation.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>December 10: Sant Anna School of Advanced Studies - Pisa: Agriculture and climate change: the role of organic agriculture in the ecological transition</p><p>Anna Camilla Moonen, associate professor of Agronomy and Herb Cultivation at the Institute of Plant Sciences, took part in the conference 'Organic farming to tackle climate change', financed by Ersa and realised by Edilador Srl, with the scientific support of Aiab Fvg (Associazione Italiana Agricoltura Biologica - Friuli-Venezia Giulia), which was held at the Friuli Foundation in Udine.</p><p>At the event, which focused on arable crops (cereals, legumes, potatoes.) and viticulture, Camilla Moonen illustrated adaptation practices and virtuous experiences in the organic cultivation of cereals and vegetables, explaining how the organic method can offer concrete solutions to deal with increasingly unpredictable weather and extreme climatic events that are more frequent and problematic every year.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>December 06: Sant Anna School of Advanced Studies - Pisa: The gymnasium where healthcare personnel in the Serchio Valley (Lucca) can 'train' in clinical procedures: the Barga Simulation Laboratory (BaSiLabo) is born as part of the multi-year Proximity Care project</p><p>Advanced simulation finds a new home at the Barga Simulation Laboratory (BaSiLabo), the ideal place, the gymnasium where healthcare personnel can be 'trained' in the performance of clinical procedures, the importance of which appears crucial in an inland area such as the Valle del Serchio, in the province of Lucca, where the low number of cases requires constant training to ensure adequate practice.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

This phased implementation, targeting completion by 2028, is expected to enhance operational efficiency and scalability. While short-term cash flows may be pressured due to the significant capital and operational expenditure, the long-term benefits include cost reduction, improved decision-making, and sustained competitiveness. Execution risks such as delays or cost overruns remain critical factors for investor monitoring.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expansion in China Through Evirth Acquisition&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The Q4 2024 acquisition of Evirth (Shanghai) Industrial Co., Ltd added $201 million in net revenues during the first half of 2025, strengthening the company's footprint in China's cakes and pastries market. This move aligns with the strategy to diversify regional portfolios and drive growth in the AMEA region. While integration costs and contingent adjustments may present near-term margin challenges, this acquisition supports long-term value creation by tapping into a high-growth consumer segment.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pension Risk Reduction Enhances Stability&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The buy-out conversion of the Mondelez Global LLC Retirement Plan in June 2025 transferred pension liabilities to third-party insurers. Although this decision incurred a $282 million non-cash pretax settlement loss, it eliminates long-term pension liabilities, improving financial stability. While the settlement loss diluted Q2 2025 earnings, this proactive risk management decision strengthens the balance sheet and instills confidence in future fiscal health.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dividend Increase Reflects Confidence in Cash Flow&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;A 6% increase in the quarterly dividend to $0.50 per share, declared in July 2025, underscores management's confidence in sustained cash flow. This move enhances shareholder returns, making the stock attractive to income-focused investors. However, the potential impact on capital reinvestment opportunities should earnings growth slow is a consideration. The consistent dividend policy reinforces investor confidence in the company's ability to deliver long-term value.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Streamlined Portfolio Through JDE Peet's Divestiture&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The Q4 2024 sale of 85.9 million shares in JDE Peet's follows a (EURO)612 million impairment charge earlier in 2024. By reducing its exposure to this volatile equity investment, the company is sharpening its focus on core operations. Although the impairment charge weighed on 2024 earnings, reallocating capital from non-core assets positions the company to deploy resources more strategically. Investors should remain attentive to how this decision drives future growth initiatives.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Balancing Market Presence in High-Risk Regions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Despite suspending new capital investments and advertising, the company continues its operations in Russia, contributing 4.0% of net revenue in Q2 2025. Above-average profitability in this region bolsters near-term earnings, yet geopolitical risks, such as asset expropriation or sanctions, pose long-term uncertainties. Management's commitment to ensuring food supply continuity reflects a balanced approach. However, investors should weigh the region's revenue contribution against potential stability concerns.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operational Resilience in Ukraine&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The resumption of production at Ukrainian facilities in Q2 2024 restored operations in a region accounting for 0.4% of Q2 2025 net revenue. This commitment to leveraging existing capacity amid conflict underscores the company's operational resilience. Although geopolitical risks persist, the restoration supports revenue stabilization in European markets. Investors should monitor ongoing developments for potential disruptions to operational continuity.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Enhanced Transparency Amid Hyperinflation in Argentina&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;Beginning Q1 2024, the exclusion of extreme pricing in Argentina from non-GAAP metrics aims to improve the comparability of Organic Net Revenue and other performance indicators. This change offers investors a clearer interpretation of underlying business performance, albeit at the cost of masking some economic realities. Investors should consider this adjustment alongside existing currency-related risks to maintain a comprehensive perspective on emerging market volatility.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Completion of Simplify to Grow Program Bolsters Margins&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The Q4 2024 conclusion of the Simplify to Grow Program marks the elimination of restructuring costs, driving cost efficiency and improving 2025 margins. This effort reflects management's focus on streamlined operations, which contributes to stronger profitability. While any revisions to liability estimates could impact earnings, the program's success emphasizes a commitment to operational discipline-a positive signal for investors seeking sustainable growth.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Expanded Financing Capacity for Strategic Flexibility&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>&lt;p&gt;The December 2024 increase in long-term financing authorization to $4 billion, with $2.4 billion remaining as of mid-2025, equips the company with added liquidity for acquisitions, share buybacks, and capital expenditure. This strategic positioning enhances growth potential but also raises leverage concerns, evidenced by a debt-to-capitalization ratio of 0.44 in Q2 2025. Investors should monitor debt management to ensure it aligns with long-term financial health and value creation.&lt;/p&gt;</p><p>SECTION 7 BEARISH SIGNALS</p><p>7.1 Price/Earnings of 18.3 &gt; Consumer Non-Durables sector (of 12 stocks) avg of 16.7:</p><p>- The price-to-earnings ratio of 18.3 indicates overvaluation compared with sector average of 16.7.</p><p>7.2 Downtrend</p><p>Price/Moving Average Price of 0.96 and negative MACD:</p><p>- The Price/MAP 200 for Mondelez International is 0.96.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to MondelezInternationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports MondelezInternationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to MondelezInternationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports MondelezInternationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

This may explain why appetite for cookies and biscuits is rising with the percentage of global consumers who eat biscuits and/or cookies at least once per week increasing 5% in the last year.</p><p>Indulgent snacking is the perfect expression of little treat culture a convenient and comforting escape from day-to-day routines, said Melissa Davies, Senior Manager, Global Insights &amp; Trendspotting at Mondelez International. People see snacking as a well-deserved reward and way to unwind after a long day.</p><p>Mondelez International continues to lead the snacking industry in adapting to these evolving consumer preferences and working to ensure that every snack provides an opportunity for connection and mindfulness while prioritizing consumer desires.

The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water. Additionally, Mr. White was prohibited from posting anything related with marine mammals on social media.</p><p>Toothed whale species, including dolphins and killer whales, rely on echolocating - using sound to navigate their environment.

Mr. White was recorded speeding toward a pod of Pacific white-sided dolphins on his jet ski, coming within just a few feet while filming them on his cell phone - much closer than the 100 metre legal approach distance. The court determined his actions were negligent and reckless, leading to a six month ban from operating any motorized vessel on water.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

These core scans and their associated data will be made available through a centralized digital platform, helping to reduce exploration risk, re-evaluate existing discoveries and enable new mineral development opportunities across the North.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">This program will be centred on drill cores from the Slave Geological Province in the Northwest Territories, one of Canada's most promising regions for mineral exploration and critical mineral development. This vast, underexplored area is home to past-producing mines and significant greenfield potential, particularly for critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements. By applying AI-driven analysis to historical core samples, both governments aim to spur new investment by giving industry the tools it needs to unlock untapped mineral value - without further disturbing the land.</p><p>INDEX</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>SECTION 3 OTHER NEWS: 2025</p><p>SECTION 1 NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA PATENTS</p><p>1.1 Patents issued to National Research Council of Canada by the US PTO and the EPO on same inventions</p><p>In the past 24 months the following patent was issued by the USPTO and the European Patent Office (EPO) to National Research Council of Canada. </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"3\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"248\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"200\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"168\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Title</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">US PTO</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">EPO</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">A Method For Correcting Ray Distortions In Tomographic 3d Printing</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">20240066804; 29 Feb, 2024</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">4274729; 15 Nov, 2023</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>SECTION 2 PRESS RELEASES: 2025</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Minister Joly to give remarks at meeting hosted by Canada's Ocean Supercluster</p><p>The Honourable Melanie Joly, Minister of Industry and Minister responsible for Canada Economic Development for Quebec Regions, will give remarks at a working lunch hosted by Canada's Ocean Supercluster.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change.

Under this new policy, suppliers from countries that limit Canadian access to their own government contracts can be restricted from bidding on Canadian federal contracts. This measure will prioritize suppliers from Canada and from our reliable trading partners that provide reciprocal access to suppliers from Canada through trade agreements.</p><p>The policy applies to all federal departments and agencies and will be implemented in two phases:</p><p>Phase 1, the interim policy, will focus on applying the policy based on the location of suppliers, started with the roll-out of training and tools on June 30, 2025, to support implementation. The interim policy is effective as of July 14, 2025. Phase 2, the complete policy, will determine supplier eligibility based on the origin of goods and services being offered, and will be introduced at a later date.</p><p>As shared earlier this year, the government is also exploring additional ways to maximize the use of Canadian steel and aluminum in government-funded projects, including in coordination with Canadian provinces and territories.</p><p>By enforcing fair and reciprocal procurement access, the government will protect Canadian innovation, jobs, and economic growth, and ensure that Canadian suppliers remain competitive in the global marketplace.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada's new government to consult on its first federal budget</p><p>In the election, Canadians called for change - and Canada's new government is moving with urgency to deliver this change.

Starting today, until August 28, 2025, Canadians can participate in the consultations by sharing their thoughts on key issues at Canada.ca/YourBudget.</p><p>Consultations will focus on bringing down costs for Canadians - building on measures such as the middle-class tax cut which saves a two-income family up to $840 a year and removing GST on new homes under $1 million for first-time buyers. Consultations will also emphasize job-creation, including measures to build more homes, expedite nation-building projects, and bolster Canada's defence industrial capacity.</p><p>In the weeks to come, the Minister of Finance, alongside Secretary of State, Wayne Long, and Parliamentary Secretary, Ryan Turnbull, will also be meeting with stakeholders and individuals across the country as part of the pre-budget consultation process.</p><p>July 14: National Research Council of Canada: Canada and the Northwest Territories Partner on Innovative, AI-Based Core Scanning Initiative to Support Critical Minerals Development</p><p>The Government of Canada and the Government of the Northwest Territories are working together to advance a new geoscience research initiative that leverages artificial intelligence (AI), digital scanning technologies and historic drill cores to unlock the North's mineral potential and help solidify Canada's position as a global leader in resource development and critical minerals.</p><p>As part of this initiative, Canada and the Northwest Territories will pilot a project to scan, digitize and analyze existing drill cores from the Northwest Territories Geological Survey's collection using cutting-edge techniques to highlight new areas of high critical-mineral potential. These core scans and their associated data will be made available through a centralized digital platform, helping to reduce exploration risk, re-evaluate existing discoveries and enable new mineral development opportunities across the North.</p><p>This program will be centred on drill cores from the Slave Geological Province in the Northwest Territories, one of Canada's most promising regions for mineral exploration and critical mineral development.

The Honourable Randene Neill, Minister of Water, Land and Resource Stewardship, announced that the Province of British Columbia is contributing an additional $3 million, further strengthening this collaborative effort to improve ecological connectivity.</p><p>Many animals need to reach habitat well beyond the boundaries of protected areas to survive, and ecological connectivity is the movement of these wild species and the flow of natural processes through a landscape. With support from both governments, the Stewardship of Ecological Corridors in British Columbia initiative focuses on identifying, planning, and acting to improve movement through ecological corridors - linkages that connect natural habitats, including protected and conserved areas. Ecological corridors provide biodiversity and human well-being benefits and are vital for the long-term health of ecosystems.</p><p>July 09: National Research Council of Canada: Federal government and East Gwillimbury partner to help residents walk a new path</p><p>East Gwillimbury will expand its active transportation network thanks to a joint investment of $7.6 million with the federal government and York Region.</p><p>The project will build 1.5 kilometres of new multi-use path along Yonge Street in the downtown core.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Following the training, these smallholders formed a smallholder's association, Labuhanbatu Independent Oil Palm Smallholders Association (APSKS LB), North Sumatra. Musim Mas encourages smallholders to form associations to get better access to resources and obtain certification by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) and Indonesian Sustainable Palm Oil (ISPO).</p><p>\"Musim Mas has long saw that smallholders are\u00a0key to achieving palm oil sustainability, and that's why we lead Indonesia's most extensive smallholder program. We believe that the way forward is to collaborate with more partners to achieve a\u00a0wider impact. With our BIPOSC partners, we hope to advance the skills and knowledge of smallholders through regenerative agriculture and related techniques. Regenerative agriculture and agroforestry have the potential to help smallholders be part of a sustainable palm oil supply chain. It could help them develop alternative sources of income, especially during the replanting period where their palm oil crops are unproductive, typically for three years,\" said Rob Nicholls, General Manager, Projects &amp; Programs, Musim Mas Group.</p><p>In the face of climate change and threatened biodiversity, regenerative agriculture can play a role for small farms because it maintains soil health, prevents erosion and\u00a0water runoff, and can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen leakage.</p><p>\"As a global development partner organization, SNV aims to support Indonesia in achieving its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To achieve this, we need to implement effective and impactful programs to transform agricultural and food systems, energy, and water. In the BIPOSC program, we promote a comprehensive regenerative agriculture and agroforestry model to maintain soil fertility and biodiversity, providing maximum benefits for farmers' livelihoods and economy,\" said Rizki Pandu Permana, Country Director of SNV Indonesia.</p><p>The key regenerative agriculture techniques taught include the application of bio-input, mulching to protect topsoil, planting cover crops, integrated pest management that reduces the need for chemical pesticides, and application of compost that reduces the amount of chemical fertilizers needed. To date, 1,032 independent smallholders received training and implement these techniques on their farms, representing a total land with a total area of 1,063.68 hectares. The project trained 25 village facilitators to provide hands-on assistance to smallholders, and seven demo plots established as pilot areas and learning facilities for regenerative agriculture.</p><p>\"When I visited palm oil smallholders a few years ago in the area, their biggest concern was access to more fertilizers. While fertilizers play a key role in boosting yields, there was a noticeable gap in understanding how to protect the soil from long-term degradation. Smallholders needed more knowledge about maintaining soil health, preserving soil structure, and other critical factors. This is exactly what the BIPOSC project aimed to address, and we're pleased to see that the farmers involved are now reporting not only higher yields but also healthier soils on their plots,\" said Bernard Giraud, President &amp; Co-Founder, Livelihoods.</p>", "publisher": "RWE Resources News", "instances": ["The project began in 2021 and takes a long-term approach to sustain a deforestation-free supply chain, regenerate degraded land, restore local biodiversity, and improve the livelihoods of independent smallholder farmers in Labuhanbatu, North Sumatra.

It could help them develop alternative sources of income, especially during the replanting period where their palm oil crops are unproductive, typically for three years,\" said Rob Nicholls, General Manager, Projects &amp; Programs, Musim Mas Group. In the face of climate change and threatened biodiversity, regenerative agriculture can play a role for small farms because it maintains soil health, prevents erosion and\u00a0water runoff, and can potentially reduce greenhouse gas emissions and nitrogen leakage.", "As a global development partner organization, SNV aims to support Indonesia in achieving its Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). To achieve this, we need to implement effective and impactful programs to transform agricultural and food systems, energy, and water. The key regenerative agriculture techniques taught include the application of bio-input, mulching to protect topsoil, planting cover crops, integrated pest management that reduces the need for chemical pesticides, and application of compost that reduces the amount of chemical fertilizers needed. To date, 1,032 independent smallholders received training and implement these techniques on their farms, representing a total land with a total area of 1,063."]}, {"relevance_score": 801, "title": "Mondelez International climbs 14% in 2025", "published": "2025-07-11", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">NASDAQ END-OF-MONTH STOCK REPORT</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mondelez International Inc.'s (NASDAQ: MDLZ) stock price has now climbed $8.25 (or 14%) year-to-date (YTD) in 2025 to close at $67.15. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Compared with the NASDAQ-100 Index which has risen 8.6% YTD, this is a relative price increase of 5.4% for Mondelez International shareholders. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Mondelez International is the NASDAQ's largest Consumer Non-Durables company by market cap. </p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Period-based % Price change, compared with benchmarks</p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"4\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_1\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"352\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"88\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"80\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Price Change %</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">1-month</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">3-month</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">3-year</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">MDLZ</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">2.2%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2.5%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">15.4%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Consumer non-durables sector</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">-0.2%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">2.9%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">6.7%</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">NASDAQ-100 Index</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">4%</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">22.1%</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">88.3%</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>Past quarter momentum up: Mondelez International lifts 2.5% on average volume 0.9 times average. </p><p><table><tgroup cols=\"5\" rowsep=\"0\" xml:id=\"tgroup_2\"><colspec colname=\"col1\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"184\"/><colspec colname=\"col2\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col3\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col4\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"64\"/><colspec colname=\"col5\" colsep=\"0\" colwidth=\"224\"/><tbody><row><entry colname=\"col1\">Past month to</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">High</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">Low</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">VWAP</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">Volume Index *</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">10 Jul 2025</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">69.81</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">65.44</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">67.81</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.9</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">10 Jun 2025</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">67.03</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">65.99</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">66.04</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">0.8</entry></row><row><entry colname=\"col1\">09 May 2025</entry><entry colname=\"col2\">66.64</entry><entry colname=\"col3\">65.85</entry><entry colname=\"col4\">67.06</entry><entry colname=\"col5\">1.0</entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table></p><p>[*Volume Index of 0.9 means volume for the month was 0.9 times its 12-month average]</p><p>[VWAP is defined as the Volume Weighted Average Price; High Low prices and VWAP are shown in USD]</p><p>MONDELEZ INTERNATIONAL EX-DIVIDENDS SINCE JUN 30</p><p>The shares have fallen 0.4% in the 7 trading sessions since the ex-dividend date of June 30.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

For instance, Labor Treasurer Jim Chalmers approved $507,000 to redesign the $5 note. Similarly, federal Labor spent $620,000 over two years for a speechwriter for minister Bill Shorten, despite Services Australia (his department) having over 180 communications staff.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Whilst each expenditure may have its justification, in an environment of record debt and extreme cost-of-living pressures, such spending is irresponsible. In 1942, Sir Robert Menzies observed, \"The great vice of democracy is that for a generation we have been busy getting ourselves on to the list of beneficiaries and removing ourselves from the list of contributors.\" Regrettably, this observation seems more pertinent today than ever.</p><p>It's time for our government to focus on delivering core functions and abandon unnecessary, boutique projects, especially those ideologically driven. Taxpayer money isn't limitless; it's a finite resource that must be managed with care and respect.</p><p>Tim Traill Sandy Bay</p><p>Needless wand worries There has been opposition to police being given wands that will react to persons carrying a knife. The opposition is that police will use this detection method indiscriminately or target people. Guidelines are in place that the wand can only be used in designated areas or in an area where a knife has been used before.</p><p>Police carry capsicum spray and guns but only use them under certain circumstances. It will be the same with the wand. Also it is an unobtrusive search method rather than a physical search.</p><p>The only ones who should be concerned are those in the community who are carrying knives or any weapon for that matter. I have no problems with police being dedicated and diligent in their approach to suspicious activity, it will only mean that there will be safety for the wider community.</p><p>Alan Leitch Austins Ferry</p><p>Not anti-jobs, pro-future After raising concerns about fish farms releasing antibiotics into our inshore waters, I was told: \"You just want to destroy forestry and aquaculture.\" That's not true - and it misses the bigger picture.</p><p>Everyone understands the need for jobs, but we need a better balance between jobs, profits, and protecting our environment. Right now, we have large profits going offshore, around 3500 local jobs, and an ecological time-bomb with cost implications for all Tasmanians.</p><p>Fish farms are polluting our waters, fuelling antibiotic resistance, and leaving marine debris. Native forest logging is accelerating climate change and pushing species to extinction. Both industries are contributing to Australia's wider biodiversity crisis.</p><p>But there are alternatives: seaweed and shellfish farming, onshore barramundi aquaponics, engineered timber from plantation species, and agroforestry. We could re-tool sawmills, support innovation, educate our kids to a high standard, and build a university-based tech hub.</p><p>Expressing concerns about industry practices isn't anti-jobs, it's pro-future. Other countries with fewer natural resources are doing this already. We just need the political will to invest in smarter, more sustainable options.</p><p>Jenny Cambers-Smith Crabtree</p><p>Make it better, Greens Growing fish in floating cages represents the pinnacle of humanity's transition from hunting and gathering to \"agriculture\". At 360 million square kilometers, the oceans are the ultimate pasture. With automated feeding, no bycatch, no threat to other species, and natural waste disposal, what could possibly go wrong?</p><p>Plenty - if done poorly. Overcrowding driven by greed, reluctance to build offshore cages for deeper waters, and poor design due to inadequate research could all pose risks. But the greatest threat isn't from within the industry; it's from relentless Green opposition.</p><p>Instead of working to improve this promising and successful sector, they seem intent on shutting it down, undermining the investment needed for progress.</p><p>The Greens must recognise the urgent need for affordable, healthy, and sustainable protein. Rather than campaigning against fish farming, they should focus on making it better.</p><p>Richard McCure Sandy Bay</p><p>Hospital stuck in past Reading David O'Byrne's tabling of Hospital South \"non-standard food items\" in parliament (Mercury, April 9), regarding written permission required for comfort foods such as an icy pole, reminded me of visiting someone in the RHH K Block on Tuesday around 2pm.</p><p>The whiteboard still had the previous days date and duty nurse written up and the wall clock was still on daylight saving time.</p><p>When I mentioned the clock to a nurse, I received little more than a shrug. Staff are under the pump, and this is small insignificant stuff I know. I guess the clock can only be adjusted by a suitably qualified and certified maintenance person, as reaching up and removing the clock from the wall could land the nurse in hospital.</p><p>I had to physically restrain myself from walking over and adjusting the clock.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Businesses across Asia are treading warily as they deal with a fragmented and complex B2B payment landscape. While some companies are cautiously optimistic about future sales and profits, others are fearful about cash flow problems and a deterioration in B2B customer payment behaviour. A significant 50% of firms also believe there will be a rise in customer insolvencies in the months ahead, posing a clear threat to financial health.</p><p>Our latest survey, conducted during the second half of Q2 2025, thus reveals an underlying fragility among companies in Asia amid widespread unease about how global trade policy uncertainties will impact on domestic economies. There is a remarkable mix of opinion across all the indicators, including an almost even split between firms experiencing stable, improved or worsening payment behaviour. The strain on business cash flow is highlighted by an average 44% of all B2B credit sales being affected by late payments. Bad debts average 5% of B2B invoices, but this figure masks vastly fluctuating rates among the various markets and the consequent serious threat to profitability.</p><p>Trade credit continues to play a central role in B2B trade across Asia, however, reflected in the survey finding that 54% of all B2B sales are currently transacted on credit. This is clearly a strategy to encourage sales and promote customer loyalty, but does mean increased credit exposure only partially mitigated by steady payment terms.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 2 of 2 Jul 14, 2025:</p><p>ARCADIA HOTEL NECKARSULM: TRADE CREDIT AND SURETY INSURANCES REINFORCE THEIR ROLE</p><p>According to the International Credit Insurance &amp; Surety Association (ICISA), trade credit insurance covered commercial credit lines grew by 7.5% in 2024, reaching EUR 3.5 trillion and supporting global trade at record levels.

It has also been a moderate and amply wet climate for the Corn Belt, which has been continuously extended, pushing off the originally forecast hot-and-dry spell that was long expected by midsummer 2025. On Friday, however, traders will take at least a brief pause from the weather trade to see what USDA has to say regarding corn fundamentals.</p><p>For Friday's report, the Dow Jones pre-report survey shows the average guess among analysts to be 1.342 billion bushels (bb) of carryout for the 2024-25 season. In fact, 10 of the 15 analysts included in the survey are predicting USDA to cut the old-crop carryout. If this cut occurs, increased exports are very likely to be the driver, as corn shipments through the last full week of June are running 27% ahead of the same time in 2024, with USDA currently estimating a 16% increase. Another 25- to 50-million-bushel (mb) increase may be appropriate, but I believe USDA will be cautious here given the seasonal tendency for exports to slow ahead of harvest.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 2 of 24 Jul 09, 2025:</p><p>ALGONA LIVESTOCK AUCTION: USDA DISASTER AID DETAILS RELEASED</p><p>Crop farmers who suffered losses due to natural disasters in 2023 and 2024 can now apply for $16 billion in assistance through the Supplemental Disaster Relief Program (SDRP), USDA stated Wednesday.</p><p>Funding for the program was passed by Congress in December as part of a $31.78 billion overall package that earmarked $10 billion for economic assistance and $21.78 billion for natural disasters in 2023 and 2024.</p><p>To expedite the implementation of SDRP, USDA's Farm Service Agency (FSA) is delivering assistance in two stages, the agency stated.

One underappreciated source of resistant bacteria is our wastewater, as bacteria in sewage evolve to survive small doses of antibiotics excreted by patients. Without proper treatment, these resistant bacteria could get into our water resources and cause infections, or transfer genes for antibiotic resistance to other bacteria. Scientists experimenting with natural compounds as potential water treatments have discovered that extracts of turmeric and rhubarb, curcumin and emodin, inhibit the activity of some strains of these resistant bacteria.

These core scans and their associated data will be made available through a centralized digital platform, helping to reduce exploration risk, re-evaluate existing discoveries and enable new mineral development opportunities across the North.</p><p>This program will be centred on drill cores from the Slave Geological Province in the Northwest Territories, one of Canada's most promising regions for mineral exploration and critical mineral development. This vast, underexplored area is home to past-producing mines and significant greenfield potential, particularly for critical minerals such as lithium, copper, cobalt and rare earth elements. By applying AI-driven analysis to historical core samples, both governments aim to spur new investment by giving industry the tools it needs to unlock untapped mineral value - without further disturbing the land.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 14 of 20 Jul 14, 2025:</p><p>NATIONAL RESEARCH COUNCIL OF CANADA: DR.

Briefly, what did you see there?</p><p>Well, it was interesting how tolerant so many people were there to being so tightly regulated. So there they have rules around loss limits, which means every person who gambles in Norway can only lose a certain amount of money every month. It comes to about $2,000 per month. There's also limits on how long you can play, how many hours you can play per month. There are limits on the kinds of games that you can play, and they have no casinos there. So, it's all online or it's in kiosks and in some sort of slot machines that they have at convenience stores. So there's just a lot of rules. And one thing that I think is very important is that the government owns the entire gambling industry or almost the entire gambling industry.

It is a bit of an investment of work up front, but mulch serves important purposes beyond just making the garden look tidy.</p><p>Mulch helps conserve soil moisture, suppresses weeds, and - if you use organic mulch - adds soil nutrients.</p><p>Diseases are less likely to get a foothold if you use mulch. It helps keep soil off of plants and fruit during heavy rains. Fungi, bacteria, and nematodes in the soil can infect plants, leading to issues like damping-off and root rot.</p><p>All mulches serve the same basic function, so which mulch you choose depends on the types of plants you grow as well as on your own aesthetic tastes.</p><p>For annual and perennial gardens, organic mulches are best. These include bark mulch, wood chips, shredded leaves, or pine needles. Skip the landscape fabric - it's a maintenance headache.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 14 of 23 Jul 11, 2025:</p><p>NEW HAMPSHIRE PUBLIC RADIO, INC.

We gave the ball (away) in areas where they transitioned very well and we had a difficult time getting pressure on the ball. I think that was probably the biggest issue in the first half was getting pressure on the ball. We started in a 4-2-3-1 and we had a way in which we wanted to go pressure them and it didn't work. We made an adjustment halfway through the second half, trying to put Manu (Garcia) a little bit closer to Dejan (Joveljic) in more of a 4-4-2. We tried a few different things and it just wasn't working. We were giving the ball away and then we got stretched and they were getting at us. (Jordan) Morris' run for the first goal, we've seen that time and time again and that was something that we were aware of and unfortunately he got to the spot first. That set everything else in motion. After it was 2-0, I think we started to put a little bit more pressure but then a dagger right before half in transition by giving the ball away - which you will from time to time in the box taking chances - and they transitioned right down the field and they scored. So we had almost an insurmountable deficit to overcome. But, as you said, we did come back in the second half. We made significant adjustments in the second half, in which we got close. But on the day, the first half did us in.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 6 of 12 Jul 13, 2025:</p><p>SPORTING KANSAS CITY CRONICA DEL PARTIDO: SPORTING KANSAS CITY CAE 2-3 CONTRA LOS SEATTLE SOUNDERS</p><p>En un partido donde Sporting se encontro atras tres goles en el primer tiempo, Kansas City pudo anotar dos goles en la segunda mitad para acortar la ventaja.

Cheese, a Panda Express, a Jollibee Chicken, and the din of traffic from U.S. Highway 22 all pressing in from the west, north, and east. Only the presence of a meandering branch of the Rahway River to the south has prevented a complete encirclement. Hostovsky's grave plaque, one of twenty-two thousand located there, is a modest one, in keeping with the cemetery's park-like aesthetic, as well as the age-old Jewish conviction that everyone rots equally. \"Life is known to be very difficult and very complicated,\" Sigmund Freud once wrote his friend Wilhelm Fliess, \"and, as we say in Vienna, many roads lead to the Central Cemetery.\" Set against a solid granite base is a flat bronze marker, decorated with two Magen Davids and an inscription providing only the barest outline of Hostovsky's remarkable life - Egon Hostovsky, April 23, 1908 - May 7, 1973.</p><p>Source: Company Website</p><p>+    Week 29 of 2025 - Press release 10 of 20 Jul 09, 2025:</p><p>THE AMERICAN SPECTATOR A GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC SCANDAL IS BREWING: WHAT IF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH IS NO LONGER TRUSTWORTHY?</p><p>Every day, the press churns out shocking scientific news that contradicts what we've always believed, our trusted doctors, or plain common sense.

The dumber the methodology, the harder it is to verify if the researchers even exist. The more groundbreaking the result, the more likely its interpretation is bogus. The more clicks a story gets, the less fact-checking the journalist did. And the more institutions and media outlets amplify and rework the story, the more dangerous the headline becomes.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.

Triscuit is an iconic snacking brand with a history and heritage dating back more than a century. Through this initiative, the Triscuit brand is contributing to the sourcing of recycled plastics via the ISCC mass balance approach, helping to support a more circular pack economy in the U.S. and Canada. This contributes to Mondelez Internationals goal of achieving about 5% recycled plastic content by 2025**. In the past, soft plastic packaging has been considered a single-use material. By adopting this advanced recycling technology, Triscuit fans can snack easier knowing that the brand is playing a role in helping reduce plastic waste.</p><p>As part of this effort, up to 50% of the plastic used in the protective bag-in-box liner films can be attributed to plastic sourced from advanced recycling technology through the ISCC PLUS certified mass balance approach. This advancement complements the current outer box used in Triscuit cracker packaging, which is already made from 100% recycled paperboard (35% post-consumer recycled content), promoting a more sustainable packaging structure for Triscuit crackers overall. Through this investment, the Triscuit brand aims to divert over one million pounds of plastic waste from landfills per year.</p><p>We are excited to implement this innovative technology for Triscuit cracker packaging, said Caitlin Schell, Marketing Director for the Triscuit brand. The Triscuit brand supports Mondelez Internationals strategic focus of working toward driving change where the world needs it most.</p><p>April 15 2024: Mondelez International Reports Meaningful Progress Against its Snacking Made Right Priorities</p><p>CHICAGO, April 15, 2024 -- Mondelez International, Inc.
