New Zealand is a small enough place to do it, with the help of domestic flights and the occasional helicopter.</p><p>Otahuna Lodge, a 30-minute drive from Christchurch's international airport, is the lodge I imagine in my dreams. The seven-guestroom stately home, built in 1895 as the residence of politician Sir Heaton Rhodes, has had a checkered history over the past 50 years (it was a seminary, then a commune, then derelict) before being rescued by partners Hall Cannon and Miles Refo, who poured love and buckets of money into a complete restoration, opening the house to guests in 2007. You can see why they love it. Otahuna has the distinction of being the largest private historic residence in New Zealand and one of the best examples of Queen Anne architecture in Australasia.</p><p>Heartbreakingly, the earthquake of 2010 damaged the house, but that didn't deter the new owners, who supervised repairs and reopened it the following year. The original, ornate Rimu panelling, the hand-carved Kauri staircase and the 16 fireplaces, some with their carved inglenooks, survive, as well as the exquisite, embossed Japanese Kinkarakami wallpaper in the dining room, originally installed by Sir Heaton's wife Jessie.</p><p>You couldn't find a more charming host than the garrulous, Memphis-born Cannon, who has restored the property with such love, he's even kept the original switchboard Sir Heaton used.</p><p>But it doesn't feel like a museum. Guest rooms have been decorated with aplomb in Colefax &amp; Fowler and Pierre Frey fabrics, bespoke furniture and all mod cons, such as heated bathroom floors.</p><p>I stay in the gorgeous attic suite, The Loft, which includes its own door to Narnia in the cupboard. There are several such witty touches throughout the property, such as the chicken coop named Ota-hen-a. And, past the heated outdoor pool, there's a croquet lawn, of course. Cute, black-nosed sheep occupy one of the paddocks.</p><p>The 12 hectares of gardens are magnificent, with woodlands, orchards, flower gardens and a vast organic vegetable and herb garden from which chef Jimmy McIntyre draws his ingredients.</p><p>The cooking is off the charts in terms of flavour, using garden produce such as prosciutto and ham from the farm's pigs and fresh eggs from the chickens. Breakfast is a total delight in the big, country kitchen, with preserves, pickles and chutneys from the garden.</p><p>Otahuna is famous for its carpets of daffodils in spring. More than a million bulbs have been planted and about 100,000 of these bloom every year. In autumn, formal gardens with their red benches are a riot of reddish colours and mossy greens.</p><p>After the cosy stay, it's a flight to Wellington and then a quick helicopter transport to Wharekauhau (pronounced foray-ko-ho), a working sheep station with 16 cottages and a villa set atop dramatic 62-metre-tall cliffs overlooking Palliser Bay on the very south of the North Island.</p><p>Wellington has been nicknamed \"Wellywood\" for its vibrant film industry, and the lush neighbouring fields we fly over belong to US film director James Cameron, who has been instrumental (with Peter Jackson) in the industry's boom. The landscape is wrapped in the peaks of the Remutaka mountain range.</p><p>Wharekauhau was one of the first purpose-built lodges in New Zealand when it opened in 1998. It's now owned by American entertainment mogul William Foley, who loved it so much as a guest that he bought the property in 2010. Foley has a stake in a number of local vineyards in nearby Martinborough, which also produce Lighthouse, the craft gin made by Rachel Hall, New Zealand's only female gin distiller.</p><p>The lodge, set on 1200 hectares, is supremely comfortable, with plush country house-style interiors by Victoria Fisher. The cottages all have canopy beds, sitting rooms by gas fireplaces, large bathrooms and wide verandas facing the ocean. Because of the spectacular storms in the region, storm watching and stargazing are the lodge's most popular activities.</p><p>Fine dining and drinking New Zealand's famous wines are too, of course. There's a dedicated edible garden which supplies the chefs - and there's a head forager, Jack Fredrickson, an Australian who ventures far and wide on his quad bike to find wild ingredients for the dishes.</p><p>The main lodge has room after room of overstuffed furniture and beautiful objects and art, a glasshouse with pool, spa and gym, tennis courts, croquet lawn, games room, library and two restaurants. Every detail is immaculate, in line with the expectations of guests.</p><p>Walks down country lanes to visit the sheep are invigorating. And then there are activities such as ATV and quad bike excursions on the moody black sand beach scattered with bleached driftwood, and clay pigeon shooting at stations along the river. (When the zombie apocalypse comes, I'm not going to be much help - I hit one target out of about 20.)</p><p>It's a domestic flight from Wellington to Queenstown and on by car to Blanket Bay Lodge, which sits on the far reaches of Lake Wakatipu, near the village of Glenorchy.</p><p>With the Southern Alps framed in every window, the setting has an undoubted wow factor and the lodge itself, a lofty chalet lined with recycled wharf and woolshed timber polished with wool lanolin, is as spectacular as the surrounds.</p><p>It's filled with delightful ephemera - antler chandeliers, taxidermy deer and ducks, displays of birds' nests, saddles, fishing rods and bales of wool - which makes it feel like a cross between a swank Aspen chalet and a hunting lodge.</p><p>Opened in 1999 and developed by American Tom Tusher, a keen fisherman, the lodge consists of five lakeside lodge rooms and five suites in the main building, plus two chalet suites and an exclusive-use villa with four bedrooms and private chefs on tap. (Kylie Minogue is a past guest, as are a number of movie stars when in New Zealand to shoot Wellywood productions.)</p><p>There are stone hearths and fireplaces throughout, with afternoon teas, cocktails and delicious, chewy cookies served by the fire. (Each cookie arrives topped with a gilded chocolate \"B\" - an example of the superb attention to detail throughout the lodge.)</p><p>The gastronomy is refined, with dinner an ever-changing five-course degustation sourced from New Zealand regions, such as organic chicken from nearby farms and kingfish sashimi from local waters. As with all the lodges, full farm breakfasts are a highlight of the day.</p><p>Why venture outside? Well, there's the lakefront and peninsula woodlands and sheep farms to explore on foot, plus the world-famous hiking trails on the Alps.</p><p>One of the experiences is a jet boat adventure along the Dart River, which is a couple of hours of screaming and getting soaked as the driver does countless \"wheelies\" in the cold water.

Hopping between three, writes Mercedes Maguire The first few tentative steps atop the white snowy caps of New Zealand's Southern Alps are not what I expected. From a distance, the ancient glaciers appear as a soft blanket of freshly fallen snow blanketing the mountaintops, not the hard, compacted ice we find when our helicopter lands among Fiordland National Park's highest peaks.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">\"Edmund Hillary climbed that peak three times in training before he tackled Everest,\" our pilot says, pointing at Mount Tutoko. \"Sadly, these glaciers are disappearing. I remember seeing those mountain peaks covered in snow, not exposed like that.\" His commentary forces me to put down my camera and take in the precious moment; breathe in the crisp, clean air and marvel at the silence and glaring whiteness stretched out before me.</p><p>We were picked up from the front lawn of Blanket Bay luxury lodge for a helitour of Fiordland National Park. En route, our pilot points out the remote cabin on the edge of Lake Wakatipu where Brad Pitt's still-in-production film Heart of the Beast recently wrapped filming, and fans of The Lord of the Rings and Mission Impossible: Fallout movies will recognise the scenery of the lake sandwiched between mountains.</p><p>The Southern Alps is the final stop in a multi-lodge holiday of New Zealand. New Zealand's lodges are different to those anywhere else - often in remote, natural settings, they offer the perfect combo of intimate service, amazing food and genuine sustainability. I like to think of this trip, which will include a stay in three of the country's best luxury lodges, as a bit like an island-hopping adventure with a twist - lodge leaping, perhaps?</p><p>First stop Otahuna Lodge may be just 30 minutes from Christchurch Airport, but it has getting-away-from-it-all vibes. The seven-room Queen Anne mansion - built in 1895 by politician Sir Heaton Rhodes for his new bride, Jessie - comes into view on approach along the long gravel driveway.</p><p>Hall Cannon and Miles Refo took on the then-crumbling pile in 2006 (left derelict after its time as a Christian monastery and a 1960s hippie commune), opening the largest private historic property in New Zealand after a year-long restoration.</p><p>My room is a light-drenched space styled in modern Victorian with high ceilings, a wood-burning fireplace and a large recessed picture window overlooking the grounds.</p><p>It was once the room of the lady of the house, and I'm happy to be its latest occupant, even if it's just for the night. While the lodge operates as a fine hotel under the Relais &amp; Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux banner, it feels more like I'm a guest in a private country home, each room a perfect blend of authentic old and comfortable new. There's no minibar or television in my room, for example, because they didn't have them in Jessie's time. But on the main landing, an old timber sideboard serving as a shared minibar heaves with freshly baked friands and Anzac biscuits, tea, coffee and cold drinks.</p><p>The extensive gardens were remodelled into a series of spaces that are like living jewellery boxes - the Dutch garden, rose garden, orchard and a 130-variety fruit and vegetable patch that inspires executive chef Jimmy McIntyre's seasonal menus. Guests are encouraged to book cooking demonstrations and garden tours for the full experience.</p><p>Hall waves us off the next morning, after a country breakfast that included a delicious multigrain no-knead bread made from a 100-year-old recipe in New Zealand's beloved Edmonds Cookery Book, farm fresh eggs, homemade jams, honey and muesli.</p><p>North Island hop A short plane trip to Wellington and a helicopter ride across the water (or a 90-minute drive) takes us to our second stop, Wharekauhau. If Otahuna Lodge is reminiscent of an old English hunting lodge, Wharekauhau is more like a luxe farmstay, cradled between the Remutaka mountains and Palliser Bay.</p><p>The main building is the hub for meals, activity-planning, evening drinks, exercise or just a place to hang out, while the accommodation is away from the lodge in 16 cottage suites and a villa.</p><p>Wharekauhau has a dedicated \"activity outfitter\" and planning your days over cocktails in the formal lounge is all part of the experience. We toured the 1200ha estate on ATV quad bikes (keeping an eye out for movie-director neighbour James Cameron), hand-fed eels, went clay-target shooting and walked the black-sand beach at Palliser Bay - and that was without leaving the estate. A 45-minute drive takes you to the charming town of Martinborough, a great spot for lunch and shopping and the home of Lighthouse Gin, run by New Zealand's first female head distiller, Rachel Hall.</p><p>Refusing to get caught up in the \"crazy-flavoured gin trend\", Hall produces a core range of three gins: Original, Navy Strength and Barrel Aged, all made using nine botanicals and spring water from Wharekauhau.</p><p>And back south The luxury lodge trifecta finishes at picture-perfect Blanket Bay, 45 minutes from Queenstown Airport. There are eight rooms in the main lodge plus four chalets and a four-bedroom villa elsewhere on the estate.</p><p>The area is a perfect base for adventure activities like horse riding, ziplining, bungee jumping, helifishing, hiking and jetboating. But with a helipad on the grounds, flights over nearby Milford Sound and the glaciers of the Southern Alps are the ultimate local experience.</p><p>Our pilot tells us that what appears to be dirt on the glacier tops is actually ash from Australian bushfires. That doesn't stop me bending to scoop the water, drip-fed from a glacier to a small steam, into my mouth. It's crisp, perfectly chilled and delicious. And after a week of pure indulgence, it seems like a fitting finale to New Zealand.</p><p>The writer was a guest of Relais &amp; Ch\u00c3\u00a2teaux.</p><p>Escape contributor Mercedes Maguire can now add these skills to her repertoire: ATV quad-bike driver, glacial water sommelier, gin enthusiast and clay target sharpshooter (okay, that's probably going a bit far).</p><p>.</p><p>ESCAPE ROUTE STAYING THERE Otahuna, 30 minutes from Christchurch Airport.

From capturing stunning aerial videos to delivering packages, drones are transforming industries.<br/>But what's making drones smarter and more capable is the rapid advancement in robotics and artificial intelligence (AI). Autonomous drone technology is moving beyond simple remote-controlled machines to fully independent systems that can think, adapt, and make decisions on their own.</p><p><br/>One of the most important advancements in drone technology is the development of AI-powered navigation systems. Autonomous drones can now fly without direct human control, relying on sensors, cameras, and algorithms to map their surroundings and avoid obstacles.<br/>For example, drones equipped with LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) can create detailed 3D maps of their environment in real-time. This allows them to navigate safely through forests, cities, or even inside buildings without crashing.<br/>Drones are also getting better at working together. Using a concept called \"swarm intelligence,\" researchers are developing drones that can communicate and coordinate with each other, just like a flock of birds or a school of fish.<br/>This technology is particularly useful in situations like disaster response, where multiple drones can work as a team to search for survivors, deliver supplies, or assess damage. For example, during the 2020 Australian bushfires, autonomous drones were used to monitor the spread of fires and guide firefighting efforts.<br/>Another breakthrough in autonomous drone technology is in object recognition and tracking. Thanks to machine learning, drones can now identify and follow specific objects or people. This is being used in agriculture, where drones can monitor crops and identify areas that need watering or pest control.<br/>Similarly, wildlife researchers are using drones to track animals and study their behavior without disturbing them. In the delivery industry, companies like Amazon and UPS are testing drones that can identify delivery locations and safely drop off packages.<br/>One of the most exciting applications of autonomous drones is in transportation. Urban air mobility is becoming a reality, with companies developing drone taxis that can carry passengers across cities.<br/>These drones use advanced robotics to ensure safe takeoffs, landings, and navigation through busy airspaces. While this technology is still in its early stages, it has the potential to revolutionize transportation and reduce traffic congestion.<br/>Autonomous drones are also making a big impact in environmental conservation. Drones equipped with sensors and cameras are being used to monitor deforestation, track illegal fishing, and even plant trees in hard-to-reach areas.<br/>Some drones can collect air quality data, helping scientists understand pollution patterns and find ways to combat climate change.<br/>The military is another area where autonomous drones are being heavily developed. These drones are used for surveillance, reconnaissance, and even combat missions. Autonomous systems allow drones to operate in dangerous environments without putting human lives at risk.<br/>However, the use of drones in warfare raises ethical concerns, particularly when it comes to fully autonomous weapons that can make life-and-death decisions without human oversight.<br/>As drones become more advanced, their potential uses continue to grow. Emergency response teams are using drones to deliver medical supplies to remote locations.<br/>Energy companies are deploying drones to inspect power lines and wind turbines, reducing the need for risky manual inspections. Even in the entertainment industry, drones are being used for light shows and creative filming techniques.<br/>While there are still challenges to overcome, such as improving battery life and addressing privacy concerns, the advancements in robotics for autonomous drones are opening up new possibilities across industries.<br/>By making drones smarter, safer, and more efficient, robotics is shaping a future where these flying machines will play an even bigger role in our everyday lives. From saving lives to protecting the environment, autonomous drones are proving that the sky is no longer the limit-it's just the beginning.<br/>Copyright \u00a9 2025 Knowridge Science Report.

The other - a largely sympathetic profile of \"troublesome beneficiary\" James Murdoch in The Atlantic - is more pointed and personal.</p><p>But both, beneath the splashy melodrama, make a fundamentally legal point. The attempt to alter the family trust has failed, and even upon appeal, will probably not succeed. Things are back in their holding pattern. Only now, that pattern is untenable.</p><p>Everyone hates Lachlan and is barely talking to Rupert. The solution?</p><p>A buyout of the troublesome siblings, on more agreeable terms than the 60 per cent of market value they'd been offered. Call it a veiled threat. As Prue, Liz and James told the Times: \"We are refraining from comment at this moment, because most of the litigation is still under seal.\" Key words: at this moment.</p><p>Of course, this is nothing less than a family divorce, and motivations aren't singular. In laying out his side of family tensions in The Atlantic, James gives every appearance of seeking a moral vindication. His father, he said, was \"a misogynist\" who never considered his daughters as potential successors. An uncaring patriarch who shows no interest in his grandchildren, and who organises sham family counselling retreats with the sole aim of isolating and controlling his troublesome son. And a \"twisted\" and inscrutable opponent, at one point in a deposition texting an attorney who called James and his sisters \"white, privileged, multibillionaire trust-fund babies\" with suggestions on where to push his son next.</p><p>There's no denying the Murdoch children have all done well out of the family business. Aside from a lifetime of assured privilege, each was paid $US2.1 billion ($3.3 billion) in 2019 for selling their stake of the company's entertainment assets to Disney. Further, the Sun King does not appear misguided about his troublesome son's antipathy for News Corp's editorial positioning. Asked what changes they want to see in the family's outlets, James' wife Kathryn makes a telling remark about Fox News. \"It doesn't have a clear purpose in the ecosystem any more,\" she says.</p><p>Reading that, yesterday, led Sydney broker and long-time Lachlan backer Angus Aitken to quip his thanks that neither James nor Kathryn have anything to do with the business. \"It is pretty obvious that if James did get his way ... it would have ended up like MSNBC and CNN: financially distressed with declining ratings, revenues and relevance,\" he said.</p><p>The profile is, in a sense, a rebuttal to such views, widely expressed in Australia and in the closed Nevada trial (where James was grilled on his business achievements). The younger Murdoch son is depicted as a suave, sophisticated bureaucrat who turned a loss-making Asian satellite subsidiary around and knew how to drive cultural and financial change within legacy businesses.</p><p>In the Times piece, it is the Murdoch women who dominate. Liz and Prue are close, frequently sharing emoji-laden messages of their fraught contact with their father and brothers.</p><p>Prue, the daughter from Rupert's first marriage to Patricia Booker, even advises Rupert on how to reach out to James, suggesting he talk to him about missing his grandchildren, rather than going heavy on the manoeuvring (\"I know. Not totally stupid,\" Rupert replies).</p><p>When Rupert later attempted to enlist his daughters' support in disenfranchising them of their birthright, they were stunned.</p><p>According to trial transcripts, Prue called her father and warned him about treating her and Liz like \"assistants\".</p><p>\"You already lost one son. And you could well lose two daughters over this,\" she tells him.</p><p>Liz, meanwhile, urged her father to find another solution, and told him he was misunderstanding James, to which Rupert responded that she'd been lobbied by James and \"you're going to bend to his will\".</p><p>\"Do you think I'm a f---ing moron,\" she replied.</p><p>She also tried appealing to Lachlan, telling him she'd always been his biggest supporter and that the trust changes were a \"massive gut punch\". Lachlan was unsympathetic.</p><p>\"Today is about dad's wishes and confirming all of our support for him and for his wishes. It shouldn't be difficult or controversial,\" he texted back.</p><p>Anna Murdoch - Rupert's second wife and the mother of Liz, Lachlan and James - also made an appearance. It is to her that Rupert tellingly tied the future of conservatism in the English-speaking world to the ascension of his oldest son.</p><p>\"Fox and our papers are the only faintly conservative voices against the monolithic liberal media,\" he wrote in an email. Anna didn't disagree, pushing her ex-husband to \"get things sorted out soon\".</p><p>\"Lachlan is the best to run the business ... James is very bright and articulate - but time and again showed poor judgment.\"</p><p>The Atlantic's story also makes much of James' shock and hurt at discovering his father and brother have leaked to the press against him. But it would be naive to think he does not do the same. Those sympathetic to Lachlan point out that when James broke from the News Corp narrative during the Australian bushfires in 2020, expressing his disappointment with \"the ongoing denial [of climate change] among the news outlets in Australia\", he did so through his own PR representative.</p><p>They are also sceptical that his present manoeuvring will work. Such mischief, they argue, will only harden Rupert's resolve. But this assumes a lot. After all, in the fullness of the appeals process, a Nevada courtroom may deny him and his chosen successor a choice.</p>", "publisher": "The Australian Financial Review", "instances": ["The Atlantic's story also makes much of James' shock and hurt at discovering his father and brother have leaked to the press against him.

His poetry is sublime. This is a collection of short stories, beautifully packaged by Transit Lounge. Kinsella is deeply concerned about the environment. His language, when he talks about our fragile planet, is like music. I have not yet read all the stories in this collection - I intend to savour them, one at a time - but he sure knows how to get you in, with elevator pitches like these: \"Two men must awkwardly meet again when their daughters -attend the same ballet class\". Bravo John. I'm so happy to have this in my to-be-read pile.</p><p>FIREWORKS By Oliver Smuhar Mountain Blue Publishing, Children 274pp, $7 This book was truly a labor of love for the author, who is also the illustrator. In his letter to readers, Oliver says: \"First of all, I would like to thank you for your donation!\" Because some of the money raised is going to the FireWorks fund for the environment. Oliver is a young and passionate writer, who published his first book, a young adult fantasy, before he'd even finished high school. He says: \"From the bottom of my heart, I hope you enjoy what I've created\", which is a lovely story about Illuka the koala and Bouddi the sugar glider, who had to try to survive Australian bushfires.</p><p>BOY WITH A BLACK ROOSTER By Stefanie vor Schulte (translated by Alexandra Roesch) New South, Fairytale 184pp, $29.99 This little book is described as a \"fairy tale for adults\". It was originally published in German but is now available in English, and it has won a number of different prizes, among them the Mara Cassens Prize for best German-language debut. It was also nominated for the Klaus-Michael Kuhne Prize. The premise is fascinating: can an 11-year-old boy succeed where others have failed, and recover a kidnapped child? The boy in question is accompanied at all times by his friend, the black rooster. You'll cheer for him, as he goes about his adventures. It's a morality tale, by and large.</p><p>THE OUTSIDE By Larry Blair and Jeremy Goring Penguin Random House, Nonfiction 305pp, $29.99 This book has got a little of the Trent Daltons about it, except that Larry Blair has decided not to fictionalise his life story but to tell it with a friend. According to the blurb, he \"shot to fame at just 19, coming from nowhere to take the largest ever cash prize in surfing\". He's also won Hawaii's Pipeline Masters, twice. Nobody knew how far he'd come: his father, Baldy Blair, was a bank robber, and his mother, -Patricia, a jewel thief. Larry's co-writer is also his long-time surfing partner. The ocean shimmers, a symbol of peace throughout.</p><p>SHAKESPEARE IS HARD BUT SO IS LIFE By Fintan O'Toole Head of Zeus, Nonfiction 196pp, $29.99 This is a hard copy, issued by Bloomsbury for the Australian market, and if you're at all interested in Shakespeare - I mean, who isn't? - you need this on your shelves. Fintan O'Toole is a columnist for the Irish Times, and an editor at the New York Review of Books. He is a warm, funny guide to the Bard, but he's also keen to pick apart the idea that Shakespeare essentially writes morality plays, saying: \"We are not in a moral universe of comeuppances and rewarded virtue.\"</p><p>BENEATH THE SOUTHERN CROSS: LOOKING FOR AUSTRALIA IN THE 21ST CENTURY Edited by Peter Kurti Connor Court, Essays 230pp, $29.95 This is a new collection of essays from writers and academics who take, as a jumping off point, the idea that the voice referendum exposed some divisions in the Australian community, which perhaps reflect deeper changes in our culture. The foreword, by Lorraine Finlay, sets the scene: \"What does it mean to be Australian? There is no single, objectively correct answer to this question.\" Yet it's absolutely critical for any nation to have something of a national story, and a sense of pride in that story. To that end, the writers are keen to \"restore cultural self-confidence, and recover a truly national identity\". The contributors include Georgina Downer, Anne Henderson, Gary Johns and Tanveer Ahmed.</p><p>JOHN BERGER AND ME By Nikos Papastergiadis Giramondo, Memoir 212pp, $32.95 Studies of male friendship are rarer these days than they used to be, which is why I was so pleased to see this elegant volume, when it first crossed my desk. The author is a sociologist, who studied at the University of Melbourne and the University of Cambridge; he is now a fellow of the Australian Academy of the Humanities. He recalls and examines in this book his long friendship with writer and art critic, the late John Berger, with whom he lived a peasant life over many summer months, including during the harvest in a French village. The author says: \"This book is about how he (Berger) changed my appreciation of my -father's peasant life (in Greece) and how his memory continues to shape my life.\" Lovely.</p><p>HEIMLICH UNHEIMLICH By Hazel Smith and Sieglinde Karl-Spence Apothecary Archive, History 53pp, $22 This is an important book. It takes the contrasting childhoods of the two author-illustrators as a starting point. They have also made use of glorious photographs from their family albums. The characters are Hessian, a German girl whose father fought in the German army, who migrates to Australia while she is still a child; and Muslin, who was born to a Jewish family in England after the war, before becoming a poet, and moving to Australia. Her family is keen to preserve Jewish culture, and cannot forgive the Nazis. Second and even third-generation trauma is still being unpicked by sociologists, and this is a -wonderful contribution.</p>", "publisher": "The Australian", "instances": ["Because some of the money raised is going to the FireWorks fund for the environment.

The Incident controller plotted the location of these fires onto his fuel-age plans and was relieved to find that, of the 26 fires, 20 were burning in fuels that were less than four years old, so could initially be left unattended. He then concentrated all fire-fighting efforts on the six fires burning in heavier fuels. These were brought under control, with a total of only 6000 hectares of forest burnt.</p><p>This is another, of the many examples, where fuel reduction by prescribed fire has been successful in avoiding potential catastrophe.

The Science is not real science. It is a set of beliefs, a faith. Those who demand we agree it's settled are no different from a Catholic bishop declaring: \"Roma locuta est; causa finita est\" - Rome has spoken; the cause is finished.</p><p>The zealots who invoke The Science as a gag order have never read the research or wilfully ignore its infuriating uncertainty. This uncountably large group includes battalions of politicians, academics, activists, journalists and a few dozen billionaire energy-hobbyist carpetbaggers.</p><p>Take the deeply entrenched belief that global warming is causing more extreme weather. This is so ubiquitous as to be unquestioned. It is an article of faith and there is almost no weather event nowadays that does not come with a blizzard of declarations it is proof of climate change.</p><p>Among myriad examples, let's pick Tropical Cyclone Jasper, which hit far north Queensland in December. It dumped a massive amount of rain and none of what follows denies the fact it caused great damage and suffering. In its wake the Red Cross released an Instagram video declaring \"Disasters like Ex-Tropical Cyclone Jasper in Far North Queensland are happening more often due to climate change\". Greenpeace called it a \"frightening portent of what's to come under climate change\". The Climate Council warned \"climate change is making (tropical cyclones) more destructive\".</p><p>None of this is true.</p><p>If The Science of global warming has a bible then surely it must be the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report Climate Change 2021: The Physical Science Basis. It is the latest accumulation of all the best research and it runs to a mind-numbing 2391 pages.</p><p>On page 1586 it says: \"(Tropical cyclone) landfall frequency over Australia shows a decreasing trend in Eastern Australia since the 1800s, as well as in other parts of Australia since 1982. A paleoclimate proxy reconstruction shows that recent levels of (tropical cyclone) interactions along parts of the Australian coastline are the lowest in the past 550-1500 years.\" Pause on that. Not only does observation show there are fewer cyclones since the industrial revolution began belching extra carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, there is evidence to suggest cyclone activity in Australia is at its lowest ebb since the days of the Tang dynasty and the decline of the Western Roman Empire.</p><p>The CSIRO echoes that finding in its State of the Climate Report 2022 and adds: \"The trend in cyclone intensity in the Australian region is harder to quantify than cyclone frequency, due to uncertainties in estimating the intensity of individual cyclones and the relatively small number of intense cyclones.\" What of droughts? The IPCC finds southwestern Australia has been drying out since the 1950s and there is evidence that the length of droughts in southeastern Australia has \"increased significantly\". But it says \"the Millennium drought in eastern Australia was not unusual in the context of natural variability reconstructed over the past millennium\" and concludes \"there is currently low confidence that recent droughts in eastern Australia can be clearly attributed to human influence\" (p1089).</p><p>In summary, on page 1663, it says there is low confidence in observed trends, or projected changes, to droughts in central and eastern Australia as the climate warms. In northern Australia there is medium confidence of a \"decrease in the frequency and intensity of meteorological droughts\". So, more rain for the Top End then.</p><p>The report notes the major drivers of drought in Australia as well-known natural climate events: \"During the last millennium, the combined effect of a positive (Indian Ocean Dipole) and El Nino conditions have caused severe droughts over Australia\" (p1104).</p><p>What of bushfires? \"Extreme conditions, like the 2019 Australian bushfires and African flooding, have been associated with strong positive (Indian Ocean Dipole) conditions\" (p1104).</p><p>And, in case you were wondering, \"There is no evidence of a trend in the Indian Ocean Dipole mode and associated anthropogenic forcing\" and \"The amplitude of the El Nino-Southern Oscillation variability has increased since 1950 but there is no clear evidence of human influence\" (p1104).</p><p>Let's be clear. There is plenty of evidence in the IPCC report demonstrating the climate is changing, that the world and Australia are getting warmer, and that industrial activity has played a part in forcing some of it. We should take that seriously. In response Australia should do its proportionate share in cutting greenhouse gas emissions without destroying our local ecology or impoverishing the nation.</p><p>But here is the good news: we are not facing a climate Armageddon. Again, this is not just my view but one shared by British professor Jim Skea, who was appointed chairman of the IPCC last year.</p><p>\"The world won't end if it warms by more than 1.5 degrees,\" Skea told German weekly magazine Der Spiegel last year. \"It will however be a more dangerous world. Countries will struggle with many problems, there will be social tensions.</p><p>\"And yet this is not an existential threat to humanity. Even with 1.5 degrees of warming, we will not die out.\" Skea worries the zealots are doing their cause a grave disservice. \"If you constantly communicate the message that we are all doomed to extinction, then that paralyses people and prevents them from taking the necessary steps to get a grip on climate change,\" he said.</p><p>What it is also designed to do is scare people out of questioning absurd statements and bad policies.</p><p>Here there is another assault on reason by ideologues. In this game of witch burning, questioning a policy response to global warming is evidence of the crime of climate change denial. Their argument can be expressed as a syllogism.</p><p>Premise 1: Climate change is real.</p><p>Premise 2: Renewable energy combats climate change.</p><p>Conclusion: Therefore, to question renewable energy is to deny climate change.

The Bureau of Meteorology, which has different criteria than international weather agencies, is yet to formally declare an El Nino event and may do so in coming weeks, but the canary appears to have already keeled over.</p><p>On Tuesday, the world recorded its hottest day, when the average global temperature reached 17 degrees, surpassing the August 2016 record of 16.9 degrees. Earlier this year, the World Meteorological Organisation released a report that said there was a 98 per cent likelihood that at least one of the next five years would be the warmest on record, beating the record set in 2015-16, when there was an exceptionally strong El Nino. That time seven years ago was disastrous for Australia, with the Great Barrier Reef experiencing the worst coral-bleaching event on record, resulting in damage to more than 60 per cent of the region.</p><p>Australia has just experienced a period of high rainfall due to a La Nina event combined with two other climate drivers: a negative Indian Ocean dipole and a positive Southern Annular Mode. It means the soil is moist and plants are flourishing. Now we are set to enter into a drying period driven by an El Nino. Experts fear the abundant plant growth leading into a dry period is likely to result in widespread bushfires across Australia.</p><p>Not all El Nino years result in bushfires but former Fire and Rescue NSW commissioner Greg Mullins warned the state has been set up for a serious fire season as there had been above-normal fire potential for central Australia and northern NSW after years of heavy rain had enabled strong grass growth. There had been a lot of regeneration in parts of the state that had previously burnt in bushfires, elevating dangers along the South Coast. Parts of Sydney and Newcastle could also experience elevated fire risk this coming summer.</p><p>The question is this: how ready is NSW to face another natural disaster onslaught? In the recent past, emergency service organisations have been found wanting in their response to bushfires and floods. Since the Black Summer bushfires of 2019, and the subsequent years of floods, a new sense of preparedness has been imposed on the authorities charged with protecting the state. One welcome outcome of the independent inquiry into the floods was the appointment of a NSW Police deputy commissioner, Peter Thurtell, to oversee and co-ordinate emergency services' response to future natural disasters. In addition, the Albanese government last month allocated more than $70 million to NSW for disaster preparedness.</p><p>The threat posed by El Nino's return also represents a challenge to the climate change movement. Only a decade ago, prime minister Tony Abbott was moved to anger by the UN daring to link climate change with Australian bushfires, but the world has moved on and most now agree with the movement's legitimate concerns.</p><p>However, while conscious of the impact of El Nino, for many Australians a shadow sometimes falls between the idea and the reality: Amid a chilly winter, Sydney's coldest May in 53 years and a 23.9 per cent jump in power bills, consumers know that climate change demands they reduce their reliance on fossil fuels but understandably prefer to be warm.</p>", "publisher": "The Sydney Morning Herald", "instances": ["In addition, the Albanese government last month allocated more than $70 million to NSW for disaster preparedness.

cent protein for every 100 grams, making them higher in protein than chicken or beef.</p><p>Ms Pownall's Mandurah-based business Grubs Up was founded in 2016 and produces and processes crickets and mealworms for human and animal consumption.</p><p>She said the turnover between hatching and harvesting was quick, about eight weeks, for thousands of crickets at a time.</p><p>When establishing her business, she was immediately met with difficulties in food safety regulations.</p><p>\"When we started we couldn't get food approval, because all the policies were about trying to keep insects out of food,\" Ms Pownall said.</p><p>\"We were also told we could only buy crickets from a registered breeder, which there is no such thing.\"</p><p>There are also high input costs, particularly labour and energy, as crickets need to be kept between 22-25 degrees Celsius to grow properly.</p><p>\"We would solve one problem and encounter another and given the nature of the industry, there weren't many resources available,\" Ms Pownall said.</p><p>This led her to wonder if there was a more efficient way to grow and harvest crickets on a large scale.</p><p>In 2020, Ms Pownall received a Nuffield scholarship to investigate what the edible insect industry would need to drastically scale up, including regulations, production facilities and best practice.</p><p>The plan was to bring this information back to WA and scale up her own business.</p><p>But when the pandemic hit, borders closed and the edible insect industry nosedived.</p><p>Edible insect businesses globally were met with increased input costs, transport costs and issues in importing and exporting.</p><p>Many quickly began to supply to other industries, such as the pet food industry, and never looked back.</p><p>At the time, the global edible insect industry was estimated to be worth $500 million and is now expected to increase to about $3 billion globally over the next five years.</p><p>Ms Pownall spoke to edible insect growers in Canada, Asia and the United Kingdom, as well as industry stakeholders including investors, governments and customers during her scholarship trip.One Canadian cricket farmer told Ms Pownall it exported to 12 countries prior to COVID-19, but switched to domestic sales due to the cost of exporting overseas.</p><p>Also in Canada, Aspire Food Group is one of the biggest insect farming organisations in the world, or as Ms Pownall called it, \"the Amazon warehouse\" of cricket farms.</p><p>Launched in 2022, the company operates a $110m facility which is fully automated and uses artificial intelligence and advanced manufacturing techniques.</p><p>Ms Pownall said Canada was the chosen location for Aspire Food Group's production due to an investment of $35m from the
