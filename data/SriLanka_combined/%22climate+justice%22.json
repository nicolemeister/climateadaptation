The ruling outlined multiple decisions regarding state responsibilities and was primarily based on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement, with additional reference to customary international law.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Court's opinion reflected the differentiated obligations of developed and developing countries under the UNFCCC. It also affirmed that the human right to a clean, healthy, and sustainable environment is essential to the enjoyment of other human rights, a point highlighted by Sri Lanka's Attorney General Parinda Ranasinghe during his presentation before the bench.</p><p>Significantly, the Court noted that once a state is established, the disappearance of one of its constituent elements does not necessarily entail the loss of statehood. This finding is especially relevant for small island states facing threats to territorial integrity due to sea level rise.</p><p>Sri Lanka was among 123 countries that co-sponsored the resolution that led to the ICJ hearing and one of 96 nations that made oral submissions in The Hague. Sri Lanka's legal team included Attorney General Parinda Ranasinghe, Deputy Solicitor General Dr. Avanti Perera, and State Counsel Vishni Ganepola and Prabhashanee Jayasekera, along with two other AG's Department officials who contributed with their research.</p><p>'We are quite pleased with the decision of the ICJ. This is the outcome we, along with like-minded nations, were hoping for. My officers put in a lot of hard work into the preparation of Sri Lanka's submission,' said Attorney General Ranasinghe.</p><p>Sri Lanka's laws and policies must now align with the ICJ's opinion, he said, adding that the Foreign Affairs Ministry should identify the appropriate line ministry to initiate consultations for legal and policy reform, including a climate change law and a dedicated unit within the relevant ministry. The Attorney General's Department will provide the necessary legal support to help Sri Lanka comply with its international obligations on climate change.</p><p>Environmental law expert Dr. Lalanath de Silva noted that although the ICJ opinion was advisory and therefore not binding, it established the legal reasoning the Court would apply if a case were brought before it. He emphasised that the judgment would heavily influence Sri Lanka's judiciary in shaping environmental and climate-related jurisprudence, pointing to the X-Press Pearl ruling as a precedent where principles like 'polluter pays' were reinforced.</p><p>Dr. de Silva said the judgment increased the responsibility of developed nations to take more aggressive steps in reducing emissions. Violations could constitute internationally wrongful acts, opening the door to legal consequences, including suits before the ICJ. He noted Sri Lanka could consider seeking compensation or restoration for climate-related damage, though such a move would need to account for political and geopolitical implications.</p><p>The expert also stressed that Sri Lanka's Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) must be progressively strengthened over time, as regression could also trigger legal consequences.

Sunstein was the co-author, with the Nobel laureate economist Richard Thaler, of Nudge, a widely acclaimed bestseller showing that small changes in how choices are put to people increase the likelihood that they will make healthy, prudent, or socially beneficial choices.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Under Sunstein's leadership, OIRA sought to change government regulations in ways that would acknowledge the reality of global warming and seek to minimise the harm it would cause. To make these changes consistent across the government, it was essential to assess policies affecting greenhouse-gas (GHG) emissions - for example, closing coal-fired power stations, or subsidising electric cars - on the basis of an agreed price for a tonne of carbon. Only then could the social cost of GHG emissions be reflected in assessments of the costs and benefits of regulations.</p><p>Once a price is put on carbon, other emissions that contribute to climate change, like methane, can be priced in terms of their equivalent impact. That is why Sunstein has called the price of carbon 'the most important number you have never heard of.'</p><p>Before Obama came to the White House, no US government had ever tried to put a price on carbon. To determine what that price should be is no easy task. It requires complex estimates of the effect of GHG emissions on average temperatures, extreme weather events, changes in rainfall patterns, rising sea levels, and many other factors on which the livability of our planet depends. When that is done, one needs to put a price on the impact of these changes on the well-being of those whose interests the US was willing to consider.</p><p>The first of these tasks, estimating the physical effects of GHG emissions, was for scientists, who had models for calculating the answers. The second task, determining the impact of these effects on well-being, is not only a matter of economic calculation. It also raised a crucial ethical question: is the US willing to consider the well-being of those who live outside its borders, and of those yet to be born?</p><p>The Obama administration priced a tonne of carbon at $42. That was cut to $5 during President Donald Trump's first term, and under Joe Biden, it jumped to $190. One can debate what the price should be, but it cannot be seriously questioned that CO2 emissions do have a cost, even if we consider only the costs to US residents. Unless the US sets that price centrally, policies issued by different departments and agencies will lack coherence, incurring unnecessary expense in reducing emissions which could have been reduced more cheaply by policies issued by a different department.</p><p>Notwithstanding the facts and logic behind putting a price on carbon, last month Jeffrey B. Clark, the acting administrator of OIRA, issued a memo stating: '[I]t is no longer federal government policy to maintain a uniform estimate of the monetised impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.' Clark's memo referred to 'supposed changes in the climate,' as if there were still doubts about whether the climate is changing, and also to doubts about whether human GHG emissions are contributing to those changes.</p><p>Even if it is still possible to harbour doubts about the role of human emissions in global warming, to act on those doubts is to ignore the views of the vast majority of climate scientists, as expressed in the thoroughly referenced reports of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Clark and the president he serves are gambling with the future of our planet.</p><p>After Sunstein left his position in the Obama administration, he continued to think about the ethical questions raised by climate change. His thoughts on that topic have now been published in Climate Justice: What Rich Nations Owe the World - and the Future. (Sunstein has compared the timing - three weeks after Trump's second inauguration - to publishing a book about folk music the week after Bob Dylan went electric.)</p><p>On the key question of whose interests the US should consider when calculating the cost of carbon, Sunstein defends the view that he says is in accordance with both the utilitarianism of John Stuart Mill and the golden rule of Jesus of Nazareth: The US should set a carbon price that reflects, as closely as possible, the net costs emissions impose on everyone they affect or will affect, now and in the future. In addition, Sunstein writes, justice requires wealthy countries to compensate the poor for the damage that climate change causes them.</p><p>In addition to those moral claims, however, Sunstein insists that it is in our own strategic interests to care for others: 'If the world is to solve the climate problem, each country needs to consider the interests of people who live in other countries.'</p><p>I believe Sunstein's moral arguments are completely sound. Yet to seek to implement them fully and immediately would, in many affluent countries, open a path to power for populist politicians who deny either the science or the moral arguments. Until that changes, it may be sound strategy for politicians to make the case for reducing emissions on the basis of the damage that climate change is already doing to their citizens, and the more severe damage it is likely to bring in the future.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Clark, the acting administrator of OIRA, issued a memo stating: '[I]t is no longer federal government policy to maintain a uniform estimate of the monetised impacts of greenhouse gas emissions.

There, Sri Lanka must join other nations and seize the platform to expose the structural injustices of the global economic system and press for transformative solutions to the crises driving today's instability.</p><p>This summit represents a critical chance to push for fairer global financial rules - rules that tackle inequality, extreme wealth concentration, and the climate emergency that threatens our collective future.</p><p>However, the recent negotiations leading up to Seville have been discouraging. Both the European Union and the United States have resisted substantive reforms, opposing more democratic global economic governance. Instead of supporting inclusive proposals, they continue to promote narrow initiatives, which fall far short of addressing the scale of the challenges we face (EU Observer, June 2025).</p><p>Campaign groups such as Eurodad are urging the European Union to support an agreement at FfD4 for launching an intergovernmental process to establish a UN Framework Convention on Sovereign Debt.</p><p>Sri Lanka's current IMF-led debt restructuring agreements fall short of delivering a meaningful reduction in the country's debt burden, heightening the risk of a second default. The current bi-lateral and private bondholder debt restructuring agreements do not provide a viable, long-term solution aligned with Sri Lanka's development goals or the 2030 United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). In the meantime, Sri Lanka loses billions of dollars annually through illicit financial flows facilitated by the broken global financial architecture.</p><p>The current system marginalises the poorest, traps nations in unsustainable debt, and enables the ultra-wealthy to plunder resources while consolidating control. Sri Lanka must support three critical pillars in the FfD negotiations:</p><p>1. Debt justice</p><p>We are in the midst of the worst global debt crisis on record. According to the UN, 3.3 billion people live in countries that spend more on interest payments than on health or education. Despite its shortcomings, the UN remains the only global body where all countries have equal representation-and therefore the only venue where debtor interests can be prioritised over creditor dominance.</p><p>Sri Lanka should align with other Global South nations to support UN-led reforms to resolve sovereign debt crises. Alternatives such as the IMF and the G20 have proven inadequate, slow, and biased in favour of wealthy creditors.</p><p>2. Equitable access to finance</p><p>Access to fair finance has dried up, especially for countries reliant on the now weaponised global reserve currency for dollar-based finance. Amid global aid cuts and rising military spending, development funding is shrinking-undermining real security, which is rooted in diplomacy, democracy, and sustainability.</p><p>Wealthy nations continue to fall short of the long-standing 0.7% GNI commitment to aid, with little accountability. This underscores the need for a UN convention on international aid, where all countries can participate equally in rule-making-unlike in the OECD, where wealthy nations set the terms.</p><p>3. Global tax justice</p><p>Rampant tax abuse by multinationals and the ultra-rich drains hundreds of billions from the Global South. As the world approaches its first trillionaires, public resources are being hollowed out by corporate tax havens and avoidance schemes.</p><p>Sri Lanka must actively support the UN-led Global Tax Convention, now under development, to curb these injustices and reclaim revenue for public investment.</p><p>Fighting for these reforms is not only morally imperative-it serves Sri Lanka's long-term national interest.

My article, which appeared in this newspaper on 28 May, titled Climate Week at ICAO: Discord in the Skies discussed how States participating in this event are conceptually, in their history and approaches to pollution of the air by industrial emissions, including aviation, are on disparate paths. The discussion below touches on a possible approach to conventional wisdom that has permeated aviation and climate change through carbon offsetting and reduction.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A New Twist?</p><p>In the rarified realm of civil aviation governance, where the din of jet engines often drowns out the subtler sounds of environmental deliberation, ICAO's latest initiative to convene a dialogue on climate change-specifically regarding the implementation of the Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA)-is timely, if not overdue. The stakes are no longer confined to the insulated lexicon of emissions units or compliance cycles. What beckons now is a philosophical reorientation of the global aviation sector's epistemic assumptions. It is in this context that the present discussion may be invigorated by the dialectical perspectives of Kohei Saito's 'Slow Down' and George Monbiot's 'Heat,' both of which challenge the doctrinal underpinnings of technocratic optimism and growth-centric mitigation.</p><p>Saito's treatise, drawn from the intellectual marrow of Marxist ecology, stands as a lucid indictment of capitalist accelerationism. In his framing, growth is not merely a quantitative index of prosperity but a metaphysical delusion-an echo of Enlightenment hubris that obscures the planetary limits of extraction and expansion. Saito's 'degrowth communism' enjoins us to recalibrate our normative assumptions about value, consumption, and technological salvation. Monbiot, in 'Heat,' confronts the same malaise from a pragmatic, systems-oriented perspective, unmasking the subterfuge of 'business-as-usual' solutions and carbon offsetting regimes. In their confluence, these two works present a sobering mirror to the ICAO delegates: to proceed without epistemic humility would be to chart a course toward climatic irreversibility.</p><p>CORSIA, heralded by ICAO as a historic market-based measure to mitigate international aviation's carbon footprint, is predicated on a transactional architecture of offsets and reductions. Designed to complement a basket of measures-including technological innovation, sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), and operational improvements-CORSIA seeks to stabilize CO2 emissions at 2020 levels through a phased implementation framework. Yet, what is conspicuously absent from its structure is a moral reckoning with the structural inequities and ecological myopia of offsetting itself. Saito would argue, with unimpeachable clarity, that such mechanisms serve to externalize ecological costs while preserving the core dynamics of accumulation and flight-based privilege.</p><p>Indeed, it is one thing to record compliance and another to question the ideological substratum that necessitates such compliance in the first place. What is the telos of ICAO's climate mandate? Is it to enable the aviation industry to continue its expansion unfettered by environmental constraints, or is it to forge a civilizational shift toward ecological stewardship? In Monbiot's language, the fetish of 'efficiency' becomes the opiate of policymakers, delivering incremental gains while occluding the structural transformations required. Efficiency does not negate excess; it merely renders it momentarily tolerable.</p><p>This event, if it is to rise beyond the theatre of performative diplomacy, must initiate a jurisprudential and existential inquiry into aviation's future. What is the moral calculus of a tonne of CO2 saved in spreadsheets but not in the atmosphere? What justice is served when wealthy nations offset emissions through reforestation projects in the Global South while continuing to facilitate luxury air travel as a normative right? The delegates must be reminded that offsetting, however scientifically modeled, often veils a fundamental asymmetry: it is not a subtraction of harm but a redistribution of guilt. Saito's call for the abandonment of GDP worship and Monbiot's excoriation of technofixes converge in this regard. The question is not whether aviation can grow sustainably, but whether sustainability necessitates a contraction of aviation itself.</p><p>The empirical data show that aviation contributes approximately 2-3% of global CO2 emissions, a figure modest in aggregate yet monumental in per capita terms. Aviation remains one of the most carbon-intensive modes of transport per unit distance per passenger. Yet, policy discourse within ICAO has long been insulated from this reality by the invocation of aspirational targets-such as carbon-neutral growth and net-zero by 2050-that are rarely accompanied by binding obligations or enforcement mechanisms. Here, the insights of Monbiot ring prophetic: he argues that climate policy has been hijacked by language designed to defer action under the guise of complexity. The Paris Agreement's reliance on nationally determined contributions (NDCs) and ICAO's deference to state voluntarism under CORSIA's structure mirror this tendency.</p><p>The philosophical undertone of 'Slow Down' indicts not just growth, but the epistemology of climate mitigation as currently construed. Saito demands a civilizational de-escalation-a retreat from productionism and technocratic hegemony. How might ICAO engage with such a proposition? It would involve confronting deeply embedded assumptions: that air connectivity is inherently good; that more passengers equate to more prosperity; that decarbonization is a logistical challenge rather than a moral imperative. The assembled delegates must examine the interstitial zone between regulatory ambition and ontological necessity.</p><p>What ICAO Should Do</p><p>It is time for ICAO to go beyond compliance monitoring and assert a stewardship ethos grounded in sufficiency rather than expansion. The implementation of CORSIA must not be the end but the means to a more radical self-examination. Does the scheme reduce real emissions or merely enable their translocation to less scrutinized sectors? Are the offsets real, permanent, and additional? Or are they, as Monbiot charges, 'imaginary commodities,' created not to heal the biosphere but to preserve the illusion of continuity? The compliance mechanisms under CORSIA must be interrogated for their epistemic validity, not just procedural accuracy.</p><p>The challenge lies in ICAO's own constitutional architecture-built on consensus, bounded by sovereignty, and entrenched in the economic interests of its Member States. Delegates would do well to reflect on Saito's insistence that true climate action cannot be negotiated within frameworks that fetishize market efficiency over ecological truth. If the logic of capitalist expansion remains unchallenged, then the technical execution of CORSIA may well become another ritual in regulatory theater-replete with compliance reports, offset registries, and sustainability rhetoric, yet devoid of transformative consequence.</p><p>What Aviation Week Should Accomplish</p><p>What purpose, then, should animate the deliberations of this event? If we accept that aviation cannot continue to expand indefinitely in a carbon-constrained world, then the regulatory community must begin to design for contraction, not just mitigation. This does not entail a Luddite abandonment of progress but a redefinition of what progress entails. Is it not more noble to reimagine mobility through slower, more localized, and equitable forms of connectivity than to pursue universal flight access at the cost of climatic stability? The emerging discourse on degrowth, far from being an ideological outlier, must be integrated into the regulatory grammar of ICAO deliberations.</p><p>To Monbiot, the present crisis is not a crisis of knowledge but of will. The science is known; the pathways are clear. What is lacking is the political courage to act against entrenched interests. This ICAO event offers an opportunity, perhaps a fleeting one, to break from the inertial politics of accommodation. The delegates must resist the seduction of incrementalism. They must confront the possibility that CORSIA, in its current form, may be structurally incapable of delivering climate justice unless radically reimagined.</p><p>My Take</p><p>This reimagination must begin with a humble acceptance of planetary boundaries and a renunciation of growth as the organizing principle of aviation development. It must extend to a reconsideration of subsidies, air service agreements, and bilateral regimes that privilege traffic growth over emissions reduction. It must embrace the concept of 'sustainable degrowth' by rewarding those States and operators who choose to fly less, not more; who invest in rail integration rather than airport expansion; who see virtue in stillness, not just speed.</p><p>The deliberative process at this event must be guided by a dual awareness: that the window for meaningful climate action is narrowing, and that the legitimacy of ICAO itself depends on its ability to align with a future that is not only technologically plausible but ethically tenable. To this end, the Secretariat must challenge States to move beyond technical submissions and articulate their vision for a just aviation future. The spirit of consensus must not be allowed to dilute the imperative of truth. Saito's vision of deceleration and Monbiot's insistence on integrity must be summoned into the room not as adversarial critiques but as epistemic allies.</p><p>If the ICAO event is to fulfill its promise, it must transcend its procedural mandates and rise to the level of philosophical reckoning. Compliance, while essential, is insufficient. Offsets, while operationally convenient, are morally fraught. Growth, while seductive, is ecologically untenable. The gathered delegates must summon the courage to slow down-not in the inertia of bureaucracy, but in the discipline of wisdom. They must understand, as Saito and Monbiot both urge, that the climate crisis is not an aberration of the system but a consequence of its logic. To change the outcome, we must change the logic. ICAO stands at the threshold of that possibility. Whether it chooses to step through remains to be seen.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["To Monbiot, the present crisis is not a crisis of knowledge but of will.

The Liberian-flagged MSC ELSA 3, operated by Mediterranean Shipping Company, sank 38 nautical miles off the Kerala coast on May 25, 2025 with over 640 containers on board.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Some containers carried only cotton or glassware. But others? Hazardous substances. One of them was calcium carbide, a compound that reacts explosively with water. And inside the ship's tanks were over 450 tonnes of fuel oil and diesel.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">When the vessel sank, it released not just oil and cargo, but a wave of truth that can no longer be ignored.</p><p>The Vizhinjam Container Transshipment Port, a flagship project of both the Kerala Government and the Adani Group, has been hailed as India's bold leap into global maritime power. However, that vision is now tarnished by oil spills, public anxiety and the undeniable evidence of ecological misadventure - all within three weeks of its dedication to the nation by Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p><p>The fact that this region is ecologically fragile, climate-vulnerable and oceanographically risky was recognised long ago. Nonetheless, a massive transshipment port was imposed on its shores. And now, with this first disaster, the warnings of scientists, fishers and environmentalists have come ashore, both literally and metaphorically.</p><p>Eroding shores now grapple with pollution</p><p>Vizhinjam Port was hard-sold as India's answer to Colombo and Singapore: a deep-sea port just 10 nautical miles from international shipping lanes, requiring no dredging due to its natural depth. With a projected capacity of 5 million TEUs and an investment of over Rs 18,000 crore, it was marketed as a strategic and economic masterstroke.</p><p>However, long before construction began, experts had called the site 'an erosion-prone zone that violates the basic tenets of sustainable coastal development.'</p><p>Dr KV Thomas, former scientist at the National Centre for Earth Science Studies, described it as 'an irresponsibly sited project' on a stretch of coastline that has experienced some of the worst erosion in the country.</p><p>Between 2016 and 2022, beaches north of the port, Shanghumukham, Valiyathura and Cheriyathura, began disappearing. In 2019 alone, over 170 families were displaced by sea incursion, many of them fisherfolk with nowhere to go.</p><p>This was not just an environmental tragedy but a textbook case of governance failure. Despite clear Coastal Regulation Zone (CRZ) rules and scientific evidence, both the Kerala Government and the Adani Group proceeded, dismissing any opposition as anti-development.</p><p>The Environmental Impact Assessment, conducted over a decade ago, grossly underestimated the region's wave action and ignored concerns about coral reef destruction, declining fish catch and coastal erosion. It even failed to model worst-case oil spill scenarios - an omission that now appears negligent.</p><p>But the concerns don't stop there: The containers aboard MSC ELSA 3 included 13 hazardous cargo units and over 250 tonnes of calcium carbide.</p><p>For the uninitiated: Calcium carbide reacts violently with water, producing acetylene gas, which is highly flammable. Fortunately, no explosion occurred, but the threat was real. In addition, the ship's diesel and heavy furnace oil began leaking, resulting in a visible oil slick nearly 4 kilometres wide. Aerial images from the Indian Coast Guard showed floating containers scattered at sea, with some beached near Kollam, Alappuzha and even Thiruvananthapuram.</p><p>By the third day, over 30 containers had washed ashore, damaging seawalls and threatening homes. Residents were evacuated from some areas and authorities issued warnings not to touch the containers. Fisherfolk were advised to avoid beaches and not to fish in the affected waters.</p><p>Thiruvananthapuram's shores are now also facing alarming plastic pellet pollution from ruptured containers spilling raw plastic feedstock into the surf. Fisherfolk and citizens' groups have called for volunteers to join the cleanup before it contaminates marine life. Meanwhile, the Kerala State Pollution Control Board appears to have dismissed these concerns, stating the pellets are non-toxic.</p><p>Here lies a cruel irony: World Environment Day 2025, less than two weeks away, is themed 'Ending Plastic Pollution'. On the Kerala coast, plastics are not just a theme. They are a choking reality.</p><p>Fishers saw this coming</p><p>Thiruvananthapuram's fisherfolk have not been passive observers. They have been the most active - and yet ignored - stakeholders. A decade ago, during public hearings for the port, community elders asked a prophetic question: 'What if a ship sinks? Who will save us?'</p><p>That fear is now reality. The coast will be off-limits to small-scale fishers for days - many already reeling from declining catch due to sea warming and sediment shifts. Their nets, boats and beaches are now potentially contaminated. Many fear their catch will become unsellable - either due to pollution or public perception.</p><p>In 2022, after hundreds were displaced by erosion and fish catch plummeted, fishers launched a 140-day protest in the capital. Led by the Latin Catholic Archdiocese, they demanded compensation, erosion control and recognition of their right to live and fish. The state's response? Denial, criminalisation and vague promises.</p><p>Now, the same government faces a credibility crisis it can no longer deflect.</p><p>Climate signals ignored</p><p>This was never just about local ecosystems or fisher livelihoods. It was also about global climatic shifts that have made the Arabian Sea more volatile than ever.</p><p>According to Indian climate scientist Roxy Mathew Koll, the Arabian Sea has warmed by over 1.2 degrees Celsius, resulting in more intense cyclones and erratic wave patterns. Cyclone Ockhi in 2017, which took the lives of 270 fishermen, served as a brutal reminder of what cyclones in the Arabian Sea can inflict. It also damaged the partially built port and delayed construction. Yet, no attempt was made to re-evaluate the project's risk.</p><p>So, what we're seeing now isn't just another incident of bad luck-it's the outcome of a poorly planned, poorly located, poorly executed project in a deteriorating climate.</p><p>With rising sea levels, heavier monsoons and a growing risk of freak waves, ports like Vizhinjam must be evaluated for their vulnerability, not just their potential. The Vizhinjam Port project is nothing but an ambitious trophy scheme, with little consideration for local geography, changing climate conditions, or even economic rationale.</p><p>The accountability gap</p><p>So who takes responsibility?</p><p>The Adani Group, which operates the port, has remained mostly silent. Its grand declaration of building a 'green port' seems hollow in the face of this toxic spill. The company's previous denials about erosion and its impact on the community now resemble corporate gaslighting.</p><p>The Kerala Government, particularly Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijayan, has hailed the port as a state-level achievement, specifically, his government's. However, his refusal to pause construction during public protests, his failure to learn from Ockhi-like disasters and his administration's failure to update climate risk assessments must be called into question.</p><p>Yes, it is true that the container ship was not directly under state control. But it had just departed Vizhinjam Port before capsizing and sinking in Kerala's waters. Was it permitted to sail despite turbulent sea conditions and risky weather? Port authorities are responsible for shipping safety, weather alerts and emergency response. When a disaster happens this close to port limits, it reflects on the port and reveals a deeper vulnerability along our coasts.</p><p>Let us also not forget the bureaucracy that granted environmental clearance, ignoring multiple scientific submissions warning of erosion, wave impact and ecological fragility.</p><p>What must now be done</p><p>Kerala cannot afford to dismiss this as just another shipping accident. Nor should the government or the Adani Group be allowed to, because the consequences are unfolding not only at sea, but in people's lives. It's time to stop pretending that infrastructure can be imposed on nature without consequence.</p><p>Kerala is already a climate hotspot. Its coasts are eroding. Its monsoons are unpredictable. Its fish stocks are collapsing. In this context, Vizhinjam Port is not just a misfit - it is a monument to misplaced priorities.</p><p>We must urgently demand a judicial inquiry into the spill and its impact, along with a full-scale environmental and toxicological cleanup led transparently by independent scientists-not just the Coast Guard, fisherfolk, or corporate agencies. A time-bound compensation package must be ensured for fisherfolk, covering days lost at sea, polluted nets and equipment, and the loss of market trust that threatens Kerala's seafood reputation. </p><p>Free medical screening and long-term health surveillance should be provided to all affected coastal communities to monitor for chemical exposure or spill-related illnesses.

Does this signal a new Cold War dynamic, and how should the Global South strategically respond?</p><p>A: The world system has always been polarised, mainly between its core and periphery. Since the fall of apartheid and the Berlin Wall, there has been a semblance of unipolarity imposed by the pre-eminence of the Western Bloc dominated by the Triad under the leadership of the United States, and a headlong rush into neo-liberalism. We have witnessed a dispersal of national itineraries, the economic disengagement of States, and the alignment of economies with globalisation. Globalisation has enabled the more dynamic economies of the global South to participate differently in the international division of labour.</p><p>The response of the countries at the centre of the world has been to focus on geopolitics at a time when they are losing their ascendancy in the world economy. However, there is a big difference between 'multi-polar', which is characterised by juxtaposition or coexistence, and 'pluri-polar', which is characterised by pro-activity where the different components interact and can both compete and complement each other to achieve a common goal.</p><p>We favour pluri-polarity, with a preferential emphasis on the global Southern tri-continent. All the people and nations that have suffered colonisation and continue to suffer its after-effects must learn to work together to emerge from their condition - whether through South-South cooperation at all levels, bilateral, multilateral, or simply as citizens.</p><p>Q: BRICS has expanded and is often viewed as an alternative pole of power. But is BRICS truly representative of Global South interests, or is it becoming another elite club?</p><p>A: The advent and progress of the BRICS is likely to revolutionise South-South Cooperation as well as our living conditions and perhaps revise the architecture of international regulation, if the South is united and its peoples ensure that the elites of the countries leading this grouping do not reinvigorate capitalism. The Non-Aligned Movement led to the advent of the Group of 77 in a truncated system of multilateralism and disappointing international cooperation, failing to honour its commitment to 0.7 percent ODA under the leadership of the OECD and the triad (United States, Europe, Japan).</p><p>The latter responded to pressure from the South with the G3, the G5, the G7, the G8 and, by co-opting a few so-called emerging countries, the G20. The G20 is attempting to regulate the international order without having the authority to do so. The advent of the BRICS should not reinvigorate imperialism, and even less should it constitute a sub-imperialism through the selfish interests of its members and its expansion to other countries.</p><p>Q: What structures or mechanisms are necessary for a genuine Global South alliance to function beyond trade, to include solidarity, people-to-people diplomacy, and justice?</p><p>A: The 22nd session of the High-level Committee on South-South Cooperation convened from May 27-30, 2025 to review progress made in implementing the Buenos Aires Plan.

It is up to us, at this exceptional moment in history when imperialism is being redeployed, to contribute to completing their efforts - building a collective internationalist network of resistance to imperialism, starting by strengthening its axis in the most promising parts of its periphery.</p><p>This is not a time for nostalgia and mere commemoration, but for understanding that the non-aligned must now have the courage to align themselves against imperialism and reinvent a trans-internationalism of peoples.</p><p>If the latter accepts the leadership of the industrial champions of the Global South, it rejects their sub-imperialist temptations and reaches out to the peoples of the Core countries to fight barbarism.</p><p>I propose trans-internationalism starting from the Global South first, so that once it has crystallised, and without sub-imperialism, it can irradiate the peoples of the North, whose interests are not so opposed to ours, confronted as they are with the rigours of their uniformising economic, cultural, educational and political standards and systems. Universality will only exist when other homeomorphic and endogenous equivalents have irrigated it, and when hegemony fades through fertile and reciprocal acculturation.</p><p>Q: You've spoken often of economic neocolonialism. How would you assess the current debt crisis in Africa and the Global South, particularly in light of the IMF and World Bank policies?</p><p>A: Over these past few decades, national sovereign spaces have been considerably destabilsed by arbitrary, unjust practices and the authority of big financial institutions, whether public or private. These policies have hampered States and the development of their people, even if they have encouraged the dynamism of certain private sectors. Their tragic consequences include increased poverty and environmental degradation. They have fuelled division and war, and their war mongers are even contemplating a global world war, or at least big regional wars.</p><p>This is the choice implemented by the senile troika to reproduce their world order that is globally rejected by the wide majority of the world population. The negative socio-political and ecological consequences of these measures will take decades to stamp out in our countries. These conditionalities and the regulatory mechanisms that exist globally, whether multilateral or otherwise, to protect the commons, have become archaic or inoperable.</p><p>Debt is, therefore, the continuation of blackmail and a trap that perpetuates our dependence, favours one mode of development, and prevents us from considering other possible horizons.</p><p>Q: Can you comment on the role of odious debt in maintaining colonial economic structures in Africa, and what ethical frameworks should guide debt cancellation or restructuring?</p><p>A: As our comrades at the CADTM have said, for a debt to be considered odious in the sense of its creator, Alexander Sack, it must meet these two conditions:</p><p>1) It must have been contracted against the interests of the Nation, or against the interests of the People, or against the interests of the State.</p><p>2) The creditors cannot show that they could not have known that the debt had been contracted against the interests of the Nation.</p><p>Our countries have often gone into debt under these conditions, and these amounts must be recognised as null and void and cancelled. We add to this that reparations for the exploitation of slavery and colonisation and their afflictions must also be calculated. At this point, you can see that in addition to the cancellation, there are impressive sums that could help development. Of course, imperialism refuses all this, and our countries should unite more in facing up to and obtaining these reparations together.</p><p>Q: What lessons can the broader Global South, including nations like Sri Lanka, learn from Africa's resistance movements and its experience with colonialism, liberation, and now debt?</p><p>A: I believe that as victims, we both need to learn with humility from our resilience and our failures and victories against capitalist financialisation. It is important to build on the historical struggles that have been fought and to more boldly work with others to translate the genuine credentials of our people. More broadly, a global anti-imperialist front on the debt issue, with Latin America too. This new horizon involves a convergence of the diversity of efforts that are now under way against a global financial war and to save the common good of humanity, which can serve as our ground for unity.</p><p>Within this framework, 'where the market has its place, but not all the place, the economy and finance must be put at the service of a project for society and not be subjected unilaterally to the demands of an uncontrolled deployment of the initiatives of dominant capital which favours the particular interests of a tiny minority'. So we need to build an anti-comprador coalition and the development of a concerted leadership that supports the content of a Universal Declaration for the Common Good of Humanity. The development of a tri-continental internationalist political platform of convergence against the debt trap is still possible.</p><p>A first goal should be to feed mankind and ensure basic needs, not to make sure that accumulation, or market profit, have to be number one. It is incredible to have a huge quantity of food waste in an era of abundance and plenty, where so many suffer from hunger:</p><p>Q: You've spoken about \"sovereign development.\" What would that look like for Africa today, and how can it serve as a model for others in the Global South?</p><p>A: Development thus appears as a matrix of Eurocentrism, as a Western belief, says Rist, the very symbol of modernity and coloniality, a paradoxical instrument of continuity and rupture. It is the imperative that transcends all existing traditions, reshaping the world to its requirements. Development ignores physical barriers and borders, and needs a framework in which to flourish.</p><p>We, the people who were not founded based on accumulation, profit, and the ownership of nature and people, and who have instead been the victims, should articulate a different conception of development. I call it dynamic balance. It does not master nature, but places human beings in symbiosis with it. It advocates equality between men and women and between human beings who are united and concerned about sustainable production and consumption.</p><p>Some countries, notably those of the ESA in the Sahel, have undertaken to cut their ties with the neo-colonial system that has fostered jihadist cells and comprador forces there, and are trying to nationalise their resources and practices. The initiative comes from military juntas, which find themselves at odds with regional regulatory bodies that are now obsolete. They need to become more democratic and avoid the populist temptation. Elsewhere, people are fighting against the perpetuation of neo-colonial practices. In Southern Africa, the persistence of economic apartheid is holding back social progress.</p><p>In Central Africa, the rapacity of junior multinationals and neighbouring ethical interests is provoking wars of occupation and illegal extraction. The African Union itself suffers from institutional problems and a lack of a continental development project, although the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCTA) and Agenda 2063 fall short of our requirements. In short, I'm not sure we're ahead of the game, but the struggle towards a free federal Africa continues.</p><p>Q: The Bandung Conference was a turning point in Global South solidarity. In today's context of global crises and multi-polar tensions, how can the spirit of Bandung be revived meaningfully?</p><p>A: This year marks the 70th anniversary of Bandung, the 80th anniversary of the United Nations, the 80th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, and the Panafrica in Manchester Conference, but also the centenary of Lumumba, Fanon, and Malcolm X. Humanity is still exposed to the perils they fought against, and it is important to highlight the scale of the geopolitical obstacles and how we can respond.</p><p>November 29 is the International day of solidarity with Palestine, obviously with the genocide of its people we need several days and effort for the international community to focus its attention on the fact that the question of Palestine remains unresolved and that the Palestinian people have yet to attain their inalienable rights as defined by the General Assembly, namely, the right to self-determination without external interference, the right to national independence and sovereignty, and the right to return to their homes and property, from which they have been displaced.</p><p>Everywhere, the struggle to preserve equality or to increase inequality continues. The balance of power is political and, depending on the worldview and the period, gives rise to increasingly sophisticated superstructures to resolve issues of wealth, power, and meaning. The resulting institutions can be immutable for a long time, or they can be brutally overturned, creating new relationships of power and knowledge.</p><p>It is up to us, in this exceptional historic moment of redeployment of imperialism in the 21st century, to help complete the efforts of so many people who have fought for our freedoms and our development. The leaders and forces of resistance in these countries were fighting for decolonisation and against the persistence of neo-colonial rule. Despite their efforts and the fact that it was impossible to remain neutral in the East-West conflict, their position was quite clear in the face of imperialism. Of course, both the East and the West tried, with relative success, to co-opt the participating countries. But virtually all the countries of the South have had difficulty transcending the asymmetry imposed by global polarisation and have remained on the periphery of the world system, with China escaping to a lesser extent.</p><p>They are what is known as the periphery, the Global South, with exceptions such as the former Yugoslavia, which has relived balkanisation and remains in thrall to Western Europe. While the countries of the Global South were non-aligned in the face of bipolarisation, they were, nonetheless, for a lot of them, aligned against imperialism or victims of it. This is the soul of this movement, and it must reinvent an anti-imperialist trans-internationalism for the 21st century with bold connections between grassroots struggles.</p><p>Q: Is non-alignment still a viable or effective strategy today, or must we move towards a more active form of South-South cooperation and resistance?</p><p>A: The global South is inexorably becoming aware of its anti-systemic potential. A new era may start. Bandung II, the new era of the Aligned Movement against imperialism, will be a second decisive step towards affirming democratic and popular sovereignty.</p><p>Here, it will be important to firmly complete the gains of the preceding era and affirm an alignment with Nation-States, popular movements, social groups, political parties, associations, individuals, on the basis of internationalism in this specific condition that marks this transnational era.</p><p>Bandung II will provide a roadmap for a societal project in a polycentric world where popular forces of the South fed up with the North-South monologue are proposing to reorient globalisation towards a development that is truly about balance, social justice, protecting Mother Earth, well-being, proper conduct, and attitude.</p><p>It is important to revive the response and re-engage the Southern front by putting the historic pendulum in the radical sense towards the demands of the Tri-continental and working on the advent of the 5th International, or more broadly, a global anti-imperialist front.</p><p>Q: Sri Lanka's economic collapse exposed the fragility of neoliberal dependency. What can Sri Lanka learn from African struggles for economic self-determination? How should countries such as Sri Lanka position themselves strategically in the Global South to avoid repeating cycles of crisis?</p><p>A: I don't think we have anything to teach Asian countries or Sri Lanka. On the contrary, we should learn from them. Sri Lanka would also benefit from learning from Asian countries that have refused the yoke of the Bretton Woods institutions and whose resilience and initiative are remarkable. We must not have any complexes and use our youth and its enthusiasm to have the audacity to implement the promises that got this Government elected. Sri Lanka can do it, and we will support it.</p><p>Q: Climate justice is increasingly commodified in global policy arenas. How can the Global South reclaim climate narratives to center justice, responsibility, and reparations? How do you see the connection between ecological destruction and the capitalist extractive model in Africa and the Global South? What alternatives do you envision?</p><p>A: We have not been responsible for the way we produce and consume, but rather we have been its victims, even if we have also contributed to the Anthropocene; we are the victims of the Capitalocene. From now on, we need to escape the logic of technological domination and financial profit at all costs.</p><p>We need to rediscover a sense of balance, rediscover the meaning of life, promote biodiversity, promote responsible farming initiatives, encourage low-tech and community utopias, and in all that give more power to women. Building a world based on the recognition of the non-market status of nature, the planet's resources, and agricultural land.</p><p>Q: You emphasize people-centered development and struggle. In an age of top-down global governance, how can grassroots movements reclaim political space?</p><p>A: As we said in Bamako, the world we want sees socialisation as the main product of unbridled democratisation. Within this framework, where the market has its place, but not all the place, the economy and finance must be put at the service of a project for society and not be subjected unilaterally to the demands of an uncontrolled deployment of the initiatives of dominant capital which favours the particular interests of a tiny minority.</p><p>With this in mind, the democratic re-politicisation of our masses and the struggle of our peoples for equality and the right to development are the only viable options.</p><p>Q: What role should popular education and decolonised knowledge play in empowering resistance movements today?</p><p>A: As Paolo Freire showed, we need to revolutionse education in line with the aspirations and needs of our masses. Culture is the vehicle for the change of praxis. The Global South must take back the epistemic initiative and restore the sense to participate in the uninhibited construction and non-Eurocentric reconstitution of knowledge.</p><p>We need to deconstruct the Eurocentrism embedded in our cognitive frames that are deeply enmeshed in our thoughts and practices of knowledge. The prejudices about race and racial myths, and alleged backwardness and incompatibility with civilisation, persist in a coloniality that even today demands a change in our paradigms and power relations. A progressive education will fix that.</p><p>Q: If we are to imagine a truly emancipated Global South in 2050, what would that look like politically, economically, and ecologically?</p><p>A: A project against the modernisation of pauperisation and technocratic depoliticisation, a free, egalitarian, democratic, feminist and solidarity-based project for the construction of a responsible universalist order without oppression for humans and nature alike. This must be done in a respectful, democratic, and united way, in the diversity of our obligations, with the prospect of rebuilding a world labour front conscious of the issue of the commons, the last non-commodified public spaces, and the importance of adopting a Universal Declaration for the common good of humanity.</p><p>The challenge of an anti-systemic response based on the spirit of Bandung should consider the feminist, ecological, and progressive challenge at the heart of any analysis aimed at democratically re-politicising peoples with a view to an upsurge in the defence of peace, of the commons, and an alternative to capitalism. It presupposes a critique of development as a Eurocentric belief and a non-culturalist emphasis on the validation of other functional epistemes to build a universalism of peoples.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

Let us join hands to contribute to the establishment of an equitable and effective global mechanism on climate change, work for global sustainable development at a high level and bring about new international relations featuring win-win cooperation.' ~ Chinese President Xi Jinping</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Aviation leaders will meet again at the 2025 ICAO Aviation Climate Week, from 2 to 4 June 2025 at the International Civil Aviation Organization, under the theme: 'Skyward Action: Realizing Aviation's Sustainable Future.' This is not to say these events are not important or that they are lacking in enthusiasm and purpose. It's just that whenever such events occur, particularly in the context of aviation and climate change under the auspices of ICAO, one has to inquire into the teleological significance of the event. In other words, what is the meaning and purpose of such a gathering, and what will be the outcome of the deliberations therein?</p><p>The forthcoming three-day ICAO Aviation Climate Week, to be held at ICAO Headquarters, manifests yet another significant attempt by the Organization to unify its Member States and industry stakeholders around a pressing and inescapable reality: climate change and its profound impact on international civil aviation. This initiative emerges not in isolation but as part of a continuous institutional effort to translate aspirational goals, such as the Long-Term Aspirational Goal (LTAG) of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, into tangible policy instruments, actionable strategies, and cooperative mechanisms.</p><p>It must be emphasized that the value of this event, ostensibly couched in technical discussions, programmatic evaluations, and exhibition opportunities, lies not merely in the sharing of information but in its potential to deepen epistemic engagement among stakeholders. The convergence of governmental, intergovernmental, and industry actors creates an agora for epistemological reinforcement of sustainability in civil aviation. This is especially critical given the evolving nature of international aviation governance, which is now increasingly beholden not only to safety and security concerns but to environmental imperatives.</p><p>Disparate Approaches</p><p>In embarking upon an assessment of how climate change is viewed across various geopolitical regions-and in particular, how aviation is understood within the context of this existential threat-it becomes necessary to situate the discussion not only within the disparate economic realities and ideological foundations of various regions, but also against the backdrop of historically rooted doctrines of responsibility, sovereignty, and technological ambition. The global discourse on climate change is no longer a matter of scientific consensus-indeed, that threshold has long been crossed. What remains contested, and indeed politicized, is the calculus of accountability, capability, and will. Amid this turbulent discourse stands the aviation industry-both commercial and military-as a convenient scapegoat, a strategic enabler, and a reluctant reformist.</p><p>The United States</p><p>The United States presents a complex yet instructive paradigm. Oscillating between climate ambition and industrial pragmatism, American policy demonstrates a kind of environmental schizophrenia. On the one hand, successive administrations-particularly under Democratic leadership-have pledged adherence to global climate instruments such as the Paris Agreement. On the other hand, the United States continues to subsidize fossil fuel industries and demonstrates a marked reticence in curtailing the growth of its aviation sector, citing economic imperatives and national security interests. This paradox is not accidental. It is rooted in the American doctrine of exceptionalism, which positions the U.S. not merely as a participant in global governance, but as a principal architect of its direction. Aviation, viewed through this lens, is not merely a mode of transport; it is an instrument of economic dominance, military readiness, and technological prowess. The discourse on climate change in the U.S., therefore, bifurcates into two streams: the first, driven by civil society and progressive sectors, which demands accountability and rapid decarbonization of aviation; and the second, driven by industry and security lobbies, which seek incrementalism tempered by innovation promises such as sustainable aviation fuels (SAFs), hydrogen propulsion, and electrification-without an honest reckoning of carbon offsets' limitations.</p><p>Russia</p><p>Russia, by contrast, presents an orthogonal viewpoint. Underpinned by a resource-based economy heavily reliant on oil and gas exports, the Russian Federation has historically maintained a posture of skepticism towards global climate agendas. Climate change is often interpreted not as a planetary threat but as a geopolitical instrument wielded by Western powers to curtail Russian economic influence. In this context, aviation is perceived less as a climate liability and more as a symbol of national sovereignty and logistical self-sufficiency, particularly in its vast and sparsely connected hinterlands. While Russia has nominally committed to climate goals, including net-zero by 2060, such commitments are frequently accompanied by caveats and ambiguity. In Russian strategic thinking, the rhetoric of climate mitigation is subordinated to the imperatives of realpolitik. Technological upgrades in aviation-if undertaken-are motivated more by cost-efficiency and military competitiveness than by environmental concern.</p><p>China</p><p>China's engagement with climate change is at once pragmatic, ambitious, and opaque. As the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases and simultaneously the largest investor in renewable energy, China embodies the contradictions of the Global South's developmental aspirations and the Global North's climate expectations. The Chinese Communist Party's climate discourse is embedded within the broader rubric of 'ecological civilization,' a political narrative that seeks to align environmental stewardship with socialist modernization. Within this framework, aviation is a double-edged sword: on one hand, it is essential for connecting the vast Chinese interior with its coastal metropolises and for projecting soft power through initiatives like the Belt and Road Initiative; on the other, it is a sector that invites international scrutiny for its carbon intensity. Beijing's response has been to invest in domestic aircraft manufacturing, such as the COMAC C919, with the implicit goal of achieving not only aviation sovereignty but also environmental competitiveness. That said, China's climate commitments-including carbon neutrality by 2060-appear contingent upon technological feasibility rather than regulatory constraint. Aviation is unlikely to be aggressively curtailed; rather, it will be subject to a developmentalist logic that privileges innovation over limitation.</p><p>Europe</p><p>Europe occupies a distinctive moral and legal position in the climate discourse. As the progenitor of the Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and the CORSIA alternative within its regional jurisdiction, the European Union has, more than any other bloc, embedded climate consciousness within its regulatory fabric. The EU views climate change not merely as an environmental issue, but as a juridical obligation. This normative architecture has led to robust measures aimed at internalizing the externalities of aviation emissions, ranging from inclusion in carbon markets to airport slot constraints based on environmental metrics. More significantly, European jurisprudence increasingly recognizes the rights of future generations and the principle of intergenerational equity, giving climate litigants substantial leverage. Nevertheless, Europe's approach is not without contradictions. The single aviation market remains a cornerstone of EU economic integration, and the post-pandemic recovery strategy is heavily dependent on aviation connectivity. Thus, while Europe positions itself as a climate vanguard, it must navigate the competing imperatives of economic cohesion and environmental stewardship. The doctrine of 'green growth' undergirds its aviation policy-a doctrine whose efficacy remains debated among scholars and civil society.</p><p>South Asia</p><p>In South Asia, the narrative is one of climate vulnerability and developmental urgency. Countries like India, Bangladesh, and Pakistan view climate change through the prism of adaptation and climate justice rather than mitigation. These states argue-with some merit-that they are victims rather than culprits in the global carbon equation. Aviation, though growing, is still a nascent sector in much of South Asia, serving more as a symbol of upward mobility and economic aspiration than as a climate concern. India, for instance, has undertaken modest efforts to green its aviation sector, including mandates on fuel efficiency and airport carbon accreditation. However, the political salience of aviation emissions remains low compared to the more immediate challenges of energy access, water scarcity, and urban pollution. There exists, therefore, a structural disjunction between international expectations and domestic priorities. South Asian states tend to resist binding commitments on aviation emissions in multilateral fora, invoking the principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR). In such a landscape, aviation is viewed more as a developmental enabler than as an ecological burden.</p><p>East Asia</p><p>East Asia presents a more differentiated canvas. Japan, South Korea, and Taiwan exhibit high levels of technological sophistication and are among the few countries to have operational roadmaps for carbon-neutral aviation. These nations adopt a technocratic approach to climate change, relying on innovations such as electric aircraft prototypes, fuel cell research, and digital air traffic management systems to offset environmental impact. There exists a cultural premium on efficiency, precision, and discipline-all of which influence their aviation climate strategies. Yet, even within East Asia, policy coherence is not absolute. Japan's reliance on international carbon offsets and South Korea's gradualism reveal the enduring tension between ambition and feasibility. Aviation, while central to their export-oriented economies, is increasingly framed within a sustainability narrative, albeit with varying degrees of urgency and enforceability.</p><p>The Middle East</p><p>The Middle East poses another layer of complexity. With some of the world's most prolific carriers-Emirates, Qatar Airways, and Etihad-the Gulf States in particular have used aviation as a tool of economic diversification and geopolitical branding. Climate change, though acknowledged, is often refracted through the prism of economic risk rather than planetary duty. The region's participation in global climate frameworks is strategic rather than normative. For oil-rich states, aviation represents both a post-oil future and a continuation of energy hegemony through kerosene-intensive industries. That said, the Gulf carriers have adopted aggressive environmental branding strategies-investing in newer, more fuel-efficient aircraft and participating in CORSIA-though critics argue that such measures amount to greenwashing in the absence of structural reforms. In non-Gulf Middle Eastern states, where aviation infrastructure is less developed, climate change garners attention primarily through its impact on water security and agricultural viability, with aviation occupying a marginal place in the policy hierarchy.</p><p>Australia</p><p>Australia offers yet another variation. As both a developed economy and a continent facing severe climate-induced risks, Australia's climate policy has oscillated between ambition and inertia. The aviation sector, due to the vast distances and low population density, is integral to national connectivity and economic function. Consequently, the political appetite for restrictive aviation measures is low, notwithstanding growing civil society activism. Successive Australian governments have shown limited inclination to impose stringent emissions regulations on airlines, relying instead on voluntary frameworks and industry-led initiatives. However, the private sector, particularly carriers such as Qantas, has taken steps toward decarbonization, including commitments to net-zero emissions and investment in SAFs. Still, the broader national policy landscape remains fragmented, shaped by partisan divides and a powerful mining lobby. In this regard, aviation policy reflects the broader ambivalence of Australia's climate posture: a tension between global responsibility and domestic expediency.</p><p>Africa and South America</p><p>Africa and South America, though geographically distant and culturally diverse, share a common narrative of marginalization in the global climate discourse-a narrative shaped by historical inequities, economic dependency, and the enduring asymmetry of global aviation. Their engagement with climate change, and by extension, aviation's role therein, is informed less by ideological ambition and more by existential necessity. In both continents, the aviation sector is nascent but crucial-a lifeline for remote communities, a vehicle for trade and tourism, and a symbol of integration into the global economy. Yet, these regions have been perennially relegated to the periphery of international regulatory structures, where decisions affecting their futures are often made in absentia.</p><p>In Africa, climate change is an omnipresent reality, manifesting in droughts, desertification, and the disintegration of traditional livelihoods. The continent contributes a mere fraction to global aviation emissions, yet it bears a disproportionate share of the climatic consequences. African states, therefore, approach the aviation-climate nexus with cautious pragmatism. There is an acute recognition that imposing burdensome emission reduction measures on their fledgling aviation sectors would stifle development and further entrench inequality. Consequently, the African position in multilateral fora such as ICAO is one of conditional participation-supporting climate measures like CORSIA insofar as they are voluntary, non-punitive, and accompanied by capacity-building and financial assistance. For many African governments, the priority is not emission mitigation per se, but ensuring that global climate actions do not exacerbate their structural vulnerabilities. Aviation is thus embraced not as a threat, but as a tool for resilience and economic emancipation.</p><p>South America, for its part, navigates the aviation-climate equation through a similarly nuanced but distinct lens. With vast rainforests acting as carbon sinks and indigenous communities living in harmony with nature, the continent is deeply conscious of environmental stewardship. At the same time, the region has witnessed erratic economic trajectories, political instability, and underinvestment in infrastructure-all of which shape its cautious approach to aviation regulation. Brazil, Argentina, Colombia, and others have adopted moderate positions, often aligning with the Global South's principle of Common But Differentiated Responsibilities. They advocate for equitable solutions that recognize their sovereign right to develop and expand air connectivity while also contributing, in principle, to global decarbonization goals. Some states have engaged in carbon offset programs and introduced sustainability targets, yet these are typically framed as aspirational rather than obligatory.</p><p>In both continents, there is an abiding skepticism toward market-based measures that lack transparency or equity, such as arbitrary emissions caps and unilateral taxes on airline operations. These regions resist being penalized for a crisis they did not create and demand instead a reconfiguration of international legal frameworks to reflect historical responsibility and differentiated capability. As such, Africa and South America call for a recalibration of global aviation governance-one that does not merely dictate terms, but listens, understands, and incorporates the legitimate developmental imperatives of the Global South.</p><p>My Take</p><p>The divergent approaches outlined above raise a central juridical and philosophical question: can a fragmented, interest-driven assemblage of national policies produce a coherent and effective global response to the aviation-climate nexus? The ICAO's Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA) was intended as a harmonizing instrument. Yet, its non-binding nature, limited scope, and reliance on carbon offsets have led many to question its sufficiency. The principle of CBDR remains contested, particularly between developed and developing nations, and there is scant consensus on how to equitably allocate the carbon burden of aviation. In effect, the global aviation sector is regulated by a mosaic of national, regional, and industry-led initiatives, none of which possess the legal gravitas to enforce meaningful change across borders.</p><p>What is required is a reimagination of aviation not merely as a vector of commerce or convenience, but as a moral actor within the planetary commons. This reimagination must be rooted in a jurisprudence that transcends state sovereignty and incorporates notions of intergenerational equity, ecological integrity, and distributive justice. Until then, aviation will remain suspended in a paradox-heralded as the engine of globalization and castigated as its ecological Achilles' heel. The divergent national postures on climate change and aviation reflect deeper cleavages in global governance-cleavages that cannot be bridged by technology alone. Law must evolve in tandem with conscience. In the absence of a universal legal will, we are left with the uncomfortable truth that aviation's flight path toward sustainability is still awaiting clearance for takeoff.</p><p>The Climate Week event must therefore be assessed within this continuum. It represents an evolution of ICAO's engagement with climate issues from passive response to active orchestration. Of particular importance is the inclusion of outcomes and recommendations from CAEP/13, which not only legitimizes technical developments but also ensures that policy discussions are anchored in empirical assessment. Similarly, the focus on implementation of CORSIA (Carbon Offsetting and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation) and the Global Framework from the Third Conference on Aviation and Alternative Fuels (CAAF/3) reflects ICAO's recognition that the future of aviation sustainability hinges on more than offsets-it demands structural transformation across fuel systems, airport infrastructure, and operational practices.</p><p>Furthermore, the timing of this event-on the cusp of the 42nd Session of the ICAO Assembly-is not merely convenient, but crucial. In the run-up to the Assembly, State representatives will be required to navigate the challenging terrain between national interest and global responsibility. Climate Week enables pre-Assembly calibration of perspectives, allowing States to voice their positions, forge coalitions, and project influence over the emerging normative order in international aviation environmental law. It is an opportunity to test narratives, share data, and build consensus-or at the very least, mutual comprehension-on divisive issues such as differentiated responsibilities, market-based measures, and fuel transitions.</p><p>The exhibition component, often dismissed as a mere commercial interlude, should not be underestimated. In ICAO's context, the showcasing of technologies and solutions operates as a performative legitimization of environmental aspirations. It translates abstract commitments into visible, tangible modalities. More importantly, it invites scrutiny and comparison, which is the very engine of competitive innovation. The opportunity for industry stakeholders to exhibit products aligned with green airports, SAF production, and climate-resilient infrastructure contributes to what may be described as a semiotic economy of sustainability, where meaning is assigned to progress not only through policy declarations but through material demonstrations.</p><p>Yet, critical reflection demands we ask whether such events, despite their noble intentions and technical rigor, are sufficient in precipitating the transformational change required. The risks are twofold: first, that Climate Week becomes a performative ritual, an echo chamber for the converted; and second, that it will be used as a public relations exercise by actors more interested in optics than in genuine reform. ICAO must therefore ensure that this event is evaluated not merely by the quality of its presentations, but by the quality of its outcomes. Will Member States depart with enhanced commitments? Will there be new partnerships with measurable objectives? Will the event produce a roadmap that is actionable, time-bound, and accountable?</p><p>Therein lies the deeper teleological question: What is the ultimate purpose of Climate Week? If it is to merely 'take stock' and 'share initiatives,' then it risks repeating the inertia of past engagements. But if it becomes a crucible for redefining aviation's existential contract with the planet-a contract long overdue for revision-then it could mark a watershed moment in ICAO's environmental journey.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["Nevertheless, Europe's approach is not without contradictions.

Minister,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We are writing regarding the difficulties faced by civil society organisations (CSOs) in implementing their activities. This is in a context in which successive governments of Sri Lanka have viewed CSOs with suspicion, publicly attributed unproven conspiracies to CSOs while calling for increased control of CSOs that receive foreign funds.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Several CSOs, primarily those operating out of Colombo, are receiving letters from the NGO Secretariat, requiring them to register with the Secretariat under the Voluntary Social Services Organisations Act as they are in receipt of foreign funds. This is despite these organisations already being registered under the Companies Act as a (non-profit) limited by guarantee companies, and therefore subject to the regulation of the Registrar of Companies.</p><p>On 12 December 2024 the NGO Secretariat issued instructions, which not only require them to register with the NGO Secretariat even if they are already registered under other laws, but state that the registration will be approved only if there is clearance from the Ministry of Defence. It does not set out objective criteria on which basis the application will be reviewed by the MOD, nor does it state how the applicant can appeal if their application is rejected. Moreover, the involvement of the military in monitoring and oversight of CSOs is troubling, only increases the militarisation of civilian administration and is a potential threat to the freedom of association.</p><p>In November 2024, the Registrar/Director General of the NGO Secretariat, Sanjeewa Wimalagunarathna, said a law titled NGOs (Registration and Supervision) Act was being drafted to give effect to standards of the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). However, the current practices of the NGO Secretariat are in contravention of FATF standards. For instance, FATF requires governments to undertake risk assessments to ascertain whether non-profit organisations (NPOs) are at risk of terror financing. The State must take action according to the level of risk posed, instead of adopting blanket measures that impact all CSOs, as is currently being undertaken. FATF requires that measures need to be 'focused, proportionate and risk-based measures, without unduly disrupting or discouraging legitimate NPO activities'.</p><p>According to FATF's best practices guide, non-focused, disproportionate and non-risk-based measures include measures that require information on beneficiaries of their projects and the provision of information on all donors or local partners. Other requirements such as financial reporting are required to be proportionate. In contrast, the Government is imposing blanket measures that have led to all CSOs, particularly in the war-affected North and East and those working on accountability issues and with groups such as the families of the disappeared, being deemed a collective threat. As a result, these organisations are routinely visited by the security and intelligence forces and subjected to surveillance and intimidation. Further, they are required to submit details of their project activities, beneficiaries and personal information regarding the employees of the organisation to security agencies.</p><p>Since 2023, FATF requires states to only have 'oversight' of or 'monitor' NPOs instead of 'supervising' them. This is because NPOs are not designated as reporting entities by FATF, i.e. they are not viewed as gatekeepers, such as banks and casinos, that are required to report suspicious transactions to the Financial Intelligence Unit. In fact, FATF states that any measures that are overly burdensome or restrictive contravene Recommendation 8 of FATF, which sets out how NPOs should be dealt with when implementing the FATF standards. According to FATF, many NPOs are low risk, due to the fact they may have adequate internal controls and self-regulatory measures that mitigate such risks, or may already be subject to regulatory controls. In these instances, FATF states 'there may be no need for additional measures.'</p><p>Presently CSOs are being hindered from being able to access their funds, following the circular issued by the Financial Intelligence Unit of Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to all licensed banks in 2019. The circular only requests banks to undertake enhanced due diligence of a CSO that is not registered with the NGO Secretariat if it receives foreign funds. In practice, banks are refusing to credit funds received by CSOs if they are not registered with the NGO Secretariat. Furthermore, banks often refuse to allow CSOs to open bank accounts unless they are registered with the Secretariat.</p><p>The above-mentioned measures have cumulatively created a hostile environment in which CSOs are struggling to operate, which in turn affects the work they do and the communities they serve. It must be pointed out that despite the heightened suspicion with which CSOs are viewed in Sri Lanka and the myriad of measures in place against them, charges have not been brought against a single CSO for financing terrorism or money laundering, to date.</p><p>Not only do the above-mentioned measures encroach upon the fundamental right to assembly and association, but they also worsen the relationship between civil society and the state. These measures undermine the culture of openness, inclusive civic participation and the new era of democratic engagement that the government promised the people in its election campaign.</p><p>In light of these matters, we request the following steps to be taken:</p><p>Rescind the 2019 circular and raise awareness among financial institutions that they are not authorised to prevent CSOs from accessing their funds or open bank accounts.</p><p>Include civil society in a meaningful and inclusive manner when drafting new laws and policies that would affect their operation and activities.</p><p>As required by FATF, conduct an inclusive consultation with CSOs for the risk assessment of NPOs for Sri Lanka's mutual evaluation by FATF in 2026, in line with best practices and via transparent processes that allow CSOs to be equitably included.</p><p>Remove the involvement of the Ministry of Defence in any activities related to the registration or oversight of CSOs.</p><p>CC:</p><p>Hon.

The sheer turnout of people from all walks of life and the participation by a wide range of advocacy groups were a testament to the impact of climate change on every aspect of life: human rights, women's rights, religion, food insecurity, and labor rights.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> For many of these advocacy movements in Seoul, recent crises like COVID-19 have brought home the urgent need to address the climate crisis.Opening with a rally in Namdaemun Plaza at 3 p.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">m., the two-hour march occupied four out of six lanes of Seoul's main Sejong-daero Boulevard.</p><p> Standing on moving flatbed trucks, people spoke about the intersectionality of the climate crisis and other issues, including labor insecurity, housing instability, and social discrimination.table \" \" 0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto   class=\"tr-caption\" An artist performing during the climate justice march in Seoul.</p><p>South Korea [Photo Credit:Action4climatejustice.Kr]Ten megaphone-mounted flatbed trucks placed at regular intervals logistically ushered large crowds of protesters--brightly clad youth in headdresses in sunflower or coral reef shapes, families wrapped in \"Carbon Neutral\" cloak-like banners, Buddhist monks with globe-painted temple lanterns, Catholic nuns wearing \"Save the Earth\" tunics and holding \"Anti-nuclear NOW\" placards, regional community groups demanding a stop to coal plants and new airports, and countless union members in matching vests, flying union banners.</p><p>The groups of protesters regularly chanted in unison: \"lives over profit\" and \"we can't live like this anymore!\" Drumming, music, and dance filled the streets. During a five-minute \"die-in,\" protesters fell to the ground, front to rear, like cascading dominoes.</p><p>The march was the result of three months of planning, promotion, and fundraising by Action for Climate Justice, a coalition of more than 400 civic, regional/community, and trade union movements united under the guiding concept of climate justice.Like previous marches, environmental NGOs played leading roles in the organizing, such as Green Korea United and the Korean Federation for Environmental Movements (KFEM), alongside youth movements.</p><p> But 2022 also saw a large influx of long-established and new movement groups not exclusive to environmental activism but for whom the climate crisis has become central to their agenda--human rights groups, women's groups, social movements, political parties, religious networks, food cooperatives, irregular contract workers, and trade union movements.From the Human Rights Movement Sarangbang, combating the violence of political and economic discrimination and exploitation since 1993, to the recent Human Rights Movement Network Baram working to secure the rights and dignity of discriminated groups, such as women, the disabled, LGBTQ communities, immigrants, and irregular contract workers--the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the climate crisis to the fore of their activities.</p><p>Climate policy has likewise become a pressing issue for the Anti-Poverty Alliance, which emerged during mass layoffs and bankruptcies following the 1997 financial crisis and neoliberalization of the Korean economy. This \"IMF era\" alliance has grown to include 49 member organizations engaged in various struggles for livelihood, from the fight for a universal basic income to alternatives to substandard housing (including polytunnel villages where people live in greenhouse-like shelters made out of vinyl) and housing instability in the face of Korea's speculative housing markets and climate change.</p><p>Religious orders are also a sizable part of the movement now.

The march was the result of three months of planning, promotion, and fundraising by Action for Climate Justice, a coalition of more than 400 civic, regional/community, and trade union movements united under the guiding concept of climate justice. Like previous marches, environmental NGOs played leading roles in the organizing, such as Green Korea United and the Korean Federation for Environmental Movements (KFEM), alongside youth movements. But 2022 also saw a large influx of long-established and new movement groups not exclusive to environmental activism but for whom the climate crisis has become central to their agenda--human rights groups, women's groups, social movements, political parties, religious networks, food cooperatives, irregular contract workers, and trade union movements. From the Human Rights Movement Sarangbang, combating the violence of political and economic discrimination and exploitation since 1993, to the recent Human Rights Movement Network Baram working to secure the rights and dignity of discriminated groups, such as women, the disabled, LGBTQ communities, immigrants, and irregular contract workers--the COVID-19 pandemic has brought the climate crisis to the fore of their activities. Climate policy has likewise become a pressing issue for the Anti-Poverty Alliance, which emerged during mass layoffs and bankruptcies following the 1997 financial crisis and neoliberalization of the Korean economy. This \"IMF era\" alliance has grown to include 49 member organizations engaged in various struggles for livelihood, from the fight for a universal basic income to alternatives to substandard housing (including polytunnel villages where people live in greenhouse-like shelters made out of vinyl) and housing instability in the face of Korea's speculative housing markets and climate change.", "Over the past two years, pandemic restrictions on gatherings and suspension of protest permits in South Korea have brought activism online and into classrooms and have included the unconventional occupation of public spaces.

While the government has set ambitious targets, including a pledge to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 50% by 2030 in its Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), the pathway to achieving these goals remains unclear.</p><p>Experts argue that these commitments are more aspirational than actionable, given the systemic issues plaguing the country's administrative machinery.Corruption, bureaucratic inefficiency, and a disregard for merit have stifled progress.</p><p> Key climate-related initiatives are often outsourced to international consultants, reflecting a lack of domestic capacity. Meanwhile, provincial administrations, which play a critical role in implementation, are notorious for their inefficiency and lack of coordination.</p><p>The absence of sustainable financial resources further complicates matters. Pakistan requires an estimated $200 billion in climate finance, but its share from the Green Climate Fund remains a mere $256 million--insufficient for even the most basic mitigation and adaptation projects.</p><p> The nation's inability to effectively utilize the funds it does receive, due to poor project management and governance, further exacerbates the problem.One of the most glaring examples of governance failure is visible in urban centers like Lahore.</p><p> Once known as the \"City of Gardens,\" Lahore has transformed into a polluted urban sprawl. Hazardous air quality, driven by unchecked construction, deforestation, and vehicle emissions, now defines the city.</p><p> Every winter, smog blankets Lahore, causing severe health issues and disrupting daily life.This crisis is a direct result of unregulated urban expansion and a focus on profit over sustainability.</p><p> Green spaces have been sacrificed for high-rise buildings and housing societies, while industrial emissions remain poorly regulated. Short-term fixes, such as temporary restrictions on vehicles or crop burning, fail to address the root causes of pollution.</p><p>Experts stress the need for comprehensive urban planning that prioritizes environmental sustainability. This includes reintroducing green belts, enforcing emissions standards, and expanding public transportation systems.</p><p> However, without strong governance and accountability, these solutions remain out of reach.On the global stage, Pakistan has put forth its vulnerability to climate change, aligning with the G77 bloc to demand climate justice.</p><p> Yet, its efforts often fall short due to a lack of preparation and technical expertise.

At the local level, initiatives such as afforestation, waste management, and renewable energy projects can have a significant impact.</p><p> At the national level, structural reforms are essential to address corruption, improve governance, and mobilize resources effectively.Public engagement is equally critical.</p><p> Citizens must be educated about the impacts of climate change and empowered to demand accountability from both government and industry. Civil society organizations can play a pivotal role in bridging the gap between policymakers and communities.</p><p>The consequences of inaction are already visible. From displaced families to toxic air, the climate crisis is no longer a distant threat but a present reality.</p><p> If Pakistan fails to act now, the damage could become irreversible, with devastating consequences for its people and environment.The government must prioritize climate action, not as an isolated agenda but as a fundamental component of national development.</p><p> This means investing in sustainable infrastructure, enforcing environmental regulations, and ensuring that climate considerations are integrated into all policy decisions.The time for half-measures has passed.</p><p>Pakistan must rise to the challenge, not only to secure its future but also to set an example for other vulnerable nations.

There is no further elaboration in this message as to who should invest; of what nature that investment should be; or how one should invest.</p><p> But then, we can turn around and say that we have a history of talking about it, from 1992 in Rio with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development to the adoption of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) right down to COP/27 (27th Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC) in Egypt in November 2022. In the process, we have coined some fancy terms  like heat dome; wet-bulb temperature; climate anxiety; climate grief; carbon neutral; net-zero; emissions trading; carbon pricing; carbon offsetting. Aaron Saad, in his book Worlds at Stake: Climate Politics; Ideology and Justice has added to this jumbled maze of terminology the word \"Solastalgia\" which denotes a homesickness we might feel without ever leaving our home, where we lament how comfortable we were before climate change started roasting us with global warming, causing floods, forest fires, unnaturally frequent tornados and the like.</p><p>Now, we are desperately trying to achieve a 1.5% degree world (measured against pre industrialized world levels of warming) without doing anything much about it.</p><p> This is where the celebrated Albert Einstein comes in with his lasting definition of stupidity  doing the same wrong thing and expecting a different result. Post COP/27 responses of the more influential States to what Antonio Gutters, Secretary General of the United Nations called for at COP/27  a global climate pact  amply resonate the Einsteinian definition of stupidity.</p><p> Despite the fancy words of climate conventions and the 1.5% aspirations, what strikes one in this confederacy of pomp and circumstance is the diversity of opinion and approach.</p><p> China and India  two of the biggest users of coal  have given every indication that they intend to keep using coal, let alone reduce their use. Of the big polluters, only Britain and Australia had at the time presented new climate targets.</p><p> The United States and China had not submitted anything, while the European Union was working on a redefinition of the National Voluntary Contributions to reflect the additional cuts that will result from plans against the energy crisis and to release Russia's gas.One of the greatest obstacles to combatting climate change at the global level is the lack of political will which can be put down to the arbitrary and capricious stance adopted by States.</p><p> This feckless insouciance of States to come to a cohesive and coordinated unity in acting as one in the battle against global warming acts as a serious problem. As of September 2022, only 38 countries had filed their National Adaption Plans.</p><p> These plans are calculated to reduce vulnerability to the impacts of climate change, by building adaptive capacity and resilience; facilitate the integration of climate change adaptation, in a coherent manner, into relevant new and existing policies, programmes and activities, in particular development planning processes and strategies, within all relevant sectors and at different levels, as appropriate.COP/27 ended with the retention of the 1.</p><p>5c goal (compared to preindustrial levels) and an agreement on a fund to compensate developing countries for losses and damage caused by the climate crisis. However, the conference failed to agree on concrete steps to wind down the use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Earthday.org which organizes Earth Day gives some ways we as individuals can contribute: plant trees; reduce plastic consumption; participate in advocacy; eschew wasteful fashion trends and generally \"vote Earth\".</p><p> This is certainly a proactive list for citizenry. However, as Aaron Saad says correctly \"These are not solutions to an urgent and worsening moral crisis.</p><p> Real solutions call for a political program of response that has morality as its core and its overriding priority\". The morality Saad speaks of can be linked to climate justice which in turn would at least partially make reparations (to the planet) against a \"climate debt\" owed by the major polluters over the years.</p><p> Saad cites in his book two main factors to consider the moral aspect of climate justice: the major polluters over a sustained period of time  throughout the ages in fact  have been developed countries and therefore they must bear primary responsibility; the second factor is that historically, contributions of carbon emissions to the atmosphere have been extremely unequal : \" just six developed countries account for 41% of cumulative emissions from 1751 to 2020: The United States (24.4%); Germany (5.45%); The United Kingdom (4.7%); Japan (3.9%); Canada and Australia combined (3%). The entirety of Africa accounts for just 2.</p><p>9% and India 3.4%\".</p><p> However, in 2023 China has taken the lead with 13.8% of pollution in the historical context, producing goods for consumption in Europe and North America in particular.If climate justice is to be administered, Saad suggests the need to answer five questions: who ought to do what: who will be impacted and why; what the moral significance of climate impacts is (which inevitably touches on human rights); whose concerns matter; and most importantly, what is driving the crisis and preventing responses.</p><p> Once these questions are answered, climate justice  in all its moral imperative  should have an implementation tool that would strengthen enforceability which in turn would obviate Einstein's definition.My TakeThis defining issue for humanity's sustenance cannot be solved nor comprehensively discussed in a short essay.</p><p> However, a good start would be to identify the issue from scratch progressively as follows. We are aiming at global warming of 1.</p><p>5C which is to limit the increase in the global average surface temperature compared to the pre-industrial period (18501900). COP/27 saw many countries agreeing to pursue efforts to this limit in the Paris Agreement of 2015, which aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change.</p><p> The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) in its recent report, says that global warming of 1.5C is likely to be reached between 2030 and 2052 if it continues to increase at the current rate.</p><p> As already discussed, so far, the 193 States comprising the international community of nations have given no indication that positive measures adequate to reach this goal are being taken. The recommendation of the IPCC, if exceeding this limit is to be avoided, is that global net human-caused emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) should fall by about 45% from 2010 levels by 2030, reaching 'net zero' around 2050. This means that any remaining emissions would need to be balanced by removing CO2 from the air.</p><p>Lock step with this goal is the compelling requirement to achieve rapid and far-reaching transitions in energy, land, urban and industrial systems. These transitions are unprecedented in terms of scale and imply deep emissions reductions in all sectors, a wide portfolio of mitigation options and a significant upscaling of investments in those options.</p><p> The attendant benefits of restricting warming to 1.5C, compared to 2C or higher, are clear: lower risk of climate-related impacts on human health, livelihoods, food security, water supply, human security and economic growth.</p><p> This cannot be achieved without significant costs and trade-offs.What should be done?To avoid doing the same wrong thing by pledging goals without political will and resolute determination achieved through a proactive and effective mechanism that is implementable globally, some initial agreements should be reached.</p><p> For one, new fossil fuel infrastructures should be prohibited. Much of the current energy structure may have to be decommissioned.</p><p> This era that we are Contemporaneously, tin  Capitalocene (an off shot of Anthropocene)  in terms of neo-liberal market economics of control exerted by huge multinational corporations and climate change deniers would have to be reexamined. More government involvement in terms of implementable policy and regulation should be encouraged.</p><p> Contemporaneously, there should be more spent on research and development that would pave the way forward to a green economy.One way to achieve this goal is to fit into a relatively new concept called the Global Administrative Law Theory (GAL)  also sometimes referred to as legal pluralism  which came to light in the first decade of this Century.</p><p> The GAL Project is focused on an emerging field of research and practice where administrative law-type mechanisms that address issues of transparency, participation, accountability, and review operate within the parameters of global governance.The GAL theory posits that administrative law and its principles must be applied not as a mutually exclusive realm but in conjunction with the principles of international law and other related disciplines.</p><p> Like domestic administrative law, GAL could be an amalgam of a scholarly approach or methodology and a set of actual norms, \"practices,\" or activities or mechanisms. In other words, GAL would be a combination of the legal rules, principles, and institutional norms that apply to administration from a global perspective rather than a structure that demonstrates and exhibits a mere intrastate legal and political realm of authority.</p><p>To enforce climate justice we have to go back to the very beginning of the Bible where in The Book of Genesis (1:26-28) it is said \"Then God said, \"Let us make mankind in our image, in our likeness, so that they may rule over the fish in the sea and the birds in the sky, over the livestock and all the wild animals, and over all the creatures that move along the ground\".To rule over the world, we must have enforceability founded on unswerving political will.</p><p> For now, all that we know is that we have botched our mandate as defined in the Book of Genesis.Dr.</p><p> Abeyratne teaches aerospace law at McGill University.

Billed as a once-in-a-generation high-level event, the Summit brought together world leaders and non-governmental actors in New York City to adopt a Pact for the Future, including a Global Digital Compact and a Declaration on Future Generations. This Pact aims to update global governance for the realities of today and the challenges of tomorrow, building on the United Nations Secretary-General's statement that 'we cannot create a future fit for our grandchildren with a system built by our grandparents.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The Pact for the Future covers a wide range of topics from peace and security to sustainable development, climate action, and the global financial system. Youth and future generations are highlighted as key actors and stakeholders, and a Global Digital Compact is annexed as 'the first comprehensive global framework for digital cooperation and AI governance.' As an overarching commitment, the Pact pledges to 'reinvigorate global action to ensure the future we want and to effectively respond to current and future challenges, in partnership with all relevant stakeholders.'</p><p>A Decade of Action</p><p>In 2015, the world decided on the Paris Agreement on climate change as well as sixteen Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Under the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the SDGs are supposed to be achieved by 2030, a process that is supposed to be accelerated during the 'Decade of Action' from 2020 to 2030. Similarly, implementation of the Paris Agreement has begun in 2020, with Parties due to update their respective contributions (the Nationally Determined Contributions or NDCs) by early 2025, ahead of the global climate change conference end in Bel\u00e9m, Brazil. These NDCs should be informed by the first Global Stocktake, an assessment of the state of global climate action that was finalised and adopted by all Parties at the end of 2023.</p><p>Both the Pact for the Future and the Global Stocktake highlight the 'current slow pace of progress in addressing climate change' and find that the world is 'not yet collectively on track towards achieving the purpose of the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals.' Climate action needs to be scaled up in this critical decade, including through the provision and mobilisation of finance, enhanced international cooperation, and science, technology, and innovation.</p><p>Climate-vulnerable developing countries, including Sri Lanka, are at the forefront of climate change and exposed to some of the most direct and dangerous impacts. At the same time, they are often facing increasing macroeconomic challenges, constraints, and debt distress, further limiting their fiscal space and the ability to engage in long-term planning. The current global financial architecture has been criticised for its inadequacies in addressing these issues, and. There is a growing call to restructure this architecture to be more equitable and supportive of sustainable development, aligning with principles of climate justice and international cooperation.</p><p>Both the Global Stocktake and the Pact for the Future take up this call for accelerated financial system reform to meet the urgent challenge of climate change, allow countries to borrow sustainably for their development, and create 'a world free of poverty on a liveable planet.' As outlined in these documents as well as several recent reform proposals-such as the Bridgetown Agenda 3.0, the CVF/V20 Accra-Marrakech Agenda, or the Paris Pact for People and Planet-, this includes greater access to climate finance for developing countries, new visions for multilateral development banks, and innovative financial instruments such as climate-resilient debt clauses, blue bonds, or debt-for-climate swaps.</p><p>Changing systems and the need for transformation</p><p>How can we envision the future of global climate action and sustainable development, and what does that mean for developing countries such as Sri Lanka? The SDGs and the Paris Agreement have been pivotal in shaping global efforts toward sustainability and climate action: but the SDG target year of 2030 is approaching quickly, and more ambitious action is required to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach.</p><p>Foresight-driven planning involves anticipating future challenges and opportunities, enabling policymakers to develop proactive and effective strategies while accounting for uncertainties and emerging risks. In this context, concepts such as transformative adaptation or long-term resilience are gaining prominence, although it remains ambiguous how exactly to define and operationalise them.</p><p>Fostering transformative adaptation and long-term resilience requires systemic and whole-of-society approaches. Implementing individual actions or technologies-for example, building flood defences or shifting to renewable energies-is important, but there is also a need for a deeper systemic change that considers all actors across the various value chains as well as the socioeconomic ecosystem that in which they operate. These approaches would go beyond incremental adjustments and seek to alter the underlying social, economic, and environmental frameworks to address root causes of vulnerability and empower systems and institutions to dynamically respond to the challenges of tomorrow.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Both the Pact for the Future and the Global Stocktake highlight the 'current slow pace of progress in addressing climate change' and find that the world is 'not yet collectively on track towards achieving the purpose of the Paris Agreement and its long-term goals. Climate action needs to be scaled up in this critical decade, including through the provision and mobilisation of finance, enhanced international cooperation, and science, technology, and innovation. Climate-vulnerable developing countries, including Sri Lanka, are at the forefront of climate change and exposed to some of the most direct and dangerous impacts. At the same time, they are often facing increasing macroeconomic challenges, constraints, and debt distress, further limiting their fiscal space and the ability to engage in long-term planning. The current global financial architecture has been criticised for its inadequacies in addressing these issues, and. There is a growing call to restructure this architecture to be more equitable and supportive of sustainable development, aligning with principles of climate justice and international cooperation. Both the Global Stocktake and the Pact for the Future take up this call for accelerated financial system reform to meet the urgent challenge of climate change, allow countries to borrow sustainably for their development, and create 'a world free of poverty on a liveable planet. As outlined in these documents as well as several recent reform proposals-such as the Bridgetown Agenda 3. 0, the CVF/V20 Accra-Marrakech Agenda, or the Paris Pact for People and Planet-, this includes greater access to climate finance for developing countries, new visions for multilateral development banks, and innovative financial instruments such as climate-resilient debt clauses, blue bonds, or debt-for-climate swaps. Changing systems and the need for transformationHow can we envision the future of global climate action and sustainable development, and what does that mean for developing countries such as Sri Lanka? The SDGs and the Paris Agreement have been pivotal in shaping global efforts toward sustainability and climate action: but the SDG target year of 2030 is approaching quickly, and more ambitious action is required to keep the goals of the Paris Agreement within reach."]}, {"relevance_score": 12, "title": "Sri Lanka urges action against cybercrime centres, employment rackets in ASEAN region", "published": "2024-07-29", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka, July 29 -- Sri Lanka's State Minister of Foreign Affairs Tharaka Balasuriya has called for decisive action against cybercrime centres and employment rackets taking place in some parts of the ASEAN region.</p><p>In his address to the 31st Ministerial Meeting of the ASEAN Regional Forum in Laos on Saturday (27 July), Balasuriya also called for the Asia Pacific region to concertedly address emerging challenges including security-related aspects of new and emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence, with a view to taking preventive measures against their misuse, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said.</p><p>Issuing a statement, the Ministry mentioned that the Foreign Affairs State Minister further highlighted that in addition to sustaining the Asia-Pacific region's efforts to promote peace, security, and cooperation, the Forum must address challenges to cyber and network security systems and tackle transnational organized crime.</p><p>This year's ARF Ministerial meeting attended by 27 ARF members, was chaired by the Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Saleumxay Kommasith of Lao PDR, which holds the ASEAN Chairmanship.</p><p>Speaking further at the meeting, State Minister Tharaka Balasuriya has outlined Sri Lanka's historical ties with ASEAN countries and the active role in the work of the organization particularly as Co-Chair of several inter sessional processes in the areas of disaster relief, non-proliferation and disarmament.

Today, there are two main theatres of war - Gaza and Ukraine, which have collectively led to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. Apart from these, more than 50 conflicts are raging in a number of countries from Yemen to Sudan. Here in Sri Lanka too, we have experienced the debilitating effects of war and conflict.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But are people the only victims of war? The clear answer is \"no\". Countless animals perish in every conflict and war. Indeed, the entire environment and ecosystem are harmed by wars. In fact, some warring factions deliberately damage the environment in an attempt to weaken the enemy. The world witnessed this tragedy in Vietnam and in many other places.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">According to the United Nations (UN), the environment has often remained the main unpublicised victim of war. Water wells and rivers have been polluted, crops torched, forests cut down, soils poisoned, and animals killed to gain military advantage.</p><p>The United Nations Environment Program (UNEP) has found that over the last 60 years, at least 40 percent of all internal conflicts have been linked to the exploitation of natural resources, whether high-value resources such as timber, diamonds, gold and oil, or scarce resources such as fertile land and water. Countries too can fight over resources such as shared rivers and dams. Conflicts involving natural resources have also been found to be twice as likely to occur again, despite conclusive negotiations.</p><p>UN's role</p><p>The UN attaches great importance to ensuring that action on the environment is part of conflict prevention, peacekeeping and peace-building strategies, because there can be no real and durable peace if the natural resources that sustain livelihoods and ecosystems are destroyed.</p><p>On November 5, 2001, the UN General Assembly declared 6 November of each year as the International Day for Preventing the Exploitation of the Environment in War and Armed Conflict.</p><p>On May 27, 2016 the United Nations Environment Assembly adopted resolution UNEP/EA.2/Res.15, which recognised the role of healthy ecosystems and sustainably managed resources in reducing the risk of armed conflict, and reaffirmed its strong commitment to the full implementation of the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). \"If we are to achieve the SDGs, we need to act boldly and urgently to reduce the risks that environmental degradation and climate change present for conflict and commit to protecting our planet from the debilitating effects of war,\" says UN Secretary General Antonio Guteress.</p><p>Collective effort</p><p>Six UN agencies and departments (UNEP, UNDP, UNHABITAT, PBSO, DPA and DESA), coordinated by the UN Framework Team for Preventive Action, have partnered with the European Union (EU) to help countries identify, prevent and transform tensions over natural resource as part of conflict prevention and peace building programs.</p><p>The Environmental Law Institute (ELI), United Nations Environment Program (UNEP), and the Universities of Tokyo and McGill (Canada) initiated a global research program to collect lessons learned and good practices on managing natural resources during post-conflict peacebuilding.</p><p>This four-year research project has yielded more than 150 peer-reviewed case studies by over 230 scholars, practitioners and decision-makers from 55 countries. This represents the most significant collection to date of experiences, analyses and lessons in managing natural resources to support post-conflict peacebuilding.</p><p>Studies of this nature are essential to understand the massive loss caused to the environment by wars and conflicts that have dragged on for decades without a solution in sight. Warfare has many impacts on the total environment: Air pollution, soil pollution, ecological damage, biodiversity damage, and water pollution are among a few. Moreover, energy, water and electricity supplies are also deliberately targeted in wars, which also leads to environmental issues.</p><p>Here in Sri Lanka, many agricultural lands and forests were devastated by the War that lasted for 30 long years. Many areas remained out of bounds due to the anti-personnel mines buried in massive numbers, though most of these have now been cleared. But worldwide, millions of landmines and other munitions lie waiting underground for their victims, human or animal. Besides, they can also damage the soil and water sources.</p><p>In Vietnam, harmful chemicals such as Napalm were dropped in forest areas with the aim of killing VietCong members, but this caused environmental damage on a massive scale. Associated Press photographer Nick Ut's iconic photograph of Vietnamese children fleeing a napalm attack not only revealed the human tragedy of the Vietnam War, but also revealed the grim truth about environmental degradation and biodiversity loss caused by chemical warfare in Vietnam and in nearby Cambodia. Although this incident led to laws that restricted the use of chemical and biological agents in war, there were plenty of instances when they were used with impunity by both State and non-State parties. But war per se is not needed for Governments and militaries to take actions that wittingly or unwittingly damage the environment.</p><p>Military exercises that involve thousands of troops and vehicles from multiple countries are routinely held around the world. These are highly damaging to the environment, since they simulate the conditions of an actual war and use live ammunition and combat explosives. It may be a coincidence, but some of the largest military bases and facilities are in ecologically sensitive areas.</p><p>One can also imagine the extent of emissions by military vehicles, planes, ships and helicopters, thousands of which are in use at any given time. In a world obsessed with emissions from civilian airliners, this topic is hardly discussed.</p><p>\"Military pollution\"</p><p>The reality is that the Carbon Dioxide emissions of the biggest militaries far outweigh those of many Global South nations as they rarely use any form of renewable energy. In fact, a new term \"military pollution\" has been coined to describe the ecological damage caused by militaries.</p><p>Testing of new weapons is another cause. Open air nuclear testing in remote islands such as Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands chain in the 1950s and 1960s destroyed entire ecosystems and some of these islands are still off-limits today as a discernible level of radioactivity remains. Today, above-ground nuclear testing is banned but countries such as North Korea are known to conduct underground tests. The testing of conventional Inter- Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) also poses environmental hazards, though not on the same scale.</p><p>Defence spending</p><p>Defence spending is another issue that has a direct, though often unnoticed, impact on the environment and combating Climate Change. The UN is struggling to secure US$ 100 billion for its Climate Finance and Climate Justice programs, but rich countries and even some developing ones annually spend close to US$ 2.5 trillion on defence, according to the Sweden-based Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI). Keeping the 12,000 odd active nuclear warheads primed alone costs millions of dollars every year, not to mention the grim prospect of where the nuclear material can go if they are ever dismantled. Either way, it is a lose-lose situation.</p><p>Perhaps the biggest issue is the internal and external displacement of whole populations as a result of conflict, war and even gang violence (Haiti is an example for this). If the displaced go en masse to another country, that too could face the threat of environmental problems and disease as seen in Bangladesh and Kenya, which host large refugee populations.</p><p>This is a world that sorely needs peace and an understanding of the \"Other\". Resolving the conflicts that rage around the world is the only remedy for this. The world should recognise the almost irreversible harm caused to our fragile ecosystems by wars and conflicts.</p><p>Climate Change certainly does not need a boost from military adventurism but this is unfortunately what seems to be happening around the world. Countries rich and poor must resolve to drastically prune their defence spending and divert the savings to protecting our planet from the existential threat of Climate Change.

But obviously, the failure wasn't acknowledged on paper.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">COP27 - or the Conference of Parties by the United Nations Framework on Climate Change - with its 40,000+ delegates this year, had three primary areas of focus:</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">(i)Ramping up mitigation - the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and consequentially, global warming.</p><p>(ii)Financing adaptation - helping those impacted by climate change to adapt to the changes in their environments.</p><p>(iii)Most controversially, loss-and-damage finance. It refers to immediate assistance given to developing countries affected by climate-change-related catastrophes and impacts that they cannot adapt to. At COP27, a progression of the language was Glasgow was the goal. At the Glasgow summit, developed nations made a US$ 100 billion annual commitment to this.</p><p>The Paris Agreement sets the target of limiting 'global temperature rise this century well below 2 degrees Celsius and pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius.'</p><p>According to the Emissions Gap report, released by the United Nations Environment Programme last month, countries are falling miserably behind. It said the pledges made by countries since the last COP in Glasgow, are insufficient to reach the emission goals set and the current policies will lead to a 2.8 degrees Celsius rise by the end of the century.</p><p>Fossil fuel phase-outs, activists argued, would be key to this. Glasgow kick-started the coal phase down, but gas and oil remain unchallenged, and civil society organisations are calling for a complete phase-out of all fossils fuels. The emergence of a Fossil Fuel Non-proliferation Treaty in 2019 was a significant move in this direction. So far, 70 cities and subnational governments, have supported it. Sri Lanka is not among them.</p><p>'The goal was to mobilise resources to limit temperatures to 1.5 degrees Celsius,' noted Chair of the Friends of the Earth, Hemantha Withanage. This was championed by the United States, one of the world's biggest emitters, perhaps as an attempt at evading the climate finance obligations they faced, he said, adding that making finance conditional to the 1.5 degrees Celsius goal would buy developed countries more time.</p><p>Mitigation finance and technical assistance would assist countries with phasing out fossil fuels and replacing them with renewable energy, all of which are expensive.</p><p>However, Sri Lanka feels mitigation was not a primary focus of negotiations this year.</p><p>'Sri Lanka is sticking to its no-new-coal policy as promised at COP26 last year,' Power and Energy Minister Kanchana Wijesekera told the Sunday Times at Sharm-el-Sheikh last week.</p><p>He said Sri Lanka would phase out coal power generation by 2040 while the forex crisis had limited the use of diesel and furnace oil power plants in Sri Lanka. 'We reaffirmed our commitment to move towards a 70% renewable-sources-based energy mix by 2030, a move that quite a few stakeholders have agreed to support.'</p><p>No concrete commitments are in sight for Sri Lanka at the moment, however. Nonetheless, since Sri Lanka is not a big emitter, the negotiation focuses on adaptation and loss and damage.</p><p>Activists charged that there is an undercurrent of a fossil-fuel agenda at this COP despite the resonance of slogans such as 'Don't Gas Africa' (in reference to the expansion of fossil fuel extraction there), and 'Kick the polluters out' at the venue.</p><p>A count taken from the official participant list of the UNFCCC website showed that 636 fossil fuel lobbyists attended the conference this year. 'You don't invite mosquitoes if you want to address malaria,' noted NigerianClimate Activist Philip Jakpor.</p><p>'No one here is saying that we are going to get rid of fossil fuels tomorrow,' noted Catherine Abreu from Destination Zero at a COP27 assessment press conference on Friday. 'We are calling for a just and equitable transition away from fossil fuels and towards renewable energy.'</p><p>She refuted claims that fossil fuels were the only way to give energy access to communities without it across the continents. 'They would've done this by now if it was possible.'</p><p>As of Friday night, at an informal stocktaking plenary, oil and gas were not yet added to coal for a phase-out.</p><p>The second issue was the Adaptation Gap. While at least 84%, a 5% increase from last year, of COP members have established adaptation plans, strategies, laws and policies, finance has not kept up. The UNEP estimated that the global adaptation finance requirement is USD 160-340bn by2030 and USD 315-565bn by 2050. But even the 100bn annual pledge made by developed countries in 2009, to be distributed by 2020 to developing countries, is still pending. Adaptation finance would go towards things like early warning systems and flood-proof housing. As of now, one-third of the world does not have access to these systems.</p><p>But Adaptation Finance should be in the form of grants instead of loans. This was a ringing cry throughout the conference. The transition to innovative climate finance models was long overdue. The link between debt and climate vulnerability was contributing to an ever-extending adaptation gap as developing countries grapple with the expenses of the impacts of climate change.</p><p>At Sharm-el-Sheikh, developing countries' call for double adaptation finance has not been answered yet. While a text containing the components to set up a framework was released earlier this week, the US and Switzerland were among the developed countries blocking it with the EU wanting to postpone discussions till next year. 'Without a clear roadmap for a global goal on adaptation, the outcome will be disappointing,' noted Mohamed Adow of Powershift Africa.</p><p>New finance models like 'GlobalShield', a climate risk insurance scheme, were announced but met with resistance by activist groups that insisted insurance schemes would be unsustainable given the higher rate of climate-related disasters that took place. 'The insurance product will not be feasible. If I get into car accidents every other day, I will be blacklisted by the company,' said Harjeet Singh, head of global political strategy at Climate Action Network.</p><p>The scheme, by the German government, cropped up during hot debates on this COP's most controversial question of loss and damage finance.</p><p>On Friday night, after the COP Chair, Egypt, announced that the conference would go into extra time till midnight on Saturday, talks seemed to have hit a deadlock with no compromise in sight.</p><p>Earlier this week, China and G77, which Sri Lanka is a part of, submitted a proposal calling for a loss and damage finance facility to be established in Sharm-el-Sheikh. The expectation was that the modalities and operation aspect of the facility will be established by COP28 in Dubai. But developed countries, Sweden the most vocal out of them, pushed it back.</p><p>The developed countries' resistance continued to the idea of a 'facility' on account of the liability that it imposes and the fear it may open the floodgates for climate justice litigation.</p><p>'The reason why loss-and-damage has become so important here has nothing to do with the COP, it has everything to do with the weather,' noted Prof. Saleemul Haq, Director of the International Centre for Climate Change and Development (ICCCAD).</p><p>He attributed the urgent interest to the undeniable correlations scientists have established between the increasing climate events and human activities. 'Getting loss-and-damage on the agenda was a victory, but it cannot stop there,' he told the Sunday Times.</p><p>He insisted that the fund had to be established at this COP. The mere dialogue was no longer acceptable. Some countries, like Denmark, had begun a loss-and-damage fund of their own. So has Scotland, but they are not a party to the Convention.</p><p>However, the bloc against the establishment prevailed into the wee hours of Saturday morning.</p><p>'No more talks,' Prof. Haq said, but COP seemed fated to have just that, as draft text after draft text, the resulting document of the COP, kept coming back with the note that no agreement had been reached on loss and damage. Implementation, the theme of COP this year, seemed a distant dream.</p><p>There were too many questions, the developed countries argued. Who would pay? Who would be eligible to receive it? Who would manage the fund?</p><p>But these were questions that can be answered during the operational discussions around the fund at COP28 in the UAE, insisted Pakistan's Ambassador Nabeel Munir at a media conference on Thursday. 'Loss and damage is not charity, it is climate justice,' he noted. Pakistan led the G77 bloc this year in proposing loss and damage as an agenda item and consequentially the first proposal with regard to a financing facility.</p><p>'If nations leave without showing the political will to hear the desperate calls of the vulnerable countries to establish a loss and damage fund, we will consider this a serious abrogation of their obligations to us, the UNFCCC, and the Paris Agreement,' said Ralph Regenvanu, the Climate Change Minister of Vanuatu at the same press conference.</p><p>On Friday evening, the announcement that COP27 would go into overtime till midnight on Saturday was announced.

The inauguration on the theme 'Public Health Through Fostering Collaboration and Building Resilience' was graced by the Chief Guest and First Lady, Prof. Maithree Wickramasinghe, and Guest-of-Honour and Health Ministry Secretary Dr. Palitha Mahipala. Interspersing technicalities with real-life anecdotes, Orator Prof. Marambe, Senior Professor, Faculty of Agriculture, University of Peradeniya, described how when he and his wife were getting their house built in Peradeniya, the architect wanted to know whether he should attach hooks on the slab for ceiling fans. They had laughed him off, considering the salubrious and comfortable climes of Kandy........but now, 25 years later, they were paying for their folly and depending on pedestal fans!</p><p>The head-table (from left): CCPSL Treasurer Dr. Pubudu Chulasiri; Guest-of-Honour Dr. Palitha Mahipala; Chief Guest Prof. Maithree Wickramasinghe; CCPSL President Dr. Shiromi Maduwage; Orator Prof. Buddhi Marambe; and CCPSL Secretary Dr Anuji Gamage. Pix by Priyanka Samaraweera</p><p>Looking at Sri Lanka, he said that since 1961, the country's average temperature has increased at a rate of 0.01\u00b0C to 0.03\u00b0C per year. A recent analysis had shown that wet areas (Wet Zone) will be wetter and dry areas (Dry and Intermediate Zone) will be drier.</p><p>Prof. Buddhi Marambe</p><p>'This is an alarming situation as the Dry and Intermediate Zones would face water deficits, leading to significant losses of crops, livestock and aquaculture, impacting the livelihood of people. The cooler climates, meanwhile, have already shown a rapid increase in the night temperatures than the day temperature. This indicates that the central highlands of Sri Lanka would experience crop yield reductions due to the loss of dry matter due to the increased rate of night respiration. All such events would increase the probability of food insecurity in Sri Lanka,' cautioned Prof. Marambe who is former Chairman of the National Experts Committee on Climate Change Adaptation (NECCCA) of the Environment Ministry.</p><p>He explained that increasing levels of Greenhouse Gases (GHGs) in the atmosphere are directly linked to the average global temperature. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is the most abundant GHG, mainly emitted from burning fossil fuels, contributing to about two-thirds of the overall GHGs. Methane contributes to about 25% of the warming today. While the global warming potential of Methane is 80 times more than that of CO2, this is emitted from human activities (60%) and natural sources (40%).</p><p>Prof. Maithree Wickramasinghe</p><p>'The most significant sources of Methane due to human activities are from agriculture (cattle and paddy fields), fossil fuels and decomposition of landfill waste,' stressed Prof. Marambe.</p><p>Linking climate change and global warming to 'devastating' consequences for human health, he pointed out that the 'Lancet Countdown' reported that globally, the number of people exposed to extreme heat has grown exponentially due to climate change and the heat-related mortality (death) of people over 65 years of age has increased by around 85% between 2000-2004 and 2017-2021. Climate change also increases vector-borne diseases and reduces water quality, putting at riskhuman health and sanitation.</p><p>Prof. Marambe urged that countries need to develop implementable commitments to bring them in line with the 1.5-degree world aligning with the Paris Agreement. To keep this Paris Agreement target within reach, the world has recognized that the energy sector should reach net zero emissions by 2050, by speeding up the transition away from fossil fuels and utilizing zero- and low-carbon fuels well before or by around mid-century. The next two years will be critical in global climate negotiations, as the countries need to establish a new climate finance goal.</p><p>Dr. Shiromi Maduwage</p><p>Sri Lanka has already committed to becoming carbon net zero by 2050; achieving 70% renewable energy in electricity generation by 2030; and not to embark on capacity addition of coal power plants, he said, looking at the progress achieved.</p><p>Sri Lanka has updated its National Policy on Climate Change in 2023 and its National Determined Contributions (NDCs) in 2021; established the NDC Implementation Plan (2021-2030) in 2023, the Climate Prosperity Plan (CPP) in 2022, and the 2050 Carbon Net Zero Road Map and Strategic Plan in 2023.</p><p>The CPP has identified US$ 26.53 billion and the Net Zero Strategic Plan US$ 140 billion as the financial requirement from national (including private sector) and international donor agencies to support these climate actions until 2030 and 2050, respectively.

He noted that it essentially calls on developed countries to support developing countries in three areas: finance, technology development and transfer, and capacity building.</p><p>'This is also precisely what isn't being addressed adequately, and developing countries have been battling for it,' he said, noting that an agreement for a loss and damage fund, which was agreed on last year, took decades.</p><p>Sri Lanka's move for climate justice, however, will not take a confrontational approach. It is where the concept of the tropical belt comes in. The Ministry Secretary noted that the tropical belt, northwards and southwards from the equator, was rich in biodiversity and renewable energy, with biomass potential that was much higher in comparison to polar and subtropical regions. Some 134 out of the 198 UN countries were either fully or partially located in the tropical belt, and 40% of the landmass and the global population were concentrated in this belt too. 'This is also the area that has suffered the most historically in terms of pollution, climate events, and biodiversity loss. That is why they are considered vulnerable countries-90% of vulnerable countries are located in the tropical belt.'</p><p>Echoing Senior Advisor Wijewardene on the call for investments into green transitions in the tropical belt, Dr. Jasinghe noted that if developed countries start investing in these areas regardless of political affiliations and geopolitics, the whole world would benefit. 'The tropical belt is the natural shield for the globe.'</p><p>The Sri Lankan pavilion is set to host 25 side events at COP28, which will be attended by thousands of stakeholders, from state leaders to NGOs and the private sector.</p><p>With climate catastrophes exacerbating across the world and even here in Sri Lanka, each COP becomes more decisive than the next.

Sri Lanka will host its first-ever pavilion at the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Conference of Parties in Dubai next week, where multiple climate-related policies and lobbies are set to be spearheaded by Sri Lanka. While the Sunday Times does not have information on the nature of funding for the political and technical delegations, it has confirmed that the overflow delegates are self-funded or sponsored by other organisations.

The Ministry Secretary noted that the tropical belt, northwards and southwards from the equator, was rich in biodiversity and renewable energy, with biomass potential that was much higher in comparison to polar and subtropical regions. Some 134 out of the 198 UN countries were either fully or partially located in the tropical belt, and 40% of the landmass and the global population were concentrated in this belt too. 'This is also the area that has suffered the most historically in terms of pollution, climate events, and biodiversity loss.

For example, AI can significantly improve the accuracy of climate change projections and climate risk assessments by analysing vast datasets on weather patterns, recorded impacts, and other relevant factors.

President Anura Kumara Dissanayake was sworn in as the 9th Executive President of Sri Lanka. The people of Sri Lanka have vested in him the mandate to realize the people's aspirations for the future and to build a sustainable foundation for future generations.</p><p>H.E. President Dissanayake has outlined to the nation his determination to put in place a united Sri Lanka and a transformed ethical political culture. Echoing the wishes of the people, his future trajectory combines nation-building based on public trust in governance and in the political system through accountability, integrity and the elimination of waste and corruption.</p><p>In the words of His Excellency President Anura Kumara Dissanayake:</p><p>'We are launching ... a unified Sri Lankan nation that respects diversity, fully ending an era of division based on race, religion, caste and class ...'</p><p>In order to achieve these objectives, the Government has recognized that it is crucial to reinforce stability and confidence in the economy and stimulate growth. The Government will work within commitments to reach macro-economic stability through the framework of international financial institutions and in negotiations with sovereign and private external stakeholders.</p><p>The Government is acutely aware of the hardships that have been faced by the people in the process of economic transition. Measures will be put in place to generate greater resources for enhanced public expenditure and welfare to raise the living standards of the people, with equity and justice.</p><p>The recent vote for change by the people of Sri Lanka presents us with a renewed opportunity, and we are determined to succeed including with the support of our friends in the international community.</p><p>Moment of profound global crises</p><p>Despite our consensus on the Pact of the Future, this year's UNGA takes place at a moment of profound global crises on multiple fronts. In the Middle East, we are closer to wider regional conflagration than when we convened last week and the humanitarian suffering in Gaza gets worse by the day. The achievement of the SDGs now appears beyond our reach, and we are off target on the Paris Climate Goal to limit the temperature increase to 1.50C above pre-industrial levels.</p><p>Big power rivalries and geopolitical tensions have reignited and widened, and new rifts are appearing on North-South lines. Racism, intolerance, discrimination, and xenophobia against migrants are on the rise. Theatres of conflict and tension have opened up on land and in the oceans. The developments in the digital realm provides fertile ground for proliferation of disinformation and hate speech, with the potential for violence. The lingering impact of the pandemic have reverberated throughout the global economy, creating profound economic insecurities, threatening free trade and leading to protectionist barriers. We are spending more on weapons than ever before in the past and regrettably use of nuclear weapons is in mainstream discourse. New domains are being weaponised including outer-space and cyberspace, while the use of AI is challenging International Humanitarian Law in the battlefield.</p><p>Debt crisis of unprecedented proportions</p><p>Today, a large number of developing countries, including my own, face a debt crisis of unprecedented proportions. This debt distress severely impedes our ability to invest in sustainable development, as we are unable to meet these financial obligations while simultaneously investing in the future and well-being of our citizens. It is a fact that financing challenges remain at the heart of the Sustainable Development crisis. As per the Financing for Sustainable Development Report 2024, the SDG financing gap is between USD 2.5-4.0 trillion.</p><p>Comprehensive reform of the global financial architecture</p><p>Given these immense challenges, the need for comprehensive reform of the global financial architecture has never been more pressing. The current international debt resolution framework has failed to respond adequately and efficiently to contemporary challenges. The global landscape has changed dramatically, with global debt, particularly in the developing world, increasingly controlled by international bond markets and non-Paris Club lenders. It is time that we review the architecture's traditional moorings; we must urgently reform this system to reflect the new economic landscape. It is necessary to find a more efficient, comprehensive, and equitable way to address debt. Other institutions of global governance that reflect the world of the past century need to be reformed to meet the challenges of the present and the future. The composition of the Security Council must be expanded to be representative of current global diversity and decision-making. In parallel, the role of the UN General Assembly, the most representative primary organ of the United Nations where all countries have an equal voice, must be strengthened and revitalised.</p><p>Global peace and security</p><p>Sri Lanka's commitment to maintaining global peace and security has been unwavering. We recognise that peacekeeping is one of the most effective tools available to the UN to help member states to manage the difficult phase of transitioning from conflict to peace. Sri Lanka has been contributing to UN Peacekeeping operations in some of its most hostile and demanding deployments. Over 23000 men and women from the Sri Lanka armed forces and Police have contributed to ensuring international peace and security under the UN banner over the past 6 decades and been commended for high calibre service.</p><p>Climate crisis</p><p>Beyond economic recovery, we face an even greater existential threat: the ongoing climate crisis, and the accompanying need for a just energy transition. Although our development trajectory has not contributed to climate degradation, Sri Lanka has taken concrete steps to address these challenges. We will increase our nation's forest coverage and increase renewable energy in our energy mix. It is time for developed countries to fulfill their obligations and assume their fair share of responsibilities under the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities. We need their support in mitigation and adaptation efforts, as well as compensation for loss and damage. Without a concerted international effort to bridge the climate financing gap, the burden of climate impacts will continue to fall most heavily on those least responsible for the crisis. Sri Lanka is committed to phase out coal by 2040 and reach net zero carbon emission by 2050. As a climate vulnerable country, Sri Lanka has been advocating for operationalisation of the Loss and Damage Fund and called for climate justice. There is an urgent need for increased climate financing, especially for vulnerable, developing nations like Sri Lanka.</p><p>Two other critical issues which are also relevant to Sri Lanka as an island nation were a part of the discourse during this year's High-Level Week. Sea level rise is an imminent reality affecting millions. While Sri Lanka has taken mitigation measures nationally, as included in the National Adaptation Plan for Climate Change, it is through concerted international action that solutions can be implemented to halt the global warming that is the cause of sea level rise. Sri Lanka initiated the UNGA resolution on declaring 1 March as the World Sea Grass Day, to bring international attention and awareness on a small but significant aspect of universal importance of combating climate change. Sri Lanka has further been recognized for its contribution to mangrove regeneration programme as a 2024 World Restoration Flagship by the UN, under the UN Decade on Ecosystem Restoration.</p><p>Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) has become a critical public health issue the world over with bacterial resistance linked to around 5 million deaths worldwide annually. AMR, if not contained, has the potential to spiral into a development issue as well with life expectancies declining worldwide. We welcome the target of mobilizing $100 million through the Antimicrobial Resistance Multi-Partner Trust Fund to ensure that 60% of countries have funded action plans by 2030. However, international cooperation and sustainable financing must increase to meet this goal.</p><p>As we seek solutions to global challenges, we must harness the power of technology and innovation. Digital technologies and artificial intelligence offer unprecedented opportunities to accelerate sustainable development. Sri Lanka aims for sustained growth by innovation and envisages an equitable digital transformation through the establishment of accessible digital public infrastructure. At the same time, we call for increased capacity building and technical assistance to bridge the global digital divide and empower all countries to leverage these tools for the betterment of their people.</p><p>This General Assembly's theme calls on us to leave no one behind and to act together for the advancement of peace, sustainable development, and human dignity for present and future generations.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, 38% of our total population is youth, which is the most capable and dynamic resource that can contribute to our future development. Sri Lanka advocates for increased youth participation in decision-making processes. After all, the Declaration on Future Generations is theirs. Simultaneously, the new Sri Lanka will realise the aspirations of a just society with greater empowerment for women, who make up to 52% of our population.</p><p>Recognition of legitimate and inalienable right of Palestine people</p><p>As we look towards the future, we must also address one of the gravest injustices that this Assembly has inherited from the past. Sri Lanka has repeatedly voiced its concern over the dire humanitarian situation in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. We reiterate our support for the recognition of the legitimate and inalienable right of the Palestine people to statehood and join the call for a two-state solution, based on the 1967 borders, in line with all UN resolutions.</p><p>As a country that has suffered separatist terrorism for decades, we condemn the terrorist attacks in the Middle East and elsewhere in the world. Sri Lanka calls for complete and unconditional lifting of all Unilateral Coercive Measures imposed against any country, as they hinder free trade, right to development and have unintended humanitarian consequences.</p><p>As an island country, we are concerned about the present environmental and geopolitical aspects relating to the oceans. We want our oceans to be free of rivalry, conflicts, and pollution, and to be able to sustainably manage our marine resources. The UNCLOS, with its cohesive and universal nature, provides us with a say in shaping the global maritime system. Sri Lanka remains committed to the balance and collaboration embedded within the Treaty, enabling freedom of navigation and sustainable use of the oceans, respecting the sovereignty of the coastal states.</p><p>We must recognise that global challenges demand global solutions. In our interconnected world, no country can solve these complex problems in isolation. We must strengthen our international institutions, enhance knowledge sharing, and foster stronger relationships. We must work together equitably, ensuring all voices are heard in shaping our shared future. It is encouraging that several developing countries are on the cusp of becoming the leading economies tomorrow. We must bolster South-South Cooperation, to foster economic growth, social progress, and sustainable development among us. However, South-South Cooperation is not a substitute for the responsibilities of the global North as set out in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda and the Paris Agreement.</p><p>In conclusion, as Sri Lanka embarks on a path of national unity, ethical governance and economic recovery and growth with justice and equity under new leadership, we reiterate our commitment to multilateral cooperation in pursuit of peace, prosperity, and sustainability. We must harness the power of international solidarity to confront the interconnected challenges before us as well as to explore durable solutions for the generations to come.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["We will increase our nation's forest coverage and increase renewable energy in our energy mix.

It is we; the developing countries are both disproportionately vulnerable and disproportionately impacted due to their lower adaptive capacity when it comes to investments in Finance, Technology and Climate.</p><p>The Independent High-Level Expert Group Report on Climate Finance highlighted that at least a Trillion USD per annum is required to combat climate change. The Transitional Committee on the Operationalization of Funding Arrangements in its Report of 4th November 2023 only calls for voluntary contributions to the \"Loss and Damage fund\". The Report makes no mention of the funds needed or who the contributors are. It is silent on the issue of global debt relief. These are interconnected'</p><p>Nevertheless, four days later, the Technical Dialogue of the First Global Stocktake highlighted the requirements of a minimum of US$ trillion per annum. To arrive at a consensus not to take up a contentious issue is not a solution. Who are we fooling?</p><p>Climate justice must be available to all the people and all the countries. In this background, Sri Lanka will propose a resolution for a Climate Justice Forum which was agreed upon at the 5th Forum of the Ministers of Environmental Authorities of Asia Pacific to be moved at the UN Environment Assembly of 6th February 2024.</p><p>The Climate Justice Forum will provide us a platform for constructive and proactive engagements. The Secretary General of the UN highlighted, \"The era of global boiling has arrived\". The enemy is at the gates. We are still procrastinating. We are still forming our battalions to take the fight to the enemy. Therefore, this fortnight is critical.</p><p>It will determine whether we are capable of providing a leadership. Let us prove we can do so by action and delivery.</p><p>Sri Lanka is committed to the 1.5 degree Celcius limit. We are facing a drastic situation to await the disaster. We must think outside of the box. We must Invest in the Tropical Belt to tackle the Triple Planetary Crisis.</p><p>The Tropical Belt constitutes 134 countries covering 44% of earth's surface, and will by 2030s be home to roughly 50% of world's population. Most of the world's remaining primary forests are tropical, along with its coral reef systems. The rich biodiversity of the Tropical Belt enhances biological carbon sequestration and can shield the world from instabilities in weather.</p><p>Furthermore, the energy generation potential from solar, wind and biomass are significantly higher in the tropics than that of other areas on the earth. Yet, anthropogenic activities in the Tropical Belt can easily lead to an imbalance in the equilibrium of this region.</p><p>So much so that some scientists predict that the Tropical Rain Belt could shift away from the Equator by the 22nd Century. Large scale investments in Renewable Energy, Pollution Control and Nature-based Solutions will lead to significant transformative changes in the entire world by enhancing carbon sequestration.</p><p>Therefore, Sri Lanka and other concerned countries will convene a panel to report on the Tropical Belt Initiative. A multi sector plan distributed not only among the whole tropical region but the whole world. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), Sri Lanka is focusing on the interdependence between the Indian Ocean and climate change.</p><p>A healthy ocean generates oxygen and absorbs the carbon and heat produced from global warming. Mangroves and sea grasses sink more carbon than land forests. However, the rapid climate change is altering the marine environment with rising sea levels and temperatures, Ocean acidification, coral bleaching, habitat destruction and extreme weather patterns. These phenomenon have a direct impact on human lives by disrupting ocean biodiversity, the Ocean dependent food patterns, and coastal livelihoods. Member states and partners of IORA will work towards ensuring a sustainable, Indian Ocean for future generations.</p><p>The Tropical Belt initiative and the Indian Ocean IORA program combined will form the largest global sink for carbon sequestration. Addressing the climate change need, up to date scientific knowledge, and the effective use of these findings</p><p>Therefore, at COP27, I proposed to establish an International Climate Change University (ICCU) for capacity building and advancing research, necessary to contribute to the crucial efforts to limiting global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius. We will be operationalizing the International Climate Change University (ICCU) next year.</p><p>Ministers Mr. Ali Sabry, Mr. Keheliya Rambukwella, Mr. Kanchana Wijesekera, and Member of Parliament Mr. Madhura Withana represented the government, while Members of Parliament Mr. Champika Ranawaka and Mr. Ajith Mannapperuma represented the Opposition.

On the other side are marine conservation efforts.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Global platforms like the United Nations, the World Bank, the European Commission, the Commonwealth of Nations, and the Center for the Blue Economy have called for oceanic sustainability efforts.</p><p>In March 2024, the United Nations Environmental Assembly adopted a resolution on 'strengthening ocean efforts to tackle climate change, marine biodiversity loss and pollution.' A press release issued by the European Commission after the session stated, 'By submitting and negotiating the resolution, the European Union and its Member States reiterated their determination to play a leading role in protecting, conserving, restoring, and sustainably utilizing the world's oceans.'</p><p>The concept of the blue economy is rooted in the recognition that the oceans are vital to human well-being and the global economy. Still, they are also threatened by overexploitation, pollution, and climate change. Therefore, the blue economy seeks to balance economic development with the need to protect and restore the ocean environment, ensuring that future generations can enjoy marine resources.</p><p>Fundamental principles of the blue economy include:</p><p>Sustainability: Ensuring ocean-related activities do not deplete resources or harm the environment.</p><p>Inclusive Growth: Promoting economic activities that benefit local communities and alleviate poverty.</p><p>Innovation: Encouraging the development of new technologies and practices that enhance productivity and sustainability in using ocean resources.</p><p>Governance: Implementing effective policies, regulations, and international cooperation to manage ocean resources responsibly.</p><p>The blue economy is increasingly seen as a crucial component of global efforts to achieve sustainable development and address climate change, particularly in coastal and island nations heavily dependent on marine resources.</p><p>Challenges in Defining the Blue Economy</p><p>There is no consensus on the definition of 'blue economy.' The term generally refers to the purportedly 'sustainable' economic activities associated with oceans, seas, and coastal waters. Yet, that's where consensus on the concept breaks down. The blue economy requires a clear, widely agreed-upon definition before it can be applied appropriately.</p><p>The World Bank defines the blue economy as the 'sustainable use of ocean resources for economic growth, improved livelihoods and jobs, and ocean ecosystem health.' The European Commission defines it as '[a]ll economic activities related to oceans, seas, and coasts. [It] covers a wide range of interlinked established and emerging sectors.'</p><p>According to the United Nations, the blue economy 'comprises a range of economic sectors and related policies that together determine whether the use of ocean resources is sustainable' while emphasizing the need to protect life below the water. The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) stated that the blue economy applies to industries with 'a direct or indirect link to the ocean, such as marine energy, ports, shipping, coastal protection, and seafood production.' The World Wildlife Fund acknowledges that there is no widely accepted definition.</p><p>Defining the blue economy is much more than semantics. Some people mistakenly believe that it has been intended to benefit capitalism. This is a widespread phenomenon and is not just limited to corporations. In some ways, it is similar to the misconceptions that arose from using the term green economy.</p><p>People who live far from the ocean may not fully grasp how much humans rely on the ocean for survival, including regulating climate, providing food sources, and generating oxygen, even if they don't directly access it for daily needs. This can lead to a view of the blue economy as simply supporting coastal transportation, recreational activities, or ecotourism. However, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency states, 'Approximately half a billion people globally depend on coral reef ecosystems for food, coastal protection, and income from tourism and fisheries.' And yet, coral reefs are dying at an alarming rate due to ocean acidification fueled by the climate crisis. They are also being destroyed by harmful coastal development-development that could be part of the blue economy.</p><p>Development or Destruction?</p><p>The United Nations affirmed that the blue economy would assist in achieving the Sustainable Development Goals-especially Goal 14, 'Life Below Water.' This triggered a rapid expansion across all facets of the blue economy, with projections suggesting this trend would persist.</p><p>Marine economic activities include fisheries, aquaculture, maritime transport, coastal renewable energy, seabed mining, bioprospecting, marine biotechnology, and waterborne tourism. These activities harm marine health to some degree and contribute to many problems, including biodiversity erosion, ocean acidification, climate change, water and air pollution, and even noise pollution that threatens marine life, including whales and dolphins.</p><p>The corporate extractive sector, in particular, has been looking for new territories to extract minerals such as manganese, cobalt, copper, nickel, and rare earth elements. This has become increasingly problematic due to the risks involved in resource extraction. Though the ocean may seem like an unlimited expanse that profiteers exploit purely for financial gain, it has natural limits.</p><p>'[A]lthough scientists and campaigners have been warning of the consequences of our rampant exploitation for decades, time is now running out to protect our oceans,' Hugo Tagholm, executive director of Oceana in the UK, and Callum Roberts, a professor of marine conservation at the Center for Ecology and Conservation at the University of Exeter, wrote in EuroNews in November 2023. 'We like to think of our ocean as infinite, but the truth is, it cannot stand this industrial-scale exploitation.'</p><p>The Earth's marine ecosystems are extremely valuable to the global economy. They deliver essential ecosystem services to life on the planet and provide sustenance for billions of people. More than 3 billion individuals depend on the ocean for their livelihoods. Most live in developing nations; humans and countless other species rely on healthy, thriving oceans.</p><p>Bluewashing: Covering Up Bad Behavior</p><p>Terminologies such as 'green economy' and 'blue economy' might seem promising but are often noted as cover-ups for harmful activities. '[T]he blue economy is not a benign concept offering a win-win for the economy and the environment,' said John Childs, a senior lecturer at the Lancaster Environment Center at Lancaster University, United Kingdom, and the co-editor of a special section in the Journal of Political Ecology that presented several papers on the blue economy.</p><p>Childs said the papers he reviewed suggest that the blue economy is 'another capitalist fix in which global capital is seeking to reproduce itself, to keep making money and create a surplus. This is happening as we get to the point where much of the planet's landmass [has] been appropriated.'</p><p>'If 'greenwashing' is the practice of making unsubstantiated or misleading claims about the environmental benefits of an action, then perhaps we need a new term-'bluewashing'-to cover coastal and marine development initiatives which fail to deliver on their environmental and social promises,' wrote Nicole Leotaud, the executive director of the Caribbean Natural Resources Institute, in 2017. 'Personally, I'm tired of labels that confuse and mask the development principles we are seeking,' she added.</p><p>Threats to the Marine Ecosystem</p><p>Some protections benefit the oceans, such as the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), established in 1982 to provide an international legal framework for using and protecting the marine environment. However, not all nations agree to these protections. Additionally, ocean-bordering countries have their own laws, creating a patchwork of often poorly enforced rules. Contested waters regularly result in tumultuous situations.</p><p>Many maritime crimes negatively impact oceanic health, such as illegal fishing or harvesting, ocean dumping, and polluting. In addition to overfishing, where necessary species are removed from the food chain, and accelerating biodiversity loss, unsustainable industrial development along coastlines has also contributed to ocean pollution. 'All of these threats erode the capacity of the ocean to provide nutritious food, jobs, medicines, and pharmaceuticals as well as regulate the climate,' stated a 2020 article in the journal Nature. 'Women, poor people, Indigenous communities, and young people are most affected.'</p><p>Climate change is another serious threat to our oceans. '[I]ncreasing sea levels and making the ocean warmer, more acidic, and depleted in oxygen,' the Nature article pointed out. The ocean has absorbed more than 90 percent of excess gas trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, but that is only a portion of the damage. 'Unsustainable development along coastlines destroys coral reefs, seagrass beds, salt marshes, and mangrove forests,' which provide vital biodiversity reservoirs, sequester carbon, and buffer coasts against storm surges,' the article added. Because of human intervention, plastics, and nutrient runoff pollute the water and kill sea life.</p><p>We must not ignore the hazards of shipping. Sea vessels use heavy fuel oils that release soot, sulfur, and carbon dioxide, amounting to substantial emissions of some air pollutants and 3 percent of carbon dioxide emissions.</p><p>There are many parts of the ocean where life has died. These sections have layers of crude oil and have been contaminated to outlandishly unsafe levels.</p><p>A Bayelsa State Oil and Environment Commission report reveals that the 'concentration of noxious chemicals, such as Total Petroleum Hydrocarbons, exceed safe levels by a factor of 1 million according to some of the samples taken,' pointing to the impact of oil extraction in Bayelsa in the Nigerian Delta.</p><p>Even though significant oil spills receive much media attention, the ongoing oil flow into the sea represents the bulk of the problem. 'Hundreds of millions of gallons' of oil enter our oceans yearly, but most evade media attention. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, only a fraction of that-5 percent-comes from what the U.S. Department of Commerce labels as 'significant' oil spills.</p><p>Some of the most prominent damage to ocean ecosystems appears to come from deep-sea mining on a massive level, which destroys the seabed. It harms marine and aquatic ecosystems while impoverishing coastal communities that depend on fisheries and other resources. The kind of damage that it could cause is almost impossible to calculate, especially since deep-sea mining is a relatively new endeavor.</p><p>In a press statement in August 2024, Dr. Enric Sala, the National Geographic Explorer in Residence and Pristine Seas founder, said:</p><p>'Giving the greenlight to deep sea mining would open a Pandora's box of unknown impacts. Mining the seabed will inevitably affect fragile sea life that we barely know. And a [July 2024] study ... showed that deep-sea polymetallic nodules produce oxygen in total darkness, which may be key to ocean health. The more we look in the deep sea, the more we discover. Rushing to mine the seabed will surely go down in history as an environmental disaster we should have stopped before it started. It is short-sighted to destroy, in minutes, ecosystems that have taken millennia to develop. Countries worldwide have so much more to gain by protecting vital parts of the ocean than signing them away for short-term profit.'</p><p>The Blue Economy in African Coastal Waters</p><p>Just as vast tracts of global land have been acquired to extract fossil fuels (in the United States alone, Earthjustice, a nonprofit public interest environmental law organization, reports that '[t]he oil and gas industry has over 26 million acres of land under lease.' The same phenomenon is being duplicated in the sea. The well-being of more than 200 million Africans who depend on fisheries for food and nutritional security is at risk, CEO of WWF Kenya Mohammed Awer said in July 2023. Once corporate interests claim bodies of water as their own, they will likely become inaccessible to those who make their living from the sea and nearby coastal communities.</p><p>Industrial installations, such as crude oil platforms, establish control over the surrounding waters, ostensibly as security buffers. Fishermen who have tried to find more sea life in the high seas have reported that large parts of the continental shelf and beyond are off-limits because extractive industries have claimed and cordoned them off with controlled installations.</p><p>Unregulated industrial fishing in West African coastal waters, often carried out by foreign fleets, threatens fishermen's livelihoods. According to 'Fishy Networks: Uncovering the companies and individuals behind illegal fishing globally,' a 2022 report by the Financial Transparency Coalition, more than 40 percent of cases involving illegal, unreported, and unregulated (IUU) fishing by industrial vessels from January 2010 to May 2022 occurred in West Africa. More than one-third of global fisheries were overfished in 2019, mainly due to illegal fishing.</p><p>Access to healthy water bodies is becoming increasingly difficult by the day due to industrial installations and related pollution. Massive oil spills have been the result of different security forces at work, including blowouts at wellheads at Santa Barbara River, a fire at the Ororo-1 well (which erupted in 2020 in Nigeria and was still raging nearly a year later), explosions of floating production storage and offloading (FSPO) units; the blowing up of oil-laden vessels; and burning of bush refineries.</p><p>Paying to Pollute</p><p>In the current blue economy paradigm, privatization prioritizes profit above ecosystem health. Water is not viewed as a commodity in this construct, and the buying and selling of oceanic water and aquatic resources would be prioritized over other considerations.</p><p>The blue economy could allow polluters to pay to pollute by allowing bodies of water to be used as dumps for mine tailings and other pollutants. It could also open the space for speculators on water futures, thus raising the stakes against access to clean and safe water for the 4 billion people worldwide facing extreme water scarcity for at least one month every year.</p><p>Promise and Peril for Ocean Economy</p><p>An OECD report indicated a significant increase in ocean-related economic activities by 2030, saying that '[t]he new 'ocean economy' is driven by a combination of population growth, rising incomes, dwindling natural resources, responses to climate change and pioneering technologies.' The projections show that the global value added by ocean-based industries could grow from $1.5 trillion in 2010 to more than $3 trillion by 2030.</p><p>While the growth of the ocean economy does offer potential advantages for coastal communities, it's essential to monitor the adverse outcomes that ocean-based economic development can also yield. These challenges can include the growth of existing economic disparities, the displacement of local communities and their means of livelihood, pollution, harm to environmental sustainability and biodiversity, and an infringement on human rights.</p><p>With all of these stressors connected to the exploitation of the oceanic ecosystem, safeguards must be implemented.</p><p>Physical capital and technology have been given such priority in the world economy that other critical factors like human resources and natural resources are ignored or reduced in significance, and there is no longer any real balance in sustainability.</p><p>The drive for profit above the health of the planet and its people leads to the transformation and, often, the destruction of environmental resources without regard to planetary or social limits.</p><p>For coastal communities, the ocean is not just an arena for economic activities but a space for culture, spirituality, and interactions with nature. Connections to the ocean are a way of life. The prevailing capitalist bent may dismiss this reality as an inefficient use of aquatic ecosystems. Yet, it highlights the origins of the polycrisis in our world today.</p><p>When governments and corporations decide what should be done, they often ignore the people closest to the water and the fact that they know more about what is necessary to protect it. It gets more troubling when the uninhabited deep sea is discussed. For example, in Nigeria, Shell Oil is selling off its onshore oil fields and moving operations to the deep sea, where there is limited oversight on the damage being done. Even if the harm being done in the deep sea stays out of sight, its results still affect everyone onshore. This is a major reason for the concern anywhere in the world that is near the water.</p><p>While some countries believe that opening their maritime territories to investment will improve their economies, they invite the destruction of irreplaceable resources.</p><p>Norway Explores Deep Mining in the Seas</p><p>In January 2024, Norway's Parliament voted to allow mining companies to search a large area of the country's waters, approximately the size of Italy, for the minerals needed to build electric cars, mobile phones, and solar panels. 'If you find the resources, and if you have the technology that shows that you can develop this with acceptable [environmental] impact, then you will have your green light,' said Walter Sognnes, CEO of the startup mining company Loke Marine Minerals, according to a January 2024 Wired article.</p><p>Other companies are also looking to exploit the Norwegian waters, with the startup Green Minerals expected to 'extract copper from what's known as seafloor massive sulfide (SMS) deposits, according to its CEO, St\u00e5le Monstad,' added the article. Test mining is supposed to begin in 2028, but several technical challenges must be resolved. Deep-sea mining companies must transport mineral deposits 3 kilometers (approximately 1.9 miles) from the seabed to the surface. How the maritime ecosystem-corals, sponge grounds, and other sea life-will respond to the mining is unknown. Yet, on a positive note, mining companies are required to study the environmental impact before they are permitted to begin exploration.</p><p>Norway has changed its position on this issue in recent years. As co-chair of the Ocean Panel, it pledged to sustainably manage the world's coastline by decarbonizing the shipping industry and regulating seafood production. The Ocean Panel, formed in 2018, comprised 14 governments responsible for 40 percent of the world's coastlines.</p><p>Norway's shift in allowing deep-sea mining occurred because a new government was elected in 2021. Outraged researchers have said that not enough is known about the deep-sea ecosystem to risk mining for minerals such as manganese and cobalt, used in batteries and other electronics. 'In marine biology, our knowledge about the existence, function, and distribution of many species is either too poor or non-existent,' warned a group of scientists from the Norwegian University of Science and Technology and NTNU University Museum, both located in Trondheim, Norway.</p><p>When a relatively forward-thinking country like Norway promotes deep-sea mining, it raises concerns due to the region's history of resistance to expanded offshore oil extraction. The damage to local economies, fisheries, and Indigenous peoples of the region has been demonstrated before, so it is worrisome that support for deep-sea mining seems to be increasing once again.</p><p>Deep Mining in U.S. Seas</p><p>According to the Nature article, 'Five Priorities for a Sustainable Ocean Economy,' '[b]lue carbon' ecosystems of mangroves, seagrass beds, and salt marshes store carbon at up to 10 times the rate of terrestrial ecosystems.' For example, the article's authors cite the successful restoration of 3,000 hectares (approximately 1,500 acres) of seagrass beds in Virginia lagoons along the U.S. eastern seaboard, sequestering about 3,000 tons of carbon annually.</p><p>However, there are proposals to rely on seaweed to capture carbon or iron filings, which could lead to enormous damage. Yet, most people are unaware of these initiatives or the potential disasters they can cause. The concept appears benign, but the unsustainable aspects aren't adequately addressed in the public sphere. Moreover, the pursuit of blue carbon through mangrove protection or restoration portends the danger of sea grabbing, displacement of communities, or disruption of their livelihoods.</p><p>Assessing the Value of the Marine Ecosystem</p><p>Some argue that putting a price on the oceans' value distorts the meaning of the blue economy as the right path forward. According to a 2023 report by the World Resources Institute, the blue economy is responsible for more than $1.5 trillion of the annual global economy.</p><p>Although a blue economy is often conceptualized as the 'sustainable' management of aquatic and marine resources and ecosystems, actions other than economic profit or power are usually seen as unreasonable or not viable.</p><p>A 2015 report published by Nature estimated that the assets found in the global marine ecosystem-including fisheries, shipping routes, and tourism-have a total value of $24 trillion and generate an annual output worth $2.5 trillion. In 2022, employment in the marine economy grew by 5 percent in the United States, outpacing the overall economy (3.9 percent) in job growth.</p><p>Yet, the fundamental issue is that the concept of an 'economy' has become so pervasive that people often assume that aquatic ecosystems are intended solely for capital accumulation through exploitation.</p><p>Protecting Marine Ecosystems</p><p>Local coastal communities must be mobilized. Forming alliances with fishermen, activists involved with natural rights, nonprofit organizations, and legal and political influencers will have to play an essential role in protecting the oceans. We must use all legal mechanisms to prevent threats to water bodies from corporations, governments, and other parties.</p><p>The world functions quickly, while political leadership in many regions tends to make strides on the path of least resistance, taking the most expedient way forward. It is a global responsibility to prevent profits from becoming the first priority for industry and political leaders, thereby maintaining the importance of natural resources and life below water.</p><p>The wars happening in the world today demonstrate that oceans and other waterways require protection. The massive destruction shows that appealing to the consciences of political leaders or the boards of global corporations is counterproductive. Grassroots activists and mass public awareness and mobilization, including litigation, can help to hold corporations, governments, and criminals accountable when official routes fail to protect the seas. The media can help expose ongoing marine destruction and unsustainable practices and motivate lawmakers to protect oceanic ecosystems. Destroying marine ecosystems can be viewed as an international crime. As harmful activities in the oceans threaten species, it may be considered a kind of genocide-ecocide, or the killing of Mother Nature.</p><p>Marine Protected Areas: More Action Needed</p><p>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) include oceanic space for long-term conservation. Other areas could be estuaries, seas, and lakes. Such protected areas also cover rivers, creeks, swamps, and continental shelves.</p><p>As governments, corporations, and illegal actors exploit the open seas in a highly unregulated ecosystem, community-led MPAs represent a potential strategy for protecting the health of the Earth's oceans. Simply marking an area as an MPA may not be a neutral exercise.</p><p>MPAs can have many names: marine parks, conservation zones, reserves, sanctuaries, and no-take zones. As of 2023, there were more than 5,000 MPAs worldwide, covering more than 8 percent of the ocean. MPAs have been established in various maritime sites, including the open ocean.</p><p>Most MPAs aim to protect marine habitats and the sea life they support. One of the best-known examples is the Gal\u00e1pagos Marine Reserve, which is about 1,000 kilometers (600 miles) off the west coast of South America and includes a variety of marine habitats like coral reefs and mangrove swamps, where trees grow directly in seawater. The waters around the Gal\u00e1pagos are home to about 3,000 plant and animal species. Some MPAs, on the other hand, focus on particular historical sites, like shipwrecks.</p><p>According to the Marine Conservation Institute, approximately 8 percent of the world's waters are protected by some form of marine protection, with the island nation of Palau far out in front. Only nine countries have protected 10 to 30 percent of their waters, though only 2 percent have protected as much as 30 percent.</p><p>The UN's World Database on Protected Areas documents MPAs submitted by nations. It reports that more than 15,000 MPAs safeguard an expanse of ocean covering more than 27 million square kilometers, equivalent to nearly 10.6 million square miles. In the U.S., marine protected areas cover 25 percent of the country's waters.</p><p>Most African MPAs are in Eastern and Southern Africa, with a few in West and North Africa. Experts recommend that MPAs should be people-driven rather than financially driven. If the laws regulating MPAs come solely from the government, further details must be made clear to those involved in keeping these laws intact.</p><p>One example of these rules is the Chumbe Reef Sanctuary in Tanzania, established in 1992. This project continues to involve local communities in managing and monitoring marine resources. It has led to a significant recovery of degraded coral reefs and increased fish stock. This success is due to the involvement of local communities in the management of MPAs and the assurance of equitable stakeholding in the benefits derived from such conservation.</p><p>Another success story is the Bazaruto Archipelago National Park in Mozambique, established in 1971. It covers an area of 1,430 square kilometers (approximately 550 square miles) and contains a diverse range of marine habitats, including coral reefs, seagrass beds, and mangroves. This MPA has provided economic benefits to the local communities by supporting sustainable artisanal fishing and protecting the region's biodiversity, including endangered species such as dugongs, turtles, and sharks.</p><p>Unless MPAs are instituted with the full consent and support of dependent coastal communities, they may be a means of shutting groups of people off from nature. Governments can protect forests without the consent of relevant parties in what is often called 'fortress conservation.' This concept refers to the ability of some groups to map out and prevent others from going near designated parts of the ocean. In such instances, the blue economy could be considered a cause of many conflicts. This situation could arise if communities or commercial entities contend to control resources found in particular areas. Conflicts could also occur when MPAs are cordoned off with a military shield as 'conquered' territories.</p><p>Colonizing Nature</p><p>The concept of colonialism goes beyond the political control and exploitation of one nation by another; it also extends to our relationship with nature. The 'colonization of nature' entails exploiting and transforming natural resources for economic gain without considering its socio-ecological impacts. This approach has contributed to many problems, including climate change, biodiversity loss, and armed conflict over resources.</p><p>Launched in 2018 and based in Nigeria, the School of Ecology (SoE) explores environmental and climate justice, agriculture, resource democracy, and overall socio-ecological transformation. The organization operates under the aegis of the Health of Mother Earth Foundation, an ecological think tank where I serve as the director. One SoE gathering was based on the MPA concept and the challenges of the idea of the blue economy. A people-driven MPA would place the fate of their aquatic ecosystems in people's hands. Such a level of stewardship would ensure ecosystem protection and restoration where damage may occur.</p><p>The organization promotes the security and resilience of ecosystems as wielders of power and capital. Although many people see the promotion of the blue economy as a means of securing life underwater, as highlighted in the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, this is often not the case.</p><p>Environmentalism From Below</p><p>The Gulf of Guinea has seen high pollution levels and environmental crimes. A high level of sea-based pollution, including plastic waste, in the Gulf of Guinea is traceable to the Niger Delta, and it is time for regional governments such as the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to declare an environmental emergency.</p><p>A commitment to such a declaration will go far in ensuring that the population of West Africa can rely on a safe environment to carry out their economic, socio-cultural, recreational, and spiritual activities. Environmentalism from below requires the reassessment of the false idea that environmental concerns are for those who have had their basic needs met and have the benefit of thinking about luxuries. Environmentalism from below requires those who depend on healthy ecosystems for their basic needs to stand up against attempts to appropriate their territories for exploitation by powerful and connected individuals, governments, and corporations. Humanity is outpacing nature and plundering ocean resources to the degree that we are preventing those resources from recovering naturally.</p><p>Establishing community-managed MPAs is a powerful strategy for safeguarding the health of our oceans and halting further decline, particularly when incorporated into a comprehensive management framework. These MPAs offer a compelling solution that will help to guarantee that the aquatic commons remain free of corporate and industrial exploitation and monopolies.</p><p>Optimally, if local, community-based managed MPAs were established in coastal waters worldwide, they would restore degraded areas, rebuild biodiversity, revive cultural practices, restore dignity, and reinvigorate local economies. While capitalism often sets rules globally, there are definite ways in which humanity can work together to liberate nature from the bottom up. The world's oceans-and all species they support, including ours-depend on it.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["This situation could arise if communities or commercial entities contend to control resources found in particular areas.

Research has firmly established the need to mobilise significant resources for addressing these impacts, as well as the current gaps and shortfalls in this endeavour. According to the first Global Stocktake, which was finalised at the 28th meeting of the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement (COP28) in December 2023, the adaptation finance needs of developing countries 'are estimated at USD 215-387 billion annually up until 2030,' and their needs to implement their Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) 'at USD 5.8-5.9 trillion for the pre-2030 period.'</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Besides mobilising these funds-which will be a key topic for climate negotiations in 2024 and at COP29-, there is also a challenge in connecting the global to the national and local level. Ultimately, climate finance and other means of implementation-such as technology, technical support, and capacity-building-need to reach vulnerable communities and other local stakeholders at the frontlines of climate change, who depend on this support to reduce their vulnerabilities, adapt to climate impacts, and address climate-induced loss and damage.</p><p>Barriers and constraints for local-level access</p><p>The needs of communities, households, and vulnerable groups and individuals as outlined above are well established and documented. Global funds-such as the Green Climate Fund (GCF), the Global Environment Facility (GEF), the Adaptation Fund (AF), the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), and now the Loss and Damage Fund (L and DF)-have been created to address this urgent need for resources to scale up climate action and build resilience. However, local-level stakeholders are often unable to directly access these funds and have to rely on a chain of intermediary entities, which can lead to delays, transaction costs, and misalignment.</p><p>Key barriers and obstacles for local organisations, communities, and grassroots actors to access climate funding can include stringent eligibility criteria; complex application procedures and proposal templates; limited direct access modalities; lack of small grant windows; high fiduciary standards and reporting requirements; and the need for comprehensive scientific evidence and needs assessments.</p><p>In addition, another challenge for communities includes potential waiting periods and timelines for funding allocation, which can often span years and do not match the immediacy and urgency of ground-level needs in the face of climate action. Many local-level stakeholders are also not aware of available climate finance opportunities or lack a detailed understanding of how to access, manage, or report on such funds. Without this knowledge and empowerment, local stakeholders are left without the means to initiate and sustain relevant projects that address their specific needs and circumstances.</p><p>Local-level priorities and success metrics</p><p>Access to and the effective utilisation of funds also depends on clearly identified and communicable needs, priorities, and success metrics. How can resources at the local level be used to efficiently address climate impacts and risks in a targeted manner? How can the impact of such interventions be measured-especially when it comes to averted or addressed economic and non-economic damages and losses-without adding additional burdens on already vulnerable and resources-constrained communities? And how can it be ensured that the needs and voices of all groups are incorporated, including women, youth, the elderly, migrants, displaced persons, informal workers, or those with disabilities?</p><p>Setting up systems that can answer these questions is a key challenge that involves a range of different stakeholders on the local level-such as communities, grassroots organisations and associations, research institutions, civil society actors, and local authorities-as well as on the national and global level. In the context of the multilateral climate negotiations, workstreams such as those on the Global Goal on Adaptation and the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience, the Loss and Damage Fund, the technology work programme, or National Adaptation Plans and NDCs can connect to these ground realities and acknowledge them in the development of targets, indicators, modalities, guidelines, recommendations, reporting mechanisms, and guidance to global funds.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>The challenge of local-level access to global funds is strongly connected to issues of climate justice and equity, but also to the need of ensuring the transparent and accountable disbursement and utilisation of funds, including robust monitoring, evaluation, reporting, and impact assessment mechanisms.</p><p>If local actors are to directly access funding, it is vital to build up and strengthen their relevant skills, competencies, and systems as well as their awareness of priorities, success metrics, and funding opportunities.

They thought it was impossible. But I accepted the challenge.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">You know this story so well. You also know this very sad story; people suffered in queues all day, waiting for fuel, gas, medicine and essential items. But today, that country has started breathing. Finally, things are getting better.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Yes, there are still difficulties, little hitches, little concerns. But, we can overcome them. To do that, we must make the economy stronger and more stable. We have come so far on this precarious rope bridge, now we cannot turn back!</p><p>Some say that things feel better now because we do not have to pay back the loans. It's not true. We did pay back the loans, approximately Rs. 2.5 Billion in 2022, and Rs. 2.6 Billion in 2023. The journey we have undertaken through hardships and obstacles has so far been a tremendous path of success. And I intend to complete this journey - with you!</p><p>I was just a UNP MP in the Parliament. Just one man. Eventually, they set fire to my house as well. The entire country was in flames. Nobody believed it was possible to build a peaceful and prosperous country again, a country where people could be free and happy. A by-gone dream. But I rose from ashes. I took the challenge because I have always loved my motherland, I always believed that this country could do better. It was my time to prove it.</p><p>So today, when I see people in my country smiling again, somehow having three meals a day, when I see vehicles back on the roads, and Sinhala and Tamil New Year, Thai Pongal, Ramazan, and Christmas being celebrated, dansalas being initiated everywhere once again during Vesak, I feel a sincere pride. I have achieved the impossible!</p><p>The politicians who fled and hid during the crisis have now come out of their dens and are criticising me. I found Rs. 10 Billion to hold the Presidential Elections in this country again. It is with much compassion I gaze at them.</p><p>Of course, I took over a bankrupt country. But we are gradually gaining speed. We have restructured our debt and we are recovering rhythmically. In 2019, when I left the post of Prime Minister our Gross National Product (GNP) was US$ 89 Billion. But in 2022, when I took over the country as President, it was USD 76.9 Billion. Our GNP has dropped by US$ 12.1 Billion! However, by the end of 2023, we could increase it to US$ 84.4 Billion even amidst a crisis! That is what I call possibility. If we continue to tread this path, we can reach US$ 89 Billion by the end of2025.</p><p>I did all this with just one seat in the Parliament. But I garnered the support of many parties to pass relevant Acts in the Parliament and made plans which are critical for development. All of you, despite your political preferences, extended me your full support. That is why I am contesting this Presidential Election as an independent candidate.</p><p>I do not represent a party or a group of people. I stand for all of you who have varied political views. My service is not only for you who are from the previous and the new generation, but also for those children who are yet to be born, the future generation.</p><p>- Ranil Wickremesinghe</p><p>The manifesto of President Ranil Wickremesinghe; running as an independent candidate at the upcoming Presidential Election; titled \"Five Triumphant Years for Sri Lanka with Ranil\" was unveiled on Thursday (August 29).</p><p>In his policy statement, President Wickremesinghe outlined the priorities of the five-year plan: easing the cost of living, creating jobs, providing tax relief, promoting economic growth and implementing programs to ensure that every citizen has the right to land and a home.</p><p>The manifesto \"Five Triumphant Years for Sri Lanka with Ranil\" comprising five core principles: \"The Theravada Trade Economy, Operation-Beyond 2025, Towards a Prosperous Nation, A Win for the Motherland, and A United Sri Lanka,\" was first presented to religious leaders, led by the Maha Sangha and then to the country's youth by President Wickremesinghe. The President also launched the website <url normalizedValue=\"http://www.ranil2024.lk\">www.ranil2024.lk</url>, which features his manifesto \"Five Triumphant Years for Sri Lanka with Ranil\" as an independent candidate for the upcoming Presidential Election.</p><p>The Theravada Trade Economy will ensure an adequate standard of living for all the citizens. We will be able to create a highly competitive, export-oriented digital green economy through this journey, and we will be able to achieve all our economic goals by 2048. We have already passed and implemented the primary laws aiming for necessary transformation towards such a development stage.</p><p>A separate authority will be established to ensure systematic and expeditious delivery of rights to citizens. This will ensure land ownership to 2 million people through the Urumaya program and the transfer of low-income housing owned by the Government in Colombo city to the residents within 4 years. Loans will be granted at concessional rates to middle-class families for the construction of houses. Low-income families shall be given the opportunity to own their houses in condominiums. New villages will be established for the plantation workers and those living in line rooms will be granted the right to own a plot of land.</p><p>Significant Trade Union representation will be allowed in the Board membership of the Employees' Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees Trust Fund (ETF). Representatives from the Chamber of Commerce will also be included to ensure better financial administration.</p><p>The National Wealth Fund will be formed by combining the budget surplus and the profits of Government institutions. This fund will be invested in local and international stock markets.</p><p>We have been given a foremost place in the World Climate Change Program due to our commitment to addressing climate change. We have launched a number of initiatives in this regard such as the Climate Justice Forum, the Climate Prosperity Plan and the International Climate Change University.</p><p>We are a principal stakeholder of the Global Financing Pact entered into by the countries of the Global North and the Global South under the patronage of France, in order to address the global climate changes. We have also joined the Global Blended Financial Alliance initiated by Indonesia focusing on the countries in the Global South. We have launched a Tropical Region Collaboration program at present with the aim of ensuring environmental safety in the tropical region.</p><p>Farmers will be provided with seeds, fertiliser and modern machinery required for modern agricultural methods. A supply chain where agro-products will be directly purchased from the farmers will be created. Establishment of a chain of storages across the island in order to uplift the rural agriculture industry is also in the works. Home garden cultivations and subsistence crop cultivations in urban apartments will be highly encouraged.</p><p>Three hundred thousand acres of land will be allocated out of the underutilised State Land for commercial crop cultivation. Proper instructions and assistance will be provided to Urumaya freehold deed recipient farmers to expand and improve their cultivations. We will encourage them to use those lands for productive crop cultivation and other agro-enterprises. An amount of Rs. 25,000 will be directly credited to the accounts of farmers for the purchase of fertiliser and other requirements needed for paddy cultivation. A fixed-rate will be declared for the selling price of paddy from season to season.</p><p>Although our island home is surrounded by the ocean, even less than 40 percent of the boats we own at present are utilised for fishing. It is planned to implement a plan to reap maximum benefits from the ocean with the patronage of the local and foreign experts. This is expected to double the income of US$ 300 million we currently earn via fisheries products exportation. The freshwater fishery industry, prawn cultivation, aquatic plants, and ornamental fish industry are expected to be promoted and expanded.</p><p>Economic centres</p><p>The fishery harbours across the island will be developed and upgraded to Fishery Economic Centres. Fishing societies, fishermen, investors and experts will be linked to these centres in order to yield the best out of the economic centres.</p><p>A program to raise the dairy harvest by connecting the National Livestock Development Board with Indian authorities related to the dairy industry is already in progress. This would positively impact the local dairy industry in the aspects of technology and investment.</p><p>The infrastructure required to provide a better experience for the tourists will be upgraded and the tourist arrivals which are 2.5 million will be increased to 5 million within the forthcoming five years. The gross income received to the country from one tourist is currently US$ 150, and it will be increased up to US$ 500 by the year 2035. The cities Colombo, Galle, Kandy and Trincomalee will be developed as the main tourist hubs.</p><p>We will also provide facilities to convert the Eastern coast and Jaffna to high-end tourist destinations. Steps will be taken to further increase the demand for the Southern coastal area. The tourist industry will be expanded to the hill country with better activities and attractions for tourists.</p><p>A new Economic Commission will be established for investment promotion and an Office for Internal Trade will be set up to oversee all aspects related to international trade. Trincomalee is expected to be the Primary Economic Hub which will be equipped with a harbour, efficient transport, industrial facilities, energy generation possibilities and also naval and aviation strength. The Government of India has pledged to assist us in this matter.</p><p>Investments in renewable energy production including green hydrogen will be highly encouraged. It is targeted to obtain 70 percent of the power supply network from renewable energy sources which amounts to 2000 Megawatts by 2030. Sri Lanka will thus be transferred to a Green Energy Hub and it will enable us to export energy to India and other neighbouring countries.</p><p>The latest and the most advanced trends shaping the world in future are Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Automation based on digital technology. AI will be the base of all disciplines in future, health to education to financial and economic sectors.</p><p>A Technology Promotion Act will be passed in the year 2025 with the aim of bringing about a digital transformation. A Digital Transformation Agency and a Technology and Innovation Council will thereon be established. Amendments have already been made to the Sri Lanka Telecommunications Act in an attempt to create the background for this purpose.</p><p>A new entity named Vocational Skills Sri Lanka (VSSL) will be established in the year 2025 amalgamating the National Apprentice and Industrial Training Authority and the Vocational Training Authority of Sri Lanka. All the vocational training schools and centres will be brought under its purview.</p><p>Provincial Vocational Education Boards will be established in all nine provinces before the end of 2026, and all the vocational training centres located in the provinces will be upgraded to vocational schools and brought under the established Provincial Vocational Education Boards. Technical and Vocational and Management University Colleges will be opened in all the provinces. Steps will be taken to award the related degrees upon the completion of an academic period of two years, similar to developed countries.</p><p>Steps will be taken to modernise the school infrastructure system to face the era of technology which will be dawned in 2040. Funding will be provided by the Government. A program to equip teachers with new knowledge and training will be implemented in the year 2025. School education will be revised with a focus on soft skills, life skills and moral values. The system of examinations and evaluations will be revisited enabling the students to start university education at the age of 17 years. \"English for All\" program which provides English education to all the school children will be implemented within the next decade. It has been planned to recruit 2500 English teachers as a short-term remedy to fill the vacancies for English teachers throughout the country; 1000 retired teachers, 400 from Teaching Colleges and 1100 graduates recruited through a competitive examination will come under the aforementioned 2500 new teachers. The graduates recruited will be given a special training for a period of 3 months before their posting.</p><p>A favourable environment will be built for doctors, nurses, other medical professionals and members of the supporting staff, to carry out their duties in a better manner. A key expectation of improving the condition of healthcare personnel is to reduce the brain drain. Local and foreign training opportunities for the medical staff headed by the doctors will be expanded.</p><p>The area from Kalutara to Negombo will be developed into one extensive megapolis. These city planning activities will be carried out in consultation with Surbana Jurong Pvt Ltd of Singapore. Galle, Kandy, Nuwara Eliya and Trincomalee will be transformed into megapolises enriched with all modern-day facilities.</p><p>We have made future plans for the sectors of transport and highways with the aim of providing sustainable green transport services. We will use digital technologies from issuing driving licences to driving vehicles. In order to encourage the use of electrical vehicles, we will establish charging centres around the country.</p><p>Even though the northern economy regrettably collapsed due to the decades-long war, we have already launched plans to revive the country's economy through the Northern Province. Our aim is to strengthen the North into being a major economic stronghold which renders a greater contribution to the Western Province as well as to our economy.</p><p>Trincomalee will be transformed into one of the major economic centres equipped with all aspects such as transport, energy, industries, ports, naval, and aviation. The transformation will be supported by the Government of India. We will develop the Verigalara to Panama-Kumana coastline to utilise them optimally in the tourism industry.</p><p>A Gazette Notification is already issued increasing the wages of plantation workers. In addition to this, a number of specific measures to uplift the living standards of the plantation community will be taken in future.</p><p>None of the political leaders who have boasted about catching thieves took action or showed interest in passing the necessary laws to ensure justice. We did not waste time bragging but discussed with the IMF and adopted modern anti-corruption laws, based on global best practices to prevent bribery and corruption. We will be implementing the Anti-Corruption Agenda to make our country the least corrupt State in South Asia.</p><p>A separate commission for women's rights will be established as per the Women Empowerment Act. We will formulate new policies to support the women suffering from poverty. The current process of liberating women from the burden of micro-finance loans and other debts will be further expanded.</p><p>We will formulate the necessary laws to ensure children's human rights, and child rights while protecting them from abuse, delinquency and child sexual exploitation, within the year 2025.</p><p>Working from home</p><p>We have a series of plans in the works to equip the youth with the knowledge and experience required to one day lead the nation. They will be given opportunities and guidance to generate income by working from home. Training programs will be implemented in the fields of Digital Marketing, Freelancing, E-Commerce, and so on.</p><p>Informal practices and external interferences in the past have led to current weaknesses in sports administration. As a result, our athletes are facing various difficulties. New legislation will be introduced for sports to address this situation. According to the recommendations of the committee appointed on cricket, Sri Lanka Cricket will be restructured.</p><p>We will amend the National Policy for Senior Citizens in 2025. Various activities will be carried out by the Divisional Secretariats and Community Organisations to enhance the social and cultural lives of senior citizens.</p><p>We will take steps to adopt the Sign Language Bill and develop a comprehensive national policy for people with special needs. The building access policies will be revised to ensure that they meet the requirements of individuals with disabilities. We will allocate a special employment quota for such communities.</p><p>Across the country, there are small community groups that often go unnoticed and are marginalised by society. Although these groups have faced different forms of suppression and difficulties, no attention has been given to their requirements so far. We are committed to building a society where no citizen is discriminated against or disadvantaged based on religion, language, caste, gender, political opinion, or place of birth.</p><p>We will increase the salaries of public servants from the range of 24 percent to 50 percent. The lowest salary will be brought up to Rs. 30,000. The Cost of Living allowance will be increased to Rs. 25,000. Government employees below the age of 40 will be given one year's leave with scholarships to follow courses to improve service efficiency. University of Public Policy and Administration will be established. A skills or merit-based promotion system will be introduced. Our plan includes digitalising the entire public service to make it more efficient and streamlined. To support this initiative, we are hoping to provide laptops, tablets, and smart phones at subsidised rates.</p><p>As a result of our economic policies, an increasing number of new enterprises will emerge through local and foreign investments, creating numerous employment opportunities in the future. While this may take a year or two to develop, in the meantime, one hundred thousand new employment opportunities will be provided in the year 2025.</p><p>In 2025, we will launch a new program for youth who do not get through Ordinary Level and Advanced Level examinations. This program, in collaboration with the private sector including tourism and manufacturing industries, will provide vocational training and a monthly allowance of Rs. 35,000 for a period of one year. Private companies could also contribute additional funds to this allowance. They will be provided employment opportunities in those companies after the training.</p><p>We are in the process of amending the Foreign Employment Bureau Act, which will introduce benefits such as housing schemes and daycare centres, to provide them with better facilities and working conditions. We will also be taking steps to enhance foreign employment opportunities. We will establish an Information Centre which will provide continuously updated data on the international job market.</p><p>A large number of people work in the informal labour market, which includes three-wheeler drivers, private bus drivers and conductors, labourers and many others. We will be introducing a contributory pension and social security system for all these workers in 2025. Standardised training will be provided to enhance the professional dignity of these roles. NVQ Level 4 certification courses for female massage therapists have already been introduced.</p><p>Many three-wheeler drivers are currently suffering due to debt. We will be providing the defaulters with an opportunity through State banks to restructure their loans. Discussions will be done to make the arrangements to extend this relief through private banks as well.</p><p>The Security (Special Provisions) Act has now been drafted to enhance the status of our Tri Forces and stabilise the security of the nation. The committee's report on modernising security forces to meet the demands of 2030 has been received, and its recommendations will be implemented. 'One Rank - One Pension' system will be introduced for the Tri Forces. This will eliminate the issues related to pensions of war heroes. Opportunities will be expanded for our military personnel to serve in the UN Peacekeeping Missions.</p><p>The basic foundation of a strong criminal justice system is to create a Police Service consisting of safe, responsible, active, competent, brave and honest officials who ensure the safety of citizens. A Police University will be established to improve the institutional and extracurricular knowledge and skills of police officers. Thereby police officers will be given the opportunity to obtain degrees and post-graduate degrees while in service.</p><p>International standards</p><p>We have planned to build a number of new prisons in accordance with international standards. It is expected to equip these prisons with facilities in the aspects of health, sanitation, food, and welfare services for prisoners and prison officers. This will strengthen the process of rehabilitating prisoners and helping them reintegrate into society as law-abiding citizens. The cases of long-term detainees and those serving lengthy sentences will be reviewed.</p><p>In 2025, we will draft a bill to establish a comprehensive Anti-narcotics Command Headquarters covering all functions from drug control to rehabilitation of drug addicts, and ensure that it is passed in 2025 itself.</p><p>The invaluable heritage found at the historical sites of Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa should be further studied and utilised for the benefit of the country. We aim to give priority to peace and eliminate disputes that are found in the values of governance in the Eastern world. While promoting non-violence, kindness and compassion, we would also seek to be nourished by the lessons from the Western world.</p><p>We are looking forward to establishing a digital museum dedicated to Buddhist civilisation of the historic city of Kandy. Measures will be taken to utilise AI and new technologies to study the Thripitakaya. Establishing Mahavihara University is another important objective we have.</p><p>Sri Lanka now has world famous writers and it is our responsibility to facilitate and encourage their writing. We will establish an International Fine Arts and Cultural Centre near Ananda Coomarswamy Mawatha by combining the Nelum Pokuna Theatre, John De Silva Theatre, the Science Museum, Mahaweli Centre, and the New Town Hall Premises. This centre shall provide the facilities to improve the skills of the local artists, and produce art of international standard. This centre will be named the Ananda Coomaraswamy Arts and Cultural Centre. A South Asian Cultural Centre and a Museum for Modern and Contemporary Art will be established in the same premises. This task will be commenced in 2025.</p><p>Both multi-community media and modern media are needed to create a sensitive society. We will be drafting a national journalism policy and building a strong foundation to creating a society that values humanity, discipline, loyalty and integrity. We will empower and strengthen journalists and freelance writers. A higher education institute on journalism will be established in 2025. We will work towards solving the issues faced by the regional journalists. An Electronic Media Regulatory Commission will be established to generate a transparent media environment which holds values.</p><p>Two years ago, the economic crisis shattered the people's hopes in all aspects. People lost the hope of moving forward. But now, the time has come for everyone to be united and come together to create a beautiful future for the country. The future which we will be creating will benefit all citizens equally, irrespective of ethnicity. No citizen who speaks in Tamil should be neglected by the Sinhala community, and similarly, no citizen who speaks in Sinhala should be neglected by the Tamil and Muslim communities.</p><p>We will make sure that an atmosphere where people from different ethnicities and religions could live harmoniously like relatives and friends, will be created.</p><p>We will devolve power to the Provincial Councils as per the Constitution. The powers of the Provincial Councils that come under Schedule 1, which are now vested under the Central Government will be devolved back to the Provincial Councils.</p><p>The decision of vesting police powers to Provincial Councils will be decided by the new Parliament. The powers given under Schedule 3 that are approved by the party leaders will be given to the Provincial Councils.</p><p>New Constitution</p><p>Several key reforms need to be made in order to rebuild the country to make the future stronger. I will give the Parliament the responsibility of drafting a new Constitution within a year after the forthcoming Parliamentary Election following the Presidential Election. The new Parliament will need to decide whether or not to abolish the Executive Presidency.</p><p>The new Parliament will introduce a new election procedure based on the recommendations presented by the Commission headed by the retired Chief Justice Priyasath Dep in making the election reforms.</p><p>The political parties in Europe are following systems of high standards in maintaining transparency. We will introduce new rules and regulations regarding election expenditure and other activities of political parties.</p><p>The Parliamentary Standards Act will come into force and it will contain sections enabling the removal of Parliamentary Members who strongly violate the standards given in the Act. It will enact the laws that prevent the elected representatives from doing business with the government.</p><p>One of the main methods where people's sovereignty is exercised, is through voting, which takes place at the Presidential, Parliamentary and Provincial Council election levels. The Peoples' Initiative Act will further enable citizens to submit proposals to the Parliament. In this manner, citizens could be directly involved in the law and policy-making process of the country. This Act will further strengthen democracy practiced in the country.</p><p>The aim of the Jana Sabha is to have the active participation of provincial and rural communities in the decision-making process. Currently, several pilot projects are being implemented in this regard. We will establish Jana Sabhas with representatives from the 50,000 villages in the country dispersed throughout 14,002 Grama Niladhari Divisions.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

He said the country's first-ever pavilion at the international event was a serious undertaking.</p><p>Dr. Jasinghe, by contrast, was seen hard at work, making numerous interventions and representations for Sri Lanka in many spaces. The result of this year's COP was underwhelming from a developing country's point of view, he concurred.</p><p>'The Global Stocktake revealed that progress was insufficient,' he said. 'The target was to cut 43% of emissions by 2030 compared to 2019 globally, which hasn't happened.'</p><p>Consequently, the GST has called on parties to triple RE capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030; and to produce ambitious economy-wide emission reduction targets.

Prof. Munasinghe has developed innovative concepts such as the integrative, trans-disciplinary Sustainomics framework, Balanced Inclusive Green Growth (BIGG) and Millennium Consumption Goals (MCG).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In a candid interview with the , Prof. Munasinghe shared his thoughts about impacts of climate change, sustainable post-pandemic recovery, and his vision for Sri Lanka.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Q How do you feel about receiving the 2021 Blue Planet Prize?</p><p>I felt deeply grateful and honoured when I received the award notification from Japan, and even a little surprised - why me, since there were other colleagues worldwide, who also had outstanding credentials. While meditating that morning (which I have done daily for over 50 years), I realized how the award is not just one person's achievement, and how indebted I am to so many who have contributed generously to my intellectual development and emotional intelligence, including teachers, mentors, colleagues, family and friends. The pressures of COVID-19 further remind us that social ties are invaluable, and should never be taken for granted.</p><p>It was quite encouraging that the award committee has specifically acknowledged several key concepts I developed and their practical application worldwide, during almost 5 decades, including the Sustainomics framework, sustainable development triangle (economy, environment, society), balanced inclusive green growth (BIGG), and Millennium Consumption Goals (MCG).</p><p>On reflection, my research interests have evolved from basic disciplines like engineering, physics and economics,</p><p>to application sectors like energy, water, transport, ICT, and environmental resources, and finally to multidisciplinary topics like poverty, disasters, climate change and sustainable development. This eclectic personal journey helped me develop Sustainomics, as a holistic, trans-disciplinary methodology.Drawing on my past work and the global platform provided by the prestigious Blue Planet Prize, I hope to continue my modest efforts to make our planet more sustainable for all.</p><p>Q You have worked many years in the fields of sustainable development and climate change. Are you satisfied with how humanity has performed in bringing about changes in these two areas?</p><p>The current world status is summed up by the two major international achievements of 2015 -- the United Nations 2030 Agenda and sustainable development goals (SDG), and the COP21 Paris Agreement on Climate Change. The progress made so far is disappointing.In fact, we are even further behind compared to the high hopes I had when we launched the historic Agenda 21 and UNFCCC at the 1992 UN earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.</p><p>Q Indeed, the UN SDGs and COP21 Paris Agreement of 2015 are major global accords where your research and applications made significant contributions. What's the impact such events have had in helping us to address sustainable development and climate change issues?</p><p>Both agreements are early steps on a long human journey towards sustainability and climate stability. However, we have failed to achieve significant milestones in recent years. Progress on the SDG are quite limited at best, and country pledges on carbon mitigation are far below the levels needed to limit global temperature rise to 1.5Cdeg or even 2Cdeg, which are considered dangerous thresholds. Furthermore, adaptation efforts are also inadequate to protect the poorest and most vulnerable, who will unfairly suffer the harshest climate impacts. Basically, climate justice has been ignored, which requires that the rich (who caused the problem) should bear the main cost burden, while the poorest must be protected from impacts.</p><p>Q You introduced the key concept of 'Sustainomics'. Tell us a little about it...</p><p>Sustainomics is a comprehensive and integrated trans-disciplinary framework, which I first presented at the 1992 Rio Earth Summit. It sets out a step-by-step methodology to make development more sustainable, based on balanced consideration of economic, social and environmental concerns, using trans-disciplinary thinking and a range of analytical tools. During the past two decades, the approach has been successfully applied practically, worldwide. The four core principles are:</p><p>1. The sustainable development triangle --integrating and harmonizing the three dimensions (economic, social and environmental). Any critical sustainable development issue like poverty may be analysed in terms of all three dimensions, and their interactions - for example, the poor are economically destitute,socially disempowered, and live in environmentally degraded neighbourhoods. Furthermore, the social and economic interaction results in increased inequalities.</p><p>2. 'Making Development More Sustainable' (MDMS), which is essentially using a step-by-step method that empowers people to take immediate action without waiting for instructions from leaders. You and I could simply identify and eliminate many existing unsustainable activities - by conserving energy and water, planting trees, etc.</p><p>3. Transcending traditional boundaries in our thinking, to bring about sustainable behavioural changes in the longer term. Replacing unsustainable values like greed with sound ethical principles, especially among the young, must go hand in hand with raising awareness across every sector of society.Implementing sustainable development requires cooperation that transcends stakeholder boundaries - across government, business and civil society.Trans-disciplinary analysis is essential, and we must transcend geographic scaleswith global level planning and temporal scales over decades or centuries.</p><p>4. Full life cycle, integrated,long-term analysis to ensure implementation of sustainable development activities, especially consumption and production -- that covers the entire value/supply chain, identifying hot spots where process innovation can improve sustainability, reducing material use, and eliminating waste.</p><p>Q Many are of the view that the COVID-19 pandemic helped restore the environment and give nature a break. Do you think the pandemic is a blessing in disguise or has it posed more challenges in achieving the SDG?</p><p>The term \"anthropause\" has been coined to describe temporary improvements in various environmental indicators (especially carbon dioxide emissions) that followed COVID-19 lockdowns. However, I strongly disagree that a disease that has already killed millions worldwide and greatly increased poverty, inequality, unemployment and hardship, could be called a \"blessing in disguise\". On the contrary, the pandemic should be considered a cautionary lesson about Mother Nature's harsh response to human environmental abuse - I have described 9 lessons learned, in a 2020 journal article: \"COVID-19 and sustainable development\".</p><p>One important lesson is that the anthropause is an unsustainable outcome, because it violates the first core concept of Sustainomics, by severely unbalancing the sustainable development triangle. While the pandemic may have temporarily improved environmental conditions, the economic and social costs are very high, with impacts falling disproportionately on the poorest and most vulnerable. Indeed, the achievement of many key SDG have been set back significantly due to socio-economic impacts of the pandemic.</p><p>Fortunately, there are other and more benign ways to reduce environmental resource use, without drastically reducing living standards, through an approach called the \"balanced inclusive green growth\" (BIGG) path, as described below.</p><p>Q Can a country become fully sustainable in this competitive global environment, particularly in the face of a pandemic?</p><p>The pandemic is just one shorter term problem among many others (like poverty, inequality, environmental degradation and conflicts), on a rocky long term path towards sustainable development. SDG12 on Responsible Consumption and Production is a key sustainability requirement for which the Millennium Consumption Goals (MCG) I introduced at the UN in 2010, was a key building block.The MCG sought to reduce the unsustainable consumption of the rich which was exceeding the sustainable eco-capacity of the planet, while leaving inadequate resources to reduce poverty and inequality. It facilitates balanced inclusive green growth (BIGG -- based on Sustainomics), to help countries become more sustainable. Several countries are trying to pursue BIGG paths.</p><p>Rich nations at point C are already unsustainable and exceeding safe ecological limits. They should take one step towards sustainability by first balancing economy and environment. They can reach sustainable point E by reducing environmental resource use without lowering their quality of life,as envisaged in the MCG--using new resource efficient technologies, lifestyle changes, and other measures, to dematerialize modern economies. Meanwhile, emerging nations at intermediate point B should learn from the past, innovate and avoid exceeding safe limits. They could go through the Green Growth (GG) tunnel to also reach point E, avoiding the unsustainable path of the rich countries.</p><p>However, we need to go beyond Green Growth, to ensure that social goals are met. In the second step,the BIGG path also adds pro-poor and inclusive policies to Green Growth-thereby fully harmonizing the sustainable development triangle: economy, environment and society. Furthermore, the same BIGG path is generally available for other types of resources like energy, food and water.</p><p>Q Like every other country Sri Lanka too is a victim of climate change. Has climate change changed Sri Lanka's weather patterns, food production cycles, and lifestyles?</p><p>It is too early to identify major impacts in Sri Lanka that are unambiguously attributable to climate change, but some preliminary trends in temperature and precipitation are emerging. We experience warming of around 0.8degC during the 20th century, with temperature rise accelerating toward the end. This trend will continue. Meanwhile, annual precipitation has decreased about 7% in the late 20thcentury, compared to the period 1931-1960. However, future rainfall is projected to rise, especially in the hills.</p><p>Extreme events and disaster risks will rise, with future increases in heat waves and permanent (chronic) heat stress. The intensity of extreme rainfall events is likely to rise, with more flooding (both inland and coastal areas) and landslides (especially in the hill country). By the 2030s, floods would affect thousands of people, with annual GDP losses exceeding US$300 million. Paradoxically, droughts will worsen especially in the dry zone, with reduced rainfall, river basin flows and reservoir storage. Finally, cyclone frequency has declined recently, but their intensity has increased, underlining the need for future disaster risk management. More broadly, nine vulnerable sectors were identified in recent consultations -- food security, water, coastal sector, health, human settlements, bio-diversity, tourism and recreation, export development and industry-energy-transportation.</p><p>Q What three things should Sri Lanka keep in mind, as it is becoming a geopolitically important location with developments such as the Port City?</p><p>In order to become a \"sustainable, upper middle income Indian Ocean hub\" following the BIGG path, as envisaged in the Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision report (described below), we should aim to:</p><p>1. Maximize the geo-strategic advantages of our unique location and emulate the success of ports like Dubai to the west and Singapore to the East, by taking the lead in focused areas like digital and financial technology and banking, port and maritime facilities, high-end tourism(nature- and culture-based), etc., while greatly upgrading our infrastructure services in critical areas like energy, water, communications, skilled workforce (especially in science, technology, engineering and mathematics - STEM), etc.</p><p>2. Provide improved governance, including policy consistency, fair and investor-friendly regulations, convenience in doing business, tax incentives, etc.</p><p>3. Follow a strictly non-aligned foreign policy - carefully balancing major international forces, supporting a multi-polar world order, and riding the wave of rising Asian dominance in this century (paying attention to China, India, Japan, Russia and other emerging Asian powers), while maintaining cordial relations with our major markets in the west.</p><p>Q You are also the first Sri Lankan to share the Nobel Peace Prize. Is there enough space in Sri Lanka for intellectuals to grow and contribute to the wellbeing of the country? Or has Sri Lanka continued to facilitate a brain drain? Tell us your experiences.</p><p>Sri Lankans have consistently excelled internationally -- having enjoy ededucational advantages much superior to most comparable developing countries. However, this edge is now eroding and we need to seriously revamp our entire educational system to compete in the modern world. Focusing on STEM subjects is critical, but new areas like emotional intelligence, sustainability, and multi-disciplinarity are also important to produce practical, rational, well-rounded citizens who can contribute to sustainable development along the BIGG path (as detailed in the Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision report described below).</p><p>The brain drain is not unique to Sri Lanka. We must strive to make our country attractive to our youth, so that they either stay here and grow intellectually, or return after a stint abroad bringing fresh intellectual and financial capital to their motherland. Above all, building a true Sri Lankan identity from an early age, will help enormously.</p><p>One small practical contribution is through my institute (MIND). Since 2000, our scholarships have funded almost 500 undergraduates. We also hosted many graduate students as \"fellows\", and supported some school-goers (especially 2004 Tsunami-orphans). We maintain contact via digital technology with this MIND family, as \"ambassadors of sustainable development\" who will transform Sri Lanka and the world. To reach young minds, I also continue to deliver sustainable development university courses, public lectures, webinars, etc. To reach millions of young hearts, I helped found Sustainomusica (at the Rio+20 Earth Summit in 2012) -- a musicians network harmonizing the planet by creating \"music for sustainability\".</p><p>Q Where do you see Sri Lanka in another 10-20 years' time? As a country that braces to become a sustainable nation or a country that has moved away from it?</p><p>Sri Lanka could become a world leader in sustainable development, provided we immediately start following the comprehensive recommendations in 2019 Presidential Expert Committee (PEC) report on \"Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision and Strategic Path\".</p><p>This document describes the country status, key issues and opportunities relating to sustainable development, future priorities and targets, and new initiatives and options to achieve ambitious goals by 2030. The report empowers citizens, and provides guidance to government, civil society and business. The key findings are essentially robust and neutral, helping to build the national consensus and a truly Sri Lankan identity -- irrespective of ethnicity, race, religion or political affiliation. The report could continue to provide strategic guidance to all present and future governments, while strengthening sustainability and national unity.</p><p>By 2030 Sri Lanka would become a sustainable, upper middle income Indian Ocean hub that is economically prosperous, competitive and advanced; environmentally green and flourishing; and socially inclusive, harmonious, peaceful and just.</p><p>Q How can one expect to see change from individual, national and global perspectives?</p><p>It is important to start with oneself, before trying to save the planet- by \"harmonizing the personal sustainability triangle\"and becoming a mature, content and well-balanced individual. There are three key elements including: (1) good career and income: (2) robust physical health; and (3) thriving social links including family and friends;to build a wholesome and decent persona, having both emotional and mental intelligence. Balancing these three internal elements will create a global population that can build a sustainable planet more effectively.</p><p>From a planetary perspective, the impacts of global issues like COVID-19 and climate change are \"mother nature's\" feedback loops, reminding us that human activities are environmentally unsustainable. We need to correct the \"unhealthy\" relationship between ecological and socio economic systems. If we do not change, it will not be the end of the world. The earth will certainly continue as it has for billions of years, but perhaps with a diminished human presence or none - a relatively minor blip in the greater scheme of things.</p><p>However, from our narrower, human-centric viewpoint, matters look more serious. Returning to a pre-pandemic, business-as-usual path is unsustainable. Adopting limited reforms (due to inertia of existing power structures) will merely stave off disaster temporarily. Only a transformative path like BIGG offers a safe and sustainable future for all. By adopting rational, science-based approaches and working together, we can make this third (and right) choice, to avoid enormous suffering and millions of unnecessary deaths in the future.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

The completion of a lengthy process in a remarkably short time is a significant triumph for our country.</p><p>Moreover, we have successfully fostered positive bilateral relations with Western countries like France and Germany, as well as with Middle Eastern nations such as Iran, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE).</p><p>This has not only led to the creation of job opportunities but has also initiated discussions on potential investment opportunities.</p><p>The President is adeptly managing these international affairs. His leadership skills, knowledge of international law, and experience in international relations have been instrumental in effectively handling these matters.</p><p>Q: What notable advancements were achieved during the recent visit of the President to Dubai for COP28?</p><p>A: The trip yielded numerous benefits for us. While Climate Change is widely acknowledged as a significant concern, concrete solutions have been elusive. We put forward the idea of establishing a Climate Justice Forum (CJF) to address this issue. The proposed Forum aims to unite countries, allowing them to collectively advocate for Climate Justice. As a nation with a strong voice dating back to before 1983, this trip provided an opportunity for us to reclaim a substantial role in such initiatives.</p><p>During the visit, we garnered positive attention from the global community. Engaging in discussions with several world leaders, including the Presidents of Brazil, Greece and France and regional leaders, further strengthened our diplomatic ties. Additionally, productive dialogues with the investment communities in Dubai allowed us to elaborate on the investment opportunities present in Sri Lanka.</p><p>Q: Has the Government successfully concluded the second phase of negotiations with the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and when is the expected release date for the second loan installment?</p><p>A: I am optimistic that the second loan installment from the IMF will be received this month. This is expected to instill a greater sense of confidence in our country within the international community.</p><p>A comparative analysis with the preceding year will serve as a gauge to assess the effectiveness and correctness of the path we have chosen. We have successfully managed to control inflation, eliminate queues, and reopen opportunities for tourists to visit. When comparing these outcomes, it appears evident that we are moving in the right direction.</p><p>Q: How positively has the Official Creditor Committee responded to the restructuring of Sri Lanka's foreign debt, and to what degree can this be considered a successful outcome influenced by the second installment of the IMF?</p><p>A: From the initial loan installment to the second, our journey has been exceptionally challenging. Nations such as Venezuela, Argentina, Zimbabwe, and Lebanon, which underwent similarly difficult paths, experienced an economic collapse lasting approximately 10-15 years. Considering our successful navigation of this demanding journey through prudent management, we have fared well in comparison.</p><p>Q: What economic benefits and support does our country expect to receive from the second loan tranche provided by the IMF?</p><p>A: Firstly, the receipt of the second IMF tranche sends a message globally that our country is on the right economic path. Subsequently, upon receiving these funds, the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) are likely to follow suit, providing additional financial support. This, in turn, allows for a portion of the funds to be utilized in supporting the National Treasury's budget. If successful, this approach could mitigate the need to purchase high-interest Bonds, enabling the acquisition of loans at a more favourable rate.</p><p>Subsequently, the expectation is that market loan interest rates will experience a significant decrease. With interest rates potentially reduced to 10-11 percent, businesses could seize the opportunity to secure loans and initiate new ventures through available financial facilities. The second loan installment is seen as a substantial aid in fortifying and revitalising the economy.</p><p>Q: How is the current process of restructuring foreign debt unfolding, and what is the global response to it?</p><p>A: The response has been positive thus far. Domestic Debt Restructuring (DDR) has been completed. Encouraging responses have also been received regarding the management of bilateral credit, representing two major categories of international credit. The second category involves discussions about loans secured from the private sector in Sri Lanka, facilitated by Lazard, our financial advisor.</p><p>The debt restructuring is expected to be completed by the first quarter of the upcoming year, allowing the country to resume foreign debt repayments and potentially emerge from financial distress. Information received thus far indicates a strong willingness from Japan and some other countries to make significant investments in our country.</p><p>Q: Can the Government announce a specific timeframe regarding the repayment of the loans?</p><p>A: Following debt restructuring, the priority is debt repayment. The aim is to conclude the debt restructuring by the first quarter of next year, initiating bilateral debt repayments in the second quarter.</p><p>The approach involves prioritising low-interest payments and gradually settling the agreed-upon loans. This strategy is anticipated to contribute to the reduction of the overall debt, with the ultimate goal of revitalising the economy for a substantial and long-term recovery.</p><p>Q: The Opposition claims that the Government is imposing various hardships on the people under the guise of IMF conditions. Your comment?</p><p>A: Whether or not the IMF conditions are imposed, our options are rather limited. When income does not align with expenditure, the only recourse generally is currency devaluation.</p><p>This is indeed exemplified by the rise of the US Dollar from Rs. 200 to almost Rs. 400 in just over one year. Inflation surged, and the economy faced collapse, forcing us into taking challenging decisions. Despite Opposition criticism, the question remains: what viable alternatives do they propose?</p><p>Q: Is the Government on track to achieve its goal of boosting State revenue through an increase in income tax?</p><p>A: That is our aspiration, albeit a challenging one. However, it is crucial to reach the desired tax targets. Failing to establish the necessary foundation for a sustainable economy could lead to the collapse of our economy. To safeguard our country, certain sacrifices may be inevitable.</p><p>Q: Do you share the perspective that, irrespective of the Government in office until 2027, a certain economic direction is unavoidable, as asserted by economic experts who contend that there might be no feasible alternative?</p><p>A: Expert economists emphasise that deviating from the current path could lead to an economic collapse, potentially worse than anticipated. The consequence might involve public dissatisfaction, manifesting in street protests similar to those witnessed last year. Making challenging decisions is deemed necessary to guide the country in the right direction.</p><p>Q: What recent decisions have been made regarding future Foreign Direct Investment (FDI)?</p><p>A: Following any investment, the anticipation is for a return in profits. Recognising this situation, the President has taken steps to prepare the required groundwork. Amendments are being made to facilitate this process, with an expectation that the essential groundwork will be established through the second installment of the IMF.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

The threat of debt distress or debt default is further exacerbated by the climate crisis, which causes additional risks and requires significant investment to fulfil national obligations and build long-term resilience.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">For climate-vulnerable developing countries facing serious debt-related challenges-including Sri Lanka-it is therefore crucial to understand the climate-debt nexus and identify ways to reconcile the need for green economic growth, debt sustainability, and climate action.</p><p>Connecting debt and climate change</p><p>'Sovereign debt' describes funds borrowed by a country from a creditor, which could be, for example, another country, a multilateral institution, or the private sector. The resulting debt must be repaid with interest over a specified period in line with contractual terms and conditions. If a country faces difficulties in servicing its debt on time or in full, it experiences debt distress, which can lead to debt default and a range of associated financial, political, and/or reputational costs and consequences.</p><p>Climate change can interlink with debt in several ways. On the one hand, climate impacts and climate-induced loss and damage can exacerbate countries' debt problems by forcing them to borrow funds for relief, recovery, and reconstruction efforts that exceed their available budget allocations. On the other hand, high and/or unsustainable debt constrains the fiscal space of governments and hinders them from funding adaptation and resilience-building measures, rendering them more vulnerable in the mid and long term. Furthermore, climate vulnerability and lack of resilience can also increase debt ratings and the costs of borrowing, especially from private creditors.</p><p>Existing debt also reduces the ability of countries to invest in climate action and fulfil their commitments under the Paris Agreement, such as those submitted via the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs). In some cases, high debt can incentivise governments to look at unsustainable options with higher short-term returns, such as fossil fuels or the unsustainable exploitation of natural resources. Additionally, a sizeable proportion of global climate finance is currently provided in the form of loans, thereby creating additional debt for the countries receiving it.</p><p>Other considerations related to climate change and debt could include the supply side and existing subsidies for sectors such as energy and agriculture; the role of climate technology transfer and deployment in creating debt; legal frameworks and governance gaps; the integration of climate-related indicators into debt sustainability and financial health assessments; and relevant climate negotiation agenda items, such as the loss and damage fund, adaptation finance, or the new collective quantified goal on climate finance, which will be a centrepiece of this year's World Climate Conference (COP29).</p><p>Responding to unsustainable debt</p><p>Creditors and debtors have a range of instruments and mechanisms that can address debt distress and enhance debt sustainability. This includes, for example, debt suspension and climate-resilient debt clauses; debt restructuring, rescheduling, or refinancing; debt cancellation; debt swaps (including debt-for-climate and debt-for-nature swaps); insurance mechanisms (such as parametric insurance or sovereign risk pools); bonds (including catastrophe bonds, resilience bonds, or green and blue bonds); and tax reform.</p><p>However, many debt-related challenges remain and are exacerbated by the worsening climate crisis.

I thank the Australian Government, for the hospitality afforded to all of us. I also thank the India Foundation for once again bringing us together. The theme of this Conference - \"Towards a Stable and Sustainable Indian Ocean\"- could not be timelier and more appropriate.</p><p>The Australasian continent is unique in that it has borders with both the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Oceans. Perth played a crucial role in the history of Sri Lanka - Australia relations. During World War II, Royal Canadian Air Force, Catalina Flying Boats, traversed the expanse of the Indian Ocean, connecting Perth with Koggala Air Base in Ceylon. The only air link between the Indian sub-continent and Australia. Known as flights of the double sunrise, they operated a non-stop route upto 32 hours in radio silence, to ensure the success of a critical air route during World War II for the Allies.</p><p>The Japanese attacks in April 1942 on the Indian Ocean specially Ceylon was described by Churchill as the most dangerous moment of the war highlighting the importance of the Indian Ocean to the British Empire. I was just talking with Dr. Balakrishnan and he said there were no carrier battles in the Indian Ocean for the simple reason that the Japanese sank the only British carrier.</p><p>Let me highlight a few important developments which I hope will make a contribution to your deliberations.</p><p>Firstly, historically speaking, the Indian Ocean is multipolar and has resisted domination by a single power. This multipolarity is a reflection of the essence of the Indian Ocean region and its people. As Asia emerged from colonialism the newly independent countries of Asia ie. Ceylon, India, Indonesia, Burma and Pakistan convened the Bandung Conference in 1955 to oppose colonialism in all its forms. The conference declaration to oppose big power rivalry in turn led to the Non Aligned Movement. Since then the Indian Ocean region has been influenced by the spirit of Bandung. It has never became a part of the US Hub and Spoke system.</p><p>The past two decades has seen the emergence of diverse framings of the Indian Ocean region and a flurry of diplomatic activity articulating various policy positions, tilts, and frameworks. What is clear is that no single, objective geopolitical construct has emerged, and we are left instead with a contested vision with multiple interpretations.</p><p>The key frameworks that have emerged include in addition to IORA, the Indo-Pacific, the BRI, the QUAD, and the BRICS. There are also regional organizations including ASEAN, ARF (ASEAN Regional Forum), ACD (Asia Cooperation Dialogue) BIMSTEC, SAARC, GCC, Arab League, OIC, SADC, EAC and SCO that have been established. Additionally, we have the operational arrangements that deal with specific areas of cooperation including RCEP, IONS, the Djibouti Code of Conduct, IOTC, Indian Ocean Commission (IOC), MASE, four regional Information Fusion Centres (Singapore, India, Seychelles and Madagascar), and the CGPCS (Contact Group on Piracy off the Coast of Somalia).</p><p>Along with these frameworks and groupings, we also see an increased militarization of the Indian Ocean which is redefining power balances and alliances. In the maritime space we see a building up in naval capabilities in India, and with USA, Australia, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and China all increasing their naval presence significantly. Therefore, balancing between the great power rivalries is becoming an increasingly more complex task. As a result, the space for manoeuvrability for littoral states is shrinking fast as this rivalry in the Indian Ocean region intensifies and spills over into decision making on political, economic and security issues. The proverbial question to choose one over the other is perennially hanging over us.</p><p>Secondly, the geopolitical developments have resulted in an increase in the strategic importance of the Western Indian Ocean that was not foreseen four years ago. This in turn is shifting the geopolitical emphasis towards the Indian Ocean. The Ukrainian war, and the consequent Western sanctions on Russia has resulted in the resource rich economy finding new markets in China and the Western Indian Ocean. For e.g. Russian Crude Oil is refined in the Gulf refineries. Dubai has replaced London as the financial centre for the oligarchs. Russia has developed a closer friendship with Iran, which is an important source of supply for drones. Russia is carrying on naval exercises with Indian Ocean countries, including Myanmar and South Africa.</p><p>China itself has played an active role in healing the rift between Iran and Saudi Arabia. Iran and its allies have become important players in West Asia. The Shanghai Cooperation Organisation, with India, Pakistan and Iran as members have the Western Indian Ocean as its outer limits.</p><p>The ill-advised judgment of the US in supporting the Gaza war will diminish its influence in the region. The hostility of the countries forming the Islamic Arch in the Indian Ocean will prevent any close rapprochement with the US for some time. The Russian, Chinese and Iranian strategies are successfully biting at the US hegemony thereby further weakening the US. The Indian Ocean stability requires an early end to the Gaza war followed by,</p><p>a. the establishment within 5 years of an Independent Palestine State and</p><p>b. guarantees for the security of the state of Israel.</p><p>Thirdly, the recent attacks on commercial vessels by the Yemen-based Houthi rebels, is a challenge to the 'Freedom of Navigation'. We have to ensure access and mobility in the Suez Canal, Red Sea, Bab-el-Mandeb and the Gulf of Aden. In addition, we also face the threat of Somali Pirates, once again. The safety of undersea cables and critical infrastructure are also facing additional threats. The presence of drugs in the Indian Ocean and Human Smuggling has increased. IUU fishing still takes place. These threats present challenges to the Freedom of Navigation. We need to refocus on the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean. Sri Lanka offers to recommence the discussions on the Freedom of Nation in the Indian Ocean.</p><p>Fourth, is expanding connectivity. According to estimates there will be an eight-fold increase in the GDP of India and Indonesia by 2050. Similar increases are expected in some of the other countries in South and West Asia. This requires additional port capacities and new transport routes. The Suez Canal may not be sufficient. In this regard India's two new connectivity initiatives are welcome. Firstly, the India (Mumbai) - Iran - Russia corridor and secondly the India (Mumbai) - Middle East - Europe corridor. Similarly, there are connectivity initiatives taking place in the Bay of Bengal. Work has already commenced on the Chongqing - Kyaukphyu corridor giving access to Western China. Thailand is planning the Kra land bridge connecting the Gulf of Siam with the Bay of Bengal. India and Sri Lanka are commencing feasibility studies on land connectivity between the two countries making Sri Lanka a Regional Logistics Hub with Colombo and Trincomalee ports available to South India.</p><p>The Indian Ocean Conference theme this year \"Towards a more stable and sustainable Indian Ocean\" highlights the two key areas which require our focus. What I have outlined before, dealt primarily with pursuing stability of the region. There is an equally serious, more immediate and existential threat that looms and that is the Climate Crisis.</p><p>Experts have revealed that the Indian Ocean is warming at a higher rate than the other oceans around the world. The levels of warming are estimated to be three times higher than in the Pacific Ocean and coastal areas across the IOR will experience continuous rise in sea levels and face severe coastal erosion. The Indian Ocean is also rising at a level of 3.7 millimetres annually and extreme sea disasters are inevitable. The island states of the IOR are vulnerable and have to be provided with adequate resources to mitigate the effects of climate change. Changes at sea also affect monsoon patterns and in turn impact on agriculture and food security across the Indian Ocean region. They also impact on the biodiversity and in turn on food and livelihood of people of the littoral states.</p><p>The Indian Ocean presents opportunities in terms of ecology. Not only is it our biggest sink for Carbon, but it also provides potential for mitigating the climate crisis, through offshore wind, solar, and wave energy. Through seaweed farming and mangrove cultivation we can increase the sequestration of Carbon. Sustainable exploitation of our Ocean's resources is critical for our survival, as the Ocean provides for our future.</p><p>At COP 28 Sri Lanka proposed three key initiatives, (1) the Tropical Belt Initiative, including the Indian Ocean (2) The International Climate Change University and the Climate Justice Forum. As the current Chair of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) Sri Lanka is focusing on the interdependence between the Indian Ocean and climate change. The Climate Justice Forum aims to accelerate financing of losses and damages and includes debt justice as an essential component of the overall solution. Any proposals for mitigation and adaptation interventions must take into account the debt component faced by Climate-vulnerable and developing countries.</p><p>We are living in uncertain times. The stability we had taken for granted since the end of WWII and the Cold War is unravelling. Globalisation is being challenged as is multilateralism. The Climate Crisis is affecting prospects for trade and economic development around the world. It is impacting on food security, livelihoods, supply chains, biodiversity and maritime transportation. Either we can wait for global developments to dictate our fate or unite, so that we may chart our own course.</p><p>Creating a safer ocean environment by building confidence and predictability among users and enhancing ocean situational awareness will be key to maintaining peace and security in the Indian Ocean. The main platform that can undertake this important task is the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA). Ensuring a peaceful and secure Indian Ocean would facilitate sustainable use of oceans for the economic and social benefit of coastal and littoral states.</p><p>An overarching architecture for the Indian Ocean that deals with critical issues is required. The basis for such a structure is already in existence including the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (1982) and the recently adopted BBNJ agreement in 2023 on the conservation and sustainable use of marine biological diversity of areas beyond national jurisdiction or the High Seas Treaty.</p><p>A Code of Conduct on freedom of navigation and over flight and unimpeded commerce and similar guiding principles on dealing with the climate crisis and the sustainable use of the Indian Ocean are a necessity. Only the leaders of the IORA countries can ensure that these measures are translated to the creation of an overarching regional architecture for the Indian Ocean region. Therefore the responsibility lies with us.</p><p>I thank you.\"</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Hiru News.

This forum comes as part of the on-going efforts to address the triple planetary crisis of climate change, biodiversity loss and pollution with a focus on sustainable multilateral actions."]}, {"relevance_score": 32, "title": "Civil society organisations, individuals express concerns over proposed Truth Unity and Reconciliation Commission", "published": "2024-03-11", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Over 30 organisations and 40 individuals and activists have written to the Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation Mechanism Director General Dr. Asanga Gunawansa expressing concerns regarding the proposed Truth Unity and Reconciliation Commission (TURC).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We, activists, and civil society organisations from, as well as working in the North and the East with war affected communities write to you regarding the proposed Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation (hereinafter the Commission). Some of us have engaged with the Interim Secretariat for Truth and Reconciliation Mechanisms (ISTRM), including attending the meetings organised by the Secretariat on 9 and/or 26 February 2024 to discuss the proposed Commission.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">We draw your attention once again to the four statements issued by civil society organisations in the North and East in 2023 setting out their concerns about the proposed Commission as well as their demands to the Government. These demands consist mainly of measures to build trust and repair the severely damaged social contract between Tamil citizens and the state. To date, the government has not taken action to implement even a single demand set out in these statements, thereby validating our concern about the lack of political will to provide substantive solutions to the Tamil people where truth, justice and reparations are concerned.</p><p>Our scepticism was further affirmed by the failure of the ISTRM to conduct wide ranging consultations with the war affected communities in the North and the East during their consultation process. Only a handful of organisations and activists from the North and East were invited to the meetings held in Colombo on 9 and 26 February despite concerted advocacy for greater inclusion. For instance, the ISTRM did not even attempt to meet the families of the disappeared in the North and East, a critical stakeholder in the transitional justice process. Given that the Commission for Truth, Unity and Reconciliation Bill states its focus is 'the conflict which took place in the Northern and Eastern Provinces during the period 1983 to 2009, or its aftermath', the lack of consultations with the very community that is purportedly the focus of the law beggars belief. Even those predisposed to view the proposed Commission as a good faith act to address decades long violations to which the communities in the North and East were subjected, government disregard for, and dismissal of the concerns of the communities regarding the proposed Commission, will surely question the government's intention.</p><p>The concerns we express are evidenced by the government's repeated declarations that it is determined to ensure the UN Human Rights Council Resolution is not renewed nor a new Resolution passed. Hence, we believe the proposed Commission is one of the means through which the government intends to convince the international community there is no need for another Human Rights Council resolution. If the government's intent is to resolve decades long grievances of the Tamil community and address grave violations committed against the community, instead of railroading legislation the community does not want, the government would implement at least a few demands set out in the aforementioned four statements to build trust.</p><p>While civil society, journalists, activists, families of the disappeared and former combatants amongst others in the North and East continue to be subject to surveillance, intimidation and harassment by the security agencies, while their land is being acquired and occupied and while their places of worship are being destroyed, the enactment of a law and the establishment of a Commission will do little to prevent or mitigate these actions which are in contravention of the Constitution of Sri Lanka and Sri Lanka's international obligations. They only serve to increase people's mistrust of the state.</p><p>In this regard, we highlight the findings of the public opinion survey conducted by the Sri Lanka Barometre in 2023, which illustrates that 'confidence towards the political leadership decreased as a consequence of the crisis for almost half of Sri Lankans, showing a significant effect of the crisis on political confidence'. The Barometre also states that the 'decrease in confidence indicates a sense of disappointment and disillusionment among many Sri Lankans in the current political leadership'. It should be noted the lack of trust and confidence in the political leadership is not restricted to the Tamil community as the Barometre reveals that 'almost three quarters of people in the Southern Province experienced a drop in confidence'. Hence, in a climate in which the current government does not have public confidence, establishing yet another institution will in no way enable reconciliation in the absence of substantive measures to restore the faith of the people in those that govern them.</p><p>The imperative to listen to the voices from the North and East is reiterated by another finding of the Barometre, which states that the 'fact that the highest proportion of people showing no change in confidence can be located in the Northern Province could indicate disillusionment with any majoritarian government that is perceived to have ignored the needs and grievances of the Tamil community that make up a majority of the residents in the Northern province'.</p><p>In this context, we urge the government to heed the voices of the people of the North and East and implement the demands set out in the four statements issued by civil society groups from the North and East to build trust and show good faith prior to enacting laws or establishing Commissions. The path to positive peace and reconciliation is through building trust and demonstrating good faith through substantive and meaningful actions, not rhetoric, nor establishing Commissions whose recommendations are not implemented.</p><p>The signatories are Adayalam Centre for Policy Research; Affected Women's Forum, Amparai Aham Humanitarian Resource Centre (AHRC), Trincomalee; Amparai District Women's Network; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances in the North and the East (ARED); Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances - Amparai District; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Batticaloa; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Jaffna; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Kilinochchi; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Mannar; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances - Mullaitheevu; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances- Trincomalee; Association for Relatives of the Enforced Disappearances - Vavuniya; Batticaloa District Aruvi Women's Network; Centre for Humanitarian and Integrated Development, Mullaitheevu; Civil Amayam, Batticaloa; Eastern Social Development Foundation, Batticaloa; Environmental and Community Development Organisation, Mullaitheevu; Forum for Affected Families, Mannar; Jaffna Island Women's Network; Law and Human Rights Centre, Jaffna; Law and Society Trust; Mannar Social and Economical Development Organisation (MSEDO); Mannar Women's Development Federation (MWDF); Mullaitivu Press Club; North East Coordinating Committee (NECC); Organisation of People for Justice, Vavuniya; People's Collective for Climate Justice; Tamil Civil Society Forum; Vali North Resource Centre, Jaffna; Viluthu; Voice of the Voiceless; Women's Action Network; Women Life and Rights Association, Kilinochchi; Anushani Alagarajah, Rajaretnam Anuratha, S.

Your leadership is even timelier as Uganda assumes this role at a critical moment of collective awareness among countries of the global South. This is the first NAM Summit following the onset of the pandemic, the debt crisis, climate catastrophe, new global competition, and the ensuing multiple implications for the world, in particular, for the Global South.</p><p>As we meet today, a humanitarian crisis is unfolding in the Gaza Strip and beyond. For over 3 months immense suffering and losses have been endured by the Palestinian civilian population, endangering regional security and stability. Until now, the NAM was largely silent. How can we remain silent when Gaza is destroyed? People were denied humanitarian aid and a vast majority of the dead are innocent civilians. Silence implies consent. It is encouraging that this 19th Summit has given the highest priority to this crisis in Gaza and the inalienable rights of the people of Palestine to self-determination and the realisation of an independent and sovereign state of Palestine. We must congratulate South Africa for the bold stand it has taken regarding Gaza. The international community has already called for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire and the release of hostages.</p><p>There cannot be a two-State solution based on one State - Israel. No resolution is possible without a State of Palestine. Therefore, in line with multiple UN Resolutions, and the Declaration of this Summit, the international community must recognise the West Bank, Gaza and East Jerusalem as territories coming within the State of Palestine and in addition, there should be no change in the ethnic composition of Gaza. Sri Lanka also proposes that the State of Palestine be established within 5 years and no more.</p><p>We are now witnessing the end of the post-Cold War order and the coming into being of the evolving multipolar world. On the geopolitical front, we are witnessing a resurgence of latent and open conflicts involving former and aspiring major powers. In Europe the transatlantic military alliance has been strengthened, past arms control agreements have collapsed, military expenditure has reached historically unprecedented levels and nuclear weapons are once again the subject of apparently serious policy discussion. Outer space and the oceans have become potential theatres of conflict and geo-strategic competition including in our vicinity in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.</p><p>Free trade and economic integration are being reversed by the policy-driven rise of trade protectionism due to strategic competition among major powers. Furthermore, this is being extended further with the concepts of de-coupling and de-risking. A unilateral declaration of a new trade order and the setting aside of multilateralism by the West of the WTO. The weaponising of the dollar. New challenges of economic and the debt crisis, climate justice, food and energy security. Digital and technological divides and advanced WMD arsenals have aggravated existing inequalities between the developing states of the NAM and the developed world.</p><p>The theme of this Summit 'Deepening Cooperation for Shared Global Affluence' reflects the need to address the inequities between our two worlds. Furthermore, experience shows us that, to succeed we need a strong and united NAM that contributes to a better world for all. To do so, we have to reinvent ourselves.</p><p>Our membership today is no longer a grouping of weak States. We must recognise that as a result of the rapid progress and economic advancement of some Asian, African and Latin American states. A majority of the 10 leading economies of 2050 will belong to this movement. We see among us, rising aspirants for leadership status in global affairs. They must be prepared to give leadership. Furthermore, there is a vital role we must play as geostrategic rivalries in political, economic, technological and military terms become more pronounced among former and new contenders for major power status.</p><p>Therefore, the NAM must reinvent itself under your chairmanship. Assume a new role in a multipolar world - to transform itself as the largest bloc representing the Global South. We must also recast our objectives. While upholding the Bandung Principles in the evolving multipolar world we need to, (i) oppose the spread of big power rivalry including the coercion of uncommitted states, (ii) build a multipolar world which incorporates the political, economic, social and climate change mitigation aspirations of the Global South.</p><p>Let us transform ourselves from this loose movement to become a dynamic bloc of the Global South and its friends. Let us establish an effective permanent operational structure which is equipped to address the contemporary challenges facing the Global South. An organisation which is capable of shaping the new order.</p><p>Our future lies in our hands. We can make it or break it. Let us make it work. Let me conclude by thanking you Mr. President and the Government of Uganda for the excellent arrangements for hosting this important 19th Summit of the Non-Aligned Movement.'</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Outer space and the oceans have become potential theatres of conflict and geo-strategic competition including in our vicinity in the Indian and Pacific Oceans.
