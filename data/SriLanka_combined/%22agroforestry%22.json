'This AGM is not just a checkpoint, it's a crossroads,' he told the audience. 'The world has changed. The climate has changed. Consumer expectations have changed. And the only question left is: can we?'</p><p>Elaborating on Sri Lanka's rubber industry is steeped in legacy, spanning over 160 years, he said that it has produced generations of skilled tappers, brokers, exporters, and manufacturers as well as has helped define the country's industrial economy.</p><p>But that proud history, de Silva stressed, is now at risk of becoming just that history.</p><p>'On one hand, we are producing some of the finest, ethically sourced natural rubber in the world. Our manufacturers are globally competitive. But on the other hand, 2024 recorded our lowest ever national rubber output, falling below 70,000 tons,' he opined.</p><p>He lamented that thousands of hectares have been lost to real estate development, neglected plantations and poor replanting.  'Sri Lanka's 65,000 rubber smallholders, who contribute around 70% of national output are struggling to stay afloat,' he said.</p><p>'We are operating in a business where our rubber plantations are ageing faster than our ambitions,' he said bluntly.</p><p>The solution he suggested was a 'Natural Rubber Renaissance' - a multi-year, multi-agency effort focused on replanting high-yield, climate-resilient clones, expanding nursery access for smallholders and creating financial support schemes that carry farmers through the long wait to tapping maturity.</p><p>'The CRTA is ready to back such a revival. But we need political will to match the industry's readiness,' de Silva stressed.</p><p>Beyond land and trees, he said the industry faces another invisible but critical threat, which is its diminishing workforce. 'Our skilled tappers are mostly over 50. Young people no longer see a future in rubber. This isn't just a labour shortage. It's a generational disconnect,' he said.</p><p>To reverse this, de Silva argued, the sector must present rubber not as a relic of the past, but as a future-ready, technologically advanced and environmentally essential industry.</p><p>He said climate change is also wreaking havoc, with rainfall patterns growing more erratic and droughts more frequent, farmers are losing income from untapped days and in some cases, nearly 100 days a year.</p><p>'The Government's withdrawal of the rain guard subsidy has hit growers hard. But we have not stood still,' he added.</p><p>In a major move, de Silva disclosed that the CRTA has secured a $ 14 million grant from the Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support countrywide rain guarding-a measure aimed at stabilising yields and protecting farmer incomes.</p><p>Another growing concern is PESTA, a fungal disease already spreading across low and mid-country plantations. 'We've raised the alarm with Government agencies, but action is painfully slow,' he claimed.</p><p>CRTA Chief urged swift, coordinated action between farmers, scientists, and State agencies to contain the threat before it devastates livelihoods and exports.</p><p>A looming policy shift in one of Sri Lanka's most valuable markets, the European Union could either be a lifeline or a major barrier. The EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR), which takes effect in 2025, mandates that all rubber entering the EU be proven deforestation-free and fully traceable.</p><p>CTRA Chairman believes this is a moment of opportunity. 'Sri Lanka has nothing to hide. Our plantations were established over a century ago. We are not encroachers, we are stewards of agroforestry,' he said.</p><p>But proving that to international buyers requires robust traceability systems, geo-location mapping, and verifiable data. 'Many smallholders currently lack access to the digital tools and institutional support needed to comply. We must not allow this regulation to become a barrier. Instead, let's turn it into a competitive edge,' he added.</p><p>He assures that the CRTA is working with stakeholders to position Sri Lanka's rubber as a premium, ethically sourced material, but called for urgent investments in compliance infrastructure to back that claim.</p><p>As urbanisation and climate stress take their toll on traditional rubber-growing districts like Kegalle, Kalutara, and Rathnapura, he said the CRTA is advocating for a bold pivot in expanding cultivation into Intermediate and Dry Zones using drought-tolerant rubber clones and sustainable practices.</p><p>'This isn't just about survival, it's about strategy. By moving into new regions, we unlock land, create rural jobs and strengthen our environmental credentials.'</p><p>He highlighted the role of rubber in reducing soil erosion, acting as a carbon sink, and contributing to long-term ecological balance, especially in areas vulnerable to land degradation.</p><p>Despite being one of Sri Lanka's oldest export sectors, he said the rubber industry still lacks a central strategy or a unified body to lead its development. 'We have departments. We have pilot projects. But what we don't have is momentum,' de Silva said.</p><p>To address this, the CRTA is calling for the formation of a Sri Lanka Rubber Industry Council - a single platform bringing together growers, researchers, manufacturers, exporters and policymakers under one vision.</p><p>'One table. One plan. One voice,' he said. If we are to compete with Thailand, Malaysia, Vietnam, and West Africa, we must stop pulling in different directions.'</p><p>He called on the stakeholders, the Government and the private sector to act swiftly.

For generations, the emerald slopes of this island nation have produced some of the world's finest tea. But that legacy is now increasingly fragile. Beneath the beauty of the rolling tea gardens, a crisis is unfolding in the very soil that sustains them. As that soil depletes, production costs rise, and international markets fundamentally evolve, the Sri Lankan tea industry faces a defining question: will it cling to the familiar, yet failing, practices of the past, or will it pioneer a regenerative future and reaffirm its global leadership?.</p><p>The path forward is not an academic fantasy; it is already being mapped out on the ground. The good news is that Sri Lanka has already taken the first, critical steps. Halgolla Estate, in a landmark achievement, earned the world's first-ever Regenagri certification for a tea estate, a move that instantly put the country on the global sustainability map. Not long after, the Lumbini Tea Valley followed, becoming the first group of smallholders in the world to earn the same prestigious certification. These pioneers, operating at different scales, have definitively proven that regenerative agriculture-a holistic method of farming that actively restores soil health, boosts vital biodiversity, and sequesters atmospheric carbon-is a viable model for both large estates and smallholder collectives.</p><p>But these isolated success stories, however inspiring, will not be enough to turn the tide. If Sri Lanka is to maintain its competitive edge in export markets that are increasingly and aggressively driven by sustainability, it needs a systemic transformation. That monumental shift requires one thing above all else: clear, consistent, and courageous policy support from the Government.</p><p>To be clear, embracing regenerative agriculture is not merely a feel-good idea or a corporate social responsibility initiative; it is a smart and necessary economic strategy. At its core, it directly confronts the industry's most pressing financial challenges. It systematically reduces the reliance on expensive, often imported, agrochemicals that have become a crushing burden for many growers. By rejuvenating the soil, it improves long-term yields, creating a buffer against the notoriously volatile prices in the global tea market. This transition offers growers a pathway to both economic resilience and new streams of revenue. It opens previously inaccessible doors to carbon credit markets and allows producers to command sustainability premiums for their certified products.</p><p>The urgency is underscored by a tectonic shift in international trade regulations. The world is not waiting for Sri Lanka to make up its mind. The European Green Deal, Germany's rigorous Lieferkettengesetz (Supply Chain Act), and the forthcoming EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive are game-changers. These regulations will legally require importers to trace and verify the environmental and social sustainability of their entire supply chains. Independent, verifiable certifications like Regenagri are designed to provide exactly that assurance. Without widespread adoption and alignment, Sri Lankan tea risks a devastating outcome: losing not just its market share to more proactive competitors, but losing market access altogether.</p><p>So what should the Sri Lankan Government do? A six-point policy agenda offers a clear road map</p><p>First, it must rethink and redeploy agricultural subsidies. Current subsidy schemes often favour the very chemical fertilisers and conventional monoculture practices that degrade the soil and lock farmers into a high-cost system. Instead, the Government must implement targeted, performance-based support for regenerative inputs. This means creating time-bound, results-linked subsidy programs for estates and smallholders who commit to adopting these new methods. These subsidies should support compost production, the cultivation of agroforestry seedlings and shade trees, and the use of cover crops and mulching materials. Crucially, they should not be open-ended handouts, but should be tied to real ecological outcomes, such as measured increases in soil organic carbon or a verifiable reduction in chemical inputs.</p><p>Second, the Government must invest in robust extension services and farmer training to close the significant technical know-how gap. Many tea farmers, particularly smallholders, are simply unaware of viable alternatives to the high-input chemical model they have been taught for decades. This is where key institutions like the Department of Agriculture and the Tea Research Institute must step in decisively. The strategy should include placing dedicated regenerative agriculture officers in every tea-producing district, establishing demonstration plots to showcase model practices, and integrating regenerative curricula into farmer field schools and tea factory networks. Partnering with expert organisations like Solidaridad, which has already supported Regenagri implementation in Sri Lanka and India, would ensure global best practices are adapted to local realities.</p><p>Third, this transformation cannot rest on public funds alone; it requires Public-Private Partnerships (PPPs) to de-risk investment and scale adoption. A formal PPP framework, perhaps under the Plantation Ministry or the Export Development Board (EDB), could convene stakeholders and coordinate efforts. This would encourage banks to offer preferential green loans to regenerative estates, motivate tea exporters to co-invest in pilot programs to secure their own certified supply chains, and foster collaboration with agritech startups that can provide digital tools for monitoring soil health and biodiversity.</p><p>Fourth, Sri Lanka must leverage its leadership with powerful export incentives and branding support. If the nation wants to be recognised as a global leader in regenerative tea, it must help its exporters market that unique distinction. The EDB and Sri Lanka Tea Board should offer export tax incentives for Regenagri-certified tea, feature it prominently in trade delegations and international expos, and develop a 'Ceylon Regenerative' brand seal as a powerful sibling to the famed 'Pure Ceylon Tea' mark. This branding must target not just bulk buyers, but the high-end specialty tea markets in Europe, North America, and Japan, where ethical sourcing and climate claims are rewarded with significant price premiums and long-term contracts.</p><p>Fifth, the Government must actively support participation in the global carbon market. This remains one of the least understood but potentially most lucrative benefits of this transition. Regenagri-certified estates can meticulously measure and verify the carbon stored in their soils and vegetation, which allows them to sell valuable carbon credits on international markets. The Government can facilitate this by formally recognising Regenagri under any future national carbon registry, helping estates navigate complex global standards like Verra or Gold Standard, and creating pooled carbon trading platforms to benefit smallholders. This could provide growers with an estimated $15 to $30 per tonne of CO2 sequestered, creating a vital new revenue stream.</p><p>Finally, for any of this to scale, there must be deep legal and institutional alignment. This requires embedding regenerative agriculture as a core pillar of the National Export Strategy and amending the Tea Control Act to include provisions for sustainable production. A light-touch, enabling regulatory environment that rewards ecological stewardship and supports innovation is all that is needed. Furthermore, the Government should actively channel international development aid, particularly from OECD countries, towards these programs to secure concessional financing and technical assistance.</p><p>Sri Lanka has a precious head start, but the window of opportunity is closing fast. While Sri Lanka deliberates, its competitors are acting; India is already aiming to bring 100,000 hectares under certification in the next three years.</p><p>This is not just about sustainability; it is about economic survival, global relevance, and intergenerational justice.</p><p>The tools are on the table.

Current subsidy schemes often favour the very chemical fertilisers and conventional monoculture practices that degrade the soil and lock farmers into a high-cost system. Instead, the Government must implement targeted, performance-based support for regenerative inputs. This means creating time-bound, results-linked subsidy programs for estates and smallholders who commit to adopting these new methods. These subsidies should support compost production, the cultivation of agroforestry seedlings and shade trees, and the use of cover crops and mulching materials. Crucially, they should not be open-ended handouts, but should be tied to real ecological outcomes, such as measured increases in soil organic carbon or a verifiable reduction in chemical inputs. Second, the Government must invest in robust extension services and farmer training to close the significant technical know-how gap. Many tea farmers, particularly smallholders, are simply unaware of viable alternatives to the high-input chemical model they have been taught for decades. This is where key institutions like the Department of Agriculture and the Tea Research Institute must step in decisively. The strategy should include placing dedicated regenerative agriculture officers in every tea-producing district, establishing demonstration plots to showcase model practices, and integrating regenerative curricula into farmer field schools and tea factory networks."]}, {"relevance_score": 15, "title": "National Savings Bank welcomes Sinhala and Tamil New Year", "published": "2025-04-18", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Srilanka, April 18 -- The first day of transactions at the Main Branch was conducted under the leadership of Shashi Kandambi, General Manager and Chief Executive Officer of National Savings Bank and K.

This tree is a true multi-purpose wonder, providing food, clothing, medicine and raw materials for various items. The name baobab is derived from the Arabic \"bu hibab\", meaning \"fruit with several seeds\". The tree is also known by other names such as the 'dead-rat tree' (due to its fruit's resemblance to dead rats), the 'monkey-bread tree' (since monkeys eat its dry fruit), the 'upside-down tree' (because its bare branches resemble roots) and the 'cream of tartar tree' (due to the acidic taste of its fruit). In Hindi, it is referred to as gorakh-imli or gorak-chinch.</p><p>The tree commemorates the French botanist Michel Adanson, who studied Senegal's natural history, with 'digitata' referring to the hand-shaped leaves.</p><p>There are eight species of Adansonia worldwide, found in Africa, Asia and Australia. The Adansonia digitata species, found in the Indian subcontinent, originally spread through the African savanna. These massive deciduous trees can grow up to 20-30 m tall, with a trunk diameter of 2-10 m. They have smooth, reddish-brown to grey bark with longitudinal fibres and a distinctive swollen, bottle-shaped trunk that stores water for dry seasons. The tree's extensive root system helps it thrive and some baobabs are believed to live up to 5,000 years.</p><p>baobabs are incredibly resilient, resisting fire, termites and drought. They thrive in well-drained, acidic soils and have been introduced to many countries for ornamental purposes. baobabs bloom during the wet and dry seasons, producing large flowers on long peduncles. In southern Africa, they flower from October to December, with fruits appearing from April to May.</p><p>In India, they flower from May to June, aligning with the rainy season. They are gaining international prominence in the food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries.</p><p>During drought conditions, the hollow stem of the baobab tree is used to store water and can also serve as a shelter. The tree's fibres are used for making ropes, mats and other items, while the leaves and seeds are used in soups and as flavouring agents.</p><p>The fruits are bottle- or cucumber-shaped, with a woody outer shell and a nutritious pulp high in vitamins C and B2. Their fruits and leaves are rich in nutrients, earning them the nickname 'superfruit' due to their high vitamin C and fibre content. Specifically, baobab fruit pulp contains 280-300 mg of Vitamin C per 100 grams, which is 10 times more than oranges, along with high levels of ascorbic acid (337 mg / 100 g). A 2021 study detailed the nutritional profile of a baobab fruit, highlighting its impressive nutrient content per 100 grams: 2.04-3.24g of protein, 0.4-0.7g of fat, 78.3-78.9g of carbohydrates, 45.8-53.9g of fiber, 257-370mg of calcium, 126-179 mg of magnesium, 74-163 mg of Vitamin C and 2,010-2,390 mg of potassium.

But this cradle of Ceylon tea, famed from London to Beijing, is faltering. Soil, once fertile, now lies tired from years of chemical overload. Pest outbreaks are more frequent. Fertiliser prices have soared beyond reach. And the cup, once golden, is losing its richness. 'The rain used to come like clockwork,' says Gamage Bandara, a second-generation tea farmer I met during one of my trips to Sri Lankan tea gardens. 'Now, it either pours like a flood or disappears for weeks. The leaves don't know when to grow anymore.' Gamage's lament echoes through the central highlands of Sri Lanka, where tea is more than a crop-it's heritage, livelihood, and national identity all steeped into one.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The crisis beneath the canopy</p><p>Sri Lanka's tea industry-once the pride of Ceylon and the third-largest tea exporter globally-is gradually wilting under the weight of environmental and economic distress. From the hill slopes of Nuwara Eliya to the low-grown estates in Ratnapura, the once-verdant plantations are confronting depleted soils, erratic rainfall, and rising temperatures that threaten both yield and quality. In 2022, the industry's output plunged to a 26-year low, with total tea production falling to 251 million kg from a high of over 340 million kg in 2013, according to the Sri Lanka Tea Board Annual Report.</p><p>However, the industry began to recover modestly in the following years. By the end of 2023, total production rose to 256.04 million kg, marking a 4.54 million-kg (+1.8 %) increase from 2022 (TEA Statistics, 2024). The upward trend continued through 2024: 262.16 million kg was produced by December, an additional gain of 6.07 million kg (+2.4 %) from 2023 (Market Reports - Ceylon Tea Brokers, Dec. 2024). While this modest rebound is promising, it remains significantly below the heights of the early 2010s and continues to face substantial challenges from climate impacts, soil degradation, and market instability. In fact, it will not be out of place to suggest that this downturn is more than cyclical. It's structural.</p><p>It would be a profound irony-and a strategic misstep-if Sri Lanka, a pioneer in regenerative tea, lets others overtake it in the global shift to sustainability. After all, it was Halgolla Estate that made history as the world's first Regenagri-certified tea estate, having implemented soil-restorative practices, wildlife conservation, and carbon footprint reduction to global acclaim. Likewise, Lumbini Tea Factory-the first to bring a group of smallholder outgrowers under Regenagri-has shown that long-term returns on investment come not just from environmental gains, but from lower input costs, premium market access, and greater climate resilience</p><p>Decades of continuous monoculture on steep slopes have eroded the health of Sri Lanka's tea soils-up to 412 t/ha/year in some highland plantations-far exceeding the 9 t/ha/year threshold and causing yield losses upward of 133 kg/ha annually (Wickramarachchi and Bandara, 2014). Soil organic carbon has dwindled to around 2.16% (pH 4.5), weakening nutrient retention and soil structure (Joachim and Pandithasekara, 2004).</p><p>The nationwide ban on chemical fertilisers in April 2021 led to a 35% drop in usage, slashing tea production nearly 18%, and costing the sector an estimated LKR 84 billion (US$425 million) (Drechsel et al., 2025).</p><p>Climate patterns have also become unpredictable: rising temperatures, erratic monsoons and intermittent droughts now reduce yields by roughly 4.6% per 1 \u00b0C warming (IWMI, 2025).</p><p>Collectively, these pressures have eroded yields by about 15%, degraded cup quality, and left farming families in severe economic and emotional distress-signalling a crisis beneath the green canopy.</p><p>Amidst these compounding crises, regenerative agriculture emerges not as a niche idealism but as a strategic necessity. Rooted in ecological principles and traditional knowledge, regenerative practices focus on rebuilding soil health, increasing biodiversity, and restoring the ecosystem services on which tea production ultimately depends. Unlike organic farming, which can often be prescriptive and yield-focused, regenerative farming emphasises long-term resilience, carbon sequestration, and farmer autonomy, as detailed by the Rodale Institute.</p><p>As global buyers-from Unilever to niche ethical tea brands-increasingly shift toward carbon-neutral, traceable supply chains, Sri Lanka has a window of opportunity to rebrand its tea not just as premium, but as planet-positive. The world's largest regenerative agriculture certification standard, Regenagri, offers a chance to lead that transformation.</p><p>Regenagri: The global benchmark for regenerative agriculture</p><p>Regenagri is the world's largest regenerative agriculture initiative, headquartered in London, UK, with over 2.2 million hectares under certification-more than any comparable program. Incubated by Solidaridad, the world's oldest and largest sustainability organisation, Regenagri operates as a Community Interest Company (CIC), jointly owned by farmers, businesses, and NGOs, ensuring equitable governance and shared accountability.</p><p>In tea estates, Regenagri promotes sustainable practices such as cover cropping, organic soil amendments, shade tree planting, and biodiversity corridors. Its certification process helps tea producers move beyond just \"chemical-free\" claims by verifying long-term ecological restoration and carbon sequestration through third-party audits. The platform also provides a digital hub for farmers to track data on soil health, water use, biodiversity, and greenhouse gases, ensuring transparent and continuous improvement.</p><p>For tea packers and brands, Regenagri certification ensures traceability from field to cup and opens access to premium markets demanding climate-smart products. With mounting global pressure to comply with sustainability laws like European Union's Green Deal, Regenagri offers both ecological and economic resilience for South Asian tea producers looking to future-proof their industry. For tea estates, regenerative farming isn't just good for the planet-it's also good business. Under the Regenagri framework, estates that adopt soil-friendly practices like composting, reduced tillage, agroforestry, and cover cropping can sequester carbon-essentially pulling harmful CO2 out of the atmosphere and storing it safely in the soil. What makes this powerful is that Regenagri provides a verified carbon certification system, aligned with global standards like the GHG Protocol and ISO 14064-2. Once verified, estates can generate carbon credits, which are tradable on environmental markets or sold to companies looking to offset their emissions. This creates an entirely new income stream for tea growers, especially at a time when input costs are rising and market prices remain volatile.</p><p>Evidence shows that, over time, regenerative farms benefit from reduced input costs, access to premium markets, and increased resilience to climate shocks-resulting in higher long-term returns on investment. Regenerative agriculture emerges not as a niche idealism but as a strategic necessity</p><p>Myths and truths about Regenerative Agriculture</p><p>Critics often mistake regenerative agriculture for simply being another form of organic farming. While organic bans chemical use, regenerative agriculture suggests planned reduction. In fact, regenerative practices go further, restoring soil health, enhancing biodiversity, and actively capturing carbon, making it a systems-based, outcome-driven approach rather than a fixed-input model.</p><p>Some argue it's too costly or too slow to scale. Yet evidence shows that, over time, regenerative farms benefit from reduced input costs, access to premium markets, and increased resilience to climate shocks-resulting in higher long-term returns on investment (ROI).</p><p>Concerns about initial yield drops are not visible in several pilots conducted across the world. NGO Solidaridad has shown through its field trials in 2020-22, that 13,000 farmers cultivating cotton and soy have increased yield by 20% to 30%, reduced input costs by 30%, and received a market price premium of 3%. This project shows economic and environmental viability. Importantly, the smallholder farmers in India were able to generate 2 carbon credits per acre in cotton in partnership with carbon project developer Boomitra.</p><p>Lastly, critics claim it's too radical for legacy tea estates. In reality, Regenagri supports phased adoption, allowing estates to implement hybrid models that integrate regenerative principles without disrupting ongoing operations-making the transition both practical and strategic.</p><p>Global momentum, local opportunity</p><p>Across the world, regenerative agriculture is not just a movement-it's becoming a market expectation. Meanwhile, global demand for regeneratively produced tea and other commodities is accelerating. Markets such as the EU, UK, and Japan are tightening sustainability regulations. The European Green Deal and the upcoming EU Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (EUCSDDD) require exporters to prove deforestation-free, low-carbon supply chains (CBI Report, 2023). Germany's Lieferkettengesetz (LkSG) adds another layer of accountability for social and environmental compliance.</p><p>Importantly, Regenagri complements existing ethical labels like Fairtrade and Rainforest Alliance rather than competing with them. However, it adds deeper ecological validation and carbon-traceable integrity. It's already attracting global brands like illycaff\u00e8, Candiani Denim, Giorgio Armani, and J.Crew, signalling that regenerative supply chains are becoming the gold standard in sustainability (Regenagri Certified Companies).</p><p>In this context, India's recent partnership between Solidaridad Asia and the Indian Tea Association (ITA) is a game changer. It aims to bring 100,000 hectares of Indian tea under Regenagri certification over three years-a move that could propel Indian tea industry into a global leader in regenerative, climate-resilient tea production.</p><p>Sri Lanka must not miss the bus</p><p>It would be a profound irony-and a strategic misstep-if Sri Lanka, a pioneer in regenerative tea, lets others overtake it in the global shift to sustainability. After all, it was Halgolla Estate that made history as the world's first Regenagri-certified tea estate, having implemented soil-restorative practices, wildlife conservation, and carbon footprint reduction to global acclaim.</p><p>Likewise, Lumbini Tea Factory-the first to bring a group of smallholder outgrowers under Regenagri-has shown that long-term returns on investment come not just from environmental gains, but from lower input costs, premium market access, and greater climate resilience (Weerasooriya, 2024).</p><p>Missing this opportunity would mean more than lost market share. It could mean exclusion from premium markets, especially in Europe, where regulations like the EU Green Deal and German Due Diligence Laws demand verifiable environmental compliance. Regenagri's framework, already in use by Sri Lankan estates like Halgolla, provides the tools, credibility, and international alignment required to keep \"Ceylon Tea\" not just relevant-but revered in a carbon-conscious world.</p><p>The question isn't whether Sri Lanka can afford to embrace regenerative agriculture. The question is-can it afford not to?</p><p>A future worth brewing</p><p>Imagine the same mist-draped estate in Nuwara Eliya, five years from now-its slopes teeming with life. Tea bushes thrive under a canopy of shade trees, soil hums with microbial activity, and farmers no longer fear the rain. This is not a utopia-it is the promise of regenerative agriculture made real.</p><p>Regenerative tea is not about romanticising the past or rejecting progress. It's about moving forward-with nature, not against it. It aligns ancient wisdom with cutting-edge science, ensuring that Sri Lanka's proud legacy of Ceylon tea can weather the storms ahead. With pioneering estates like Halgolla and Lumbini showing the way, Sri Lanka has a rare chance to lead as a global model for climate-smart, carbon-positive tea.</p><p>But this transition needs support. Policymakers must step in with subsidies, extension services, and market linkages. Consumers can help too-by choosing regenerative brands. And industry bodies must reorient investments towards soil-first solutions. Because beneath every good cup of tea lies not just flavour, but a future.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Its certification process helps tea producers move beyond just \"chemical-free\" claims by verifying long-term ecological restoration and carbon sequestration through third-party audits. The platform also provides a digital hub for farmers to track data on soil health, water use, biodiversity, and greenhouse gases, ensuring transparent and continuous improvement. For tea packers and brands, Regenagri certification ensures traceability from field to cup and opens access to premium markets demanding climate-smart products. With mounting global pressure to comply with sustainability laws like European Union's Green Deal, Regenagri offers both ecological and economic resilience for South Asian tea producers looking to future-proof their industry. For tea estates, regenerative farming isn't just good for the planet-it's also good business. Under the Regenagri framework, estates that adopt soil-friendly practices like composting, reduced tillage, agroforestry, and cover cropping can sequester carbon-essentially pulling harmful CO2 out of the atmosphere and storing it safely in the soil. What makes this powerful is that Regenagri provides a verified carbon certification system, aligned with global standards like the GHG Protocol and ISO 14064-2. Once verified, estates can generate carbon credits, which are tradable on environmental markets or sold to companies looking to offset their emissions. This creates an entirely new income stream for tea growers, especially at a time when input costs are rising and market prices remain volatile. Evidence shows that, over time, regenerative farms benefit from reduced input costs, access to premium markets, and increased resilience to climate shocks-resulting in higher long-term returns on investment. Regenerative agriculture emerges not as a niche idealism but as a strategic necessityMyths and truths about Regenerative AgricultureCritics often mistake regenerative agriculture for simply being another form of organic farming."]}, {"relevance_score": 30, "title": "Welcoming Sinhala and Tamil New Year with National Savings Bank", "published": "2025-04-14", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> The Sinhala and Hindu New Year, one of the most awaited festivals of the nation, is around the corner, filling the hearts of the people with novelty and joy.

Livestock management experts also began to recognize the importance of indigenous tree and shrub browse in mixed farming and pastoral production systems.</p><p>Agroforestry is a collective name for land-use systems and technologies where woody perennials (trees, shrubs, palms, bamboos, etc.) are deliberately used on the same land-management units as agricultural crops and/or animals, in some form of spatial arrangement or temporal sequence. In Agroforestry systems there are both ecological and economical interactions between the different components.</p><p>Agroforestry systems aim to maintain or increase production (of preferred commodities) as well as productivity (of the land). Agroforestry can improve productivity in many different ways. These include: increased output of tree products, improved yields of associated crops, reduction of cropping system inputs, and increased labour efficiency. In Agroforestry systems there are three basic sets of elements or components that are managed by the land user, namely, the tree or woody perennial, the herb (agricultural crops including pasture species), and the animal. Agroforestry is building a layered garden from ground cover to canopy trees that are all useful to farming groups.</p><p>One of the most important aspects of Agroforestry is diversification. Diversification can also reduce the risk of pest attack. This includes considering the particular space the tree occupies in the farming system, as well as the total number of trees of that species that need to be planted. Getting this right is important to maximize the ecological and socioeconomic benefits from the tree itself. In comparison to annual crops, the use of perennial tree crops is less expensive in terms of inputs: time, seeds, fertilizer, and land. Agroforestry system, which uses perennial plants (both tree, shrub and cover crops), provides food and useful materials for humans (fiber, medicinal, dyes, edible leaves, spices, honey, fuel wood, fodder for livestock, sap products) as well as benefits to the other plants (soil fertility).</p><p>Agroforestry landscapes have an important function in improving soil and water conservation. Agroforestry systems can reduce soil erosion caused by wind and water, and prevent the runoff of sediment and potential pollutants into rivers, whilst keeping nutrients such as fertilizer in farmland. Agroforestry systems slow water runoff and enhance infiltration, stabilize soil and reduce river bank erosion.</p><p>Multiple benefits</p><p>Many mushrooms or fungi are deliberately grown within forest habitats, a practice defined as 'Fungi Agroforestry'. Bee-keeping not only provides honey but bees pollinate fruit trees, other perennial and annual crops. These pollination services can be much more important economically than the honey that is also produced. Productivity and household income can therefore be much enhanced through cultivating and retaining trees in landscapes to provide habitat for bees. When designing Agroforestry systems, the use of a range of tree species flowering at different times can provide better forage for bees.</p><p>Resin from pine is an example of an Agroforestry and forestry product widely used for industrial purposes; for example, resin tapping in many remote villages in China has significantly contributed to local livelihoods. Fish farming or aquiculture plays a significant role in livelihood development. Aquiculture in Agroforestry practices can involve paddy rice cultivation with fish culture and trees, as well as fish ponds in farmland with trees. Trees support the banks of ponds and rice paddies, and enhance the habitat for fish through providing organic nutrition and supporting the presence of microorganisms. All the above concepts will generate jobs, and people need not come to the big cities for work.</p><p>Agroforestry provides an important habit for the cultivation of medical plant products that may be herbs or trees. Many medicinal products are derived from trees and much traditional</p><p>health care around the world is supported by their cultivation. The wide cultivation and utilization of medicinal plants in Agroforestry contributes to health support systems locally. By growing a range of species that fruit in different seasons, it is possible to provide important sources of nutrients over a large part of the year, combating malnutrition. The use of trees and shrubs as animal feed is probably as old as the domestication of animals. What trees are appropriate as fodder depends on the digestive system of the animal. Many tree (and other) legumes provide nutritious animal fodder.</p><p>Groups of farmers working together (e.g., collections of user groups) can establish small-scale enterprises or small processing plants more easily than individual farmers can. This is a good practice for Sri Lankan farmers during these challenging times. Smallholders in developing countries often find it hard to sell their products in the market for a good profit because of poor infrastructure. The transaction costs in reaching markets are therefore high for small volumes of product, and there is often no guaranteed sale on reaching the market. We have seen farmers on TV complaining at the Damublla Economic Centre, and wasting fruits and vegetables. Grouping together to transact sales is a way to deal with these constraints. Sufficient quantities of products can be delivered to meet the demands of large buyers and bargaining power is increased. There is no wastage.</p><p>Fuel wood and charcoal also play a significant role in food and nutritional security as they produce energy and generate high income in spite of the introduction of modern energy sources. There is an immense potential for combating Climate Change in developing countries by building resilient agro ecosystems which actively sequester carbon. To achieve desired social and environmental benefits, designing the right Agroforestry system by selecting the most suitable plants and management practices is a must. Improving the knowledge of beneficial traits of the existing indigenous plants used in Agroforestry and development of new cultivars from those indigenous species, availability and easy access to high quality planting material and the safe transport of superior cultivars developed in different parts of the world are also important.</p><p>I have been privileged to visit the Sri Lanka Air Force Station at Morawewa. SLAF has prudently been engaged in diverse planting and are very much self-sufficient in terms of some food produce. This camp harvests and packs their own paddy in addition to making fresh yoghurt in their dairy section. This is a shining example for other entities to follow. Where the future of Sri Lanka tourism is concerned Agroforestry can create a concept of holidays where guests can stay in Agroforestry areas and cherish the natural habitat, eating the menu items fresh from the fields and dairy farms. This is already in practice in developed nations. We have acres of uncultivated lands and forest cover. Agroforestry will benefit Sri Lanka immensely.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

The national plantation sector is primarily driven by two main groups: Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) and Proprietary Planters. RPCs, organised under the Planters Association (PA), manage just 20 per cent of the country's plantation crop production,</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Proprietary Planters possess significant executive power but lack the organisation and unity to leverage their full potential. Given their contribution to the national economy, the establishment of a strong Proprietary Planters Association (PPA) in Sri Lanka could provide the unity, coordination, and strategic direction required to elevate the sector and maximise its impact on the country's GDP.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">In this article, we will explore the comparative landscape of private planter and agricultural associations globally, and examine how the PPA could be formed under the Sri Lankan Company Act, its potential benefits, membership criteria, and the steps it must take to establish itself as the largest and most competitive private sector plantation body in Sri Lanka.</p><p>Global Comparisons: Private Planters Associations</p><p>Across the globe, various private planter and agricultural associations have played pivotal roles in enhancing the productivity, sustainability, and marketability of plantation agriculture. Here are examples from leading countries in plantation management:</p><p>India - The United Planters' Association of Southern India (UPASI): UPASI represents the interests of private planters in India, particularly in the regions of Tamil Nadu, Kerala, and Karnataka, covering tea, coffee, and rubber plantations. UPASI's role has been critical in promoting research, training, and policy advocacy, enabling the sector to grow sustainably and profitably. Their success stems from a strong membership base, a focus on environmental sustainability, and fostering unity among small and large planters.</p><p>Brazil - The Brazilian Association of Coffee Exporters (ABIC): In Brazil, private coffee planters benefit from organised associations like ABIC, which not only works towards promoting Brazilian coffee but also ensures the adherence to quality standards, sustainable practices, and market development. ABIC's collective power allows small-scale producers to have a global voice in policy and trade discussions, which strengthens the entire sector.</p><p>Kenya - The Kenya Tea Development Agency (KTDA): KTDA is a cooperative body that manages the interests of smallholder tea farmers in Kenya, making up the largest producer of tea globally. The KTDA provides a robust infrastructure, including processing plants, marketing, and research, to ensure high-quality tea production. While KTDA is cooperative in nature, its model demonstrates the importance of infrastructure and support for smallholders to reach global markets.</p><p>These associations demonstrate the power of collective bargaining, research and development, shared resources, and market access in making private planters globally competitive. Sri Lanka's Proprietary Planters need to take inspiration from these models to form a cohesive and powerful association capable of competing at the global level.</p><p>Formation of the Proprietary Planters Association of Sri Lanka</p><p>To achieve a significant impact on the national GDP and become the largest private sector plantation body in Sri Lanka, the Proprietary Planters Association must be formally established under the Sri Lankan Company Act. This legal framework provides the structure necessary for sustainability, governance, and transparency.</p><p>1. Legal Framework and Governance</p><p>The PPA must be incorporated as a non-profit or membership-based entity under the Sri Lankan Company Act, allowing it to operate as a registered association that can interact with government bodies, manage resources, and promote the interests of planters. Governance structures should include a board of directors elected by members, representing both large and small planters. The constitution of the association should emphasise inclusivity, transparency, and long-term sustainability.</p><p>2. Membership Criteria</p><p>The membership of the PPA should be open to all proprietary planters engaged in the cultivation of plantation crops, including tea, rubber, coconut, oil palm, and spices. The criteria for membership could include:</p><p>A minimum landholding size (e.g., 5 acres)</p><p>Evidence of sustainable agricultural practices</p><p>Commitment to modernising operations through research and development</p><p>Active participation in the association's objectives</p><p>A tiered membership model could be introduced, where large-scale planters have more significant representation but small-scale planters can also benefit from technical support and market access.</p><p>3. Potential Benefits of the PPA: The establishment of the PPA will provide numerous benefits</p><p>Unified Voice: A single representative body for planters can influence government policy on issues like land tenure, lease agreements, subsidies, and export tariffs.</p><p>Research and Development: The PPA can collaborate with research institutions and universities to drive innovation in crop management, pest control, and sustainable practices.</p><p>Market Access: Through collective bargaining, planters can negotiate better prices for their products and access premium markets, both domestically and internationally.</p><p>Training and Capacity Building: With a unified approach, training programmes on modern agricultural practices, technology adoption, and environmental sustainability can be rolled out to increase productivity and quality.</p><p>Sustainability: By adopting sustainable practices, planters can not only reduce costs but also improve environmental impact, contributing to the global demand for certified organic and ethically produced products.</p><p>Way Forward: Growth Aspects for the Proprietary Planters Association</p><p>To ensure the PPA's success and its role in making proprietary planters the largest private sector plantations in Sri Lanka, the association must focus on several key aspects of growth:</p><p>1. Infrastructure Development</p><p>Investing in modern processing plants, warehouses, and distribution networks will allow planters to optimise operations, increase product quality, and reduce costs. By adopting automation and precision farming techniques, planters can further boost yields.</p><p>2. Integration into the Global Supply Chain</p><p>The PPA should focus on integrating Sri Lankan plantation crops into the global supply chain by forming partnerships with international buyers and retailers. The association should also focus on branding Sri Lankan crops as premium, sustainable products to command better prices in international markets.</p><p>3. Focus on Innovation and Sustainability</p><p>The PPA must champion research and development in crop improvement, water management, soil health, and pest control. Additionally, it should focus on renewable energy use, carbon footprint reduction, and waste management to ensure the long-term sustainability of plantations.</p><p>4. Advocacy and Policy Influence</p><p>The PPA must actively lobby for favourable policies and lease agreements, aiming to secure long-term land tenure and more equitable trade terms. They should also address issues like taxation, labour laws, and import tariffs that affect the competitiveness of Sri Lanka's plantation sector.</p><p>Achieving Sustainable Competitive Advantage through Porter's Value Chain Model: To ensure that Sri Lanka's Proprietary Planters can become world leaders, the PPA should adopt Michael Porter's Value Chain Model, which focuses on creating a competitive advantage through various stages of value creation:</p><p>Inbound Logistics: The association must ensure a streamlined supply of high-quality inputs (seeds, fertilisers, equipment) and optimise sourcing practices to reduce costs.</p><p>Operations: Implementing state-of-the-art farming techniques, automation, and sustainable practices will improve operational efficiency and reduce environmental impact.</p><p>Outbound Logistics: Strengthening the transportation and distribution infrastructure will allow planters to deliver products to markets more efficiently.</p><p>Marketing and Sales: Branding Sri Lankan plantation crops as premium, sustainable, and high-quality will differentiate them in the global market.</p><p>Service: Providing post-harvest services such as processing, packaging, and customer support will enhance the value proposition of Sri Lankan plantation crops.</p><p>Conclusion</p><p>The formation of the Proprietary Planters Association of Sri Lanka is a crucial step toward making Sri Lanka's plantation sector globally competitive, enhancing the national GDP, and positioning the country as a leader in sustainable and innovative agriculture. By adopting a strong legal structure, focusing on research and development, fostering unity among planters, and aligning with Porter's Value Chain model, the PPA can revolutionise the plantation industry, creating world-class products and securing long-term growth.

As outlined by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) with high confidence in its latest assessment report (AR6), 'climate change impacts are stressing agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and aquaculture, increasingly hindering efforts to meet human needs,' including negative impacts on food security, livelihoods, human health, and economic growth. Climate-related risks to food systems are an especially severe threat to tropical and subtropical developing countries with high employment in relevant sectors, including Sri Lanka.</p><p>At the global level, food systems have been identified as a key area for climate change adaptation and resilience-building. The IPCC report states that 'effective adaptation options, together with supportive public policies, enhance food availability and stability and reduce climate risk for food systems while increasing their sustainability,' highlighting the importance of evidence-based and well-planned interventions. In the multilateral climate negotiations, food systems were also included as one of seven thematic targets under the Global Goal on Adaptation and the UAE Framework for Global Climate Resilience, aiming to attain 'climate-resilient food and agricultural production and supply and distribution of food, as well as increasing sustainable and regenerative production and equitable access to adequate food and nutrition for all' by 2030 and progressively beyond.</p><p>Key actors for resilient food systems</p><p>Sri Lanka's food systems are vulnerable to climate change impacts, including rising day- and nighttime temperatures, unpredictable precipitation patterns, extreme weather events, prolonged droughts, pests and diseases, saline intrusion, soil degradation, or loss of ecosystem services. To address these challenges and build long-term resilience, the sector needs to modernise, strengthen adaptation measures, build relevant capacities, and transition to more climate-smart, integrated, resilient, and risk-informed approaches.</p><p>For this process to be successful, multiple actors and stakeholder groups need to work together, from producers at the ground level and their associations to national government authorities as well as consumers and waste management at the end of value chains. However, for any of these actors, data, information, knowledge, and research findings are essential to enable informed decision-making and evidence-based interventions that are effective and address clearly identified issues.</p><p>The role of research providers</p><p>Research providers, such as research institutions, universities, think tanks, relevant government departments, and individual experts, play a key role in bridging data and evidence gaps and enabling long-term resilience-building. They are at the forefront of generating knowledge about the impacts of climate change and other related risks on food systems, for example on how changing climatic conditions affect crop yields, soil health, water availability, and pest and disease dynamics. This knowledge is crucial for understanding the vulnerabilities of different food systems and identifying areas that require urgent attention.</p><p>For instance, research on the physiological responses of crops to temperature and water stress helps identify which crop varieties are more resilient to climate change. Similarly, studies on the impact of climate change on pest and disease patterns enable the development of more effective pest management strategies. By understanding these impacts, research providers lay the foundation for developing targeted interventions that enhance the resilience of food systems.</p><p>Moreover, research on sustainable and climate-smart food system practices, such as agroforestry, integrated pest management, or conservation agriculture, can offer alternative methods and models for food producers and processors. These practices have the potential to not only improve climate resilience but also contribute to environmental sustainability and resource efficiency. Technology and research and development are other areas of importance, including when it comes to climate information services, early warning systems, weather forecasting tools, remote sensing, mobile applications, and machine learning to support risk analytics or tailor agrometeorological recommendations to a specific area or even farm.</p><p>Research providers can-and often do-fulfil additional functions as well.

They can directly engage with stakeholders on the ground, including farmers and extension services, and transfer knowledge on climate-smart practices to the grassroots level. In the other direction, research can also feed into policy processes by providing scientific evidence and research-backed recommendations, supporting policymakers to strengthen the enabling environment and incorporate evidence into policies and plans.</p><p>The complexity of building climate-smart and resilient food systems requires collaboration across various sectors and stakeholders, as well as between the national and international level. Research providers and academic institutions are actively engaged in partnerships with government agencies, civil society stakeholders, and the private sector. These collaborations can facilitate the sharing of knowledge, resources, and expertise, leading to more effective and coordinated efforts in addressing climate challenges.</p><p>Furthermore, research providers can also become thought leaders and agenda-setters as they identify emerging or frontier solutions, highlight evidence-based priorities, and contribute to shaping regional or global discussions, such as the development of indicators under the targets for the Global Goal on Adaptation, which is currently taking place under the UAE-Bel\u00e9m work programme. Monitoring, evaluation, learning, and reporting also are critical for the development of Nationally Determined Contributions, National Adaptation Plans, physical planning, and short-, mid-, and long-term development plans.</p><p>Conclusions</p><p>Research providers are central for the development and implementation of a successful food system transformation towards climate change adaptation, sustainability, and long-term resilience.

It represents a complex dynamic natural resource that is essential to life on Earth. It can be defined as 'the unconsolidated mineral or organic material on the immediate surface of the Earth that serves as a natural medium for the growth of land plants'. It takes thousands of years for soil to form from the weathering of the parent rock material. But it takes only a few hours to destroy thus hardly formed soil.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The multi-functionality of soil</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Soil supports the existence of plants, among many other functions. In regard to ecosystems, it contributes to the mediation of climate, hydrological, and biodiversity functions. Hence soil is a multifunctional natural resource and some of these functions include:</p><p>Nutrient Supply and Plant Growth: Soil is the chief repository of nutrients that plants need to grow. The common examples are macronutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium, and trace minerals like iron and zinc. Soil plays an important role in the short- and long-run nutrient supply by storing and releasing them slowly to plants to support their healthy growth.</p><p>Water Storage and Filtration: Healthy soils act like sponges in soaking up and storing water. By regulating the rates of water flow through an ecosystem, soils ensure the plants get just the right amount of moisture at any time while preventing flooding and runoff. The soils allow the filtration of rainwater and wastewater through them, eliminating contaminants and allowing clean water into the groundwater systems. Soil filtration is one of the essential activities in the maintenance of water quality.</p><p>Soil Carbon Sequestration: Soils are an important sink in terms of carbon and, hence, part of the solution to mitigate climate change. A big percentage of Earth's carbon is held within the soil in organic matter form. Plants remove CO2 from the atmosphere by photosynthesis and store it in their roots and within the soil. This helps in reducing the amount of CO2 in the air and, to some extent, reduces the effect of climate change.</p><p>Biodiversity support: Soil is a habitat for a range of organisms, from microscopic bacteria and fungi to earthworms, ants, and other insects. These organisms break down organic material, aerate the soil, and contribute to nutrient cycling. A healthy soil ecosystem supports a diversity of life, which in turn contributes to the resilience of the environment as a whole.</p><p>Erosion Control: Soil has the ability to stabilise land by binding particles together and, therefore, preventing erosion caused by wind and water. Plant roots that grow in the soil make a closely knit network that will glue the soil particles, reducing the risk of soil erosion. Healthy soils further promote infiltration, reduce surface runoff, and help to maintain the integrity of the soil.</p><p>Is soil a living being?</p><p>In itself, yes, it can be considered a living thing. It may not, per se, be classically defined as alive; however, for sure, it houses a teeming, dynamic community of living organisms, and its health is in great measure determined by the interaction of these organisms with the soil environment. Soil teems with life-from bacteria and fungi to insects and larger organisms like worms. These microorganisms and organisms interact symbiotically in decomposing organic matter, nutrient recycling, and plant growth.</p><p>Soil health is inseparably related to planetary health. Pic courtesy fao.org</p><p>It consists of a food web of different organisms, vital for soil fertility and health. For example, large fauna such as insects, millipedes, rats, and snails break down dead plants into smaller pieces. Then earthworms and microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi, decompose dead plants and pieces into soil organic matter. Nutrients released during decomposition are utilised by plants. The earthworms burrow underground, enhancing the structure of the soil and providing a route through which air and water can reach the plant roots more easily. These living organisms regulate the conditions of soil and contribute towards soil health.</p><p>What is soil health?</p><p>Soil health refers to the ability of soil to function as a living ecosystem that sustains plants, animals, and humans. More precisely, healthy soil should be dynamic, balanced, and resilient. Healthy soil contains an optimum balance of physical, chemical, and biological properties. This allows soil to perform its numerous functions effectively in supporting plant growth, regulating water, cycling nutrients, and maintaining biodiversity.</p><p>Key indicators of healthy soil</p><p>As we measure the temperature using a thermometer to see whether we have fever, it is possible to conduct a wide range of physical, chemical, and biological tests to ascertain the health of the soil. The following are some of the common indicators that may show whether the soil is 'healthy'.</p><p>Soil Structure: Healthy soil has good structure; this simply means it has a well-developed pore and aggregate network that can allow for aeration and water movement within the soil. The structure is appropriate for the growth of roots with access to nutrients. Soil that has become compacted becomes dense and hard, prohibiting roots from growing as well as preventing water infiltration. Compaction can be caused by heavy machinery, overgrazing, or excess tilling.</p><p>Organic matter: Serves to improve the structure, water-holding capacity, nutrition for plants and microbial existence. Organic matter usually constitutes about 3-6% in healthy soil and helps develop soil structure with a definite improved retention of nutrients.</p><p>Microbial Activity: Good soil is crawling with life. The healthy microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi or protozoa, are good and positive indicators of soil health because these help in organic matter decomposition, nutrient recycling, and promotion of plant health.</p><p>Water Retention and Infiltration: Healthy soils are capable of water retention to supply the plants and also of excess water drainage to avoid waterlogging. Easy erosion or runoff of soil upon rainfall signifies that it is not healthy. This usually happens when there is a lack of ground cover or an inadequacy in soil structure.</p><p>pH Balance: The pH level of the soil maintains the availability of nutrients within the soil to the plants. Highly acid or highly alkaline soils are not good for the growth of plants, whereas most plants grow very well in a neutral pH range of 6-7.</p><p>Nutrient Balances: When the soil is either too acidic or too alkaline, nutrient deficiencies or toxicities may be initiated, both of which would affect plant health. Excessive applications of synthetic fertilizers might also be a cause of nutrient imbalances and loss of soil microorganisms.</p><p>Sick soils make humans also sick</p><p>Sick soils not only affect plant health, but they also directly and indirectly affect human health. Poor fertility of the soil results in plant growth that is affected by nutrient deficiency; if such agricultural produce is consumed by humans, then it shows up as malnutrition and its related diseases. Besides, all kinds of chemical fertilisers and pesticides used vastly to counteract degradation, may contaminate food and water supplies, leading to chemical poisoning, disruption of hormones, and even increased risks for cancer. On the other hand, sick soils further promote environmental problems such as air pollution, water contamination, and climate change; all of these, in turn, affect human health through the quality of food, water, and air used.</p><p>Sick soils make the earth sick too</p><p>Soil health is inseparably related to planetary health: when soils deteriorate, they lose their carbon-sequestering ability and this carbon mixes into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide-one of the most potent greenhouse gases. Contributing to global warming and climate change, degenerated soil often results in poor water retention, causing floods in one region and drought in another. Other symptoms include soil erosion, where productive lands are lost and agricultural yields reduced, hence affecting food security. However, this makes the ecosystem increasingly less and less able to deal with stress. It leads to a loss in biodiversity and to a general reduction in Earth's systems' functionality. In this manner, sick soils create a vicious circle that denies health not only to the soil itself but also to the whole biosphere.</p><p>The four principles of</p><p>managing healthy soil</p><p>Key principles to be followed in maintaining and improving soil health are based on maximising the expressed performance of its functions while minimising the detrimental effects of agricultural practices. These principles are enumerated below.</p><p>1. Maximise the presence</p><p>of living roots</p><p>Living roots are a crucial element in soil health. They interact with soil microorganisms by feeding them, hence encouraging their activities. They help maintain the structure of the soil through the exudation of organic compounds that bind the particles of the soil together. Off-season cover cropping involves planting legumes or grasses to keep roots in the soil during the year. This prevents erosion, maintains fertility, and supports beneficial organisms living in the soil.</p><p>2. Minimise disturbance</p><p>Excessive disturbance through tilling and plowing degrades the structure, reduces organic matter, and disrupts the soil food web. Practicing minimum tillage technologies such as no-till or low-till allow soil to maintain natural structure and reduce chemical inputs. Reduced tillage prevents soil compaction, maintains organic matter, and helps protect the beneficial organisms that live in the soil.</p><p>3. Maximise soil cover</p><p>This is necessary to prevent erosion, inhibit water evaporation, and protect against extreme temperatures. Covering the soil with plants or organic residues reduces the loss of water and reduces wind and water erosion: cover crops like red clover, sun hemp, and pueraria protect the surface and bring additional organic matter into the soil. Straw, compost, crop residues and lawn clippings can be used for mulching so that soil structure can be improved while decomposing and gradually enriching the soil.</p><p>4. Biodiversity must be maximized</p><p>Soil health is greatly dependent on biodiversity. A good mix of plant species and microorganisms in the soil contributes to nutrient cycling, pest control, and disease prevention. Crop rotation, intercropping, and agroforestry practices will again enhance biodiversity, thus helping break the pest cycles, improving nutrient availability, and generally enhancing the resiliency of the soil.</p><p>Concluding remarks</p><p>Soil is a living, breathing system that provides life on Earth. Healthy soils are basic to food production, climate regulation, and the sustainability of ecosystems. In the face of global challenges that include climate change, food insecurity, and environmental degradation, the importance of healthy soil has never been clearer. It means the adoption of those best practices that put soil health first, such as maximising living roots, minimising disturbance, maximising soil cover, and increasing biodiversity for catalysing a future with prosperity for all humans along with a healthy planet.</p><p>Investment in soil health is an investment for humankind's future. This is a commitment we must show to secure future generations. Healthy soil is more than the cornerstone of agriculture; it is a stepping stone toward a world that will be more sustainable and resilient.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Covering the soil with plants or organic residues reduces the loss of water and reduces wind and water erosion: cover crops like red clover, sun hemp, and pueraria protect the surface and bring additional organic matter into the soil.

Identify areas for improvement and restructuring to enhance efficiency and effectiveness.</p><p>Capacity building: Develop and implement capacity-building programs to enhance the skills and competencies of government officials and staff. This includes training in modern management practices, regulatory frameworks, and industry-specific knowledge.</p><p>Service improvements: Simplify and streamline administrative processes to reduce bureaucracy, improve service delivery, and enhance responsiveness to the needs of the tea sector.</p><p>Policy and regulatory reforms</p><p>NDGs: Ensure that the policies and regulations governing the tea sector are aligned with national development goals and international best practices. This includes updating outdated policies and introducing new regulations to address emerging challenges and opportunities at least once in 5 (or 10?) years.</p><p>Transparent and accountable governance: Strengthen regulatory oversight to ensure compliance with industry standards and promote transparency and accountability practices. This includes regular audits, inspections, and enforcement of regulations.</p><p>Stakeholder engagement</p><p>Engagement: Establish a collaborative framework for engaging with key stakeholders, including tea growers, processors, exporters, and industry associations. This includes regular consultations, workshops, and joint decision-making processes.</p><p>Auditing: Promote transparency and accountability in the operations of government institutions by implementing robust reporting and auditing mechanisms. This will help build trust among stakeholders and improve governance.</p><p>Innovation and technology integration</p><p>Integration: Integrate digital technologies into the operations of government institutions to improve efficiency, transparency, and service delivery. This includes developing e-government services, digital platforms for stakeholder engagement, and data management systems.</p><p>Enhancement via R and D: Invest in research and development, monitoring to explore innovative solutions for enhancing the effectiveness of government institutions in the tea sector. This includes partnerships with academic institutions, industry experts, and international organisations.</p><p>Monitoring and supervision:</p><p>KPIs: By incorporating comprehensive evaluations and Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) based on international best management models, the institution(s) can achieve effective monitoring and supervision. This approach involves establishing a systematic framework to regularly assess the institution's performance against predefined benchmarks. KPIs should be clearly defined to measure progress in achieving strategic goals, such as response times, compliance rates, and impact outcomes. This data-driven approach not only provides transparency and accountability but also fosters a culture of continuous improvement, enabling the institution to adapt to changing needs and enhance its overall performance.</p><p>Global standards: By adopting global standards such as the Balanced Scorecard, Six Sigma, or Total Quality Management, the institution can ensure that its operations align with best practices in efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability. Periodically conduct evaluations, concentrating on areas like operational efficiency, service delivery, and stakeholder satisfaction.</p><p>Better evaluation: The 360-degree feedback method is indeed a better evaluation method, at least to be conducted every three years. It involves collecting feedback from a variety of sources around an individual or institution, including peers, subordinates, supervisors, and sometimes external stakeholders or clients. This comprehensive approach provides a well-rounded perspective on performance, strengths, and areas for improvement. The tea institution(s) can use 360-degree feedback to evaluate the performance of employees, teams, or even the efficacy of specific programs or initiatives. It aids in identifying performance gaps, enhancing leadership skills, and improving overall organisational effectiveness by integrating diverse viewpoints.</p><p>Incentivising performances:</p><p>A combination of financial and non-financial strategies can effectively motivate officials-a crucial element in enhancing service delivery to achieve KPIs. Developing these incentive mechanisms hinges on establishing a robust performance measurement methodology. Historical evidence, however, suggests that incentive schemes can endure even without achieving specific KPIs. Best practices include performance-based bonuses, which link part of compensation to achieving KPIs; recognition and awards to publicly acknowledge accomplishments; and career advancement opportunities tied to performance. Additionally, offering professional development, ensuring KPIs are clear and realistic, fostering public accountability and transparency, implementing regular feedback mechanisms, and promoting team-based incentives can all contribute to improved performance. Prioritising work-life balance and aligning incentives with public service motivation further enhance effectiveness. Each practice must be tailored to the local context, culture, and existing systems to ensure sustainability and impact.</p><p>Priority H: Tea legislation review</p><p>The Tea Control Act of Sri Lanka, commonly referred to as the Tea Act, is a cornerstone in the regulation and management of the nation's tea industry. The act, originally enacted in 19575 (1949?) with several updates later, plays a crucial role in overseeing the cultivation, production, marketing, and export of tea-one of Sri Lanka's most significant economic contributors. The act plays a crucial role in ensuring the sector's orderly growth and sustainability, within the business objectives as tea has a deep place in the country's history and continues to be a primary source of export revenue.</p><p>However, with changing global dynamics, there is an urgent need to modernise Sri Lanka's legal framework governing the tea industry. The primary objective of this modernisation is to update the Tea Act, aligning it with contemporary challenges and opportunities. Key focuses of the proposed revisions include promoting sustainable growth, ensuring gender inclusivity, and enhancing the international competitiveness of Sri Lanka's tea sector.</p><p>Updating the Tea Control Act must involve a comprehensive review of existing regulations, drawing on insights from both local stakeholders and international experts. The updated Tea Act will adopt international best practices, particularly geographical indications (to protect the unique identity of Ceylon Tea) and the integration of digital technologies for improved efficiency and transparency across the supply chain, as well as removing redundant sections.</p><p>By incorporating these elements, the revised Tea Act aims to reposition Sri Lanka's tea industry as a resilient, forward-thinking sector capable of thriving in a dynamic global market. This reform will not only preserve Sri Lanka's rich tea heritage but also ensure that it continues to evolve, empowering smallholders, enhancing gender equality, and fostering innovation.</p><p>Key components</p><p>Updating the Tea Act</p><p>Multistakeholder consultations: Revise and update the existing Tea Act to reflect current industry practices, technological advancements, and global standards. This includes addressing gaps and outdated provisions that may hinder the sector's growth.</p><p>Engage with a wide range of stakeholders, including tea growers, processors, exporters, and regulatory bodies, to gather input and ensure that the updated legislation meets the needs of all parties involved.</p><p>Review and fresh perspectives</p><p>International best practices: Leverage the knowledge and experience of local experts who understand the unique challenges and opportunities within the Sri Lankan tea sector. Their insights will be crucial in tailoring the legislation to local conditions. Incorporate perspectives from international experts to ensure that the updated Tea Act aligns with global best practices and standards. This will enhance the competitiveness of Sri Lankan tea in international markets.</p><p>Regulatory framework</p><p>Compliance and enforcement: Strengthen the regulatory framework to ensure compliance with the updated Tea Act. This includes establishing clear guidelines, monitoring mechanisms, and enforcement procedures.</p><p>Institutional framework:</p><p>Tea sector institutional reform: It must carefully evaluate the tea sector's institutional framework to learn from past successes and failures and shape its future. Institutional reforms should align with the digital government agenda, adopt international best practices, and incorporate the private sector's experience and expertise. A key question is whether the current government-led setup or a public-private partnership (PPP) model would be more effective, especially considering that private and public representation can contribute more to the sector's growth than traditional bureaucratic systems. Institutional behaviour must be publicly accessible, transparent, accountable, and focused on delivering results that are both effective and efficient. A comprehensive model for achieving this is yet to be developed and will be based on detailed analysis and careful consideration of best practices.</p><p>The institutional setup should take into account the integration of Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs) into governance, incorporating the lessons learned from the privatisation process. It's crucial that stakeholder collaboration goes beyond mere representation to involve real responsibility, empowered through a shared governance mechanism. These issues will be explored in greater detail in a separate section, with a focus on ensuring that the tea sector's institutional structure is both effective and adaptable for the future.</p><p>Fiscal and expenditure framework</p><p>Transparency and accountability: Promote transparency and accountability within the tea sector by implementing robust budgeting, reporting and auditing requirements. This will help build trust among stakeholders and improve governance.</p><p>Sustainability and inclusivity:</p><p>Sustainability: Integrate provisions that promote environmental sustainability, such as sustainable farming practices, waste management, and biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Inclusivity: Ensure that the updated legislation includes measures to promote gender inclusivity, such as equal employment opportunities, support for female entrepreneurs, and protection against discrimination.</p><p>Implementation and monitoring:</p><p>Continuous monitoring: Implement the updated Tea Act and establish monitoring mechanisms to ensure compliance and assess the impact of the new legislation.</p><p>Providing subsidies and incentives to various agricultural sectors has been a practice for many decades. In certain situations, such as short-term production issues or market fluctuations caused by external factors, government financial assistance may be justified.</p><p>For instance, if the international market for tea were to collapse due to a global economic crisis, the Government should consider implementing a time-bound assistance program.</p><p>Short term assistance programs should be periodically reviewed to determine whether continued support or sectoral transition is necessary based on a thorough situation analysis. However, the indefinite continuation of subsidies or Government support in any agricultural sector is counterproductive and inefficient. If a sector is proven to be unsustainable in the long term due to socio-economic, climatic, or scientific factors, the government's focus should shift to supporting the transition (another form of subsidies based on true financial analysis) to more viable alternatives (i.e. British's transition from coffee to tea). Subsidies, when funded through tax revenue, can make both the sector (distorting market competition) and the country unsustainable if not managed carefully. It leads to inefficiencies and wasted resources.</p><p>If subsidies are utilised by producers without optimising yields, total production can actually decrease due to lower break-even points. For example, a farmer might achieve the same profit by producing 90 kg instead of 100 kg with the help of a subsidy, as the cost of production is reduced. This can lead to complacency, where producers focus more on maintaining profits rather than maximising output, ultimately resulting in lower overall production.</p><p>There are instances where subsidies or financial support are provided simply due to popular demand, but this should not be the future approach for a country like Sri Lanka. Moving forward, decisions on subsidies must be based on a clear assessment of long-term viability, ensuring that government resources are allocated in a way that enhances productivity and sustainability rather than perpetuating inefficiencies.

Meet the jackfruit, a tropical treasure poised to revolutionise the global food industry.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Native to Southeast Asia and boasting the title of the largest tree-borne fruit on Earth, jackfruit has transcended its Sri Lankan roots to become a global culinary sensation. Introduced to Sri Lanka by Arthur V. Dias, during the British colonial era, when rice scarcity threatened starvation, the jackfruit emerged as a crucial source of sustenance, with its rich carbohydrates and natural fats providing much-needed energy. This lifesaving role later earned the title 'Rice Tree'.</p><p>A versatile star on the rise</p><p>Jackfruit is not only delicious but also a nutritional powerhouse. Packed with essential vitamins, minerals, and fibre, it offers a range of health benefits. It's an excellent source of vitamin C, which supports immune function and collagen production. Potassium and magnesium contribute to heart health and muscle function. Additionally, jackfruit's fibre content aids digestion, promotes satiety, and helps regulate blood sugar levels. While it's not a complete protein like meat, it provides a good amount of protein compared to other fruits, making it a valuable addition to vegetarian and vegan diets as well as for those keen on healthy weight management.</p><p>This commonly available naturally grown food produce in Sri Lanka, with very high medicinal properties, is the ideal gold mine for those who are passionate on winning the global food based entrepreneurship. Jackfruit is not only highly cherished for its versatility and unique flavour profile, but also because of its massive size and fibrous meaty texture, makes it a culinary chameleon internationally, rapidly gaining popularity as a sustainable plant-based alternative to meat. Moreover, the jackfruit's neutral flavour allows it to absorb the tastes of the spices and ingredients it's cooked with, making it suitable for various cuisines and dishes. This combination has sparked a global culinary revolution, propelling jackfruit to the forefront of the plant-based food industry also embraced by international brands like Starbucks and Pizza Hut. This versatility makes it a popular choice for vegan and vegetarian dishes to adding creative twist to pizzas, wraps, tacos, burgers and flavourful curries.</p><p>A sustainable solution with stable income</p><p>Driven by growing concerns about the health, environmental, and ethical implications of animal agriculture, international consumers are increasingly seeking plant-based alternatives. Jackfruit trees are prolific growers, requiring minimal water and resources compared to meat production, making the perfect sustainable solution, contributing to reduced environmental impact. Additionally, jackfruit trees can help diversify agricultural practices, promoting biodiversity and supporting sustainable livelihoods for local farmers and communities with its year round production.</p><p>A brighter future for Sri Lanka fuelled by sustainability</p><p>Sri Lankan farmers, well-versed in the jackfruit's potential, can well capitalise on this rising global demand as a stable income source while also promoting agroforestry practices. It is no secret that, sadly, per year, thousands of jackfruits fall and rot island-wide. Nevertheless, local businesses who follow the international food trends, are actively processing and exporting jackfruit in various forms, catering to diverse needs of all consumer levels starting from infants. From versatile jackfruit flakes, and pre-seasoned jackfruit patty options to convenient ready-to-eat jackfruit curries and refreshing natural drinks, with the increasing global popularity of Jackfruit, the possibilities are endless.

Biodiversity and ecosystem loss as well as land degradation due to desertification and drought are all part of the overall 'polycrisis' facing humanity in the 21st Century. In particular, vulnerable developing countries such as Sri Lanka are exposed to serious and intertwined threats to critical sectors such as agriculture, tourism, or the coastal zone.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The three 'Rio Conventions'-all deriving from the 1992 Earth Summit held in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil-aim to protect the world's climate, biodiversity, and land. They include the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Convention on Biodiversity (CBD), and the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). In the last quarter of 2024, all three of these conventions are convening their respective Conferences of the Parties (COPs): CBD COP16 in Colombia in October, UNFCCC COP29 in Azerbaijan in November, and UNCCD COP16 in Saudi Arabia in December.</p><p>Collaboration among these Rio Conventions is vital to achieve their respective targets and harness synergies, which occur when actions align with multiple goals and create co-benefits across the areas of climate change mitigation, adaptation, biodiversity conservation, or land degradation neutrality, as well as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) under the Agenda 2030.</p><p>Sri Lanka and the three Rio Conventions</p><p>On climate change, Sri Lanka has ratified the UNFCCC in 1993 and the Paris Agreement in 2016, with considerable engagement since then. Most recently, Sri Lanka has submitted its updated Nationally Determined Contributions (in 2021) and its Third National Communication (in 2022), and is currently in the process of implementing and reviewing its National Adaptation Plan.</p><p>The country has also ratified the Biodiversity Convention in 1994 and adopted its latest National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan (2016-2022) in 2016. As one of 36 global biodiversity hotspots (together with India's Western Ghats), Sri Lanka is a key location for biodiversity and has a high level of endemic species of animals as well as plants across its diverse terrestrial and marine ecosystems.</p><p>Finally, Sri Lanka ratified UNCCD in September 1998 and submitted its latest country report in 2022, outlining trends in land, cover, productivity, and degradation; access to safe drinking water; drought exposure and vulnerability; carbon stocks; and other relevant metrics.</p><p>Linkages and synergies</p><p>There are significant linkages and potential synergies between the subject areas and policy processes of all three conventions. For example, Sri Lanka's climate commitments under the UNFCCC and the Paris Agreement identify biodiversity as a key sector and repeatedly refer to land degradation, desertification, and drought across multiple key sectors. Conversely, ecosystem- and nature-based projects can address multiple environmental challenges and provide livelihoods and other benefits to local communities and economic sectors. Restoring degraded ecosystems, such as forests or wetlands, can enhance carbon sequestration and storage, promote biodiversity recovery, provide critical services such as pollination or flood regulation, reduce soil erosion, and improve soil fertility and water availability.</p><p>Food systems are another area that cuts across all three Rio Conventions. Sustainable land and water management as well as practices such as agroforestry are critical not only to prevent land degradation and desertification, but also for the conservation of agrobiodiversity, carbon sequestration in soils and biomass, improved soil health and water retention, and long-term agricultural productivity and resilience in the face of climate change. By transforming food systems, the conventions can jointly contribute to food security, climate resilience, and biodiversity conservation.</p><p>Science, policy, and means of implementation</p><p>Synergies between climate action, biodiversity conservation, and land management extend further than individual actions and projects. Governance, science and knowledge management, reporting, capacity-building, national policy processes, and funding mechanisms all have the potential to work towards multiple goals at once and strengthen overall political momentum and awareness of global environmental crises.</p><p>Integrating scientific research into policymaking is essential for the effective implementation of all Rio Conventions and is supported by specialised bodies such as the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES), or the UNCCD Committee on Science and Technology. Each of the three COPs this year will host sessions dedicated to the science-policy interface, highlighting the importance of sharing scientific knowledge and collaborating on research to develop more robust and integrated policies that can simultaneously address multiple environmental issues.</p><p>Similarly, means of implementation-encompassing finance, technology, and capacity-building-are crucial for achieving the goals of all three Rio Conventions and play a prominent role in the multilateral negotiations and technical discussions. Coordinating the existing financial mechanisms, such as the Green Climate Fund or the Global Environmental Facility, could help to optimise resource efficiency and ensure that funding is allocated to projects that offer positive synergies and have only minimal negative trade-offs across the areas of climate change, biodiversity, and land management.</p><p>In conclusion, 2024 is a key year to maximise synergies between the three Rio Conventions and better address the interconnected polycrisis facing humanity in the 21st Century. By aligning efforts in areas such as climate change mitigation and adaptation, nature-based approaches, food systems, science and policy integration, means of implementation, and high-level political engagement, the conventions can achieve greater environmental benefits and promote sustainable development towards more integrated global environmental governance.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Linkages and synergiesThere are significant linkages and potential synergies between the subject areas and policy processes of all three conventions.

Filmmaker and UN Goodwill Ambassador for Biodiversity Edward Norton urges us to 'recognize that we are one of many species in the Tree of Life' and must accelerate action to tackle biodiversity loss. Led by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) and held annually on June 5 since 1973, World Environment Day is the largest global platform for environmental public outreach and is celebrated by millions of people across the world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Melting glaciers</p><p>The global sea level is rising for a number of reasons. Ocean warming and melting ice sheets and glaciers all contribute to overall rise. One impact of rising CO2 concentration is ocean acidification.CO2 reacts with seawater and increases its acidity. It endangers organisms and ecosystem services, including food security, by endangering fisheries and aquaculture. It also affects coastal protection by weakening coral reefs, which shield the coastline.</p><p>Glaciers play an irreplaceable role in the natural world. Evidence shows that glacial melting is happening at an unprecedented rate. Glacial lake floods are a growing threat. In recent years, multiple glacial lake floods have displaced and killed people. Scientists warn that an estimated 15 million people around the world are at risk from such floods. The atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases reflect a balance between emissions from human activities, sources and sinks. Increasing levels of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere due to human activities are a major driver of Climate Change.</p><p>Polythene and Plastic</p><p>Plastics also cause many waste problems. They undergo a process known as photo degradation, in which they break down into smaller and smaller toxic particles. These particles contaminate soil and water and enter the food chain when eaten accidentally by animals like cows. Polythene bags are very dangerous that they can cause the death of the cattle. Polythene bags are also responsible for the clogging of drainage systems in cities and towns. Plastics take several years to decompose. Once polythene bags are used, they often make their way to the streets, beaches and waterways. They litter the environment. When polythene bags are burned, they produce toxic fumes and pollute the air.</p><p>Polythene bags have harmful effects on the environment. Polythene bags are one kind of plastics which are non-biodegradable and cause environmental pollution. They undergo a process known as photo degradation, in which they break down into smaller and smaller toxic particles. They are bad for wildlife. Plastic bags can choke or poison fish, animals and birds, with marine wildlife particularly vulnerable. Numbers of marine animals are killed every year from plastic bag litter in the marine environment as they often mistake plastic bags for food such as jellyfish. Paper bags are one hundred percent recyclable because they don't contain toxic and poisonous gas that plastic bags emit during recycling. They are reusable. Using paper bags and leaving plastic bags means saving nature from pollution.</p><p>Wildlife</p><p>Forests are so much more than a bunch of trees! These complex ecosystems are full of life. In fact, it is estimated that forests are home to 80% of the world's land-based plant and animal species. The lives of these organisms are all interconnected. Even the dead leaves that litter the forest floor have an important ecological role of replenishing the soil nutrients that plants need to grow. Below the ground, trees use a network of fungi to share nutrients with each other. Because life in the forest is so interdependent, it throws off the balance of the entire ecosystem when one part is lost.</p><p>For many rural communities, forests are their neighbourhood 'grocery stores.' Forests are an excellent place to forage for wild foods such as leaves, tubers, and nuts; and the wild animals that live in forests are an important source of protein. Forests also play an essential role in food preparation since about one-third of the world's population uses wood fuel for cooking. Forests influence the water cycle through a process called transpiration. Trees absorb water through their roots which is later released as water vapour from their leaves. This water vapour accumulates into clouds until it falls down again as rain. Forests also keep us safe by defending against natural hazards. Trees and other plants help prevent landslides by holding the soil in place and lessening the force of rain on the ground. Similarly, mangrove forests stabilize shorelines and reduce the power of waves. As such, they act as a natural buffer, protecting coastal communities from the damaging effects of storms and tsunamis.</p><p>Agro-Tourism</p><p>Agroforestry is a management system that combines agriculture and trees to address conservation needs and build more profitable and weather-resilient farms. Interest in agroforestry has increased as more people see it as an important way of meeting our planet's environmental challenges. But agroforestry is not a new phenomenon. It has a long history around the world and was used long before the large-scale approach to agriculture we typically see today.</p><p>Agroforestry is good for the environment because it can increase biodiversity and wildlife, capture carbon dioxide, reduce erosion and improve soil health, provide wind protection and shade, improve water quality, prevent water from becoming overly enriched with nutrients, and provide better protection for microclimates. Agroforestry also brings economic benefits as new, more modern approaches to farming provide greater yields and higher profits.</p><p>Agro-tourism activities provide the supplemental income necessary to allow for the preservation of small and mid-scale farms and rural communities. It can be promoted as an outlet for local residents and tourists to experience direct contact and interaction with agriculture and natural resources. By improving the visibility of rural values, processing, traditional crafts, rural buildings can become a powerful magnet for tourists.</p><p>Way forward</p><p>The pandemic has taught us about sanitization and the worth of the environment, so we should know about reducing the digital carbon footprint to have a clean atmosphere. Environmental restoration helps in tackling the climate crisis, bringing new changes to society, industry and commerce. These changes have a significant role in reducing the damage to our environment and putting the right efforts to all those organisations which are liable for restoring the ecosystem. Environment Sustainability refers to saving the planet. To have environmental sustainability the companies are setting science-based targets about the depth of transportation. The management of the companies is addressing the meaningful emission spanning in the supply chain. The global wind and solar capacity can increase by 70% in 2025. So the strategies of deep building retrofits, electric vehicles, infrastructure and clean technologies will improve the adverse environmental situation. Environmental sustainability is the core need of today's era, as we have to survive and perform in this atmosphere. We must preserve the natural resources for future generations.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

This aim should be at the centre of every project.</p><p>In Tajikistan, annual incomes of IFAD project participants rose by 19 per cent thanks to all actions-from managing pastures to building reliable water sources-being focused on achieving this one overarching goal.</p><p>Rather than growing lots of lower value produce, producers in Nepal grew a small set of high-value products identified by IFAD experts, including ginger, off-season vegetables and goat meat. The result? Their incomes increased by 50 per cent.</p><p>Resilience is imperative</p><p>Resilience means the ability to recover after shocks-and as environmental and climate shocks become increasingly frequent, it has never been more important.</p><p>In Ethiopia, modern irrigation schemes mean farmers can grow food-and make an income-all year. With revenues growing by 23 per cent in the dry season and 77 per cent in the rainy season, farmers did not have to sell off assets to get by in hard times.</p><p>Sustainable success</p><p>A sustainable intervention keeps reaping rewards, even after the project ends.</p><p>In Senegal, producer organisations received subsidies to help them diversify their crops and earn more.

For example, local communities in Mexico helped design initiatives, tailoring them to local contexts. In leafy Campeche State, local communities chose to sustainably manage the forests so they could benefit from agroforestry products and ecotourism. Now, both the forests and their incomes are growing.</p><p>When you empower a woman, you empower a community</p><p>Done right, rural development can empower women. But to know if it's working, we must track gender metrics throughout our projects.</p><p>In Indonesia women came together to process fish and in doing so increased women's participation in the industry by 27 per cent. Meanwhile, households participating in Kenya's SDCP were nine time more likely to have a woman in charge of the family finances.</p><p>In both instances, women were given the tools to reach economic empowerment. This is not only central to realizing women's rights and gender equality but also key to achieving the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.</p><p>Rural Development in India</p><p>Infrastructure plays a critical role in the economic development of any country and Economic growth without investment in rural infrastructure is unsustainable - and unethical. According to the World Bank report, 2021 rural population in India was reported at 64.61 %. Therefore rural development has assumed global attention, especially among developing nations. For a country like India, it has a great significance where rural development focuses on the development of the sections of rural economies, that experience serious poverty issues and effectively aims at developing their productivity.</p><p>Rural infrastructure is of utmost importance for stimulating the rural economy and achieving the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030. India can become a $5 trillion economy by FY2025 too but it requires additional infrastructure. Studies reveal that an almost 1% increase in the stock of infrastructure is associated with a 1% increase in the gross domestic product (GDP) across countries. Several studies also revealed the positive impact of infrastructure development on overall rural welfare.</p><p>A recent study by Gulati et al found that in six states, viz. Punjab, Madhya Pradesh, Gujarat, Uttar Pradesh, Bihar, and Odisha, there are three factors that explained most of the agrarian growth, i.e., (i) access to infrastructure that includes irrigation, roads, and uninterrupted quality power; (ii) diversification to high-value agricultural products such as fruits, vegetables, and allied activities like dairy and poultry; and (iii) price incentives or favorable terms of trade. Rural infrastructure is a crucial ingredient for agriculture and agro-industry development and the overall economic development of rural areas, also provides basic amenities that improve the quality of life-style in rural areas. Adequate infrastructure not only raises productivity but also lowers production costs, thereby improving rural livelihoods and human development in rural areas.</p><p>Access to public infrastructure also affects household labour, transforms gender roles, and favour the diversification of their livelihoods and activities generating income. Hence, the majority of studies show that infrastructure investment has positively impacted rural income. Binswanger et al., in a study of 13 states in India, found that while investments in rural infrastructure lowered transportation costs, it also increased farmers' access to markets, and led the commercialisation of agriculture.</p><p>According to the need for stepping up the agricultural growth rate to 4.5 per cent in the Ninth Five Year Plan, it was necessary to emphasise on developing rural infrastructure such as - irrigation, roads, bridges, etc. as an essential requirement for better productivity of capital and labour. However, one of the basic limitations to creating adequate infrastructure was the lack of resources and difficult financial position of the state governments, who are mainly responsible for developing and maintaining rural infrastructure. Therefore, it was important to create a fund in the name of Rural Infrastructure Development Fund (RIDF) to be operationalized by NABARD.</p><p>It aimed at financing rural projects in the area of basic infrastructure like agriculture, production, transport, marketing and other allied activities. India has prioritized infrastructure development maximum during FY2021. The Taskforce on National Infrastructure Pipeline (NIP) estimated a capital expenditure of 7,73,915 crore between FY2020 and FY2025 on rural infrastructure development by the centre and states.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily News Sri Lanka.

Now, both the forests and their incomes are growing. When you empower a woman, you empower a communityDone right, rural development can empower women. But to know if it's working, we must track gender metrics throughout our projects. In Indonesia women came together to process fish and in doing so increased women's participation in the industry by 27 per cent.

First, I support this collective observation as it is based on science. However, I started to explore further and compare what we see today and what I saw during my journeys sightseeing around the island in the 1960s. I remember observing an almost 6-inch-deep cow dung layer in villages around Sigiriya, Polonnaruwa, Anuradhapura, Batticaloa, Ampara, Panama, Moneragala, Hambantota and Madu areas. These were collected by Jaffna farmers by the truck load. People in those areas have the habit of digging pits and mixing cow dung with the soil. </p><p>So, the whole landscape was pockmarked with these pits. This may be to break the hard-top layer to enable water to enter the ground so to collect seasonal rain. This prevents unused water from washing away the fertile soil and seeds. Finally, it allows seed germination and plant growth. Historically, large herds of cattle, buffalo, and goats roamed the entire country's landscape, including pasture lands, shrub areas, and abandoned chena lands. These pastoralists have for centuries been in the habit of stocking pasture lands, shrub areas and abandoned chena lands with their herds. They contribute significantly to the conservation of biodiversity in the dry zone landscape.These migratory groups and the rural inhabitants have very good indigenous knowledge, and by following these methods, they not only increase long-term soil fertility and biodiversity, but also control plant diseases without harming the environment.</p><p>This practice ensures the safety and purity of water, and also makes use of available resources to produce food for people and animals. Here, I established that, with the green revolution of the 1960s which I witnessed and participated in, we destroyed our agricultural systems that had been practiced for thousands of years, and that I, too, was a big part of it, as were my colleagues in the scientific community. Today, these large herds of thousands of cattle, buffalo and goats are very rare and also restricted by the law. However, these domestic animal herds in these areas still outnumber the scattered wild animal concentrations within the forests in those areas. We should restock these lands by developing herding and land-use programmes, as well as developing an agroforestry network along the forest's perimetre.This will allow the rural folks to coexist with the forest.</p><p>In the past, the adjoining forests to these marginal lands, too, used to play an important role in the life of the human population in rural Sri Lanka. Then the forest provided food, fuel, fiber and medicine. However, even till recent times the rural peasant has continued to coexist with the forests in harmony. Methodical hunting of old, sick or weak wildlife is vital to minimize the human-wildlife conflict, to prevent infections of domestic farm animals and passing on to the human population as in the case of Covid-19. Domestic cattle, buffalo and goat herds were mostly kept closer to forest boundaries in adjoining pasture lands, shrub areas and abandoned</p><p>chena lands.</p><p>As a result, the significance of these domestic animals as primary seed dispersers has been identified and documented. They consume herbage and seeds while grazing in one place, and excrete them in a different place. These seeds started growing in that place. In addition, this act of plant seed dispersal was reinforced by a secondary seed disperser known as the dung beetle who will then disperse some of the seeds to adjoining forest areas, thus increasing or maintaining biodiversity in forest areas. This was a synergic relationship during this period as it supported biodiversity within the forest areas. Evidence from plant demography research reveals that this form of seed dispersal might have an important role in determining patterns of tree diversity and distribution. Therefore, these farmers' role in maintaining a diverse forest cover has to be identified and documented. However, this is not properly acknowledged.</p><p>After morning milking, almost all farmers send their cattle to free grazing on land designated as pasture land under the Pasturelands (Reservation and Development) Act 4 of 1983 (5441-19168-1-SM.pdf). The practice of allowing cattle to graze freely has been practiced for centuries. However, due to the legal pressures imposed by Circular 5/2001, this indigenous aspect of the free grazing system has been jeopardized. It resulted in a decrease in land availability in the total area for free grazing from 60-80% (1970-2000) to 5-30% (2001-2020) and created a seed dispersal limitation. The first observation following the implementation of Circular 5/2001 was that the ruminant population was deprived of adequate feed and nutrients to produce replacement stock and milk. The component of providing herbage through free grazing to these stocks was not included in the workload of the paddy and crop farming community. The second observation was a rapid decrease in the national ruminant numbers.</p><p>The Circular 5/2001, makes it practically impossible for smallholder farmers to rear farm animals. Hence, most had to discontinue a livelihood that sustained their crop cultivation activities by providing a daily income. Livestock supplemented their income on a daily basis as opposed to crop farming's seasonal income. In addition, livestock has a significant asset value that can be used as collateral and in times of need. Therefore, livestock increases economic stability for rural peasants and smallholder farmers by serving as a cash buffer, a capital reserve, and a deterrent to inflation. Furthermore, it reduces risks associated with crop cultivation. Rearing livestock is not hassle free, but the outcome surpasses all that.</p><p>It is known that 82% rural peasants were part-time farmers (DA 2000) and was confirmed by a study in 2017. Furthermore, 80 % of smallholder farmers are blacklisted by formal lending organizations. According to a 2017 study, 75% of the remaining 20% not blacklisted are Crop-Dairy farmers. However, only 10.8% of farms have crop-dairy integrated operations. These smallholder farmers continued with their home garden crop-dairy integrated farming system. Others discontinued and found extra income generation outside farming. Chart 1 below depicts the monthly income disparities between different land holdings in Anuradhapura and Vavuniya (2017).</p><p>Farmers having below three hectares get almost twice the income from livestock than from crop farming. This group consists of around 90% of the farming community. Farmers above three hectares get twice the income as those below 3 hectares. This implies that the smallholders below 3 hectares should rear more cattle. This is only possible if the free grazing system can be used during the day and fed processed feed such as maize silage during the night time. The synergistic effect of Crop-Dairy integration, which enabled the vast majority of smallholder farmers to earn a decent living, was undone by Circular 5/2001.This has had a significant impact on the food production system, such as the increased use of inorganic inputs for crop cultivation. This is essential to compensate for the minimum time allocated to crop cultivation by these part-time farmers. This also resulted in narrowing the profit margins or turnover from crop product sales. Therefore, the bottom line is to increase the number of farmers doing integrated crop-dairy farming in all agro-ecological zones in Sri Lanka. However, this would give better results if this project mimicked the system that was practiced in ancient times.</p><p>All pasture land and marginal areas should be demarcated as ruminant grazing areas under the supervision of the relevant Veterinary Surgeon, the Agrarian Development Authority and the Forest Department. Only community grazing is allowed to be practiced. Pasture land areas in each village should be divided into sub-areas, enclosed and numbered. These three organizations should draw up a grazing schedule for each village. All cattle in a village should be allowed to graze in the number 1 sub-area, where the number of days depends on the availability of the feed resource base. Then a subsequent sub-area will be opened to graze all the cattle in that village. However, farmers should dig pits in the first sub-area and fill them with soil mixed with cattle manure. This rotation should continue year-round. All sub-areas should have access to water. Planting shade trees species selected by the Forest Department should be provided to the village farmer group. The responsibility of this tree growth is for cattle keepers using this facility. A programme has to be introduced to use culled cows for breeding to provide female calves for new farmers. Male cattle should be fattened before being sold to butchers in these areas.Culled cows should be maintained in these areas until death and the carcasses will be used for compost making. This project requires planning.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

This practice ensures the safety and purity of water, and also makes use of available resources to produce food for people and animals. Here, I established that, with the green revolution of the 1960s which I witnessed and participated in, we destroyed our agricultural systems that had been practiced for thousands of years, and that I, too, was a big part of it, as were my colleagues in the scientific community. Today, these large herds of thousands of cattle, buffalo and goats are very rare and also restricted by the law. However, these domestic animal herds in these areas still outnumber the scattered wild animal concentrations within the forests in those areas. We should restock these lands by developing herding and land-use programmes, as well as developing an agroforestry network along the forest's perimetre. This will allow the rural folks to coexist with the forest. In the past, the adjoining forests to these marginal lands, too, used to play an important role in the life of the human population in rural Sri Lanka. Then the forest provided food, fuel, fiber and medicine. However, even till recent times the rural peasant has continued to coexist with the forests in harmony. Methodical hunting of old, sick or weak wildlife is vital to minimize the human-wildlife conflict, to prevent infections of domestic farm animals and passing on to the human population as in the case of Covid-19."]}, {"relevance_score": 28, "title": "Sri Lanka's Inaugural 'International Climate Change Forum', held on 2nd &amp; 3rd November in Colombo, concludes successfully", "published": "2023-11-13", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka, Nov. 13 -- Climate Change has been identified as one of the greatest threats to the sustainability of the planet, and in a pioneering stance to address these challenges, Sri Lanka proudly hosted the inaugural 'International Climate Change Forum' (ICCF) on November 2nd and 3rd, 2023, in Colombo.

As an initial step, the Indian Government will focus on farmlands within 5-km-wide corridors along the river Ganga. In addition, agricultural universities will be encouraged to revise their syllabi to include natural, zero-budget, and organic farming, technology-based modern-day agriculture or precision farming, value addition, and management.</p><p>From technology to crop insurance, from easier credit access to modern irrigation methods, the Government of India is implementing a comprehensive action plan to empower farmers throughout the farming cycle - a facilitating umbrella of Beej Se Bazaar Tak (BSBT) (from seed to market).</p><p>However, as the quality of crops is directly linked to seeds, ensuring quality seeds is vital.

Anticipating a bountiful harvest this April and a subsequent yield by year-end, agriculture has undeniably played a pivotal role in navigating this economic challenge.</p><p>Recognizing agriculture's potential to drive sustained national development, it is imperative for every country to acknowledge its significance and prioritize its advancement.</p><p>Another critical factor contributing to the crisis we faced is the trade balance deficit. Historically, we've struggled to maintain a favourable trade balance and have accrued a substantial amount of foreign debt that seems insurmountable within current repayment agreements.</p><p>Consequently, our country requires a comprehensive economic transformation guided by three key principles: competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and digitalization.</p><p>With a rich agricultural and export heritage spanning over 2000 years, Sri Lanka initially thrived on rice and grain exports, supported by our advanced irrigation systems.</p><p>Traditionally, wealth wasn't derived directly from land ownership but from control over water reservoirs in our ancient irrigated civilization. Following its decline, we transitioned to the wet zone, where spices became a prominent export until the decline in prices during British rule prompted a shift to tea, coconut, and rubber cultivation. Despite India and Sri Lanka maintaining dominance in these sectors globally, our agricultural development has been neglected.</p><p>In 1972, large estates were dismantled, capping land ownership at 50 acres, while initiatives like the Mahaweli scheme allocated vast acreage for cultivation, supported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. However, progress was impeded by the conflict.</p><p>Efforts to revitalize and expand our agricultural sector are imperative for sustainable economic growth and development.</p><p>Even after neglecting the plantation industry for some time, we must now re-engage with it. It's imperative that we put in the necessary effort. Our goal is to regain our status as a country that exports agricultural products. This objective is being thoroughly studied.</p><p>We can draw inspiration from our friendly country, Thailand, which currently maintains a robust agricultural export economy. Let's take cues from their success. Our first step is to restructure the existing system and involve the private sector.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the adoption of modern agricultural techniques in our country. This is crucial for our agricultural sector's advancement, even though it may take 10 to 15 years to fully implement. However, our aim is to expedite this process and achieve our goals within a decade. We are actively introducing the latest agricultural practices to our nation.</p><p>Yet, we face another challenge: the exodus of young people from rural areas to urban centres, resulting in a decline in traditional agricultural participation. Introducing smart agricultural practices to rural communities can help retain youth in villages. To address this, we have consolidated the Ministry of Agriculture, previously divided into three ministries, under one minister, to prioritize this issue. Moreover, we have initiated restructuring efforts within related institutions. Our primary focus is to ensure that farmers receive quality service.</p><p>Furthermore, we are endeavouring to transform agrarian service centres nationwide into modernization hubs for agriculture. To achieve this goal, we are actively seeking contributions from both the public and private sectors.</p><p>In addition, we recognize the need to address gaps in the purchase of agricultural products, establish new supply chains and develop cold storage facilities. Many of these essential facilities are currently unavailable in Sri Lanka, so we are committed to bringing them to fruition. This transformative initiative will significantly impact the agricultural sector.</p><p>Moreover, we have initiated the largest privatization effort in the country's history. As part of this initiative, we are facilitating access to land for farmers, including previously unused land within the Mahaweli scheme. These lands are being made available to individuals interested in engaging in modern agriculture, marking the beginning of a new era in farming practices.</p><p>Since 1935, we have allocated land to farmers under the Land Development Ordinance, providing them with licences rather than legal ownership. To rectify this, we are granting freehold ownership of these lands to the farmers. This year alone, over a million farmers will receive freehold deeds to their land.</p><p>Additionally, we have initiated efforts to enhance the animal husbandry sector, particularly focusing on milk production. Currently, each animal produces only 2 litres of milk. However, we are determined to increase this yield. To achieve this, we are finalizing an agreement with Amul to collaborate with the government-owned MILCO.</p><p>Our goal is to rear 2 million animals capable of producing 10 litres of milk per day, significantly boosting milk production and revitalizing the animal industry.</p><p>As a result, we anticipate obtaining 20 million litres of milk solely through this initiative, benefiting around two hundred thousand farmers. Moreover, several other companies are stepping forward to contribute to this endeavour.</p><p>Companies such as Nestle, Fonterra and Ambewela Farming, alongside other institutions, have significantly increased milk production to approximately 28 litres per animal.

Approximately 70% of the Asia-Pacific region's population relies on agriculture. This year's conference, themed \"Transformation of the Agro-Food System,\" will delve into key areas such as promoting nutritious food production, ensuring food security, enhancing food production, safeguarding the environment, curbing greenhouse gas emissions, and mitigating climate change risks.</p><p>Following the conference's opening session, President Ranil Wickremesinghe participated in a group photo with foreign ministers and delegates before engaging in discussions with attending agriculture ministers.</p><p>President Ranil Wickremesinghe emphasized the vital role of the Food and Agriculture Organization in bolstering food security, fostering sustainable agricultural production, and advancing resilient small-scale agricultural systems aligned with the Sustainable Development Goals in the Asia-Pacific region.</p><p>Highlighting agriculture's pivotal role in Sri Lanka's economic transformation, President Ranil Wickremesinghe outlined the country's forthcoming initiatives.</p><p>He further said;</p><p>\"Despite recent economic challenges, including fertilizer shortages and foreign exchange constraints in 2022, Sri Lanka is now moving towards stability. Anticipating the finalization of debt restructuring agreements, Sri Lanka aims to emerge from its economic crisis and transition towards a revitalized economy, emphasizing the need for sustained efforts beyond mere stabilization.</p><p>When assessing our economy, agriculture emerges as a sector capable of delivering swift results, closely followed by tourism.</p><p>Fortunately, the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) facilitated the procurement of fertilizer, thereby bolstering our agricultural capabilities.</p><p>As a result, as we approached the main cultivation season in April 2023, we found ourselves out of jeopardy, enjoying a bountiful season. This instilled confidence in our ability to progress.</p><p>The absence of domestic food production would have precipitated another crisis this year, but fortune favoured us. Anticipating a bountiful harvest this April and a subsequent yield by year-end, agriculture has undeniably played a pivotal role in navigating this economic challenge.</p><p>Recognizing agriculture's potential to drive sustained national development, it is imperative for every country to acknowledge its significance and prioritize its advancement.</p><p>Another critical factor contributing to the crisis we faced is the trade balance deficit. Historically, we've struggled to maintain a favourable trade balance and have accrued a substantial amount of foreign debt that seems insurmountable within current repayment agreements.</p><p>Consequently, our country requires a comprehensive economic transformation guided by three key principles: competitiveness, environmental sustainability, and digitalization.</p><p>With a rich agricultural and export heritage spanning over 2000 years, Sri Lanka initially thrived on rice and grain exports, supported by our advanced irrigation systems.</p><p>Traditionally, wealth wasn't derived directly from land ownership but from control over water reservoirs in our ancient irrigated civilization. Following its decline, we transitioned to the wet zone, where spices became a prominent export until the decline in prices during British rule prompted a shift to tea, coconut, and rubber cultivation. Despite India and Sri Lanka maintaining dominance in these sectors globally, our agricultural development has been neglected.</p><p>In 1972, large estates were dismantled, capping land ownership at 50 acres, while initiatives like the Mahaweli scheme allocated vast acreage for cultivation, supported by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization. However, progress was impeded by the conflict.</p><p>Efforts to revitalize and expand our agricultural sector are imperative for sustainable economic growth and development.</p><p>Even after neglecting the plantation industry for some time, we must now re-engage with it. It's imperative that we put in the necessary effort. Our goal is to regain our status as a country that exports agricultural products. This objective is being thoroughly studied.</p><p>We can draw inspiration from our friendly country, Thailand, which currently maintains a robust agricultural export economy. Let's take cues from their success. Our first step is to restructure the existing system and involve the private sector.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the adoption of modern agricultural techniques in our country. This is crucial for our agricultural sector's advancement, even though it may take 10 to 15 years to fully implement. However, our aim is to expedite this process and achieve our goals within a decade. We are actively introducing the latest agricultural practices to our nation.</p><p>Yet, we face another challenge: the exodus of young people from rural areas to urban centres, resulting in a decline in traditional agricultural participation. Introducing smart agricultural practices to rural communities can help retain youth in villages. To address this, we have consolidated the Ministry of Agriculture, previously divided into three ministries, under one minister, to prioritize this issue. Moreover, we have initiated restructuring efforts within related institutions. Our primary focus is to ensure that farmers receive quality service.</p><p>Furthermore, we are endeavouring to transform agrarian service centres nationwide into modernization hubs for agriculture. To achieve this goal, we are actively seeking contributions from both the public and private sectors.</p><p>In addition, we recognize the need to address gaps in the purchase of agricultural products, establish new supply chains and develop cold storage facilities. Many of these essential facilities are currently unavailable in Sri Lanka, so we are committed to bringing them to fruition. This transformative initiative will significantly impact the agricultural sector.</p><p>Moreover, we have initiated the largest privatization effort in the country's history. As part of this initiative, we are facilitating access to land for farmers, including previously unused land within the Mahaweli scheme. These lands are being made available to individuals interested in engaging in modern agriculture, marking the beginning of a new era in farming practices.</p><p>Since 1935, we have allocated land to farmers under the Land Development Ordinance, providing them with licenses rather than legal ownership. To rectify this, we are granting freehold ownership of these lands to the farmers. This year alone, over a million farmers will receive freehold deeds to their land.</p><p>Additionally, we have initiated efforts to enhance the animal husbandry sector, particularly focusing on milk production. Currently, each animal produces only 2 litres of milk. However, we are determined to increase this yield. To achieve this, we are finalizing an agreement with Amul to collaborate with the government-owned MILCO.</p><p>Our goal is to rear 2 million animals capable of producing 10 litres of milk per day, significantly boosting milk production and revitalizing the animal industry.</p><p>As a result, we anticipate obtaining 20 million litres of milk solely through this initiative, benefiting around two hundred thousand farmers. Moreover, several other companies are stepping forward to contribute to this endeavour.</p><p>Companies such as Nestle, Fonterra and Ambewela Farming, alongside other institutions, have significantly increased milk production to approximately 28 litres per animal. This concerted effort is expected to substantially augment milk production in the country.</p><p>Additionally, we are prioritizing the promotion of both freshwater and saltwater fishing industries in Sri Lanka. Through various strategic plans, Sri Lanka aims to make significant contributions to global food security.</p><p>While contemplating the global population projection for 2050, it's important to acknowledge that we may not be present at that time. Nevertheless, it's anticipated that the population will surge by 500 to 600 million individuals from Iran to Indonesia. This growth is expected to coincide with an overall improvement in living standards and income levels for everyone. Conversely, countries in Africa, particularly East and South Africa, will face significant food demand, emphasizing the importance of proactive measures to address future food security challenges.</p><p>Furthermore, Sri Lanka is demonstrating a strong commitment to combating climate change. To this end, we have proposed two initiatives, one of which aims to designate the tropical region, including the Indian Ocean, as a carbon-absorbing zone.</p><p>Encouraging private sector investments in grasslands and forests within our respective countries is essential. We must approach this pragmatically, acknowledging that countries like the UK may not fund projects in Mali, nor would Finland necessarily provide funding to Sri Lanka. Nevertheless, we are actively working to attract investment from various sources.</p><p>Furthermore, efforts are underway to establish a climate change university in Sri Lanka, with the necessary land already identified for this purpose. Discussions are on-going with the Republic of South Korea regarding the commencement of building construction and numerous other stakeholders have shown interest in participating in this endeavour. Additionally, there are plans to consolidate all agricultural research centres in Sri Lanka under the umbrella of the Agricultural Technology University.</p><p>Amidst these initiatives, we are hopeful for the support of the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (UNFAO) for the government's program aimed at facilitating the rapid transformation of agriculture in our country.</p><p>Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries Mahinda Amaraweera:</p><p>I am honoured to address you once more as the Minister of Agriculture and Plantation Industries of Sri Lanka.

The world today is at a critical inflection point. The sheer number of ongoing crises calls for bold collective action, 'Cooperation in a Fragmented World.'</p><p>Introduction</p><p>The world is facing a climate crisis, with global temperatures continuing to rise due to the increase of greenhouse gas emissions. Developed countries have a significant role to play in addressing this crisis, given their historical and current emissions and their position of power and resources. The problem of climate change is global in nature and</p><p>requires action from all nations. Developing nations have an important role to play in transitioning to more sustainable practices and technologies, and there is a growing recognition that support and investment from developed nations is crucial in achieving this transition. Cooperation is essential in addressing the climate crisis, as it requires a collective effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, transition to renewable energy sources, and adapt to the impacts of climate change. This cooperation must extend beyond national borders and involve a range of stakeholders, including businesses, civil society, and international organisations.</p><p>The developing world, however, faces unique challenges in transitioning to a low-carbon economy, including limited resources, competing development priorities, and a lack of technological expertise. This piece articulates how the developed world must use its power and resources to accelerate the green transition in the developing nations, explaining the different ways in their transition to a low-carbon economy, including financial and technical support, knowledge sharing, and leading by example.</p><p>Financial and technical support</p><p>Developed countries have made significant progress in developing and implementing clean energy technologies such as wind, solar, and hydropower. The same status in developing and emerging countries varies depending on the specific country and region. However, there has been substantial improvement in recent years in increasing the</p><p>deployment of these clean energy technologies in some of the developing and emerging countries such as India, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, Morocco and Kenya.</p><p>China has become a major player in global efforts to tackle climate change. It is currently the world's largest emitter of greenhouse gases, but it has also taken significant steps to reduce its carbon footprint and promote sustainable development.</p><p>In recent years, China has invested heavily in renewable energy sources such as wind and solar power. It has also introduced policies to promote energy efficiency and reduce pollution. In addition, China has played a leading role in international climate negotiations and has pledged to peak its carbon emissions by 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060.</p><p>This financial support to developing nations in their transition to a low-carbon economy can come in many forms, including grants, loans, and technical assistance. For example, developed countries can provide financial assistance to support the development of renewable energy infrastructure in developing nations. This can include funding for</p><p>solar and wind farms, as well as support for energy storage systems. They can also provide technical assistance to help developing countries to build capacity in renewable energy technology. This can include training programs, technical workshops, and other forms of capacity building.</p><p>These technologies can provide a sustainable source of energy for developing countries, but they require technical expertise and resources to implement. Developed countries can share their knowledge and expertise in these areas to support the development and implementation of clean energy technologies in developing countries.</p><p>Another important area is agriculture which is a significant source of greenhouse gas emissions in many developing countries, particularly in countries where traditional farming practices are still in use. Developed countries can provide financial assistance to support the development of sustainable farming practices including support for agroforestry systems, the adoption to conservation agriculture, and the promotion of sustainable land use.</p><p>However, as 'The Economist' refers, we need to consider the fact that rice, which feeds closer to 60% of the world's population, fuels climate change, due to the high emission of methane from paddy fields. Rice's nutritional quality is another growing concern particularly in terms of its high glycemic index and low levels of iron and zinc which can trigger diabetes.</p><p>Knowledge sharing</p><p>Developed countries have already made significant progress in transitioning to a low-carbon economy, and they can share their experiences and lessons learned with developing countries.

However, transitioning to a low-carbon economy can be challenging for developing nations, particularly if they lack the financial resources or technological expertise to do so. This is why support and investment from developed nations are essential in achieving a successful transition. It is also important to note that this support should be provided in a manner that respects the sovereignty of developing countries and their right to determine their own development paths. Developed countries should work in partnership with developing countries to ensure that the transition is just, equitable, and beneficial for all.</p><p>Developed nations can provide financial assistance, technology transfer, and capacity-building to help developing nations adopt sustainable practices and technologies.

In an era, where vast opportunities are growing for low-cost GHG reduction projects, SLCCS enables it to bring multiple benefits to the environment, society and economy.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Definition</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A carbon offset is a way of compensating for emissions of carbon dioxide or other greenhouse gases. It is a reduction or removal of emissions to compensate for other emissions elsewhere. A carbon credit or offset credit is a transferrable instrument that governments or independent certification bodies have certified. It represents an emission reduction of one metric ton of carbon dioxide or CO2. It can also represent an equivalent amount of other Green House Gases (GHGs). Carbon offsets and credits are a form of carbon pricing, along with carbon taxes and subsidies. The concepts of offsets and credits are linked.</p><p>Both offsets and credits can move among the various markets they are traded. <url normalizedValue=\"https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/what-carbonpricing#:~:text=Carbon%20pricing%20is%20an%20instrument,to%20their%20\">https://carbonpricingdashboard.worldbank.org/what-carbonpricing#:~:text=Carbon%20pricing%20is%20an%20instrument,to%20their%20</url> sources%20through%20a</p><p>Carbon markets</p><p>Carbon markets are the trading systems in which carbon credits are sold and bought. Companies or individuals can use carbon markets to compensate for their greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by purchasing carbon credits from entities that remove or reduce greenhouse gas emissions. One tradable carbon credit equals one ton of carbon dioxide or the equivalent amount of a different greenhouse gas reduced, sequestered or avoided. When a credit is used to reduce, sequester, or avoid emissions, it becomes an offset and is no longer 2 tradable. A carbon credit is the representation of a ton of carbon that is no longer emitted into the atmosphere, contributing to the reduction of the greenhouse effect.</p><p>There are several ways to generate carbon credits, including the substitution of fuels in factories, where they stop using non-renewable biomass, such as firewood from deforestation, and start using renewable biomass, which in addition to emitting less greenhouse gases, contribute to the reduction of deforestation.</p><p>Carbon credit is the currency used in the carbon market. In this market, companies that have a very high level of emissions and few options for reduction can buy carbon credits to offset their emissions.</p><p>Thus, it indirectly helps to maintain the reduction project and, in addition to balancing the level of the emissions into the atmosphere, contribute to the sustainable development of poor communities. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.sustainablecarbon.com/en/como-sao-gerados\">https://www.sustainablecarbon.com/en/como-sao-gerados</url></p><p>Kyoto Protocol and Paris Agreement</p><p>On December 11, 1997, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) was linked to what is known as the Kyoto Protocol in Kyoto, Japan. It is an international agreement that sets specific targets for 37 industrialized countries and the European community for reducing Green House Gas emissions, approximately by about 5 percent.</p><p>Owing to a complex ratification process, it entered into force on 16 February 2005. Currently, there are 192 parties to the Kyoto Protocol (191 States and 1 regional economic integration organization) the European Union, Cook Islands, Niue, and all UN member states except Andorra, Canada, South Sudan, and the United States as of 2022.</p><p>Surprisingly, this excludes the United States, the most noted polluter in the modern world. 3 Percentages in this depiction may not add up to 100% due to independent rounding and the way the inventory quantifies the U.S. as a separate sector. Further, it's based on gross total emissions excluding emissions and removals from the land use, land use change and forestry sector.</p><p>U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. <url normalizedValue=\"https://cfpub.epa.gov/ghgdata/inventoryexplorer/\">https://cfpub.epa.gov/ghgdata/inventoryexplorer/</url> The Kyoto Protocol treaty has established three mechanisms that enable countries or operators in developed countries to acquire offset credits. The economics behind these programs were that the marginal cost of reducing emissions would differ among countries.</p><p>Research suggests that the flexibility mechanisms could reduce the overall cost of meeting the targets. As discussed, the Kyoto Protocol is based on the principles and provisions of the Convention and follows its annex-based structure.</p><p>It only binds developed countries and places a heavier burden on them under the principle of \"common but differentiated responsibility and respective capabilities\", because it recognizes that they are largely responsible for the current high levels of GHG emissions in the atmosphere.</p><p>Sri Lanka submitted its instrument of acceptance of the Doha amendment to the Kyoto Protocol to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change on 2 December 2015.</p><p>Sri Lanka Accepts KP Amendment 4 December 2015 <url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/news/sri-lanka-accepts-kp-amendment\">https://unfccc.int/news/sri-lanka-accepts-kp-amendment</url><url normalizedValue=\"https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol\">https://unfccc.int/kyoto_protocol</url> 4.</p><p>A variety of greenhouse gas reduction projects could be used to create offsets and credits. Forestry projects are the fastest-growing category. Renewable energy is another common type and includes wind farms, biomass energy, biogas digesters, or hydroelectric dams. Other types include energy efficiency projects, such as efficient cookstoves, and the destruction of landfill methane. Further include methods that use negative emission technologies, such as biochar, carbonated building elements, and geologically stored carbon. The primary ingredient for making biochar is a copious quantity of agricultural waste. Covered with tea, rubber and cinnamon plantations, Sri Lanka has no shortage of residual biomass.</p><p>Traditionally, these vegetative remnants and offcuts would be sold for firewood or simply thrown into a heap and burned. <url normalizedValue=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offsets_and_credits#:~:text=A%20variet\">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_offsets_and_credits#:~:text=A%20variet</url> y%20of%20projects%20have,and%20carbon%2Dnegative%20fuels).</p><p>Other International Programs</p><p>Protecting the forests is crucial for the climate. Forests absorb vast amounts of carbon dioxide and can be a source of greenhouse gas emissions when destroyed or damaged. Countries established the 'REDD+' framework to protect forests as part of the Paris Agreement. 'REDD' stands for 'Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in developing countries.</p><p>The '+' stands for additional forest-related activities that protect the climate, namely sustainable management of forests and the conservation and enhancement of forest carbon stocks. Under the framework of these REDD+ activities, developing countries can receive results-based payments for emission reductions when they reduce deforestation. This serves as a major incentive for their efforts. Carbon Credits and Sri Lanka Carbon credits could help Sri Lanka in several ways by providing economic and environmental benefits.</p><p>Some of the potential ways in which carbon credits can be beneficial to Sri Lanka are; Mitigation of Climate Change: Sri Lanka can participate in carbon credit programs to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions.</p><p>This could involve implementing projects that promote renewable energy, energy efficiency, afforestation, and sustainable agricultural practices. By earning carbon credits through these initiatives, Sri Lanka can contribute to global efforts to mitigate climate change. Revenue Generation: Carbon credits can be bought and sold on international markets. By earning carbon credits through sustainable projects, Sri Lanka can sell these credits to countries or companies that exceed their emission targets. This creates a new revenue stream for the country, which can be reinvested in further sustainable development projects.</p><p>Renewable Energy Projects:</p><p>We can develop and invest in renewable energy projects such as wind, solar, hydropower or a hybrid solution that could have a 5 combination of all of them.</p><p>These projects can generate carbon credits by displacing the need for fossil fuel-based energy sources.</p><p>Additionally, they contribute to the country's energy security and reduce dependence on imported fuels. Rural Development: Carbon credit projects often involve activities in rural areas, such as reforestation and sustainable agriculture. These projects can lead to employment creation and improved livelihoods for local communities on agroforestry projects that impound carbon and can provide additional income for the farmers. International Collaboration: Participation in carbon credit programs fosters international collaboration and partnerships.</p><p>Sri Lanka could work with other countries, non-governmental organizations, and private entities to implement and finance projects that reduce emissions and enhance sustainability. Environmental Conservation: Carbon credit projects often involve initiatives that contribute to environmental conservation, such as protecting biodiversity and preserving natural habitats.</p><p>These activities can have a positive effect on the country's ecosystems and biodiversity. Compliance with International Agreements: Sri Lanka's involvement in carbon credit programs can help the country meet its commitments under international agreements such as the Paris Agreement, by actively participating in global efforts to address climate change. In addition, Sri Lanka can enhance its reputation and relationships on the international stage.</p><p>Climate Fund</p><p>The Sri Lanka Climate Fund is a government-owned company established under the Companies Act No.7 of 2007 of Sri Lanka. This fund's effort is to build a new low-carbon business economy and low-carbon life patterns.</p><p>While optimizing carbon emission performance in existing facilities, the company is looking to explore the potential for new effective low-carbon solutions through innovative strategies and collaboration with local and International markets.</p><p>Further, it's essential to take cognizance that the success of carbon credit initiatives depends on effective project implementation, monitoring, and verification. Additionally, the regulatory framework and market conditions for carbon credits can influence their overall impact. Importantly a national instrument and collaboration between all stakeholders would pave the way for the successful implementation of the initiatives. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.climatefund.lk/slcf_index\">https://www.climatefund.lk/slcf_index</url> Inference \"The small island countries.are on the frontline of being swallowed into an abyss, created initially by human activity and increasingly by inaction.

Sri Lanka has an inordinate need for change.</p><p>It needs to adopt practices that will not only ensure reductions in GHG emission levels but, more importantly, adapt measures to ensure a safe future. It can be easily assimilated that climate change is directly affecting Sri Lanka, whereby we need to look specifically at the impact on Sri Lanka's environment, agriculture, tourism, health, and society at large. We being a developing nation need to increase domestic and foreign investments to further our infrastructure and industry to join the rapidly developing nations.</p><p>Climate change can hinder this process dramatically if efforts are not taken to reduce and arrest the present-day trends.</p><p>Leading stakeholders in this issue the United States, European Union, and China, along with most other developed nations need to consider the negative impact of their industries and curb these industries in a way which will reduce the bearing on climate change.

It is of the view that both these initiatives need an aggressive awareness campaign amongst the public at large. These instruments need a further intensive and proactive approach to capture the target audience. It is the view that Sri Lanka should accelerate measures to adapt to climate change before it is too late. Even though Sri Lanka has a relatively minor role in mitigating this global threat, Sri Lanka and the whole world will nevertheless have to face this challenge as one. <url normalizedValue=\"https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/baba_accessible\">https://www.american.edu/cas/economics/ejournal/upload/baba_accessible</url>.</p><p>The writer is formerly Commander Sri Lanka Air Force and Ambassador to Afghanistan President of the Association of Retired Flag Rank Officers.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Also, there have been issues of concern about the management of spatial development programmes and projects that have been started. Consequently, many socioeconomic problems have been created. Some are irreparable; some can be rectified at an excessive cost. Unfortunately, policy formulators have yet to realise the gravity of the issue, and they keep blind eyes, allowing further mismanagement of the limited land resources without remedial actions. To understand the seriousness of the problem and the urgent need for solutions, some of the issues and related programs and activities that led to significant misuse/mismanagement of space and their effects are discussed below.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">4.1 Land Alienation Policy, Unplanned Village Expansion Schemes and Encroachments</p><p>The traditional villages could no longer accommodate the increasing population, preventing them from becoming landless, homeless, and unemployed. The Land Development Ordinance-1935 allowed the legal alienation of state lands to landless people. The government has implemented many Village Expansion schemes, especially in densely populated wet zones, to distribute lands to spillovers from traditional villages for agriculture and dwelling purposes. Very often, marginal lands next to the traditional villages, buffer zones of sanctuaries and national parks, and forest reserves around villages were selected for this purpose. Those were hilly or rocky trains with poor-quality soil, without drinking and irrigation water. Under a scientific and rational land use system, most of those should have been used for nature reserves, agroforestry, etc. These lands do not generate a decent income to sustain settler families. Hence, it amounts to misuse of land and other resources.</p><p>Though the legal framework was provided under the Land Development Ordinance, there was no consistent policy or regular system to distribute land. So, people suffering from land hunger were prompted to encroach on state lands for housing, cultivation, and business purposes. Later, the government adopted a policy for regularising the encroached lands, and encroaching became the accepted practice to receive a block of state land. This policy stimulated people (not only the landless) to encroach on any vacant state lands, including roads, rivers, reservoirs, forest and wildlife reservations, and environmentally sensitive places such as hilltops, flood plains, water sources, etc. Due to social and political pressure, the government was compelled to provide infrastructure facilities and other amenities to these unviable settlements at a massive cost. A proper analysis of the socioeconomic cost of these settlements would reveal that settling them in better locations would be much more economical and enable them to find jobs and easy access to services. In that case, the unit infrastructure cost per household will be much lower. The concept behind land allocation in village expansion and colonization schemes seems to be that farmers must cultivate the same land, which shelters them. Therefore, the cost-effectiveness of infrastructure, service delivery system, and convenience of settlers have not received due attention.</p><p>Moreover, there have been instances where lands suitable for productive purposes (commercial activities, industries, or tourism) have been alienated in small blocks for low-income housing schemes. Similarly, some East Coast lands ideal for tourism-related projects are used for military camps and related activities. A sizable block of land in Borella with very high commercial value is used for the prison. High-value lands in Colombo Fort have been used as military and defense headquarters until they were relocated recently. All those are a few examples of government-sponsored uneconomical use and mismanagement of the space.</p><p>4.2 Uncontrolled Urban Sprawl and its Effects</p><p>Western province, which includes the Colombo, Gampaha and Kalutara districts, has the highest population density in the country: 3621,1802 and 815 people per sq. km. respectively. The urban sprawl of Combo extends more than 40 Km. from the city centre, which encompasses catchment areas of 3 District capitals, forming a single sizeable urban agglomerate. Settlements are expanding rapidly without proper regional and sub-regional plans to guide them. In the absence of proper spatial plans, land is being sold for property development in every nook and corner of the province, disregarding the need for transport, associated infrastructure, and urban services. If the present phase of land sub-division and urban sprawl continues for a few more years, the entire province will be covered with roofs and septic tanks, leaving little space for other human settlement needs.</p><p>Another significant issue is the urbanisation along the main roads on a linear pattern (ribbon-type development), erecting barricades denying proper access to the much larger land area behind the built strip. Hence, those lands would remain rural or shanties with no commercial value. For instance, either side along the Galle Road from Colombo to Tangalle (205 Km) is blocked with linear structures, leaving little room for access to scattered housing and settlements (large areas) behind. It looks like the entire road passes through an extended urban area, making no difference between the village and the town along the road. The same situation exists along the Kandy Road up to Ambepussa, Negambo Road to Chilaw and Ratnapura Road to Hanwella.The ribbon-type development along the main roads prevents the trickle-down effects of costly road programmes. Urban sprawl is a significant issue for cities like Kandy and Nuwara Eliya, which are getting overpopulated beyond their carrying capacity. To accommodate the growing population, physical developments occur in environmentally sensitive surroundings of most hill country cities.</p><p>4.3 Conflict Between Settlement Pattern and Transport Solutions.</p><p>4.3.1 Colombo Metropolitan Region</p><p>According to an IMF analysis, Sri Lanka is among the countries with the slowest road speed. As per the Road Quality Index 2019, Sri Lanka's score is 3.9, which is below the global average of 4.07. The traffic congestion and transport problem in the greater Colombo area has been a topic for several decades for many studies by transport planners and international funding agencies. Professor Amsal Kumarage states in his article titled URBAN TRAFFIC CONGESTION: THE PROBLEM and SOLUTION, published in the Economic Review, Sri Lanka, 'According to the TransPlan Model (UoM,1999), average traffic speeds within the Colombo Metropolitan Region (CMR) have dropped to around 20km/hr today. The typical corridor (major artery) speed is around 10-15 kms/hr within Colombo City'. His research report titled GRATER COLOMBO TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, submitted to the Minister of Transport, states 'around 70% of the length of the national roads within the 10-km radius from the city centre is congested throughout the day. The average speed on these roads falls below 15 kms per hour. At such speeds, fuel consumption doubles, consequently increasing air pollution as well'. The article titled Transport Delemma: What is the Way out? Published in Daily FT on 7 February 2019, it states, 'Commuting to and from Colombo city is a daily struggle. The average speed in Colombo's major corridors during the peak hours has reduced to about 12km per hour'. 'The loss of productive time increases costs and productivity losses and waste of foreign exchange on fuel and mental agony of those commuters and drivers are the outcomes of the present transport economy of the country'. 'The average speed in Colombo major corridors during the peak hours has reduced to about 12km per hour'.</p><p>The above excerpts emphasise the gravity of transport problems in Colombo City, Greater Colombo, and the Western Province. This problem also exists in other cities to varying degrees. Sri Lankan professionals and international funding agencies have put forward various solutions and project proposals to resolve the transport problem, especially in the Greater Colombo and the western province. Among them, the main proposals are Integrated Transport System, Multi-Modal Transport Hubs, Mass Transit Systems, Park and Drive facilities, and improvement of the railway system. The essence of these proposals is the need for an integrated transport system (Public Transport) combining different modes of transport (road, rail, marine, aviation, and public and other types of operations such as private, public, individual, etc.). Some activities of those plans/ proposals have been implemented; others are yet to be considered or implemented. Though many proposals exist, there is no officially accepted master plan to resolve the transport problem in the Western region or the country except for some piecemeal projects. Despite all those proposals and efforts, the transport problem worsens daily.</p><p>4.3.2 Settlement Pattern Discourage the Public Transport</p><p>With the expansion of secondary and tertiary sector activities, urban areas, especially the Colombo urban agglomerate, have become a hive of economic activities demanding more human resources of different levels to operate them. In addition to professionals and skilled workforce, it requires many unskilled labour and low-income groups to discharge municipal services, maintenance works, etc. However, those people can't afford to live within the city or near workplaces, as the rent and land prices are beyond their affordability. This is a dilemma: the people who should attend the daily functions in the urban areas can't afford to live there. So, the low-income groups are settling in slums of the city periphery or near transport hubs.</p><p>Professionals and middle-income groups travel daily to the city for employment, and children's schooling, develop their habitats on low-priced lands, far away from public transport infrastructure and other urban facilities. They must use a private mode of transport from home to the bus stop or railway station to use public transport, and from the destination, to reach the workplace, school, etc. This discourages the use of public transportation, encourages the use of private vehicles, and increases the demand for more and more roads and personal vehicles. This settlement pattern generates morning traffic toward the city and outward in the evening, creating heavy traffic congestion in one direction. Yet, suburbs or satellite cities do not provide urban facilities such as workplaces, schools, hospitals, shopping malls, etc. UDA planning guidelines and regulations are site-specific, limited to the declared urban area and do not consider the big picture. Sometimes, approvals are granted for large housing schemes, away from the essential services, compelling the use of the existing narrow village access roads and other infrastructure. Also, land blocking-out plans do not consider basic aspects such as sewerage, stormwater drainage, and the natural and built environment of the area. That creates many social and economic problems and increases pressure on the government to resolve them.</p><p>Based on the plethora of studies and proposals, it may be possible to introduce a proper transport policy and implement a comprehensive transport plan.But most of these proposals are to resolve the issue within the transport sector itself without looking at the macro picture, especially the settlement pattern (spatial distribution of physical development). Without addressing the core issue of space misuse/ mismanagement, even a well-formulated transport system may not resolve the transport problem in the Western region because it will not reduce the need for personalised modes of transport. A drastic change in settlement patterns is essential to reduce costs and improve efficiency, comfort, and reliability through a public transport system. Unplanned and unmanaged land use and settlement patterns increase the demand for transportation, private vehicles, more roads, and related infrastructures.</p><p>4.4 Adverse Impact of Settlement Pattern on the Cost of Infrastructure</p><p>Irrational use of the space increases capital and operational infrastructure costs (roads, electricity, water, etc.) while causing an added burden on the service delivery system and inconveniencing the service recipient. In many countries, higher population density reduces the unit costs of infrastructure and operational expenses. As discussed below, while the population is increasing, the unit cost of infrastructure is also increasing in Sri Lanka due to space mismanagement. Instead of following a rational spatial policy, the government brings all infrastructure facilities to where people live at any cost. In some instances, paved roads, electricity, water, and telephone lines extend several kilometers to provide the facility for a few houses. This often happens under the Decentralized Budgets and Provincial Council allocations.</p><p>The road network in Sri Lanka has a total length of 114,039 km for a population of 22.2 million and a land area of 65,000 sq. Km.Sri Lanka has the highest road density in South Asia, with 173.9 Km of roads per 100 sq. Km of land area as of 2016. Road density-wise, Sri Lanka is in the 47th place in the global ranking. This is on par with advanced nations. For instance, the average road density in the UK is 175 Km/ 100 Sq. Km. Though Sri Lanka is a developing country, its road density is almost equal to the UK's. Perhaps, in a few more years, it will surpass the UK.</p><p>Out of the total network of 114,039 Km.,85,239 Km. are local authority roads that provide access to scattered villages, houses, and other properties. If minor access roads maintained by communities and individuals are added, the actual road density would be much higher than the official figure. The high density of rural roads demands a high maintenance cost, while its economic contribution is low. The road density could have been reduced if the human settlement development had been developed according to a rational spatial/land use/physical plan. In that case, most local authority roads could have become unwanted. For instance, Malaysia's per capita income is US$ 13,382; the total population is 33 million, and the land area is 328,550 sq. Km. But the intercity connectivity and city travel are more convenient, with a road density of only km.47 per 100 sq. Km. Though the road density is high, intercity connectivity in Sri Lanka was inferior (lengthy travel time) until recently, and city travelling is still cumbersome. This shows no correlation between road density economic growth and the quality of transport. The high-density rural road network could only contribute a little to boost the national and rural economy while increasing demand for the maintenance budget. In many cases, the internal rate of return could have been negative. It shows that significant capital expenditures incurred for several decades, especially on access roads, achieved social justice but have been economically unproductive. Also, these roads' land area isn't justified as an efficient use of limited land resources. But, if we had kept the highway network in good condition and had appropriate standards, the contribution to economic growth could have been much higher through improved intercity and inter-regional connectivity. However, inter-city connectivity has been improved significantly due to the high priority placed on improving the national road network during the last two decades.</p><p>Sri Lanka's Road network is not a systematically planned one. It is only a gradual development over a long period, from footpaths, cart tracks, gravel roads, metal and tarred black surfaces, and to the present condition of asphalt-paved two-lane roads, responding to the needs of different eras. Most roads do not have the shortest connectivity or access, appropriate width of the Right of Way, or horizontal/vertical alignments. Also, urbanisation has evolved on a linear pattern (ribbon-type development) along the roads, limiting road widening space. Thus, improving the road network to meet the present-day requirements involves high costs for land acquisition and profile corrections.</p><p>In addition to roads and transport, electricity, pipe-borne water, and telephone(landlines) have become very expensive under the present settlement pattern. According to the Findings of the Committee Appointed to Investigate Power System Failures on November 29, 2021, and December 03, 2021, 'The CEB distribution network consists of about 33,300 km of 33 kV lines, 2,400 km of 11 kV lines, and about 150,000 km of 400 V or 230 V lines3. The distribution network of LECO consists of about 1,000 km of 11 kV lines and 3,800 km of 400 V or 230 V lines4.'. Accordingly, the total length of the distribution lines comes to 190,500 Km. The total domestic electricity connection is 6,709,574. This averages 35 connections per Kilometer or 2.9 connections per sq. km., reflecting a high capital cost per connection. For instance, under the Matara District Integrated Rural Development project, the electricity line was extended by about 13 km from Morawaka to the Kalubovitiyana tea factory in 1980. After two years of completion, I could find only about 30 domestic connections for the entire length as most houses were scattered and far from the electricity line. Today, the situation may be different due to the ribbon development along the road. Though the data is not readily available, like electricity, the capital and maintenance cost per connection for water and telecommunication would also be high.</p><p>4.5 Aligning Spatial Planning with Environmental Concerns and Initiatives.</p><p>Construction and cultivation on environmentally sensitive locations such as hilly areas, steep slopes, catchments and reservations of rivers and reservoirs have caused silting of water bodies, frequent floods, earth slips, etc., causing loss of assets, environment stability and human lives and costing considerable sums to provide relief, relocate and reconstruct. Devastating floods and earth slips are frequent occurrences, with every monsoon rain destroying many lives and assets, while the intensity of such disasters is increasing. This has become a common feature in the hill country. In addition to the risk, the people living in such locations are trapped in poverty. Unplanned land use and physical development in hilly areas demand more roads and other physical structures, disturbing soil stability. Further, it exerts pressure on environmentally sensitive areas for agriculture. In addition to local issues, it creates some national problems, such as the siltation of reservoirs, water pollution, floods, and climate change.</p><p>Except for some areas in the Western province, human-wild animal conflict (wild elephants, monkeys, peacocks, hedgehogs, wild bows, etc.) is a critical problem in other provinces. The gravity of the issue differs from province to province and location to location. The damage to the economy, human settlement and life are high, and its social implications are immense. Expansion of human settlements to animal habitats, the location of development projects across elephant corridors, the declaration of small land areas as wildlife reserves between or within human settlements, and isolated and scattered small national parks are the leading causes. Small patches of forest/wildlife reserves within human territories provide daytime shelter for elephants to roam villages and farmlands for food at night. There are 28 national parks scattered throughout this small island. Except for the Yala and Wilpattu, all others are sieged by human settlements, restricting the roaming space for elephants and other animals. Sometimes, small human settlements are sieged by national parks, restricting people's free movement. According to the present land use pattern, scrublands are the buffer zone between human and animal habitats. Usually, food for most animals is found in open areas and scrublands rather than in the thick forest. Elephants coming to buffer zones to scrublands for food are naturally enthused to invade human settlements where food is abundant. Consequently, farmers/villagers are abandoning farming and making despicable attempts to co-exist with wild animals on the same land area as a survival strategy. The government strategy also seems to protect wild animals in a co-existing environment with human beings. In other words, it is a competition between animals and humans to use the same land simultaneously for food and shelter, increasing the conflict.</p><p>Both local and foreign environmentalists are concerned about the damage caused to wild animals, especially elephants. They and the wildlife department see only one side of the problem, which prevents a sustainable solution. According to a preliminary estimate compiled by HARTI, the crop damage caused by wild animals in the first half of 2022 is Rs. 30,215 million (US$ 87.5 million). It is unclear whether the figure includes the loss of human and animal lives, the opportunity costs of abandoning farming, and the cost incurred by the government and farmers for protection. Today, wild animals have been dispersed in many areas of the country and infiltrate both new and old settlements, making it a national issue. The national budget for 2023 has allocated Rs 525 million for electric fencing and human-elephant conflict mitigation. Similar or more amounts would be allocated annually, but isolated piecemeal works may not derive a long-lasting solution. Total socioeconomic losses and expenditures incurred by the Department of Wildlife annually call for a permanent solution.</p><p>In addition to the conflict with wild animals, most farmers in the dry zone face the problem of stray cattle. According to the traditional way of herd management, cows are released to find food from anywhere after milking. Bulls and heifers are released into the forest to grow wild. This was not an issue when there were common grazing lands. The land use pattern has been drastically changed, and there is no space for common grazing grounds. Consequently, stray cattle have become a nuisance for farmers and national parks. Farmers are abandoning their farming in some areas as they can't fight with influential cattle owners. This land use pattern is no longer viable in Sri Lanka. However, government authorities are still trying to maintain the system using political power instead of encouraging cattle owners to consider alternatives. The settlement and land use patterns need considerable changes to overcome the conflict between humans, wild animals, and stray cattle.</p><p>4.6 Overall Impact of Space Mismanagement</p><p>Since independence, Sri Lanka has spent a colossal amount of borrowed/grants and own funds and sacrificed resources for development, especially for physical infrastructure. While some have contributed to the growth and well-being of the citizens, the rest have created irreparable damage to the environment and economic advancement and further obstructed the space for future development. The inappropriate interaction of humans (location of activities) with nature and land resources to satisfy socio-economic needs is a significant factor affecting the cost of production and competitiveness of our products in the local and global market. The logistics arrangement is a substantial cost component in agriculture and industry. Gathering local products, particularly agriculture products, to the market from spatially unorganized scattered smallholdings is a significant challenge, leading to high cost, time, inconvenience, and quality deterioration. The farm gate prices of locally grown foods are very low in Sri Lanka, but the retail price for the consumer is exceptionally high. Sometimes, farmers spend more time and resources to sell than they spend to produce. For instance, in December 2023, a farmer told me his vehicle hire for transporting 100 kg of tomatoes to the Dambulla economic centre was Rs.1500 and sold it at Rs 150.00 per kg and spent the whole day, which could have spent to earn Rs 2000 from working elsewhere. So, his selling cost for a kg is Rs 35.00. Accordingly, his actual farmgate price is only Rs.115.00. However, I observed that the retail price in Colombo was above Rs. 500.00 during the same period. A significant portion of this price difference must be attributed to the system's inefficiency, including logistics difficulties, arising from the scattered smallholding system. In contrast, if imported, it could be much cheaper. So, Sri Lanka's sluggish economic growth is a structural issue for which spatial mismanagement is also accountable to a significant extent. Without correcting those problems, Sri Lanka will not be globally competitive in the ever-expanding market economy.</p>", "publisher": "Sri Lanka Guardian", "instances": ["1 Land Alienation Policy, Unplanned Village Expansion Schemes and EncroachmentsThe traditional villages could no longer accommodate the increasing population, preventing them from becoming landless, homeless, and unemployed. The Land Development Ordinance-1935 allowed the legal alienation of state lands to landless people. The government has implemented many Village Expansion schemes, especially in densely populated wet zones, to distribute lands to spillovers from traditional villages for agriculture and dwelling purposes. Very often, marginal lands next to the traditional villages, buffer zones of sanctuaries and national parks, and forest reserves around villages were selected for this purpose. Those were hilly or rocky trains with poor-quality soil, without drinking and irrigation water. Under a scientific and rational land use system, most of those should have been used for nature reserves, agroforestry, etc. These lands do not generate a decent income to sustain settler families. Hence, it amounts to misuse of land and other resources. Though the legal framework was provided under the Land Development Ordinance, there was no consistent policy or regular system to distribute land. So, people suffering from land hunger were prompted to encroach on state lands for housing, cultivation, and business purposes. Later, the government adopted a policy for regularising the encroached lands, and encroaching became the accepted practice to receive a block of state land."]}, {"relevance_score": 93, "title": "Agrarian heritage of Kandyan forest garden system", "published": "2023-02-12", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka, Feb. 12 -- The Kandyan forest garden system is unique to the Kandy massif in mid elevation of the wet zone of Sri Lanka. It has been a traditional way of family farming near the domicile since ancient times. During the evolution of this farming system, useful trees, herbaceous shrubs, vines, and animals were identified, protected, and managed while undesirable tree species were eliminated.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Eventually, superior foreign plant species were obtained and incorporated into the gardens. This process of forest garden diversification and development has continued, not only through deliberate additions to the existing biological mix, but also in the establishment of new gardens supporting new generations.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A forest garden can be defined as a family farming system initiated, developed, and sustained in the vicinity of the domicile. This garden supplies most of the family's basic resource needs from a small parcel of land comprising a mix of highly diverse tree, herbaceous shrub, and vine species. Kandyan forest gardens have attained a higher level of development and botanic complexity than anywhere else in the country.</p><p>Kandyan forest gardens occur at elevations ranging from about 200 to 800 metres above mean sea level in high rainfall areas of mid-altitude hills of Western and Northern escarpments of the central mountain massif in Sri Lanka. They provide provisioning, supporting, regulating and cultural services to the farming communities.</p><p>For example, some provisioning services include fruits, spices and condiments, vegetable, edible root and tubers, palm nuts and associated products such as treacle and toddy, beverages, animal products, medicine, flowers, firewood, and timber. The high density of trees creates a favorable microclimate for living under tropical conditions and builds a very high resilience to economic and environmental shocks.</p><p>Rapid population expansion and thereby fragmentation of forest gardens in this farming community has adversely affected these services at the household level. This social fragmentation of gardens emphasises the need to direct national attention towards sustaining and regenerating this heritable agroecosystem.</p><p>Most previous review studies have focused mainly on the botanic complexity of the garden system. Factors such as social fragmentation of communities, accelerated land degradation by soil erosion, loss of soil productivity, crop damages from small wild animals and extinction of domestic animals have not been adequately researched, discussed, or addressed. Hence, this article, written in consultation with a Senior Land Use Planner in Canada and a Senior Agronomist from Sri Lanka, is intended to make the public aware of the need for conserving and upgrading this agrarian heritage for the benefit of generations to come. It is also intended to educate the Kandyan forest garden communities on ways of regenerating this agroforestry system to enhance productivity and economic benefits from this nature-friendly farming system.</p><p>Soils of the gardens</p><p>The major soils supporting the Kandyan forest gardens include Red-Yellow Podzolic, Reddish Brown Latosolic, and Immature Brown Loam soils.</p><p>The Red-Yellow Podzolic soils occur in areas such as Awissawella, Ratnapura, Openayake, Galigamuwa, Pallegoda, Weddagala, Giragama and Nawalapitiya. The characteristic strong brown to yellowish-brown makes them easily recognisable. They are best observed in tea plantations in Giragama village near Pilimathalawa.</p><p>The Reddish Brown Latosolic soils are found in areas such as Matale, Kandy, Ukuwela, Gelioya, Rambukkana and Mawanella. These soils have a characteristic reddish-brown to brown and are easily recognised in excavation sites in the Matale municipal area.</p><p>The Immature Brown Loam soils are best expressed in areas such as Akurana, Geli Oya, Pilimathalawa, Kadugannawa, Galagedara and Mawanella. The characteristic dark brown to dark grey-brown makes them easily recognisable. They can be observed along either side of the A-10 road near the Galagedara Police Station in Kandy.</p><p>The productivity of these forest garden soils has declined due to accelerated soil erosion, moisture depletion and loss of soil fertility. Adoption of appropriate soil and water conservation measures, re-introduction of domestic animals, production, and application of compost to the land would enhance garden productivity.</p><p>Plant diversity</p><p>The Kandyan forest garden system consists of tree, herbaceous shrub and vine species. With respect to community use, it includes fruit crops, spice and condiment species, vegetable crops, root and tuber crops, palm trees, beverage crops, medicinal plants, ornamental species, timber species and other useful plants.</p><p>Fruit crops</p><p>Nearly 100 fruit crops occur in the Kandyan forest garden system. The more common crops include avocado, banana, durian, Jak fruit, mango, mangosteen, mandareen, rambutan and papaya. However, maintaining all of these fruit crop species plays a significant role in in-situ conservation of genetic resources for future use.</p><p>Fruit consumption in the country remains far below the actual requirement for a healthy life. Hence, enhancing fruit crop cultivation within the forest garden system and marketing products to appropriate consumer destinations in the country would help increase daily fruit consumption of the nation.</p><p>Spices and condiments</p><p>The major crops used as spices, condiments and other food additives include clove, nutmeg, cardamom, cinnamon, goraka, tamarind, ginger, turmeric, pepper, green chilli, hot chilli, curry leaves, rampe, sera and vanilla. These crops are grown mainly for family consumption. Excess produce from crops such as clove, nutmeg, goraka, tamarind, ginger, turmeric, and pepper provide an additional income.</p><p>Most of these spices are also used for indigenous medicines and first aid treatments. Adoption of newly developed land and crop management technologies such as establishment of individual platforms for soil and water conservation in tree crops, frequent manure application, timely pruning and training of plant canopy and use of scientific post-harvest operations would help enhance economic returns from these crops.</p><p>Vegetables</p><p>Nearly 30 vegetable crops are widely grown in market gardens in nearby areas but very few occur in forest gardens. This is due to the adverse shading effects on herbaceous vegetables under the canopy of tree crops in the forest garden system.</p><p>The few vegetables commonly grown include crops such as jak fruit, bread fruit, wing bean, yard long bean, green eggplant, thibbotu and leafy vegetable such as kathurumurunga and spinach. Growing herbaceous vegetables in pots in areas which receive adequate sunlight and adoption of \"vertical-pot-farming\" technology is recommended for enhancing vegetable production for household consumption.</p><p>Root and tuber crops</p><p>Among root and tuber crop species grown in the forest garden system, four crops: cassava, sweet potato, large leaved yam and dioscorea are commonly grown for family consumption. Enhancing the cultivation of these crops, would be an appropriate food production strategy as these crops have a high resilience to adverse climatic changes such as the erratic nature of rains.</p><p>Palm trees</p><p>The Kandyan forest garden system includes a few palm tree species such as coconut, king coconut, areca nut and toddy palm. Some uses of these crops include coconut kernel for household food preparation and oil extraction.</p><p>King coconut is consumed as a fresh drink, arecanut for chewing with betel, toddy palm for preparation of treacle and toddy.</p><p>The toddy consumption has been limited to elderly male family members. However, female members are very actively involved in preparation of treacle as a cottage industry which could use a helping hand to expand this micro enterprise.</p><p>Beverage crops</p><p>The major beverage crops include tea, coffee, and cocoa. Tea is available as some forest gardens have been developed on marginal tea lands. Some uses of these beverage crops include preparation of hot beverage from coffee powder for domestic consumption as well as selling the excess coffee, harvested green leaves of tea and cocoa seed for income.</p><p>Medicinal plants</p><p>More common medicinal plants which grow in forest gardens include akkapana, beli, endaru, hathawariya, komarika, murunga, pavatta, polpala and wadakaha. These plants are widely used in indigenous medicines and first aid treatments.</p><p>Ornamental crops</p><p>Many species of ornamental crops are also grown in the forest garden system. Species such as agloanema, anthuriums, begonia, bougainvillea, caladium, cane palm, cannas, carnation, cordyline, croton, dahlia, dieffenbachia, dracaena, ferns, fittonia, gerbera, hibiscus, jasmine, livistona, maranta, monstera, orchids, peperomia, roses, rhapis and spathiphyllumare widely maintained. Some uses of these crops include maintaining natural beauty of the garden, harvesting cut flowers for indoor decorations, and use in religious activities.</p><p>In some forest gardens, ornamental crops such as anthuriums and jasmine are maintained as a cottage industry for income.</p><p>Timber</p><p>Among the timber plants, species which occur commonly in forest gardens include ginisapu, halmilla, hawarinuga, ketakela, lunimidella, mahogany, pihimbiya and teak. These species are grown, harvested, and used for indoor repairs to the domicile and manufacture of furniture for domestic uses and sold for timber value in case of financial emergencies. The canopy of plants is periodically lopped out and hardwood is used as firewood for domestic cooking.</p><p>Garden canopy structure</p><p>The general botanic structure of Kandyan forest gardens is depicted as a multistory plant canopy system. Each canopy level consists of some combinations of plant species. Plants such as coconut, jakfruit and durian represent the upper canopy level; nutmeg, clove, mango, papaw, avocado, mangosteen, breadfruit, rambutan, citrus and papaya occupy the middle level; banana, cocoa, passion fruit, betel vine and vanilla represent the lower level. Ginger, turmeric, herbaceous vegetables, and yam occupy the ground level.</p><p>Domestic animals</p><p>Since very little sunlight penetrates the Kandyan forest garden canopy, it is usually not possible to grow grass and fodder crops for a large herd of domestic animals. However, a few free-range chickens for eggs, perhaps, a cow for milk, a few pigs, depending on the culture and rarely stall-fed goats, are commonly kept.</p><p>Animal feed consists of tree canopy periodically lopped out, daily kitchen refuses, and grasses and fodder collected from common property land resources such as roadsides and other public lands.</p><p>This domestic animal component plays a significant role in the daily provision of protein rich foods such as milk and egg for garden families.</p><p>In cases of financial emergencies, income can be supplemented by selling an animal. Some forest garden farmers also maintain bee colonies for harvesting honey. Bees also contribute to the pollination of local flowering plants.</p><p>Fragmentation of gardens</p><p>The Kandyan forest gardens have been subject to social fragmentation resulting from expansion of village populations and construction of separate houses for new families. This reduces land availability for growing crops.</p><p>Therefore, it is suggested to shift from large canopy crop varieties to dwarf type varieties for crops such as mango, guava, banana, amberella, durian, nutmeg, coffee, toddy palm and coconut in fragmented gardens.</p><p>Soil and water conservation</p><p>Soils of Kandyan forest gardens which occur in newly fragmented lands with sloping terrain require conservation of the soil resource base to sustain system productivity. Since these gardens receive water mainly from rains and the thick forest reserves on the crests of landscapes receive diminished water due to rapid runoff of rain fall, it is important to conserve water within the garden system.</p><p>Structures such as lock and spill drains, individual platforms, percolation pits, and cut and filled slope protection structures are suitable for conserving soil and arresting water runoff. Hence, gardeners need awareness and development of skills to construct and establish these structures in their forest gardens.</p><p>Protection from wild animals</p><p>The most common wild animals that cause crop losses in forest gardens include boar, monkey, porcupine, palm civet and squirrel.</p><p>There are strategic approaches and potential management strategies, tested and available for effectively controlling the invasion of these animals. Some possible approaches are repelling techniques and translocation. Effective repelling techniques include the use of flashlights, guard dogs, firecrackers, catapults, and air rifles.</p><p>The Kandyan forest gardens collectively represent the oldest agroforestry system in Sri Lanka. More attention is required from researchers, agronomists, land use planners and policymakers as well as local farmers for conservation of this important agrarian heritage for the benefit of generations to come.</p><p>As global concern grows over the destruction of tropical forests, the loss of biodiversity and the need for sustainable agriculture for smallholder farmers, this forest garden system deserves more careful consideration.</p><p>The writer is a Freelance Agriculture Scientist in natural resource management.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Sunday Observer (Sri Lanka).

Among the branches of trees, otherworldly-looking primates - the Tarsiers - leap upon unsuspecting insects. Above them hornbills feast on fruit, then fly away to spread the seeds across the island. While Sulawesi's species' richness is enormous, this island is also facing a serious challenge - one of which is unsustainable agriculture.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Research has shown that using non-organic fertilizers has contributed to the decreasing quality of soil and water on the island, thus affecting its biodiversity. This is not just a problem for nature. As the UN Food and Agriculture Organization confirms, biodiversity contributes to people's livelihoods and provides multiple ecosystem services such as clean air and water, carbon storage, climate regulation and reduced risk of soil erosion.</p><p>To address this, Burung Indonesia (BirdLife Partner) is supporting local farmers in developing sustainable agriculture practices. With support from the Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund - Burung Indonesia's partner in Central Sulawesi - along with local NGOs Yayasan Panorama Alam Lestari (YPAL) and Perkumpulan Salanggar, they have developed organic fertilizers using ingredients that can be easily found in every household.</p><p>In Mayakeli dan Wera Village in central Sulawesi, YPAL helped the community to develop organic farming practices which increased the productivity of their rice fields, as well as repelling pests. For the pest repellent, they created an eco-friendly formula using garlic, turmeric, lemongrass, pepper and various leaves, mixed with PH-neutral liquid soap. For fertilizer, they mixed banana stems, Gamal plant, manure, cassava and sugar to produce liquid organic fertilizer to increase the nitrate, phosphate and calcium concentration of the soil. The use of organic pesticide is only recommended if the damage to the plant reaches 80 percent, while the fertilizer can be applied once a week to the rice fields and vegetable farms.</p><p>The use of this organic fertilizer has significantly increased the production of rice and vegetables, with the results typically beginning to show in the third harvesting period. During first two harvests, the farmers still produced 680 kilograms of rice. But by the third, they were harvesting 800 kilograms, and consequently earning more money.</p><p>Elsewhere, Perkumpulan Salanggar helped to develop a different method to control pests on dry fields. People who lived in Balayon and Bojoumete villages on the Banggai islands installed traps made from plastic water bottles. These were painted with bright colours to attract the insects, which then became immobilized by the glue on top. Alongside their crops, the farmers grow plants with strong odours, such as lemongrass and zinnia, to attract predatory insects that eat pest caterpillars and aphids. These methods have successfully increased the productivity of the farm and the quality of the produce, allowing farmers to earn 300,000 to 500,000 Rupiah per yard from growing vegetables. As such, organic agriculture is helping to increase food security and nutrition on top of the financial benefits.</p><p>While these farmers concentrated on organic fertilizers and pesticides, another farmer in Gorontalo - a BirdLife Nature's Heroes awardee - successfully developed agroforestry on his land.

Coconut is uniquely positioned in Sri Lanka as a commercial crop of which 70% is used for local consumption. To strike a balance between consumption and exports (which is only 30% at present) and to adapt to unprecedented climate change and other environmental threats, coconut, thus calls for Good Agricultural Practices (GAP).</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Out of the total coconut acreage, only about 200,000 acres (18%) are coconut estates with more than five acres. The balance 900,000 acres which constitutes 83% of the total land cover are below five acres. These smallholders or home gardens are distributed among one million growers. 'Very often these small-scale holders do not realise that their coconut gardens too need to be developed to commercially viable units, irrespective of the land extent, for which GAP such as soil and water management, fertiliser management, inter-cropping, etc. are required,' says Coconut Cultivation Board (CCB) Chairperson Madhavie Herath. The CCB, as its Chairperson explains, is committed to taking GAP know-how to the grassroots level through their field officers.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Increasing production</p><p>The competition in the market for coconut between the industry and consumers and the mismatch between the demand and supply drive the nut price up each day, says Herath. 'This has a cyclic effect as people will find it difficult to spend on coconuts and the industry will find it difficult to buy nuts at a higher rate and sell for a competitive price in the international market.' GAPs, therefore, are the answer to increase productivity in the short-term and to increase the extent long-term, says Herath. 'If not for the hybrid variety, it takes about five years to bear nuts, therefore in the short-term we need to increase the yield from a tree. When the production is increased, a reasonable price will be decided which will benefit both the customer and the industry,' says CCB Chairperson who goes on to note that the Coconut Research Institute helps CCB take the latest research findings on high yielding varieties to the growers. 'We hope to increase annual nut production to at least 3.6 to 3.8 billion by 2025 for which we encourage all coconut growers, irrespective of the acreage, to adhere to best practices that CCB helps disseminate from sapling stage to maturity of a coconut tree,' Herath remarks.</p><p>Finding a niche market</p><p>Coconut is grown in 90 countries in the world and we are the fourth largest coconut producer in the world behind India, Philippines and Indonesia. A collective 'Made in Sri Lanka' branding campaign catering to the demands in the European market is essential if our coconut is to capture a sizable European market, maintains Herath. 'Our production cost is still very high and allocation for research and development is also not sufficient,' says CCB Chair who also cites lack of information and analysis, red tape in bureaucracy and archaic laws and regulation which are not flexible to cater to modern trends as bottlenecks which prevent Sri Lankan coconut from securing its due place. 'Ours is such fertile soil and whatever that grows out of it is always the best in the world, but sadly we are not committed enough as a nation to make the best out of our crops and position them as niche products in the global market,' remarks Herath.</p><p>Research</p><p>A climatic-sensitive tree, coconut requires proper management to sustain its vigour.</p><p>Coconut Research Institute (CRI) is currently conducting research on breeding coconut with the characteristics of drought tolerance, resistance to pest attacks, good kernel quality including high milk yield and high oil yield. 'We have already released six improved cultivars which have different yield potentials and characteristics. To facilitate mass production of seeds/seedlings, we have established four seed gardens, increased the mother palm pool and started setting up another two new seed gardens in collaboration with the private sector. Measures are also underway to establish more seed gardens to meet the demand of the hybrid seeds,' explains CRI Deputy Director (Research) Dr. Sarath Idirisinghe. CRI currently produces about 1.5 million seed nuts annually and issues them to CCB for seedling production. CRI has planned to produce one million hybrid seed nuts by 2024.</p><p>The management of coconut lands as Dr. Idirisinghe points out, has been very poor, particularly those of the smallholders and CRI among their other initiatives to empower growers on GAP is now promoting the use of 50% inorganic + 50% organic manure towards sustainable soil fertility management. New research is also under way to introduce soil conditioning material including carbonised planting materials and compost materials to enrich the fertility level of soil.</p><p>Coconut is grown in 90 countries in the world and we are the fourth largest coconut producer in the world behind India, Philippines and Indonesia. A collective 'Made in Sri Lanka' branding campaign catering to the demands in the European market is essential if our coconut is to capture a sizeable European market</p><p>Pest management</p><p>CRI has also developed integrated pest and disease management (IPM) packages to manage the pests and diseases and these technologies are disseminated to the growers. 'Measures are underway to establish more predatory mite breeding laboratories in the country to produce more predators to release to the growers which is in very high demand for the control of coconut mites. We are also researching to identify new predators to control coconut mite or other control measures,' Dr. Idirisinghe says. New nano-gel based pheromones are also being developed by CRI for Red Weevil (RW) control which is a major threat to the coconut seedlings and young plants.</p><p>Recurrences of extreme climatic changes have severely affected the coconut cultivations in the country and the low rainfall received during the past several years has caused significant damages to the coconut palms. Therefore, studies are underway to identify the drought resistant varieties, pest and disease resistant varieties due to changing climatic conditions. </p><p>The present whitefly attack which was first reported from Kegalle District, has now been spread to several other districts in the island causing notable economic damage to the coconut cultivations. CRI's research, according to Dr. Idirisinghe, has identified the life cycle of the pest and severity of attacks. 'We have recommended chemical insecticides, bio-based insecticides and have started to identify and breed predators to control the pest. In addition, we are also in the process of spraying chemicals to infested palms in collaboration with the CCB in Dankotuwa, Wennappuwa and Nattandiya areas as a pilot project. Based on the outcome of the pilot project, we expect to give better recommendations to manage the white fly attack in the rest of the areas in the country.'</p><p>Less than 5% of growers could afford the current price of coconut fertiliser which is at Rs. 25,000-30,000 per 50 kg bag</p><p>Intercropping and livestock</p><p>The productivity of coconut under monoculture is generally low, however, the land productivity can be increased by intercropping and integration of livestock, says Dr. Idirisinghe. CRI has recommended coconut-based agroforestry systems using fruits such as rambutan, mango, papaya, pineapple and spices such as pepper, coffee, cinnamon and cocoa and livestock such as cattle, goat and sheep. 'These practices will help change the micro climatic condition of the coconut plantations which will improve the yield. Further, agroforestry systems using Gliricidia, Calliandra and wild sunflower have been proven as potential for degraded coconut soil improvement.' Mixed-cropping systems also reduce the risk and uncertainty of incomes. Integration with livestock requires establishment of pastures and fodder varieties. Thus, livestock rearing can simultaneously increase land productivity and farmer-income which is an ideal combination for sustainability of soil fertility and to reduce rural poverty, points out Dr. Idirisinghe.</p><p>Coconut is uniquely positioned in Sri Lanka as a commercial crop of which 70% is used for local consumption</p><p>Climate changes</p><p>Climate change has had a significant impact on the Sri Lankan coconut industry. High temperature affects the pollination resulting in a few nuts per bunch and button nut fall, aggravating the effect of water scarcity. 'Although the technology is in place for minimising the drought effects in coconut plantations and the farmers are trained to implement them, many do not seem to follow recommended practices,' says Dr. Idirisinghe. He further says that CRI has set breeding objectives to develop high yielding hybrid varieties tolerant of climate change. Experiments are also being done by CRI to identify the potential of using carbonised plant materials for soil moisture conservation and for increasing the nutrient use efficiency, changing the micro climate, and carbon sequestration.</p><p>The productivity of coconut under monoculture is generally low, however, the land productivity can be increased by intercropping and integration of livestock</p><p>Unaffordable fertiliser</p><p>Unless the present whitefly pest devastation is arrested soon and a treatment process is implemented as a national program covering small holders as well, 2023's coconut production could be seriously threatened, warns the Coconut Growers Association of Sri Lanka. Its President, Jayantha Samarakoon tells the Daily FT that the diseases could eliminate over 1 million coconut trees and the annual production could drop by 10-20% which is equivalent to 300-600 million coconuts per year. This will increase the price of coconut further.</p><p>'Fertiliser issue is also very serious as most coconut growers have not fertilised their coconut estates for more than two years. Less than 5% of growers could afford the current price of coconut fertiliser which is at Rs. 25,000-30,000 per 50 kg bag. If we do not fertilise coconut trees the yield will drop drastically in the coming year and we may face severe shortage of coconut and a price hike in the domestic market. Therefore, it is very important for the government to make available coconut fertiliser at a reasonable price (Rs. 10,000-15,000 per 50 kg bag) in 2023.' </p><p>Annual fertiliser requirement for the coconut sector is about 80,000 MT. This includes 20,000 MT of Urea, 40,000 MT of MOP and 20,000 MT of ERP which is available locally. 'Urea and MOP are to be imported and made available through fertiliser companies at the above reasonable price,' says Samarakoon.</p><p>Around 1.8 billion coconuts are required for domestic consumption per year while the coconut processing industry needs 1.2 billion coconut per year. Coconut processing industry, as Samarakoon points out, generated an export income of $ 834 million in 2021 and the estimated export income for 2022 would be about $ 900 million, he says. In 2021, coconut product export contributed 6.7% of total export and about 0.7% to GDP.</p><p>Added to the fertiliser and agrochemical shortage, the economic crisis, labour scarcity, high labour wages and unavailability of skilled labour have placed many large-scale coconut plantations in predicament</p><p>Market-oriented interventions</p><p>In a bid to strengthen the state mechanism to assist growers, CDA, CRI and CCB should introduce a market-oriented service delivery mechanism to meet the requirements of coconut growers of various levels, more effectively, maintaining Samarakoon. This could include digitalisation of services and product-delivery methods, on-line applications to disseminate specific knowledge and advice to individual coconut growers which could significantly reduce the cost of operation and production, he says. 'We have also requested successive governments to provide capital investment for coconut growers to modernise irrigation systems and smart and targeted application of fertiliser. In addition, we have requested subsidy schemes for soil fertility improvement and moisture conservation to be continued for small holders.'</p><p>In a bid to strengthen the state mechanism to assist growers, CDA, CRI and CCB should introduce a marketoriented service delivery mechanism to meet the requirements of coconut growers of various levels, more effectively</p><p>Climate-smart agriculture</p><p>Added to the fertiliser and agrochemical shortage, the economic crisis, labour scarcity, high labour wages and unavailability of skilled labour have placed many large-scale coconut plantations in predicament. The whitefly menace has become a double whammy. To counter the disease, Kurunegala Plantations Ltd. (KPL) is practicing yellow sticky traps on coconut trunks and spraying pesticides, neem oil, and soap mixtures to control them, says its CEO Dr. S.M.M. Samarakoon.</p><p>Coconut production of Sri Lanka is mainly rainfed and vulnerable to climate change manifested in unpredictable rainfall patterns and high temperatures. 'Sustaining the yield of coconut has been challenged with low soil fertility with the inadequate chemical fertiliser application. KPL has cultivated more than 15 intercrops across the different agro-ecological zones as means of crop-based climate-smart agriculture. Coconut is highly vulnerable to drought as well. However, inter-crops of KPL, such as cashew, rambutan, mango, durian, and guava have shown very good performance during low rainfall with dry climatic scenarios and have compensated for the yield loss of the coconut due to dry climatic conditions,' says Dr. Samarakoon who reiterates on the importance of combining coconut with intercrops, for the sustainability of income per unit of land.</p><p>In addition, drip irrigation and jet irrigation, building of ponds, husk pits, burying husks, cover cropping, etc. are practiced by KPL to conserve moisture throughout the year, he says.</p><p>Being an island with inherent qualities, Sri Lankan coconut is well-reputed in the global market. However, heavy domestic consumption of coconut is limiting the value addition and export earnings of the crop, says KPL's CEO.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["In addition, we are also in the process of spraying chemicals to infested palms in collaboration with the CCB in Dankotuwa, Wennappuwa and Nattandiya areas as a pilot project.

We further show that the transition to a global plant-based economy has the potential to sequester over 2000 Gigatons (Gt) of CO2 in regenerating soils and vegetation, returning atmospheric greenhouse gas levels to the \"safe zone\" of under 350 parts per million (ppm) of CO2 equivalent, while restoring the biodiversity of the planet and healing its climate.</p><p> This paper clearly illustrates why the scientific community, government institutions, corporations, and news media, who vastly underestimate the role of animal agriculture and focus primarily on reducing fossil fuel use, need to urgently change their priorities in order to be effective.\"Tackling Food Systems at Global Climate SummitsAgriculture was not a central topic of discussion at the UN Climate Change Conference, COP26, held in Glasgow, Scotland, in 2021. \"Despite [the] huge impact to ecological systems and climate,\" writes Suzannah Gerber, a nutrition scientist and fellow of the National Institute of Food and Agriculture--a research agency within the U.</p><p>S.

Do tell us a bit about how this legacy started and how it has become so successful.</p><p>A: It all began with a single person, a young man with a very big dream. It was the 1950s and my father, at the age of 20, had observed the passion and the commitment with which tea was harvested. Each cup of tea contained 30 hand-picked leaves. That means somebody spent time and effort hand picking the finest leaves for your cup of tea. There is nothing more artisanal or more luxurious than that. My father saw this and he wanted to get into the tea industry. He then visited Mincing Lane in London, which ironically was the centre of the global tea trade, though they don]t produce much tea, yet, was the centre of a global tea trade, part of the unfortunate colonial economic legacy the British Empire had. And there, contrary to his expectation of a celebration of what is great about tea he found something quite different, because the trade was focused on profit and therefore value reduction. As a tea grower, my father saw at the time as we see today the incredible artisanal commitment, the effort that goes into making tea, the effort of the tea growers combined with the influence of nature. When you translate that into a commodity to be traded, it turns out to be something completely against the social and economic interests of the country. My father saw this in the 1950s when he conceived an idea. It was a very different time. There was no printing in the country. There were power issues and many complications while the trade was dominated by the British. So he had to work his way through and eventually in 1985 he was able to make his first breakthrough getting his Dilmah tea grown, harvested, ethically produced, packed and branded in Sri Lanka, with the profits coming to the country. In September 1985 he got it on shelf in Australia. That's a potted history of how it all happened.</p><p>Q: In how many countries is Dilmah being sold now?</p><p>A: Then onwards we soared and we are now in over 100 countries. However, our objective is not to say that we are the biggest. We want to maintain our quality, as there is nothing great about saying you are the biggest in volume, what matters for Ceylon tea is value.</p><p>Q: Sri Lanka does not really do much of value-added product exports. When it comes to the tea industry, the majority is bulk exports. Dilmah is an exception. What is the reason for Sri Lanka not being geared for value-added exports?</p><p>A: It]s a tragedy. Sri Lanka has the finest tea, the finest cinnamon; we have exceptional cardamom and the finest pepper. We have an abundance of quality products that extend from our people. If you talk to international chefs they would tell you Sri Lankan pastry chefs anywhere in the world are the finest. We fail to take advantage, with the finest chocolate work, ice carvings and the precision of their work. This is the difference that my father saw. Because every skill, whether it is the quality in a cup of tea, every uniqueness, every point of difference, needs to be emphasised and focused on in building value. In Sri Lanka value addition in tea may be in the region of 30 %. But real value addition is when you take a product and you add value through the use of technology, use of art, craft, communication and presenting new experiences to engage the consumer. Value addition isn]t just saying look I]ve sold something at a high price. It]s about delivering an experience where a consumer says this is worth the price we are asked to pay. Although we have all these attributes, it]s probably in the mindset and the marketing failures that we are yet selling our cinnamon as a competitor to the inferior and carcinogenic cassia. We are selling our finest Ceylon tea with all its artisanal attributes as a cheaper alternative to multi-origin blended tea which has no identity, personality, guarantee of craft nor guarantee of soil conservation. So whether it is cinnamon or our incredible cashew, we need to understand that we have an amazing asset and that asset merits charging a fair price. My father]s philosophy of understanding the concept of value and charging a fair price for the value we offer, not cheating the customer but offering an experience for which he or she is willing to pay the price extends to tourism.</p><p>My brother oversees and manages our Resplendent Ceylon. Our room rate is significantly higher than any other in Sri Lanka, because we offer a unique experience and that]s a Sri Lankan experience. Our Ceylon Tea in most countries has its own place, for example, in Poland you would see us sitting on the top shelf in terms of price, because we offer a quality product.</p><p>Tasting 10,000 teas each week and selecting the finest is about honesty. Honesty builds trust. Trust builds value. I think the important thing here is as Sri Lankans we need to first understand the value of what we have. We need to frame our proposition on how we propose to engage with the consumer. Today the consumer is very responsive to a message that talks of wellness, provenance, biodiversity, quality and taste. Tea has everything, so does cinnamon, cashew and Sri Lanka tourism. When you read some of the reviews online they are exceptional but we need to charge a fair price. Because when you discount something as a commodity, you end up devaluing it. The Seychelles is $ 600 to $ 700 a night while in Sri Lanka it's $200 a night, trying to demonstrate that probably the cost corresponds to the quality. Sri Lanka is worth a thousand plus dollars per night because of the experiences we could offer. Wellness experiences, Ayurveda, fine tea, fine gastronomy are a few that Sri Lanka offers. I believe it is as much the mindset, as well as a relic of colonialism that seems to have colonised our minds. We need to have the confidence to say we have a great product, we are going to market it as a premium, and charge the right price. It is only the right price that]s going to allow us to pay our workers a fair salary and to build innovation into our industry.</p><p>Q: Dilmah is an export-oriented business and the current high currency fluctuation can be a serious challenge. How is this impacting the industry and Dilmah?</p><p>A: We emerged from an unprecedented crisis. In 2020 following the Easter bombing we confronted unimaginable challenges. We had to build parallel transport networks, build fuel dumps. We had to maintain health and safety in a way that we never had to in the past. But we never stopped for a minute. Currency fluctuation is part of the recovery of our nation. Ultimately it]s also in the mindset. We have to be positive. Every problem has a solution. We are a Sri Lankan company, with a Sri Lankan product and believe we can do it. So we will overcome the challenge. To meet any challenge valuing our product is important. When the currency fluctuates or when we have inflationary pressures we can go to the market and tell our partners these are the justifications for a price increase. When you don]t have a brand you become a victim of all of those trends. When you sell bulk tea for example, it is you against the low cost producers around the world. So it comes back to the same thing. Value what we have. Today we have a currency crisis but it]s part of our restoration. Tomorrow we may have a climate crisis. We may have another health crisis or perhaps other issues. It is building value, understanding what you have and crafting it through value addition is what is going to help us to build resilience.</p><p>Q: Turkey and Russia are two main buyers of Ceylon tea. In the recent past we have seen that both these countries are experiencing economic challenges. How are these dynamics affecting the demand for Ceylon tea and how do you manage that?</p><p>A: Turkey, Iraq, Iran, Libya, and Russia are the traditional markets for Sri Lankan tea and I think our future and our resilience is to broad-base Ceylon tea. We have been reliant on the same markets virtually since the 1960s. There is no reason why we should not venture beyond. When we talk to industry insiders you hear the phrase 'oh we lost that market'. Yes we lost it to Kenya but we lost it on price. Ceylon tea is not a price driven product. It's a quality and sustainability driven product. So perhaps today it]s Turkey and Russia suffering from an economic crisis and tomorrow it could be Europe. But we need to broaden our markets. We cannot stay reliant on the same five or six markets. When Iraq, our number one market, has some sort of import issue, embargo or sanctions, Sri Lanka suffers. Hence, it]s an unsustainable and narrow-minded approach to keep going</p><p>Q: Kenya and India emerged as strong suppliers of tea. However, both countries are facing labour issues at present. Does that mean it creates more opportunities for Ceylon tea and is there any way that we can capture that opportunity?</p><p>A: I think it creates more opportunities but probably not in the way you think. When there is a supply disruption it is inevitably temporary. But where it creates an opportunity is, if we go to consumers and say look during the pandemic most countries either mechanised or retrenched twenty, thirty thousand workers causing them misery or they abandoned minimum wage mechanisms and reduced the wage. But in Sri Lanka we actually increased our wages and increased social commitment. If you walk on the streets of Berlin or London, you need not walk more than 100 feet to see somebody in misery, without health care, or in deep trouble. All those who come here take photographs of somebody and publish in the newspapers and say we are mistreating our workers; they need to look at themselves to understand who is at fault. The world is telling us we want a cheaper product. When we go and offer a product at a fair price we get kicked out. We are asked to compete with one country or another. Our product is valuable because we want to take care of our workers, we provide free education, and free medical care. Kenya and India face short-term labour issues but we should not seek to exploit that because that would be at most a short-term benefit. We need to understand the bigger picture. Where does Sri Lanka fit in this competitive environment? We should not seek to compete with them because it would end up in price competition. We should compete on quality. What is important is not to sell 300 million kilos, but to sell 150 million kilos of Ceylon tea profitably. When I say profitably it must be profitable for the environment. We have to invest in soil regeneration, in agroforestry, make sure it is profitable for the community, and integrate the livelihoods of people into our business model. We should tell the world that we produce the finest tea on earth, that we look after our workers, our environment and that we want a fair price. If you do this you will find a reasonable gap between the cost of production, net sale average and Export FOB. We can use that gap to benefit social environmental issues. This year Dilmah will generate almost over Rs. 900 million over our 13 centres around Sri Lanka, supporting children with Down Syndrome, schools and hospitals on the plantations, environmental education, climate change centres etc. We are not compelled to do this, but we feel obliged because we are a Sri Lankan company benefiting from a Sri Lankan product and we have to share. This is my father]s philosophy. This is a business built on family values. We can do it because we have a brand. We tell our customers, we will give you the finest tea but you have to pay a fair price for it.</p><p>Q: The fertiliser ban imposed in 2021 created serious issues for the plantation sector. Now the regulations have changed. What is the current situation?</p><p>A: That ban was ranked as a stupidity. It was purely political. It]s unfortunate because it caused a catastrophe that is still rippling through our country years later. Now we have recovered to an extent. The availability of fertiliser and the fertiliser that has been applied since is resulting in more normal crops coming through. If you look at it and try to find a little bit of light at the end of that self-imposed tunnel, I suppose people are thinking a little bit about sustainable means of regenerative agriculture. This is important. We should not be reliant on fertiliser because the stupidity of the fertiliser ban was the ban in itself. As members of the tea industry who were part of that initial task force until we were kicked out, we recommended that there should be a progressive plan by setting a target of five or ten % gradually. That would have been a wise and insightful action. Several countries are working on this model. But the time frame is 30-40 years, not overnight. So yes we are recovering but the ramifications are still being felt</p><p>Q: Do you see any change in customer preference over tea especially with the new generation? Is the new generation shifting to substitutes like coffee or juice?</p><p>A: Consumers today are used to a multitude of options. The customer doesn't come with a predetermined notion of saying I]m going to drink tea or drink coffee. They look at what]s on offer. It's up to us to make tea look good. Does tea look good? Infinite variety in taste and the taste is determined in tea, not by the manufacturer. It]s determined by nature. You have Nuwara Eliya tea. Can you produce Nuwara Eliya tea in Ratnapura? No, because there are inherent geographical and climatic characteristics that define light bright tea. We must communicate this positively and say look here]s what we have in Sri Lanka. There]s a multitude of options. You have tea for your morning, for your afternoon, to have with your salad, to have with your biriyani, etc. So make the product relevant, and look good to the consumer. Create occasions. The new consumer isn]t moving away from tea. Today tea is more relevant than any other beverage. There is no herb like tea. It]s varied in taste, with natural plant antioxidant goodness, and a variety of taste. If we build a strong ethical and environmental sustainability proposition in tea we have a compelling offer. You have what a consumer would say, look when I drink this tea. Not only am I doing something good for my body, engaging my taste buds and appealing to my taste buds but also I]m helping the plantation workers in Sri Lanka. Because when they produce this and when I pay a fair price for this they get a fair wage. We just need to be able to communicate that and make tea look good.</p><p>Q: What is the future of the Sri Lankan tea industry?</p><p>A: I think the future has never been as bright as now. The reason for that is gen Z, the younger generation, millennial are conditioned by the pandemic for health and wellness. They]re looking for products that offer health and wellness. Any scientist or if you go online you would find over 45,000 research papers that confirm the natural antioxidant goodness in tea. So it is scientifically proven. Tea has a therapeutic impact on every single lifestyle disease such as diabetes. Tea enhances cognitive ability but also enhances mood. Tea reduces the impact of stress on the human body. Tea reduces the possibility of stroke. The list is endless. The future for Ceylon Tea has never been brighter than today in my opinion.</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["Where does Sri Lanka fit in this competitive environment?

By 2028, according to forecasts, the global eucalyptus oil market is projected to exceed $213 million, while the worldwide market for eucalyptus pulp will expand to nearly $17 billion.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">But the eucalyptus industry has a dark side. Eucalyptus plantations growing in regions spanning South America, southern Africa, southern Europe, and Australia have significant detrimental impacts on local communities and biodiversity.</p><p> Communities located near eucalyptus plantations are likely to face water shortages--as these plantations utilize huge amounts of water--and pollution from agrochemicals, including exposure to glyphosate, which has been linked to various health problems, including increased cancer risk.In addition, the presence of eucalyptus trees' leaves and roots hinders the growth of other plants beneath them because they contain a biocidal oil that inhibits the survival and decomposition of most soil bacteria that come into contact with them.</p><p>Brazil is the world's largest eucalyptus producer. With an estimated 7.</p><p>6 million hectares of eucalyptus plantations, Brazil maintains 30 percent of the world's total eucalyptus trees. In eastern Brazil, particularly in the states of Bahia and Espirito Santo, these plantations have replaced the diverse and endemic Atlantic Forest ecosystem, with some municipalities seeing nearly three-quarters of their land area being covered by eucalyptus plantations.</p><p> Large corporations such as Suzano, Fibria, and Veracel dominate this industry, exporting eucalyptus as pulp for manufacturing products like toilet paper.New Forest Threat: Genetically Engineered EucalyptusGenetically engineered (GE) varieties of eucalyptus trees are poised to exacerbate a new wave of ecological and social destruction.</p><p>Brazil has approved seven varieties of genetically engineered trees. Current plantations rob regions of water, destroy wildlife habitat, and transform large swaths of land within the Cerrado--an expansive, biodiverse tropical biome situated in eastern Brazil--into unnatural, destructive monoculture farms: rows upon rows of non-native eucalyptus trees without vegetation in their understory.</p><p> Many traditional communities and Indigenous people have opposed the spread of these plantations in the country.Varieties of GE eucalyptus are pesticide-resistant and are likely to increase the use of toxic chemicals such as Roundup, the glyphosate-based weedkiller developed by Monsanto in the 1970s, which is the world's most used herbicide--and was acquired by Bayer in 2018. Other engineered traits, such as increased growth rates, could make the trees more profitable for the pulp and paper industry but significantly more harmful to the environment.</p><p>International Opposition to GE EucalyptusThe Campaign to STOP GE Trees is an international alliance of organizations working to halt the introduction of genetically engineered trees into the natural environment to prevent ecological destruction and harm to local communities. It is an initiative of our U.</p><p>S.-based organization, Global Justice Ecology Project (GJEP), with support from the Uruguay-based World Rainforest Movement, which advances the cause of social justice in the forests.</p><p>n international delegation of the campaign, which was organized by GJEP, traveled to Brazil in July 2023 to meet with Indigenous and quilombola communities (descendants of escaped Afro-Brazilian enslaved people), members of the Landless Workers' Movement (Movimento dos Trabalhadores Rurais Sem Terra, or MST, in Portuguese), government ministries, and academics. The delegation's goal was to learn about the history of resistance against the pulp and paper industry in the country and discuss how herbicide-resistant genetically engineered varieties of eucalyptus trees could increase the use of toxic herbicides and amplify ecological degradation, health impacts, and social injustice.</p><p>FASE (FederaaaPound o de orgaPound os para Assistencia Social e Educacional), a group that has been supporting communities opposing eucalyptus plantations for a decade, organized the logistics of the delegation, which included representatives from Argentina, Canada, Chile, Ireland, Japan, New Zealand, and the United States. Local representatives joined the delegation as it visited several Brazilian ministries to register official demands and testimonies from quilombola and MST community members from northern Espirito Santo and southern Bahia about the devastating impacts of eucalyptus plantations as well as new threats posed by GE eucalyptus trees.</p><p>\"The demands that we recorded were from several MST communities that we met with that are doing important agroecological work and have a whole agroecological school training people in the region about how to grow organically,\" said Anne Petermann, international coordinator of the Campaign to STOP GE Trees. She noted that \"there were also statements from members of traditional quilombola communities in that region who are suffering, very directly, the impacts of eucalyptus plantations.</p><p>\"The delegation also officially presented petitions from Rainforest Rescue, an environmental nonprofit based in Hamburg, Germany, signed by more than 100,000 people opposing the release of GE eucalyptus in Brazil to the ministries and Brazilian National Technical Commission on Biosafety.During the delegation's official meeting, Moises Savian, secretary of Brazil's Ministry of Agrarian Development, identified corporate interests driving the push for GE eucalyptus.</p><p>\"It makes no sense in my vision to have a transgenic [eucalyptus] associated with glyphosate,\" stated Savian. His comments highlighted the increasingly ubiquitous and dangerous as well as probable cancer-causing herbicide Roundup.</p><p> \"It is much more linked to market interests of the corporations that want to sell herbicide,\" the secretary noted.The Kafkaesque Incentive of Carbon CreditsAnother motivation behind the push for GE eucalyptus is the Kafkaesque incentive of receiving carbon credits for planting trees.</p><p> Corporations like Suzano--which has been called the \"world's largest pulp exporter\"--can be rewarded for planting enormous industrial tree monocultures--since they are technically planting trees, they are eligible for carbon credits--even though they first clear-cut and remove the carbon-dense native forests, which release vast amounts of carbon from the forest and the soil.The pulp industry in Brazil has accelerated the growth rate of their eucalyptus trees.</p><p> This is increasing the already enormous demands on water resources. So problematic is the expansion of eucalyptus monocultures on the hydrology and biodiversity of regions that they are often called \"green deserts.</p><p>\"\"They look green from a distance but are extremely fast-growing trees planted in perfect rows and columns optimal for mechanical harvesting. The huge plantations do not harbor wildlife, and the only biodiversity you find in them is ants and termites,\" explained Petermann, who led the delegation that traveled to Brazil.</p><p>One of the most insidious trends in false solutions to climate change is the idea that living or biological carbon can offset fossil fuel carbon. An expanding landscape of monoculture industrial tree plantations in Brazil--which rob the forests of biodiversity, displace communities and wildlife, and deplete regions of water resources--epitomizes the eco-swindle of carbon credits.</p><p>JoaPound o, a member of a quilombola community, told the delegation that when eucalyptus started being planted in Espirito Santo and Bahia, \"they removed the native plant cover and all the nutrients from the soil. People [here] used to do agroforestry, would use cover crops, [and would] let the land rest--but now, with eucalyptus, there is no rest for the soil.</p><p>\" The total eucalyptus plantation area in Bahia is estimated to be about 658,000 hectares, positioning it as the country's third-largest contributor to industrially cultivated eucalyptus.Dr.</p><p> Ricarda Steinbrecher, a biologist from the University of London who attended a forum hosted by the delegation, warned of unintended consequences of genetically engineered trees, stating that \"the risks of GE trees is extremely high in terms of the impact on biodiversity, the people living around it, and the global ecosystem and climate.\"Not only are current eucalyptus plantations destructive, but the premise that they are superior to natural forests for capturing carbon is also unsound.</p><p> In 2020, experts published a letter with the Institute of Physics stating that \"forests are superior to, and irreplaceable by, plantations as agents of terrestrial C [carbon] sequestration.\" They are harvested with incredibly short growing cycles for pulp and paper production, which releases the carbon back into the atmosphere.</p><p> But the scheme is profitable for Suzano and other pulp companies since they profit from the production of pulp and paper as well as carbon credits for planting trees.Belem DeclarationBrazil is home to numerous biomes, the most famous of which is the Amazon forest.</p><p> Known as \"the lungs of the Earth\" for the massive amounts of carbon dioxide the forest inhales and the oxygen it exhales, the Amazon is the focus of many conservation initiatives and agreements.In early August 2023, Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva hosted the Amazon Summit in Belem, the capital of the Brazilian state of Para, during which another conservation agreement was launched.</p><p> The eight nations party to the Amazon Cooperation Treaty (ACT) released the Belem Declaration, a document aimed to unify the shared objectives of the signatory nations, which are focused on preserving the Amazon and the rights of Indigenous people who live in it. The United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP30 ) is slated to meet in Belem in 2025.In a press release, however, the Center for International Environmental Law (CIEL) stated that the Belem Declaration fell short of commitments to end deforestation in the Amazon and failed to address the issues related to the continued use of fossil fuels.</p><p>Nikki Reisch, director of CIEL's Climate and Energy Program, stated:\"The Belem Declaration does not commit to ending deforestation by 2030, or to addressing the primary, intersecting drivers of rainforest loss--industrial agriculture and the extractive and destructive industries that expose primary forests to land conversion.\"\"Glaringly absent from the declaration is any mention of the threat that continued production and use of oil and gas poses to the Amazon and the ecosystems, communities, and climate that depend on it.</p><p> Instead, exploration and development of new oil and gas projects continue--even at the mouth of the Amazon itself--directly undercutting leaders' pledges to prevent the region from reaching the point of no return. Allowing expansion of fossil fuel extraction in the Amazon is incompatible with human rights, including Indigenous Peoples' rights, biodiversity protection, and climate goals.</p><p>\"Similar deference to industry interests plagues the Cerrado, where eucalyptus plantations and agribusiness continue to run roughshod over Indigenous and traditional communities and destroy a lesser-known but equally precarious natural ecological system regardless of ostensible ecological concerns and overtures.The Demand for Paper PulpAs the global demand for paper pulp continues to climb, Brazil is expected to be the site of the most significant expansion of these production facilities in South America.</p><p>Two regions that the Campaign to STOP GE Trees' delegation visited are likely to face the negative impacts of the tremendous growth of eucalyptus plantations to feed the pulp and paper industry.Quilombola communities the delegation met with stated that in Espirito Santo, most of the municipal land has been turned into plantations by Suzano.</p><p> They also explained that tax incentives and infrastructure investment in the Tres Lagoas region by local and federal governments seek to attract investments by the pulp and paper industry to the state of Mato Grosso do Sul, where much of the native Cerrado forest has been converted to eucalyptus plantation in the past decade.It is so lucrative that Suzano is building the world's largest pulp and paper mill in Mato Grosso do Sul.</p><p> The enormous facility is being built by 10,000 workers, most of whom are stacked in nearby man camps. The mill is expected to employ 10,000 people when completed.</p><p> The Cerrado Project, as Suzano has deemed it, is in a rural town that has a population of nearly 25,000. The project threatens grave environmental damage to natural habitat and biodiversity, water and air, and a devastatingly precipitous population influx.Additionally, the Chilean corporation Arauco is planning an even larger mill in Mato Grosso do Sul after the scheduled completion of Suzano's behemoth.</p><p>Robbing Land From Indigenous CommunitiesLand sovereignty of traditional communities has been a politically charged issue in Brazil, and the encroachment on lands belonging to traditional and Indigenous communities by agribusiness was a theme that the delegation heard repeated during its travels through Brazil, including in the affected areas of Espirito Santo, southern Bahia, and Mato Grosso do Sul. Born out of Brazil's colonial past and decades of military dictatorship, land distributions in the country are highly inequitable.</p><p> Agribusiness interests have been incredibly aggressive in the past and continue with this trend currently.\"What made us lose our land, our culture, was all those persecutions by agribusiness,\" stated Jose De Souza, an instructor at the Indigenous Ofaie school in Mato Grosso do Sul.</p><p> The Ofaie was \"once a large people,\" he said, noting that such agribusiness pressures almost made \"them extinct.\" Once having a population of tens of thousands, the Ofaie now live on a mere 45 hectares after being forcibly relocated twice.</p><p> \"It's not an ended thing,\" said Souza. \"They destroyed our forests and water.</p><p>\" The school where Souza teaches emphasizes Ofaie culture and language in classes often taught outside in the open. The Ofaie land is small but is an oasis of native forest hemmed in by vast stretches of industrial monoculture plantations.</p><p>The Struggle for Land: The MSTEucalyptus is as central to the Ofaie land struggle as it is to the MST, one of the most significant movements in South America. The group has nearly 2 million members, with hundreds of thousands of Brazil's poor living in MST camps as farmers.</p><p> The MST seeks to reverse Brazil's profound inequality of land distribution by occupying land for communal farms.The movement is a lightning rod of controversy in Brasilia, with lawmakers aligned with former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro trying to outlaw the movement.</p><p> Still, judges have often accepted the MST's interpretation of Brazilian law that allows unproductive land to be taken. The MST has occasionally included eucalyptus plantations as meeting the definition of \"unproductive\" and has occupied and repurposed them for communal farms.</p><p>The movement has been so successful in its occupation strategy that it is estimated that 460,000 families now live in encampments started by the campaign. The MST is forward-leaning with an eye to the future with agroecology schools that teach how to grow crops and food using agroecological methods.</p><p> They are now the largest exporters of organic rice in Latin America.Biden Administration Funding Eucalyptus ExpansionAs the MST, Indigenous people, and traditional communities in Brazil struggle against the spread of industrial eucalyptus plantations, the Biden administration is reportedly funding its expansion.</p><p>ccording to a June 2023 article on Mongabay, \"Biden promised funds from the U.S.</p><p> International Development Finance Corporation to conserve the Amazon and other critical Latin American biomes.\" Yet according to findings published by Mongabay, the debt investment, if approved by Congress, will primarily \"be funneled into mass-produced eucalyptus in Brazil's Cerrado savanna.</p><p>\"Mongabay reported that $50 million of the funding would go to Timberland Investment Group's (TIG) plan to expand its \"planted forest operations,\" which located its newest office near Suzano's Cerrado Project in Mato Grosso do Sul.PL 490: Curtailing Indigenous Land RightsDuring the delegation's visit to Brazil's capital, Brasilia, to meet with ministers and lawmakers, Indigenous peoples held a large demonstration to oppose a proposal, PL 490, a law its supporters claim would bring certainty and fairness to land disputes in Brazil.</p><p> Opponents, however, argue that the proposal would actually reverse hard-fought gains by Indigenous communities to have their land rights officially recognized.Proposed by Bolsonaro-aligned lawmakers, PL 490 would reset Indigenous land claims to October 1988--when the current Brazilian Constitution was adopted after the military dictatorship.</p><p> Since the lands were taken during the dictatorship, this is a land-grabbing ruse by extractive industries seeking to deny claims of land rights by Indigenous groups and even to erase gains they had made in the past. The Lower House of Congress gave its approval to this bill in May 2023.The push for PL 490 underscores how land sovereignty is a fundamental issue in Brazilian politics and is inextricably linked to the country's environment and the rights of traditional communities.</p><p> Monoculture eucalyptus plantations play a central role in the contest over land rights, an issue central to Brazilian politics and ultimately connected to the rights of traditional communities and the world's environmental health. With the specter of eucalyptus trees engineered for pesticide resistance and the Biden administration's embrace of false solutions to climate change, the balance is being further tipped in favor of the pulp and paper industry in that fight.</p><p>\"As Brazil goes, so does the world when it comes to the use of GE-engineered eucalyptus,\" said Petermann. \"The significance of the loss of the Cerrado to GE eucalyptus plantations cannot be overstated.</p><p>\"Credit Line: This article was produced by Earth | Food | Life, a project of the Independent Media Institute.Steve Taylor is the press secretary for Global Justice Ecology Project and the host of the podcast Breaking Green.</p><p> Beginning his environmental work in the 1990s opposing clearcutting in Shawnee National Forest, Taylor was awarded the Leo and Kay Drey Award for Leadership from the Missouri Coalition for the Environment for his work as co-founder of the Times Beach Action Group.Orin Langelle is the director of Langelle Photography.</p><p> His first assignment was photographing Vietnam War protests during the 1972 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach, Florida.

The huge plantations do not harbor wildlife, and the only biodiversity you find in them is ants and termites,\" explained Petermann, who led the delegation that traveled to Brazil. One of the most insidious trends in false solutions to climate change is the idea that living or biological carbon can offset fossil fuel carbon. An expanding landscape of monoculture industrial tree plantations in Brazil--which rob the forests of biodiversity, displace communities and wildlife, and deplete regions of water resources--epitomizes the eco-swindle of carbon credits. JoaPound o, a member of a quilombola community, told the delegation that when eucalyptus started being planted in Espirito Santo and Bahia, \"they removed the native plant cover and all the nutrients from the soil. People [here] used to do agroforestry, would use cover crops, [and would] let the land rest--but now, with eucalyptus, there is no rest for the soil. The total eucalyptus plantation area in Bahia is estimated to be about 658,000 hectares, positioning it as the country's third-largest contributor to industrially cultivated eucalyptus. Dr. Ricarda Steinbrecher, a biologist from the University of London who attended a forum hosted by the delegation, warned of unintended consequences of genetically engineered trees, stating that \"the risks of GE trees is extremely high in terms of the impact on biodiversity, the people living around it, and the global ecosystem and climate. Not only are current eucalyptus plantations destructive, but the premise that they are superior to natural forests for capturing carbon is also unsound. In 2020, experts published a letter with the Institute of Physics stating that \"forests are superior to, and irreplaceable by, plantations as agents of terrestrial C [carbon] sequestration."]}, {"relevance_score": 42, "title": "Investing in nature to address the climate crisis", "published": "2023-01-14", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\"> As a developing tropical island nation, Sri Lanka is vulnerable to the impacts of climate change. Sea level rise, erosion, and storms affect the coastal zone while agricultural areas are threatened by erratic rainfall, droughts, floods, and soil degradation. Across the country and across key economic sectors, climate change already impacts livelihoods, lives, and human wellbeing, and is projected to become more severe in the coming decades.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka is also blessed with a rich biodiversity and a multitude of productive ecosystems. From cloud forests to grasslands, and from lowland rainforests, lakes, and coastal ecosystems such as salt marshes, seagrass beds, and coral reefs, the island is home to a significant range of habitats and associated species of animals and plants, many of which are endemic.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Particularly in light of the new Global Biodiversity Framework and the intergovernmental climate negotiations, how can Sri Lanka's natural wealth help the country to address challenges such as climate change while also facilitating economic recovery and sustainable development?</p><p>The benefits of biodiversity</p><p>There are at least three ways in which biodiversity and ecosystems can be part of the solution and help to increase the resilience of human communities and systems.</p><p>First off, ecosystems provide a range of benefits, some of which can be directly expressed in monetary terms. These ecosystem services include provision of goods and ingredients for consumption, medicine, cosmetics, construction, and other purposes, prevention of erosion, regulation of air and water quality, protection against floods, storage of water, tourism and recreation opportunities, and many more.</p><p>Mangrove ecosystems, for example, have been estimated to provide services worth up to $ 50,000 per hectare in some cases, with $ 15,000 as the average value. Beyond these valuated benefits, natural ecosystems serve as animal habitats and hold intangible and hard-to-quantify aesthetic, cultural, or spiritual value, create a sense of place, and can improve mental health and resilience of nearby communities.</p><p>Secondly, while healthy ecosystems automatically provide the above-mentioned benefits to the environment, wildlife, and human communities, they can also be harnessed in targeted ways. Towards this end, ecosystem services can be incorporated into planning processes in direct, indirect, or hybrid ways.</p><p>Such nature-based solutions can, for example, take the form of green infrastructure such as green roofs, rain gardens, urban forests, urban wetlands, or urban agriculture that improve the resilience of human settlements by contributing to disaster risk reduction, flood control, food security, and sustainable livelihoods.</p><p>Beyond improving cities and infrastructure, nature also offers ways to directly boost economic growth in sustainable ways. For an island nation like Sri Lanka, investing in a blue economy holds significant potential. Blue economy measures could include ecosystem solutions in the fisheries sector, seaweed or seagrass cultivation, coastal zone management, aquaculture, coastal and marine tourism, ocean-based transportation, or renewable ocean energy.</p><p>On land, integrated nature-based solutions can transform food systems and enhance productivity, production diversity, and resilience through agroforestry, or work towards more sustainable, cost-effective, and circular land and water management.</p><p>Thirdly, actions related to ecosystem conservation, rehabilitation, restoration, and assisted growth can help to mobilise much-needed finance and investment. There are various financial instruments and mechanisms that connect to natural ecosystems and the protection of biodiversity, including green bonds, ecological restoration bonds, debt-for-nature swaps, ESG (environmental, social, and governance) investing, impact investing, carbon credits (both on the voluntary market and in relation to a centralised mechanism being set up under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement), biodiversity offsets (for instance, for afforestation or habitat restoration), natural capital finance, resource efficiency financing, or bioprospecting (the exploration of biodiversity for commercially valuable genetic and biochemical resources).</p><p>Other mechanisms that can incentivise ecosystem conservation and link them to economic growth are payments for reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD+), payments for ecosystem services (PES) mechanisms, ecosystem discounts for insurance premiums, eco-index insurance, or green mortgages.</p><p>Possible sources of finance for such interventions are varied and operate across all scales. Depending on available funding, nature-based solutions could take the form of national-level projects or public works, but also nature-based microfinance for local projects, such as in ecotourism or sustainable agriculture. Nature-based crowdfunding, donations, sale of conservation easements, special levies, or land trusts are potential other sources of biodiversity finance.</p><p>Aligning national and global goals</p><p>As highlighted in my previous column, the climate and biodiversity crises are neither separate nor are they confined to the country level. They are deeply interconnected global challenges-part of what can be called a 'polycrisis'-but must be addressed first and foremost through local and national action.</p><p>Under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement, global goals relate to climate change mitigation (emission reduction and curbing of temperature rise), adaptation (changing systems to avoid adverse impacts and seize positive opportunities), addressing loss and damage (support for those affected by climate impacts beyond adaptation limits), and providing support for developing countries, including through finance and technology transfer.</p><p>Under the Convention on Biological Diversity and the new Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework (GBF) adopted last month, global goals focus on biodiversity conservation and protected areas, halting species extinction, preserving genetic resources, halving food waste, and strengthening sustainable biodiversity management and usage. Furthermore, the GBF aims to mobilise at least $ 200 billion per year in financial flows from all sources to support these goals and ensure that adequate means of implementation are available to all Parties, particularly developing countries.</p><p>Individual countries communicate their contributions to these overarching goals through Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Biodiversity Strategies and Action Plans (NBSAPs). Sri Lanka's NDCs, for example, include sectors such as forestry, water, biodiversity, and coastal and marine, while the country's NBSAPs reference climate impacts, biodiversity valuation, sustainable use of biodiversity, sustainable agriculture, and equitable sharing of biodiversity benefits, among other things.</p><p>Both documents contain targets related to the conservation, restoration, and sustainable management of soil, water, forests, wetlands, agrobiodiversity, and coastal and marine areas. Conserving natural ecosystems and biodiversity contributes to achieving these targets as well as mitigating climate change by acting as carbon sinks.</p><p>If national, local, and sector-specific plans and interventions are aligned with these commitments, they can better access finance from global funds (such as the Green Climate Fund and the Global Environmental Facility), multi- and bilateral entities, financial markets, the private sector, the insurance industry, repurposed subsidies, and other countries.</p><p>With the new biodiversity finance target, pledges made to several funds at the recent United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP27) in Sharm el-Sheikh, and a new upcoming global goal for climate finance, there is an important window of opportunity to link action on biodiversity and climate change.</p><p>Identifying synergies</p><p>Sri Lanka is endowed with valuable natural capital in the form of diverse ecosystems, fauna, and flora. Building on this capital in line with national and global commitments can provide a pathway to attract investment, access finance from a multitude of sources, and design interventions and policies with strong co-benefits and synergies.</p><p>If concrete, transparent, and well-designed actions are taken on different levels, they can not only prevent further biodiversity loss and preserve biodiversity benefits for future generations, but also utilise the full potential of ecosystems to address climate change, support economic growth, and mobilise investment from a multitude of sources.</p><p>(The writer works as Director - Research and Knowledge Management at SLYCAN Trust, a non-profit think tank based in Sri Lanka.

The increasing franchise costs that entail imported coffees are also driving many popular coffee houses in Colombo and the suburbs to turn to local blends, some of them which have already tapped a lucrative export market. The coffee rust which ended the island's coffee romance in the British-occupied then Ceylon is given hope for resurgence today.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">The local coffee production and extent have increased over the years. Sri Lanka's coffee cultivation covers 4,787 ha. today, according to DEA's statistics. The production which was at 2,439 mt. in 2021, has increased to 2,537 mt. by the end of 2022.</p><p>The two main commercially important species of coffee locally grown are Arabica (Coffea arabica) and Robusta (Coffea canephora). These two main species grown here include several varieties. While Arabica coffee varieties are recommended for mid and up country areas with an altitude of over 400m (Nuwara Eliya, Kandy, Matale and Badulla), Robusta variety is recommended for mid and low country with an altitude of less than 600m (Kegalle, Kurunegala, Kandy and Matale). These recommendations are made depending on the temperature variation. While Arabica prefers a temperature of 15-28\u00baC, Robusta thrives in a temperature of 18-36\u00baC.</p><p>Coffee is one of the most widely consumed beverages in the world. The Coffee Market Report of April this year issued by the International Coffee Organization (ICO) notes that the world coffee consumption increased by 4.2% to 175.6 million bags in the year 2021/22. It is expected to increase by 1.7% to 178.5 million bags in coffee year 2022/23</p><p>Lak Parakum among top 10</p><p>More than 80% the world demand is for Arabica coffee says DEA's Additional Director General (Research) Dr. Ananda Subasinghe. Lak Parakum with its quality parameters, in terms of the yield, disease-tolerance and the texture of beans, stands among the best ten Arabica varieties in the world, he adds. Each kilo of Lak Parakum seed, according to DEA, could produce 2,000 to 3,000 plants and a sizeable amount of plants have been distributed among growers already.</p><p>Expanding exports</p><p>The export market for Sri Lankan coffee too expanded over the years. From 30.47 mt. in 2021, our coffee exports have increased to 50.56 mt. in 2022. Australia, UAE, USA, Maldives, New Zealand, Chile, UK and Germany are the major buyers of Sri Lankan coffee. Several new measures are now in place to tap a lucrative market for Sri Lankan coffee. Production of planting material with private sector nurseries, awareness programs for crop management, harvesting and processing practices for high quality products, promoting value addition, introduction of GAP (Good Agricultural Practices), certification to get premium prices and increasing the coffee extent to 5,800 ha and the export volume to 200 mt. by 2025 are among these.</p><p>The current average productivity of coffee is about 450-500kg per ha. However, this could easily double within a year with Productivity Improvement Programs (PIP) for existing cultivations, points out Dr. Subasinghe.</p><p>Although threats from rust diseases are still prevalent in coffee fields, they can be controlled with good management practices and available control measures, points out the DEA authorities. Apart from the rust disease, the major pest problem which threatens coffee is the berry borer damage. This too can be managed with good crop management practices, assures the DEA. Even though DEA has given a fertiliser recommendation for coffee, most of the farmers are not applying them due to different reasons such as, shortage of fertiliser, higher prices and their preference for only organic fertiliser and mulching practices, etc. If they can apply half the recommendation and Gliricidia mulch, it is more beneficial for a sustainable crop, Dr. Subasinghe points out. Conservation of the soil moisture up to six months after flowering is also crucial as the most important yield determining-practice for increasing the quantity of the coffee yield, he says.</p><p>The better price offered for Lak Parakum variety in the local market is another boost to revive coffee growing, says DEA's Deputy Director (Research) Thushari Liyanage. 'Due to the low prices offered for coffee, which was about Rs. 400 per kilo of beans, five years ago, many growers were discouraged and neglected coffee in the last few years, however, currently a kilo of quality coffee could fetch an average about Rs. 1,200 to 1,300 per kilo.'</p><p>Enhancing productivity</p><p>Immature coffee harvesting and bad processing practices lead to rejection of some of the local coffee beans by importing countries, points out Liyanage who goes on to note that if timely harvesting and good processing practices can be followed by growers and processors, the export potential for local coffee could be strengthened. Today only about 20-30% of local coffee meets international criteria for exports.</p><p>Applauding the contribution made by the private sector, Liyanage encourages 'Certification' among coffee growers and exporters. 'Unlike in the tea industry, certification processes are still not very popular in the local industry. However, if certification can be promoted, the recognition and the price offered for our coffee in the international market could be a lot more,' maintains the DEA official who also notes that coffee productivity needs to double along with good irrigation practices for the local coffee industry to be more competitive. She also cites the potential for new job opportunities within the coffee industry such as roasters, coffee baristas and coffee tasters with the expansion of it.</p><p>Coffee romance</p><p>History has it that coffee was introduced to us in 1503 by the Arab traders from Yemen. However, the planting of coffee as a commercial crop in the island commenced with the Dutch occupation and continued under British rule. Planter R.B. Butler, who had experience in coffee plantations in Jamaica, came here in 1837 and introduced methods to yield a better coffee crop. By 1863, the value of coffee imported into Europe from all parts of the world amounted to \u00a3 270 million, and we were exporting nearly a third of that.</p><p>The colonial 'Ceylon' was among the top coffee producing and exporting nations and a coffee-drinking culture complete with kopi kaday (coffee kiosks) and kopi kele (coffee forests) evolved. Christine Spittel-Wilson's famous book The Bitter Berry revolves around the ethos of a Ceylonese coffee plantation.</p><p>Sadly, the coffee rust of 1870 (caused by the fungus Hemileia vastatrix) destroyed all plantations bringing the coffee romance of the country to an end. Although rust-tolerant varieties were later introduced, today coffee is an intercrop with tea and coconut. However, the DEA encourages coffee growers to expand their coffee acreage as monocrop cultivations as well.</p><p>Reskilling skills</p><p>Tharanga Rajith Muramudali who has been in the coffee industry since 2012 promotes his own produce under the 'Helanta' brand today and is a leading exporter of premier Sri Lankan coffee. He exports premier Arabica coffee of 'shade planting', 'organic planting' and 'mixed planting' to Japan, Australia and Thailand. Sourcing coffee from his own lands in Kothmale, Tharanga also runs Natural Coffee Caf\u00e9 in Kandy. He is also a supplier of premier local coffee to some of the leading hotel chains in the country. Tharanga, who says that high quality Sri Lankan coffee supply cannot meet the demand, calls for fellow growers to expand their coffee coverage. 'Superior quality Arabica coffee could fetch from Rs. 6,000 to 10,000 a kilo in the export market, depending on the type of coffee. Special organic varieties are sold for about Rs. 10,000 a kilo and even more,' says the self-made coffee entrepreneur.</p><p>Tharanga's coffee has clinched several awards at international coffee festivals, scoring over 80 points which is a mark of eligibility to be among top coffee brands anywhere in the world, he says. 'Although we have enough land, we still do not have sufficient coffee nurseries,' lamented Tharanga whose own nurseries hope to expand to distribute 500,000 plants next year.</p><p>Nalin Priyantha of Kiyota Coffee fame produces eight signature tastes of coffee in his factory sourced from his own lands in Matale. A leading exporter of premium Sri Lankan coffee to Japan, Nalin points out that if the producers and exporters could enhance the quality of their produce, a larger export market could be tapped for local coffee. Comparing our Arabica coffee to a 'mound of gold covered in mud', Nalin also calls for increased empowerment of small holders. 'Our soil conditions, water quality of high elevations all contribute to producing some of world's best coffee and if growers could enhance their GAPs sky is the limit for our crop,' remarks Nalin, whose Amberlyplace Coffee Academy strives to add more muscle to the industry by opening several career paths as coffee roasters and baristas.</p><p>If timely harvesting and good processing practices can be followed by growers and processors, the export potential for local coffee could be strengthened. Today only about 20-30% of local coffee meets international criteria for exports</p><p>Expanding coverage</p><p>Since 2016, Elpitiya Plantations PLC (EPP) has been cultivating new tolerant-varieties of coffee in their poor tea-yielding lands in the up and mid-country (which were predominantly coffee estates back in time) as an intercrop. EPP's coffee extent of 103.05 ha. is to be increased to 283.36 ha. within the next five years, says EPP's General Manager, Up Country Cluster, L.M.C.P. Liyadipita. The coffee expansion exercise of EPP also envisages to train over 200 employees in planting, harvesting, processing and value addition for export markets.</p><p>Developments in all aspects of the Sri Lankan coffee market, including production, processing, marketing, and consumption, have been significant, points out the EPP's senior official. 'There is a steady increase in demand for specialty Arabica and fine Robusta coffee both in local and export markets especially in countries like Australia. New Zealand, Japan. UAE and Canada. The MDF (Market Development Facility) along with SL Coffee Association and the Department of Export Agriculture are jointly working with upgrading and sharing giving knowledge and rendering assistance to develop the coffee industry in the country to meet international standards.'</p><p>Braving climate change</p><p>Sri Lankan coffee with its unique quality, flavour and aroma, has a great potential for reaching an international niche market with proper branding, says Liyadipita. 'The country's highlands provide an ideal environment for cultivating high-quality Arabica beans, resulting in unique and flavourful profiles that set them apart from other coffee varieties. Additionally, Sri Lankan coffee is predominantly produced by smallholder and backyard farmers who employ organic and sustainable farming practices, ensuring the preservation of the environment's biodiversity.'</p><p>Higher temperatures, changes in rainfall patterns, increased pest and disease outbreaks, and loss of biodiversity and ecosystem services are some of the adverse effects that coffee cultivation faces due to climate change, says EPP official. 'At EPP, we have implemented GAPs to counteract the negative effects of climate change and ensure a productive coffee harvest. We harvest over 259 million litres of rainwater in harvesting ponds to recharge the soil to mitigate the drought effect and incorporate soil with 61% organic compost. We have identified 166 ha. of stream reservation for restoration by planting native plants/bamboo. Development of catchment and connecting animal corridors with increasing green cover to preserve the micro climatic conditions is another initiative.'</p><p>EPP has also introduced several schemes to encourage small coffee holders both within the plantation company and outside in the neighbouring villages. Investing in R and D, enhancing the capacity and skills of coffee farmers and processors, enhancing the awareness and appreciation of Sri Lankan coffee, strengthening collaboration and coordination among multiple stakeholders in the coffee sector and supporting a conducive policy and regulatory environment are among the measures mooted by Liyadipita to take Sri Lankan coffee to the next level.</p><p>Sri Lankan coffee to the next level</p><p>Upcountry estates of the Kahawatte Plantations, expanded over the Nawalapitiya area of Kothmale Valley and the Dolosbage hills, produce high-quality, single-origin coffees for the world market, sourced from 21 ha. The company plans to expand the coffee coverage to 50 ha. by 2027. The estates, as Kahawatte Plantations PLC Director Plantations, Chaminda Gunarathna points out, have the ideal climatic conditions for coffee-growing in the country. 'Our elevation varies from 600 msl to 1,650 msl, which provides the most favourable elevation for Arabica coffee cultivation. Moreover, the soil factor in the Nawalapitiya area has improved with GAPs such as adding compost, planting green manure crops and adopting soil conservation methods, as coffee's performance is better on nutrient-rich soils.'</p><p>As a diversification strategy, Kahawatte Plantations commenced coffee cultivation in 2021 under the guidance of the DEA. 'As our existing coffee fields will be in the bearing stage in 2025, we have planned to commence a coffee processing centre by 2025 to produce high-quality value-added coffees required by the international market,' says its Director Plantations.</p><p>Coffee is the second most traded commodity next to crude oil in the world. Hence, the potential for penetrating the market channel will be directly determined by the quality factors of the coffee that the country produces, says Gunarathna. 'Although there is a good demand for Sri Lankan Arabica coffee in the global market, the price fluctuation has negatively affected the coffee farmers.'</p><p>To mitigate the impact of climate change, their plantations have adopted GAPs and climate resilience measures introduced by Dilmah Conservation such as mulching, shade management, proper irrigation, rain-water harvesting and maintenance of good ground cover, says Gunarathna. 'As a climate resilience measure, we cultivate and maintain our coffee as agroforestry models where we have a greater impact, especially in the case of pest and disease outbreaks. Further, we maintain our coffee fields with zero herbicide to ensure the proper biological properties in the soil.'</p><p>In a bid to assist smallholders of coffee, Kahawatte Plantations offer plants sourced by their nurseries and technical assistance. Enabling more mechanisation of field practices of coffee cultivation is critical if Sri Lankan coffee is to reach the next level, remarks Gunarathna. Expanding technical assistance from the government to expand large-scale cultivation and enhancing the specialty knowledge of coffee processing are also mooted by the senior official as necessary tools if Sri Lankan coffee is to compete in the international coffee market. 'At Kahawatte Plantations, we strive at all times to raise the bar for Sri Lankan coffee in the same way we did with our tea, earning a name as a leading brand in the international market,' Gunarathna notes.</p><p>A voice for the industry</p><p>As part of Lanka Coffee Association's (LCA) efforts in elevating the Sri Lankan coffee industry and enabling a platform to voice the industry's concerns to the Government, LCA in collaboration with the DEA and Market Development Facility, hosted the 'Coordination for Improvement of the Coffee Industry in Sri Lanka' program in Kandy last year to lend voice to the key concerns in the industry.

In addition, we are hosting events such as the coffee festival to promote and showcase our coffee to the world. Through such strategic initiatives, we are able to attract a stronger international market for Sri Lanka. In addition, moves to obtain Geographical Indication (GI) for Sri Lankan coffee are also under consideration,' says LCA Chairman and Founder and CEO of Soul Coffee Company, Rinosh Nasar.</p><p>Soul Coffee, as its founder explains, is sustainably grown by over a 1,000 farming families across the luscious highland forests of Sri Lanka. 'Since its inception in 2014, the brand has been at the forefront in the revival of Sri Lankan coffee and tirelessly pushing to improve the coffee experience, and the quality of local coffee available to the everyday coffee drinker. We work closely with our hardworking and extremely skilled local farmers to grow our premium quality coffee, without using any environmentally devastating mono-culture practices, and following ethical farming standards. Our ethically conscious approach to present our customers with the perfect cup of coffee that they can enjoy without any reservation, is something we strongly believe in and reflects in our core values,' remarks Nasar.</p><p>Pic credit: Helanta Coffee and Kiyota Coffee</p>", "publisher": "Daily Financial Times", "instances": ["'As our existing coffee fields will be in the bearing stage in 2025, we have planned to commence a coffee processing centre by 2025 to produce high-quality value-added coffees required by the international market,' says its Director Plantations. Coffee is the second most traded commodity next to crude oil in the world. Hence, the potential for penetrating the market channel will be directly determined by the quality factors of the coffee that the country produces, says Gunarathna. 'Although there is a good demand for Sri Lankan Arabica coffee in the global market, the price fluctuation has negatively affected the coffee farmers. To mitigate the impact of climate change, their plantations have adopted GAPs and climate resilience measures introduced by Dilmah Conservation such as mulching, shade management, proper irrigation, rain-water harvesting and maintenance of good ground cover, says Gunarathna. 'As a climate resilience measure, we cultivate and maintain our coffee as agroforestry models where we have a greater impact, especially in the case of pest and disease outbreaks. Further, we maintain our coffee fields with zero herbicide to ensure the proper biological properties in the soil. In a bid to assist smallholders of coffee, Kahawatte Plantations offer plants sourced by their nurseries and technical assistance. Enabling more mechanisation of field practices of coffee cultivation is critical if Sri Lankan coffee is to reach the next level, remarks Gunarathna. Expanding technical assistance from the government to expand large-scale cultivation and enhancing the specialty knowledge of coffee processing are also mooted by the senior official as necessary tools if Sri Lankan coffee is to compete in the international coffee market. 'At Kahawatte Plantations, we strive at all times to raise the bar for Sri Lankan coffee in the same way we did with our tea, earning a name as a leading brand in the international market,' Gunarathna notes."]}, {"relevance_score": 64, "title": "New UN Report stuns organic fertiliser critics", "published": "2021-09-19", "bodyText": "<p nitf:lede=\"true\">Sri Lanka, Sept. 19 -- Those who are seething against the principled policy of organic fertiliser replacing the chemical stuff that we were used to, should read the recent UN report on farm subsidies.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">A new UN study castigates the farm subsidies that are pumped into the dairy industry in developed countries, and for chemical fertiliser and insecticides used in the developing world.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Almost 90 percent of the $540bn in global subsidies given to farmers every year are \"harmful\", a startling UN report has found, writes The Guardian's Environment Editor.

Powdered milk, in the form that it's sold, is useless to the consumer but then, these are highly subsidised \"big farma\" products that come to us from countries that have these industrial scale dairy farming projects in place, as it were, to dupe the consumers in foreign countries - and contribute in colossal quantities to global warming, to boot.</p><p>We can no longer have lobby groups - SJB, JVP or NGO backed, that stand the truth on its head by demonising organic fertiliser projects, and celebrating the use of chemical fertilisers, while deploring the import restrictions on foreign origin powdered milk food products.</p><p>In today's context, lobby groups that stick to such policies for whatever professed reasons, must be peopled by either ignoramuses and yokels - or those who have indentured themselves to vested interests for collateral reasons.</p><p>Juncture</p><p>The Government's move is towards global sustainability and it's a long game.

The UN warns of the dire consequences of subsidised chemical fertiliser use and industrial scale dairy farming and so on, and points out that these practices are egregiously harmful to the planet, but here we have an ex-Central Bank policy mandarin saying we should double down on the toxic culture of the agriculture of the past.</p><p>Regressive</p><p>This sort of blanket caving into vested interests as the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna MP Mohommed Muzammil said on TV once, begs the question - how far have these vested interests gone in trying to influence people?

They cannot be wished away. But does it mean that the obvious harmful effects of 'big farma' agricultural practices should be completely ignored? That we turn a blind eye to land desertification and so on that potentially could cause more hunger in the long run?</p><p>That's not just myopic, it's totally irresponsible behaviour. The JVP, SJB types owes the nation an unqualified apology for touting regressive policy as progressive, and ex-Central Bank types could join in too.</p><p>On a matter of principle it's settled science that organic farming is fast becoming a necessity because the Green Revolutions so-called came at a price.</p><p>High yielding crop varieties are one thing, but unquestioning reliance on chemical fertilisers and unsustainable agricultural practices such as industrial scale dairy farming are absolutely a thing of the past.</p><p>If anyone is encouraging powdered milk imports under these circumstances they belong in the Stone Age.</p><p>The long game under the new organic fertiliser initiative is hard, and challenging.

And it is made clear the urgent need to make global food systems more just.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">An example of modern food injustice is that if you are poor or an ethnic minority in the US, you are less likely to have easy access to healthy food. This situation, worsened by COVID-19, has been termed food apartheid. It is also often the case that corporations, not local growers, control the food produced by communities: taking money out of their hands.</p><p>If this is to change, it is important to understand who wins within existing food systems and, more importantly, who loses by being pushed to the sidelines and losing out on access to healthy food.</p><p>To do this, those who design food systems need to consider how different factors that determine if someone is marginalized - like gender, age, disability, ethnicity and religion - can combine or intersect, making some people more vulnerable.</p><p>Vulnerable groups</p><p>For example, international development programmes by Governments and charities often focus on helping women because they are considered vulnerable. But this risks overlooking different causes of poverty including class and race issues, marginalising other vulnerable groups.</p><p>In Tanzania, this kind of oversimplification when deciding who receives resources has been found to reinforce existing power hierarchies within the communities, meaning that those who had little social power to begin with - such as poorer women - do not get to benefit from the resources provided.</p><p>In contrast, research shows that development projects tend to do better when they take local community norms into account. For example, in Bangladesh, men and women from Hindu and Muslim communities work in the wetlands, but each group plays a different role. Researchers found that community wetland management projects did better when people worked in accordance with their traditional roles according to both gender and religion.</p><p>Power dynamics</p><p>An intersectional approach helps us to move beyond simplistic categories like the \"vulnerable women\", instead drawing attention to the unequal flows of power that shape access to resources. This should be embedded at the deepest level within food science to ensure marginalised and vulnerable people are at the forefront of change.</p><p>It is also vital to understand how power dynamics structure decisions within food systems, whether that is within households or inside Government institutions.</p><p>When tackling issues faced by women and girls in Burundi, CARE International worked with a network of local male gender equality champions to analyse power systems, reflect on gender roles and encourage equal and active participation by women in community decisions. Outcomes included improvements in agricultural productivity as well as increasing women's empowerment and gender equality.</p><p>Creating inclusive, safe spaces for marginalised voices is also critical. Creative approaches, such as theatre, dance and music, provide a powerful medium through which to achieve this.</p><p>For example, Roktim: Nurture Incarnadine, an Ananya Dance Theatre production, explores feminist food politics through dance. Their performance highlights issues around sustainability and justice in food systems, and demonstrates the power of community action.</p><p>Historical injustice has a large part to play in the ongoing failure of food systems. For example, when it comes to global food systems, we need to understand how colonialism has shaped food processes and how it continues to do so today.</p><p>During the late 19th and early 20th Centuries, the colonial government in Zambia promoted maize production over that of indigenous crops like millet and sorghum. Nowadays, maize production continues to receive substantial support, with almost 80 per cent of the Government's annual agricultural budget spent on producing maize. Consequently, maize - which provides limited nutrients - dominates the Zambian diet, contributing to chronic food insecurity and inequality in the region.</p><p>Understanding how to better design food systems requires researchers to take into account how colonisation has helped shape them in the first place. This allows us to acknowledge how colonial processes of exploitation and destruction, such as the transatlantic slave trade, are reflected in modern maize-dominated food systems across Africa.</p><p>Decolonising research can also encourage us to identify and challenge power, privilege and inequality in research. For example, it is usually scholars from developed countries, rather than their counterparts in developing countries, who set research agendas and determine how money is spent.</p><p>And research from across the world is frequently only published in English, limiting the accessibility of that information within communities where English is not widely spoken or understood.</p><p>Traditionally, science has seen itself as a process of impartial observation.

If rains stop falling, within a few years the area can become arid with the strong tropical sun baking down on the scrub-land.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Such losses of freshwater resources are considered one of the most immediate threats to national security. Freshwater - required for human consumption, agriculture, and industrial operations - or the lack thereof can have a tremendous effect on the social, economic, and political climate of a country. Under these circumstances, deforestation will adversely affect the survival of the nation.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Wars for water - not for oil</p><p>Today Madagascar is largely a red, treeless desert due to generations of forest clearing with fire. River flows decline and smaller amounts of quality water reach cities and agricultural lands. In interior West African countries, the declining rainfall has, in part, been attributed to excessive clearing of the coastal rainforests. Similarly, new research in Australia suggests that if it were not for human influences - specifically widespread agricultural fires - the dry outback might be a wetter, more hospitable place than it is today.</p><p>The effect of vegetation change from forests that favour rainfall to grassland and bush can impact precipitation patterns. Colombia, once second in the world ranking for freshwater reserves, has fallen to the 24th place due to its extensive deforestation over the past 30 years. Excessive deforestation around Malaysia's capital Kuala Lumpur, combined with the dry conditions created by el Ni\u00f1o, triggered strict water rationing in 1998, and for the first time the city had to import water. In the future, wars may be fought over water, not oil. In the 1990s, Egypt made it known to its upstream neighbours - Sudan and Ethiopia - that it is willing to go to war over the Nile's water. The evidence amply justify that the deforestation has a direct adverse impact on national security.</p><p>World forest cover</p><p>Forests cover 31 percent of the global land area. About half the forest area is relatively intact, and more than one-third is primary forest (i.e. naturally regenerated forests of native species, where there are no visible indications of human activities and the ecological processes are not significantly disturbed). The total global forest area is 4.06 billion hectares, or about 5,000m2 (or 50 x 100m) per person, but forests are not equally distributed around the globe. More than half of the world's forests are found in only five countries (the Russian Federation, Brazil, Canada, the United States of America and China) and two-thirds (66 percent) of forests are found in ten countries.</p><p>Lanka's forest cover</p><p>Sri Lanka had a forest density of 82 percent in 1882. It was 29.5 percent as of 2015, according to Sri Lanka forest officials. The Forest Department says a survey is generally carried out once in 10 years. In the 1920s, the island had a 49 percent forest cover. Between 1990 and 2000, Sri Lanka lost an average of 26,800 ha of forests a year. This amounts to an average annual deforestation rate of 1.14 percent. Sri Lankans have cleared 52.5 percent of the forests in 133 years. This may be due to the rise in population, agriculture, development, construction of major dams and highways and urbanisation. 'The World Food and Agriculture Organisation ranked Sri Lanka as the 4th country with the highest rate of deforestation by 2010. We are holding the same position even now.'</p><p>Premadasa's National Green Initiative</p><p>Against such a backdrop, opposition leader Sajith Premadasa, a nature lover, on March 3 introduced 'the National Green Initiative' concept. It aims to mainstream environmental conservation across all sectors as a precondition to achieve sustainable development.</p><p>He commissioned his political party Samagi Jana Balawegaya to be the first party in Sri Lanka. This environmental friendly concept needs to be appreciated and supported not only by nature lovers but also by all the citizens in the country.</p><p>Deforestation at present</p><p>The government says it is committed to increasing the national forest cover by 30 percent. President Gotabaya Rajapaksa has emphasised the need for a sustainable environmental policy to support sustainable development and promised to increase the forest cover.</p><p>Despite the promise, what we see is the deforestation of protected areas. It is a nightmare for conservationists, environmentalists and nature friendly citizens.</p><p>The construction of the Neluwa-Lankagama-Deniyaya Road, the deforestation in Anawilundawa to establish a prawn farm and clearing of several forest areas around the country caught the attention of environmental activists. Furthermore, reports indicate the involvement of a few newly elected parliamentarians in deforestation activities.</p><p>However, the diffusion of the president's aims and vision to the relevant political authorities and bureaucratic authorities seems questionable, amid incidents of deforestation and increased human activity. The authorities have failed to produce environmental assessments for development projects in forest areas. Election promises, a lack of political authority and a lack of sustainable strategies have led to the blind advancement of unsustainable development projects.</p><p>Human survival and national security</p><p>Trees have always been intricately linked to the survival and flourishing of human societies: they give us clean water, they hold and protect the soil, they cool the air and they shelter the fauna. From climate change to organised crime and the spread of infectious diseases, forest degradation is directly tied to a series of both national and global security risks:</p><p>The most serious consequences of deforestation and forest degradation have been identified as:</p><p>Reduced agricultural output due to changes in precipitation</p><p>Water scarcity and irregular water supply</p><p>Air pollution</p><p>Organised crimes.

Droughts are expected to have a significant impact on rice crop yields. Climate change is widely expected to have a negative impact on vegetable and fruit production. As a result, this will create a serious food shortage and also severely restrict farmer income generation. Consequently, a large number from the rural community will migrate from agricultural areas of Sri Lanka to already congested urban areas. This will necessitate a long-term solution. Today's Sri Lankan population under the age of 50 will definitely bear the brunt of this situation. However, the majority of today's policymakers and policy implementers are over the age of 50, and they may not be concerned enough about this situation.</p><p>However, it must be noted that despite massive constraints, areas outside of urban Sri Lanka produce roughly 80% of the national food supply. Nevertheless, according to a recent survey, a farming household with a 4.5 family size earns around US$ 6.0-8.5 (or US$ 1.3-1.9 per person) per day. Hence, 82% of farmers work outside of agriculture to supplement their family income. Significant poverty and inequality persist in these food-producing agrarian communities, where four out of every five people live below the international poverty line and one-third of women are unemployed. As a result, the majority of people in this community are forced to seek employment in cities in order to support their families. If they are unable to find work near their home, they either migrate to cities or send a family member to work abroad.</p><p>This means that 82% of farmers work part-time which can have a direct influence on high input-high output agriculture, resulting in low productivity. Furthermore, crop productivity is heavily dependent on rainfall. The impending climate change situation will harm commercial agriculture and rural economies. This situation may affect the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals. Despite the fact that agriculture's economic importance is declining, this situation emphasizes the importance of improving household income of our food producers. Hence, it is still an important part of the island's economy and cultural foundation. Politicians, planners, businesspeople, and consumers have yet to recognize the importance of this agrarian population, which relies on rain-fed income sources like agriculture, livestock, plantation, and inland fisheries.</p><p>Aside from climate change, the current Corona pandemic has caused agricultural input price increases, which have become a serious threat to the commercial food production system today. Furthermore, traditional agricultural practices that have been used for thousands of years cannot be used in commercial food cultivation due to a variety of constraints. Replacing inorganic fertilizer with organic fertilizer abruptly is not the solution for fertilizer response hybrid seed. These traditional agricultural practices, on the other hand, can be applied immediately in the now-defunct home garden farming systems, and then later to commercial agriculture.</p><p>The transition from hunter-gatherer to agricultural society was significant, but humans continued to coexist with forests by creating this forest-inspired home garden. This man-made forest, also served as a source of food, fuel, fiber, and medicine. Traditional practices such as agroforestry, intercropping, crop rotation, cover cropping, traditional organic composting, and integrated crop-animal farming, which could be implemented in this home garden became a success, as they had the potential to increase food security while mitigating climate change. Furthermore, this traditional home garden farming system is the best solution for ensuring year-round food security in the face of climate change. Resilience of our rural societies to sustain livelihoods in the face of climate change disasters can be enhanced by this home garden. The strength of this artificial forest or home garden is that it has evolved into a farming system that combines physical, social, and economic functions on land adjacent to the family home. This area is easily accessible to all family members for farm produce work, storage, and processing, as well as a location where household waste is disposed of or recycled. To ensure its long-term viability, all of these functions are frequently equally important and intertwined with one another. Unlike commercial agriculture, which relies heavily on imported inputs, this will ensure low-input food production to the household.</p><p>As a result of this interdependence, low-input dairy cattle and backyard poultry production became a source of strength for the farming family. Furthermore, not only does it fit the home garden farming system, it also increases the asset value of the farming household. Moreover, in the past, the home garden farming system served as a repository for indigenous crop, medicinal, and livestock genes. These traditional food crops and farm animal genetic resources are bio-assets with the potential to solve future food issues caused by climate change.</p><p>These indigenous poultry breeds are still managed by women. Small-scale poultry production systems, also known as \"Family Poultry\", rely on family labour and locally available feed resources. Aside from nutrition, another function of \"Family Poultry\" is to generate income. Chickens are among the most affordable livestock in resource-poor settings, and they can be sold or exchanged for sequentially larger and higher-value species (such as goats or cattle), as well as to increase a household's asset base or cash income in times of need. The production model of the home garden farming system is critical in establishing a year-round food production system, as commercial food production may be affected by climate change and destroyed. As a result, increased family income and stability will, on the one hand, prevent this community from migrating locally and internationally, while also enabling the achievement of SDGs by 2030. This proposed system has existed since man's transition from hunting to farming.</p><p>Men and women's socially constructed gender roles have a significant impact on household food production, consumption, nutrition, and income generation. Women prepare all food in Sri Lanka, and traditionally, women are limited to housework. Men perform the majority of commercial crop cultivation activities, with women participating in some areas such as home gardening, livestock and poultry, transplanting, weeding, harvesting, and processing. These strenuous activities performed by women are not considered as employment. As a result, according to government statistics, one-third of rural women in Sri Lanka are unemployed. Based on this information, the government changed its policies to empower women by employing them in garment factories in rural Sri Lanka or finding them jobs in other countries. Because most year-round food-producing home gardens were neglected, this exacerbated the problem. Furthermore, the loss of labour provided by these household women's employment elsewhere impacted the commercial food production system.</p><p>Developing a home garden system is critical to stop rural people from migrating to cities and face food shortages as a result of impending climate change. This process can be accelerated by incorporating backyard poultry and dairy cattle in the hopes of revitalizing the now-defunct home garden.</p><p>Published by HT Digital Content Services with permission from Daily Mirror Sri Lanka.

Forest restoration is one of the priority areas for mitigating the effects of climate change.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\"> Restoration and sustainable management of forests will help absorb atmospheric pollutants, re-build natural habitats and sustain life on earth. This blog discusses Sri Lanka's declining forest cover and offers suggestions on how the drivers of deforestation can be countered.</p><p>Sri Lanka's declining forest coverSri Lanka is endowed with a diverse range of forest ecosystems thanks to different topographic, climatic and soil conditions. Dry monsoon forests, lowland rain forests, moist monsoon forests, montane forests, riverine dry forests, savanna and mangrove forests are the major types of forests found in the country.</p><p>However, recent technical reports and mainstream media reports both signal a rapid increase in deforestation and degradation of forests in Sri Lanka. An estimated 70% of the island was covered with forests at the beginning of the 19th century, which has since reduced to 29.7% (1.95 million hectares) in 2017. Figures from the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) suggest that in 2020, the forest cover has further reduced to 28.39% (1.86 million hectares) of the entire land area (Figure 1).</p><p>n estimated -3.16% change in forest area has been observed during the period from 2015-2020. Primary forests are the most affected forest types. In 1999, the island had been covered by 257,000 hectares of primary forests whereas in 2020, only 167,000 hectares remained.</p><p> A new study conducted by Rathnayake, J. and Soto-Berelov (2020) which employs satellite data analysis confirms the disturbances to the protected areas (see Figure 2).</p><p> Red dots on the protected areas provide evidence of deforestation taking place within the protected areas. Drivers of deforestationA detailed account of the drivers of deforestation in Sri Lanka is published in a report under the UN-REDD program in 2015. The report identifies the catalysts of deforestation from past, present and future perspectives.</p><p> Most of the drivers are socio-economic in nature.In the current context, land encroachment, development projects and expansion of private agricultural ventures are the main proximate drivers of deforestation.</p><p> People encroach protected areas for agricultural and mining activities. With population growth, local demand for land and field crops as well as global demand for export crops and aquaculture products (,shrimps etc.</p><p>) rise. Hence, people who are pressurised by these drivers along with severe land scarcity, encroach into protected areas.</p><p>On the other hand, government policy objectives to increase local agricultural production and reduce agricultural imports such as sugar and milk also lead to an expansion of agricultural ventures. Besides, demand for precious stones like gems accelerates the degradation of forests through encroachment for mining activities.</p><p> Infrastructure development is another driver of deforestation and degradation of forests.Examples are projects on urban development, resettlements, tourism, livelihood development, infrastructure development like roads, highways and airports and voltage transmission lines.</p><p> Moreover, local demand for timber from both households and industry contributes to the illicit felling of trees. The way forwardStrengthening environmental safeguard measures: The incoherence in existing policies on forest conservation along with new initiatives to expand agricultural production or other development projects can encourage encroachments and deforestation.</p><p> For instance, in 2020, Sri Lanka cancelled three circulars that protected 700,000 hectares of forests recognised as other State forests.These areas are not classified as protected areas, yet account for 5% of the remaining forest cover.</p><p> At present, protected areas are being managed by two agencies with limited integrationthe Forest Department and Department of Wildlife Conservation with different official mandates, yet required to combine efforts to protect forest areas and their biodiversity. Therefore, the government should take necessary action to strengthen environmental safeguards associated with development programs and carry out monitoring activities.</p><p>wareness creation: Awareness creation can be an effective initiative with long-lasting impacts on forest restoration and conservation. On many occasions, people do not recognise the importance of multiple ecosystem services offered by protected areas and push for harnessing short-term economic benefits alone.</p><p> Thus, greater awareness initiated by both private and public entities would ensure a sustainable use of forest lands through restoration and reduced disturbances.Participatory approach: Public, private and community partnerships are essential for sustainably managing protected areas.</p><p> Private ventures can adhere to minimal deforestation policies or implement offset policies such as replanting.

Brazil, China, India, and South Africa.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Consequently, a number of management options are being implemented in these countries to reduce their environmental impacts. In several tropical countries, eucalypts are being raised as a constituent of mixed species agroforestry stands (as opposed to large-scale monoculture plantations) thus providing benefits to smallholder farmers.</p><p>However, the Forest Department of Sri Lanka, having raised monocultures of Caribbean pine and Australian eucalypt plantations in denuded and infertile landscape so successfully for over half a century or more, has been somewhat reluctant still to yield to the conservationists' and environmentalists' pressures. This is mainly due to the repeated failures and setbacks in their past approaches with native species restoration and possibly inadequacy of knowledge and training in ecological restoration methodology.</p><p>The primary reason for past failures in raising mixed native species plantations was that the native species selected for restoration were mostly from among mature phase canopy species of the respective forest type. Seedlings or saplings of these canopy species are ecologically ill-adapted to establish themselves in larger forest openings resulting from deforestation. Furthermore, these forest gaps often get quickly overgrown with shade intolerant and faster growing pioneers and climbers smothering the advance regeneration of the saplings. Even though seed sources are available within the surrounding degraded forest landscape, the natural regeneration of mature phase native species has been painstakingly slow for these reasons.</p><p>At the same time, most of the fernlands and grasslands in these regions are maintained by frequent human-induced fires during short-dry periods each year. Consequently, the natural successional trajectories towards reaching a climatic climax of a natural forest are almost completely stalled in them.</p><p>Pines and eucalypts with their superlative ability to tolerate strong sunlight and poor soil conditions as seedlings/saplings show impressive growth as compared with native canopy species of the mature forests. This is clearly evident from the research trials being conducted by the Forest Department in Welanhinna (near Welimada) and Conical Hill Forest Reserve in Nuwara Eliya comparing the growth of exotic eucalypts vs. native forest canopy species of those climatic regions.</p><p>A recent research article published in the Journal of Applied Ecology (<url normalizedValue=\"https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13513\">https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13513</url> [2020]) has reported some very relevant findings using exotic eucalypts globally branded as 'demons' or 'devils' in the Atlantic Forests of Brazil where selective logging of strips or rows of plantations for timber, bioenergy, pulp and paper, has been able to offset 45% - 75% of restoration implementation and maintenance costs partially overcoming the financial hurdle in undertaking active restoration projects by prospective investors.</p><p>In our own studies in Sri Lanka, equally demonised exotic pines have been used as partners in ecological restoration in the NW buffer zone of Sinharaja World Heritage Site and also in Lower Hantana in Kandy District for about 30 years. This healthy partnership between exotic and native species opens up a conciliatory middle path as the proverbial 'rawulath theagene kendath bema'- i.e., raising exotic and naturalized/native fast-growing plantations (some of which are demonised as invasive), as the first step in forest restoration initiatives. These exotics or naturalised 'nurse' trees can then be replaced sequentially by suitable native species along an ecological successional gradient leading to a successful forest restoration programme.</p><p>In both Sinharaja and Lower Hantana Peradeniya University campus land we have successfully converted pine plantations into native and naturalized plant species of utility value using these successional methods. They are being regularly used for training restoration ecologists and others for over two decades.</p><p>During this 'Decade of Ecosystem Restoration 2021 - 2030', ecologically driven Forest Landscape Restoration is being promoted as the main driving force for global scale forest restoration. Sri Lanka has pledged to restore 200,000 ha of degraded forests as its 'Nationally Determined Contribution' towards the Bonn Challenge which has set a global target of restoring 350 million ha during this decade. While the monoculture plantations of pines and eucalypts have provided superior growth and impressive timber volumes, the downside is that they are not the best for the provision of enhanced ecosystem services such as biodiversity enhancement, water and soil conservation, reduction of fire and landslide hazards and amelioration of the environment. As such, we sincerely hope the Pinus and Eucalypt plantations already established particularly in critical watersheds in Sri Lanka would be given a high priority in systematically converting them to native species using sound ecological principles with a view to increase the ecosystem services they provide to downstream communities.</p><p>Forest landscape restoration can best be done using ecological succession-based principles. One of these is known in silviculture (the science and art of growing and cultivating forest trees, based on a knowledge of their ecological characteristics) as relay floristic method of forest restoration. Both eucalypts and pines are 'early successional' species that have the ability to grow in relatively poor soil and under strong light conditions common in degraded landscapes like cultivated and abandoned pathanagrasslands and kekillafernlands. The other suitable candidates for this step/lap of the relay are Havari nuga, Kenda, Gedumba, Lunu midella, Ipil Ipil, Acacia spp., Caliandra sp. Such common plants can colonize the open and degraded lands rapidly and provide some partial shade facilitating the introduction of native species of the second lap. At the same time, they keep away the aggressive grasses and ferns by providing shade to the ground rather quickly due to their rapid growth.</p><p>The pine and eucalypt stands which have reached maturity in mountain landscapes particularly in the Central, Sabaragamuwa and Uva Provinces can be manipulated by creating appropriately sized openings simulating gaps in natural forests. In native forests, such gaps originate from natural phenomena such as standing tree deaths due to old age, lightning strikes, wind throws and landslides. The native species selected based on their ecological characteristics either as habitat generalists or specialists for each climatic/floristic region can be introduced in successive laps as in a relay in these artificially created gaps in pine stands. Both timber and non-timber species of utility value such as hora, hal, bedi del, yakahalu, dun, nawada, kitul, weniwel, wevel, enasal, thippili, etc. have been introduced in our demonstration restoration trials in Sinharaja (30 years old, now) and Hantana (15 years old, now).</p><p>Unfortunately, despite these pilot-scale successful trials which have the potential for scaling up, there are silvicultural operations going on that are evidently harmful to the environment as in Hirikatu Oya region in Ratnapura forest division. Large scale clear felling of Pinusplantations on steep slopes has resulted in extensive environmental damage not only to the site itself but also to the downstream areas. Subsequent reforestation efforts have not progressed as expected and resulted in heavy gulley erosion and soil degradation.</p><p>There are moves to repeat similar large-scale clear-felling operations in mature pine stands in Diyatalawa-Bandarawela regions. While this is likely to be environmentally harmful as in Hirikatu Oya, it also prevents an excellent opportunity to make these so called 'demonis ed' exotic plantations partnering in systematic conversion of them to native species forests.</p><p>The ecological principles and methods showcased in our demonstration models in Sinharaja and Lower Hantana could be extended to this region, initially as a trial conversion. These mature pine plantations would serve as the first lap in a relay floristic model. The key is to select the right mix of native species for second and third laps of the relay floristic silvicultural succession suitable for this climatic and floristic region. They could include not only woody species but others of traditional utility value such as medicinal, ornamental, artisanal and food value. We are in the process of preparing a list of such potential species for each subsequent lap.</p><p>It is our fervent hope that we learn from the environmentally costly experiments of clear felling of forest plantations in steep slopes as evident from Hirikatu Oya example in Ratnapura/Balangoda forest region and not repeat the same mistake in Diyatalawa/Bandarawela or any other similar landscapes. Proven silvicultural methods such as Relay Floristics methods are available to be adapted to suit the site conditions of this climatic region.</p>", "publisher": "Sunday Times (Sri Lanka)", "instances": ["Exotic single species plantations have been the bane of environmentalists world over for several decades so much so that, in a landmark decision, the Madurai bench of the Madras high court in India has decided that eucalypts, along with another Australian tree species - black wattle (Acacia mearnsii - which is also planted in Sri Lankan highlands), need to be removed from their colonized heartland forests in the Western Ghats, due to ill-effects they have on tropical rainforests and water supply in the hills.

But towards the end of the journey, after a sharp turn at the village of Wepathana, we changed vehicles at a forested nook. Aboard an open-backed 4WD, we rumbled to Polwaththa Eco Lodges where hot dinner and lodgings awaited. Not long after, I walked a muddy path by torchlight to an isolated cabana in a forest.</p><p nitf:lede=\"true\">Left alone, I drank in the surrounding tangle of trees, shrubs and vines shrouded by darkness. Thoughts of the urban jungle and the vicissitudes of the COVID-19 pandemic gave way to delight in the crisp air scented with damp earth, wood and mulch, solitude serenaded by a thousand crickets. Sleep came easily that night, in the wood cabana, cool without fan.</p><p>Polwaththa Eco Lodge is no-frills with 13 cabanas spread out across a five-hectare property. The basics included a double bed, coat rack, torches, drinking water (with free refills in the restaurant),and a spacious room and bathroom with warm solar-heated shower and soap. Each room opens to a patio, with deck chair. Any missing amenities pale into insignificance at the sight of the luxurious Kandyan Forest Garden at your doorstep.</p><p>When proprietor Nihal Ellegala, a Trinitian from Kandy, inherited the property from his father in 1993, it was populated with coconut trees interspersed with fruit, medicinal and other indigenous forest trees and food plants. 'The land conformed to the principles of Kandyan forest garden, an environmentally-friendly polyculture system compared to environmentally-harmful mono-culture systems.We left it alone because we didn't want to disturb the environment,' Nihal said.</p><p>Instead, Nihal and his wife, Nel Kapteyn from Holland, and their son Remon planted more trees and let nature have her way. Some years later, the family built a home on the land, and in 2009, launched Polwaththa Eco Lodges with a single cabana.</p><p>The giving forest</p><p>Forest gardens have been around for millennia worldwide, possibly from an ancient past when man gathered edible plants in the jungle. Over time, this simple arrangement evolved into several agricultural systems, of which the forest garden system allowed man to work with the natural rhythms of the earth, introducing useful and edible plants in a mix that mimicked forest vegetation from ground up. Ecologically, this is the least invasive form of agriculture and low maintenance because its rich biodiversity is largely self-supporting.</p><p>The Kandyan forest garden is a centuries-old system native to the Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces. It has the characteristics of a tropical rain forest, and includes a combination of different tree types such as forest trees, fruit and spice trees, vegetables and yams - to qualify as a Kandyan forest garden, this mix should provide food for a home.</p><p>Polwaththa has a rich mix of medicinal trees, fruit trees like orange and papaya, star fruit, grapefruit and banana and spice trees like cloves, and creepers like passion fruit, pepper, robusta and arabica coffee, and yams like manioc.It is home to wildlife species such as porcupine, barking deer, monkey, giant and flying squirrel and the wild boar with a taste for bread that came right up to the kitchen door for a bite. Nihal says the forest supports 62 species of birds including 17 of the 30-odd species endemic to Sri Lanka.</p><p>Maintaining a forest garden isn't easy, says Remon. Deer and wild boar destroyed hundreds of saplings that Nihal planted until the family came up with a solution - protect the saplings with chicken mesh enclosures that the animals would not be able to break through. Keeping to world standards of sustainable tourism, Polwaththa works closely with neighbouring villages Wepathana and Gomagoda. Ten young men and women, 80 percent of the Lodge staff, are from these villages and from Digana. Handicrafts from the village are sold at the Polwaththa boutique and all groceries are purchased from stores within a radius of five km. Villagers are employed in building projects and consulted on new projects.While I was there, Nihal and some village youths tested a bulk fruit-drying device they had invented themselves: although the first attempt went up in flames, it is successful and four new drying units are being prepared.</p><p>Twenty percent of Polwaththa's profits are channelled back to the villagers through the local temple and school and used for local initiatives; for example, a road was repaired and a dam built for the village, and a group of women were helped to generate an income by sewing items to sell to tourists.</p><p>The Lodge's rustic buildings complement its forest environment. 'Our aim is to provide, besides an enjoyable holiday with a natural rural environment, an experience that uplifts the spirit rather than material comfort,' says Nihal.</p><p>The birth of Bululand</p><p>In 2016, the Ellegalla family went a little further. Nihal in partnership with Dutch agroforestry expert Henk Kieft, purchased a two-hectare plot of denuded forest in the neighbourhood.</p><p>'Nel was upset about the logging going on there for firewood,' said Nihal, adding that he was drawn to the land's stunning lake view. Within three months, 300 new saplings, from large indigenous forest trees to wild flowering trees, fruit trees and coffee had been planted. Today, there are 550 new trees. These reforestation efforts have had 70 percent success, and a lush secondary forest is forming. Nel has named the plot Bululand, after a large bulu tree she loves.</p><p>To generate income for its upkeep, Nihal added a large outdoor yoga and meditation hall and built two more cabanas that would serve as solitary forest retreats on Bululand. One affords a spectacular view of Victoria Lake.</p><p>Importantly, Bululand led to the birth of the Forest Healing Foundation (FHF) of which Henk Kieft is President and Nihal is Secretary.A non-profit organisation, FHF seeks to protect threatened high-biodiversity forests, reforest barren lands and advocate for the value of forests.With Bululand serving as their showpiece, they would like to take their message across Sri Lanka.</p><p>Up until the COVID-19 pandemic this year, Polwaththa Eco Lodges registered an average of 60 percent occupancy, patronised by LOHAS (Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability) travellers and nature lovers interested in community or rural life.

They've designated 5 June as World Environmental Day to provide a chance to take responsibility for the conduct of individuals, enterprises and communities to direct themselves to preserve and enhance the environment. Since 1974, it has grown into a global platform for public outreach.

Some EU countries dependent on coal for energy oppose the 2050 carbon neutral target, saying they need help transforming energy production. To win them over, the Commission, whose proposed laws require consent of members and the European Parliament, wants to create a \"just transition fund\" to wean economies off coal.</p><p>In Sri Lanka, many of us remain complacent, living in a country that has more or less a stable climate throughout the year. We have no volcanoes and by and large have been lucky to have escaped the effects of hurricanes, whirlwinds and the likes. Yet, more recently our country has been subject to severe unseasonal rainfall, deluge, floods, landslides and long droughts, which are now becoming frequent occurrences.</p><p>Floods and landslides caused by torrential rainfalls during September 2019, The monsoon floods affected 13 districts and in its wake left at least two persons dead, while injuring six and another approximately 116,000 people displaced.
